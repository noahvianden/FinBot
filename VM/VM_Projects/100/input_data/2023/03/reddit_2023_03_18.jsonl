{"title": "SIVB options got exercised", "selftext": "Seeking advice here as I was on the wrong end of the trade. I sold $125puts on SIVB that got exercised yesterday/today by TD Ameritrade \n\nSaturday I got the email saying I was exercised. I don't have the margin to cover it, it's considerably larger margin I got called 6 figures \n\n\nMy question is has anyone had any experience on this matter? I'm not looking to dodge paying of I could come to an agreement with my broker would be best on a payment plan but do they do such a thing? Considering this usually rarely happens where a stock halts and I couldn't exit is the reason I'm upside down with the max lose\n\nNo need to say I'm a fool as I already feel it\n\nEdit V1. So my portfolio was liquidated on Monday. They cashed everything out. I had six figure portfolio in there. That's pretty much all my savings. I don't have any more money to give.\n\n\nI was reading that people weren't getting exercised and so it's just total bad luck that ALL my contracts got exercised? My thinking was the float is 58mil. But with the number of contracts that were sold how did they get so much stock? It feels like a GME where the short side is 3x greater than the actual float\nAlso thanks to all the kind people that have posted.\n\nEdit V2. For all you saying this is fake, why would anyone lie about losing money? I wish this wasn't real. \nFor anyone asking about risk management. You can't do anything if the stock is halted. Options can't be traded AH or PM. I sold them at $140ish, then price dropped even more.. I should of got out but I thought we might have some morning bounce.

Please work on your reading comprehension skills before accusing anyone of not knowing about options.  Not once did I say unlimited potential because only a naked calls have that risk graph.\n\nLet me, the new options trader, explain to you, the veteran options trader, so that you understand that it is not the same and it makes a difference if there‚Äôs unlimited upside potential. Let me give an example using TSLA. TSLA was trading at 110 in early January.  You decide to sell a FEB (30DTE) ATM 110 put for 8.00.  Fast forward to FEB and is now trading at 180.  Congrats you made $800 on the naked puts(inferior strategy).  The stock owner made $7,000 (superior strategy).  Now FEB comes around and you think CSPs is the best strategy in the world and you can't believe not everyone is doing it. You can't believe this new options trader named Pretigious guy from Reddit doesn't know what hes doing.  So now you sell the MAR (30DTE) 180 put for 8.00. Fast forward to MAR and now TSLA is at 200. Congrats you made another $800 (inferior strategy). The stock owner is now up $9000 (superior strategy) while you are up $1,600 (inferior strategy). Now MAR comes around and you sell the APRIL 200 puts for 8.00. You are on a roll!. Now TSLA is back down to 180. You now have to buy back you APRIL 200 for 20.00 if TSLA stays at 180.  So you lost the 16.00 credit from the previous 2 months plus part of the 8.00 credit for the APRIL so you are up $400 (inferior strategy).  Whereas if you bought the stock at 110, you would be up 70 points or $7,000 (superior strategy).  Who is better off?  So it does make a differnce that the stock has unlimited potentail.  You can't just watch You Tube  all day and think you know everything these is to know about CSPs.  My point is that selling puts can offset the loss of the stock but at the trade-off that it has capped profits.  Just look at the risk graph for long stock and short put.  Based on that image, which risk to reward would you rather have?  Unlimted risk to zero but limited profits OR unlimited risk to zero but ALSO unlimited potential for profits.\n\nLet's say you think it's a fluke and you for sure it's the better startegy because the guy on YouTube said so, so continue to sell CSPs the following month and sold the MAY (30 DTE) 180 Puts for 8.00.  May comes around and TSLA goes bankrupt due to accounting irregularities and it goes to zero.  You are now on the hook for $18,000 minus your $800 credit so you lost $17,200 minus the $400 credit from the previous month for a total of $16,800.  The stock owner's cost basis was $11,000 so he/she lost $11,000.

If FRC recorded their assets at fair value, they would have a negative stockholder‚Äôs equity (book value) given the unrealized losses that do not appear in the financial statements (aside from the footnotes where I got the information). Their loan book is valued on the Balance Sheet at a $22 billion premium over their fair value, and their Held to Maturity (HTM) Debt Securities (i.e. treasuries and bonds) are valued at a $4.7 billion premium over their fair value. So like SVB, FRC has a large collection of assets that have lost a tremendous amount of value since the Fed started hiking interest rates.\n\nAdditionally, if FRC was to liquidate all of it‚Äôs assets (aside from real property it owns, which I excluded from the analysis because real estate is not a liquid asset) in an attempt to stem a bank run on deposits, it would have a $1.27 billion shortfall based on the fair value of its assets at the end of 2022. In other words, if FRC sold all of its investments, sold its loan book, and used all the money plus its existing cash balance, it could not pay back all of its depositors if they wanted all their money back.\n\nTLDR; Stock is down over 70% this week, despite the $30 billion injection of liquidity courtesy of JPM, Wells Fargo, Citi, etc. The valuation on the stock seems to be more in line with reality now, with the book value of FRC's assets being greatly inflated compared to the fair value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\**Full disclosure, I own 30 shares of FRC.* ", "id": "11ub9bq", "created_utc": 1679104635.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Not for HTM designation which sounds like most of these banks and private funds are holding currently. üè¶ üí•", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.

However, what does that equate into retail end.\n\n‚ÄúIt is unclear how much of these changes in oil prices were passed through to retail gasoline and diesel prices. In general, we would expect one-for-one passthrough: a $1 per barrel decrease in crude would lower the price of gasoline by $1 per barrel, equal to $0.024 per gallon, since there are 42 gallons of gasoline per barrel. However, recently refining markets have been very tight, and it‚Äôs possible that a $1 change in crude oil would not lead to an equal decline in the retail price of gasoline.‚Äù\n\nhttps://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-price-impact-of-the-strategic-petroleum-reserve-release\n\nThe estimated drop in price for gas+diesel was between 0.13-0.33 cents.  An estimation, not even actual change.  Using California average gas price as of April, a 13 cents drop equals to a 2.6% saving while 33 cents equals 6.7% drop.  Always assuming worst scenario, a 2.6% drop in cost is nothing and that is only on retail end.\n\n‚ÄúOil consumption worldwide reached approximately 94.1 million barrels per day in 2021. This was an increase of over six percent in comparison to the previous year, when global oil consumption experienced a drop as a result of the pandemic‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/265239/global-oil-consumption-in-barrels-per-day/\n\nUS released 1 million barrel a day \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/31/us-to-release-1-million-barrels-of-oil-per-day-from-reserves-to-help-cut-gas-prices.html\n\n1/94.1=1.06%.  At best the SPR release had a 1% change to global oil price, but according to EIA they only cited SPR as adding to total supply, nothing to do with price.\n\nPer EIA, drop in oil price was due to expected lower demand due to recession and China lockdown which further reduced demand, so macroeconomics\n\n‚ÄúFrom June 8 through the remainder of 2022, crude oil prices generally decreased as concerns about a possible economic recession reduced demand. High petroleum prices were one cause of persistent broad-based inflation in 2022 that affected consumer budgets and gasoline demand. High crude oil prices led to lower U.S. gasoline demand as gasoline prices rose. Meanwhile, severe COVID-19 containment measures in China contributed to lower global petroleum demand.

Why? Well for starters oil prices became depressed, because of the recent macro environment where the banking system showed signs of stress and potential systemic risk. Which, translated to bond yield inverting more and increased volatility in the bond market. Causing oil futures to respond to such changes via algorithms that traded, which in turn dumped them, because the programs are anticipating a **recession** in the future (based on macro data). However, this may not occur or even worse the opposite could happen. This is because the next couple to few FED meetings will determine the future if inflation is over.\n\nIf the FED shows signs of fear or willingness to pause it's hawkish stance in order to save the economy, using more bailouts etc. Then the FED balance sheet will further explode upwards (We've already seen this with the 300B increase in the balance sheet). This will indicate to markets that **QT has ended and QE has truly started in earnest**, which translate to cash = garbage and people will run away from cash chasing other assets (real estate/commodities/stocks etc). This will cause an upward pressure for inflation and oil will recapture it's ATH prices, if the FED stops its inflation fight.\n\nOverall, your assessment isn't wrong per say, but the ball is in the FED's court, and it's up to them to decide, which path they take:\n\n1. Continue being hawkish to defeat inflation in the long run, but at the cost of more systemic risk appearing, spreading contagion and crashing the economy.\n2. Or prevent systemic risk/contagion to spread thru the economy and allow inflation to soar.\n\nTypically, most government chooses the latter, but again America is in a special place due to the USD being the world reserve currency.  So ultimately, no one can be sure if inflation is gonna be gone or it'll be here to stay until the FED makes a decision in the upcoming FED meetings.\n\n**TLDR:** Depends on FED's response, for now oil prices are responding to macro economic factors, when FED clarifies position. Inflation could go down if FED remains hawkish, or inflation could soar if FED goes dovish.\n\n**Edit:** As to why the USD being world reserve currency being a hindrance to the FED and just money printing infinitely (key word infinitely). Is because, while it allows the US to just print money (export inflation), there is nothing that back the USD up aside from faith/trust in the US banking system. This faith/trust is built on the belief that the US will to some degree exercise fiscal responsibility and ensure the stability of the value of the USD to facilitate stable trading. However, if the USD starts to become unstable or the US implements irresponsible fiscal policies.  Foreign nations will eventually look for alternatives or stop accepting the USD as they see the currency become worthless as the faith/trust have been broken by the US.

Hundreds of employees, dressed in business suits, left the bank's offices one by one with boxes in their hands. It was a somber reminder that nothing is forever‚Äîeven in the richness of the financial and investment world.\n\nAt the time of its collapse, Lehman was the **fourth-largest investment bank** in the United States with 25,000 employees worldwide. It had **$639 billion in assets** and $613 billion in liabilities. The bank became a symbol of the excesses of the 2007-08 Financial Crisis, engulfed by the subprime meltdown that swept through financial markets and cost an estimated $10 trillion in lost economic output.\n\nThe Financial Crisis began with a boom in the housing market, as home prices soared and many people took out loans to buy homes they could not afford. These loans were then bundled into complex financial products, such as mortgage-backed securities, which were sold to investors around the world.\n\nLehman Brothers, along with many other financial firms, branched into mortgage-backed securities and collateral debt obligations. In 2003 and 2004, with the U.S. housing bubble well under way, Lehman acquired five mortgage lenders along with BNC Mortgage and Aurora Loan Services, which specialized in Alt-A loans. These loans were made to borrowers without full documentation.\n\nAt first, Lehman's acquisitions seemed clairvoyant. Lehman's real estate business enabled revenues in the capital markets unit to surge 56% from 2004 to 2006. The firm securitized $146 billion of mortgages in 2006‚Äîa 10% increase from 2005. Lehman reported record profits every year from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, it announced $4.2 billion in net income on $19.3 billion in revenue.\n\nBut, as the economy began to cool, homeowners began to default on their mortgages, the value of these mortgage-backed securities and collateral debt obligations plummeted, causing huge losses for banks and other financial institutions that had invested heavily in them. And Lehman Brothers was one the financial institutions that were All-In on this trend.\n\nIn February 2007, Lehman's stock price reached a record $86.18 per share, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $60 billion. But by the first quarter of 2007, cracks in the U.S. housing market were already becoming apparent. Defaults on subprime mortgages began to rise to a seven-year high. Yet, Lehman's profitability was still high, and the firm reported record revenues and profit for its fiscal first quarter. But following the earnings report, Lehman said the risks posed by rising home delinquencies were well contained and would have little impact on the firm's earnings.\n\nIn 2007, Lehman was leveraged 31 to 1, with its large mortgage securities portfolio. This made Lehman highly susceptible to the deteriorating market conditions. On March 17, 2008, following Bear Stearns' collapse, Lehman's shares plummeted nearly 48%.\n\nLehman's stock plunged 77% in the first week of September 2008, amid plummeting equity markets worldwide, as investors questioned CEO Richard Fuld's plan to keep the firm independent. On Monday, September 15, Lehman declared bankruptcy, resulting in the stock plunging 93% from its previous close on September 12.\n\nThe 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers is widely regarded as a pivotal event in the global financial crisis, which caused widespread economic turmoil and led to a period of recession in many countries.\n\nLehman's collapse was the largest US financial firm failure in history up to that point. Lehman Brothers was one of the largest **investment banks** in the world, with assets of over $600 billion at the time of its collapse. Its bankruptcy filing was the largest in US history, surpassing the previous record set by WorldCom in 2002.\n\nThe collapse of Lehman Brothers had a profound impact on the global financial system, leading to a freeze in credit markets, a decline in consumer and investor confidence, and a deep recession that lasted for several years. The fallout from the crisis prompted a range of regulatory reforms and policy changes aimed at strengthening the financial system and preventing future crises.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "They are‚Ä¶.SVB is on there", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "its one of the only ones that i know lol\n\nthem and bear i guess?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not a bank by the definition we're using", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Scroll down to OPs post", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Im gonna need a link.", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Linkie for the lazy:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ukpfj/bank_failures_20012023_inflation_adjusted/jcok55o/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "My man!!!", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Appreciate the due diligence, take my award in lieu of a cookie üç™", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "They mean OP has a bank fetish and chooses to ignore the entire rest of the financial sector because it would undermine his narrative", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tiny banks became more reliable than big banks after 2008 crisis.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "All the small community banks that failed after Washington mutual", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Big balls mean big losses, mean big sad", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "My biggest concern is most people will see the snowman as bigger than the single circle since they are stacked.

Let me see if I can clarify \"the why\" in a simple fashion:\n\nHere are the characteristics of money:\n\nDurability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability.\n\nThe main problem is that money is broken since 1971. Because we removed one of the main features that ensures it is a good store of value: limited supply. We did this by unpegging it from the gold standard. Here are the consequences of that: https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/\n\nScarcity is a fundamental property of a store of value: luxury cars, art, gold, real estate with an awesome view... All these things preserve value over the long run because they are scarce.\n\nWe used gold as a money for centuries because of this property... It's scarce. Actually the first type of currency was rare beach shells because they were scarce.\n\nThe second thing we need to understand is how money is created now. It's via debt... And a great deal of it flows to real estate. This is great for banks because if you default on your mortgage the bank will sell your house (most likely for a profit) and they keep their risk as low as possible. The problem is this is a vicious cycle. The more debt the more real estate is going up because we are now using real estate as a store of value. \n\nHere's a doc that explains this in more detail: https://youtu.be/mzoX7zEZ6h4\n\nNow keep in mind the US debt is at 30T and the consumer debt is though the roof.\n\nIn summary: if you keep your money under the mattress for 10 years you basically lost all of it because debt hence inflation is out of control. So if any business (including banks) are not making more than 10% per year in profits they are losing purchasing power.\n\nThis is actually the perfect way to make money flow from a lower class to a high privilege class because they own the majority of things that are scarce.\n\nThis is a complex topic...

Loans going bad to borrowers who should have never qualified, impacting all banks. Nothing close to this is happening today.\n\nWe‚Äôve had aggressive expansion especially in the last 3 years and with that there‚Äôs naturally going to be some trash that needs to be taken out. The 2023 event impacts a few regional lenders, that‚Äôs not necessarily the sign of a broader systematic issue like 2009. \n\nIt makes sense these lenders are the first to go down, they may not be the last, but they‚Äôre all related to tech, a capital intensive industry, especially when you consider newer start ups and research firms which these banks catered to.

They don‚Äôt have to have any income and when capital costs rise these companies have issues and thus their banks also see issues.\n\nTech has has a boom since Covid when everyone including businesses bought softwares and various tech to work remotely and work from home and meet Covid restrictions. There should have been expectations for somewhat of a tech slowdown just because of this. \n\nNormally, bank runs or crashes are stemming from the loan side. There‚Äôs been a capital or liquidity crunch sure, but in the tech start up space, these kinds of companies don‚Äôt go get normal loans. They get financing from venture capital. VC has less capital to throw around, and these startups have to draw down their own cash so this is a deposit issue for the banks not a lending portfolio issue. At the end of the day these banks didn‚Äôt have enough operational cash to meet their needs.\n\nTypically bank and financial industry meltdown exposure are fueled by loans. Loans that are sold from one institution to another, the secondary market, MBS, etc. this is not the case today so the overall exposure to the entire industry is low. \n\nSure, any banks that continued to buy short term bonds in an aggressively rising rate environment would be in trouble. They‚Äôd also have to completely ignore best industry practices, ignore what rates have been doing for the last year, and have no asset liability management and insufficient portfolio and pipeline hedging. And they have $2trln ‚Äúline‚Äù secured by bonds lent out at face value.  15% of that has been used (low advance rate) with 5% concentrated in SVB alone, which we know is in a liquidity tech related crunch. \n\nBad for the tech industry and venture capital.

{"title": "Fed Rate Hike Next Week", "selftext": "Let‚Äôs say you have a bond that cost you $100 and pays 5% a year. So you get $5 every year.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs say that all of a sudden, interest rates go to 10%. In that case, a new bond that costs $100 will pay $10 every year.\n\nSo who would buy your bond from you now? Why should someone pay you $100 for your bond, which pays only $5 a year, when they can get a new bond for the same price that pays $10 a year.\n\nIn order for your bond to pay the same 10% that a new bond pays, the price would have to fall to $50. That way they‚Äôre getting $5 a year on a $50 investment, which is the same as $10 a year on a $100 investment.\n\nSo the dilemma for JP next week. Does he still raise or do they pause? I believe JP was dovish last meeting because they knew banks behind the scenes are in trouble. Mind you, not only banks, private funds, hospitals, schools etc. With the increasing rates, people need more cash to fund more expensive things.\n\n1. Raise rates .25 and wait and see. Each raise causes consumers to draw down cash, causing banks to sell treasuries. This is now a dangerous move\n\n2. Wait and see what else is breaking by raising 0 and waiting for the next cpi prints\n\n3. Slash fed funds rate. Things are still massively expensive, it could cause inflation to double back up. \n\nWhy I think 2 is what will happen, because people are losing jobs, things are expensive, savings are going down, credit is at  all time high. \n\nRegional banks are going out of business.
