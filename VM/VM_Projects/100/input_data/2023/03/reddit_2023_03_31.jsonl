That was below the 0.4% Dow Jones estimate and lower than the 0.5% January increase.\n\nOn a 12-month basis, core PCE increased 4.6%, a slight deceleration from the level in January.\n\nIncluding food and energy, headline PCE increased 0.3% monthly and 5% annually, compared to 0.6% and 5.3% in January.\n\nThe softer than expected data came with monthly energy prices decreasing 0.4% while food prices rose 0.2%. Goods prices rose 0.2% while services increased 0.3%.\n\nIn other data from the report, personal income increased 0.3%, slightly above the 0.2% estimate. Consumer spending increased 0.2%, compared to the 0.3% estimate.\n\nStocks opened higher following the report while longer-duration Treasury yields declined.\n\n\"The inflation trend looks promising for investors. Inflation will likely be below 4% by the end of the year, giving the Federal Reserve some leeway to cut rates by the end of the year if the economy falls into recession,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial.\n\nMarket pricing Friday morning following the inflation report indicated an even split between the Fed raising its benchmark rate another quarter percentage point or holding steady in May.\n\nThe Fed's own unofficial projections released last week pointed to perhaps one more increase this year and no reductions. However, traders expect cuts this year, with end-year pricing for the federal funds rate at 4.25%-4.5%, half a point below the current target range.\n\nWhile inflation has ebbed in some areas, it has remained pernicious in others. Shelter costs in particular have risen sharply. Fed officials, though, are looking through that increase and expect rents to decelerate through the year.\n\nStill, inflation is likely to remain well above the Fed's 2% target into 2024, and officials have said they remain focused on bringing down prices despite the current bank turmoil.\n\nData released Thursday suggests that the problems in banking also may be at least under control. Borrowing through two emergency Fed lending programs decreased slightly last week, indicating that there has been no frantic liquidity dash for banks that may be undercapitalized.", "id": "127q5j4", "created_utc": 1680278712.0, "score": 357, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're only technically wrong, functionally it works almost exactly as you say.  I don't think the market cares either way about bears or bulls.  It's a machine, it doesn't have feelings.  bearish not being taken seriously is a sign of exuberance and a sign of complete apathy toward bearish impulses.\n\nThe biggest problem is in two things:  1. that the market participants being exuberant is by definition what makes a lot of us doomers uncomfortable, and 2. that this in no way means we can accurately predict that the fragility of the market will come to to a head or if it does, when that will happen.\n\nThe first one is a bit tricky.  Markets being exuberant mean they completely ignore some guy eating crayons and drawing red lines all over a graph of the market.  Even if he's right they're going to completely ignore him and that's just how it works.  A lot of doomers forget that.  By nature the state of the market causes it to dismiss doomers even when they're right up until the market breaks with the exuberance.\n\nThe second one is easier to understand.  By nature identifying market risk and fragility does not mean the adverse affects of that fragility or the event that causes the failure will actually happen.  The market can be fragile as fuck and not fail.  This can happen for a wide variety for reasons but one of the biggest is that the controls to prevent that failure can actually work even if the market is being abused by certain participants.  The market can just have been well enough engineered in practice that fiscal policy and good actions save it,\n\nI personally think that's highly unlikely and the belief in that is a function of the exuberance in part 1, but recognize that I might be wrong.

There were shaken up in October but a lifeline was thrown in early January that helped them stay above water for just a while longer. Then Feb hit and many were just properly cleaned out. After all that commitment to their mantra that stonks only go up, they finally caved  and threw in the proverbial towel turning whatever was left into cash or entering low probability puts that were at least cheap. They felt a sense of responsibility and maturity for once because they had finally accepted that after being beaten into submission for over a year and let down at every corner, they were going to play the other side. How could the not win finally. They doubled down when the proverbial shit was hitting the fan with SVB and CS encouraged by their couple weeks of being so clever and booking some nice paper gains. But the quick patch-up of the poisonous banks and the chance that there won’t the hoped for societal meltdown triggered their fight of flight response and in an intense way. They couldn’t run because everything is tied up and their hopes and dreams will only come true with a real and brutal crisis. So they’re fighting. With the desperate drive of men on the verge of breakdown, they are tapping all the tools they have to convince others that a prolonged major bear market is a forgone conclusion. But they only know cliches about basic monetary theory, inflation and fiat-is-bad, and the only talent they picked up during the free money era was how to make quality memes and argue irrelevant points with anyone who will listen. They aren’t real traders and they couldn’t afford to hedge so they’re panicking in the same way that they had hoped the mom and pop at the corner store and or new homeowners falling behind on their mortgages should be by now. It is clear when they spew arguments in the form of helping the everyday man that they’re in full on panic mode and that no dirty trick is off limits. If it turns the tide in favor of their puts, or creates a crisis that re-prices equities to a level that would allow them to recoup their loses and rid themselves of the bags that they have carried for the past year; then that is their new MO.

Hedge funds were already super short. Net length among hedgies sat at the 18th percentile on a 5 year lookback. Once the new narrative took hold that policymakers were coming in to save the day and the market started rallying, risk managers started tapping PMs on the shoulder to tell them they had to clean up their books on the short side ahead of quarter end. IWM and hedge funds' favorite short baskets outperformed NDX over the last week.\n\nAnother nuance I'll point out about this rally over the last three weeks is that it's been deceptive in that people think it's the whole market, but really it hasn't been. This past week really sort of was the whole market, but the two weeks prior saw the most dispersion in performance that we've seen in a while. The stocks that pulled \"the market\" higher were the MAGMA stocks because big money managers were rotating into perceived quality, and the MAGMA stocks make up such a large part of the major indices that it gives the illusion that people are buying stocks. They really weren't. If anything, this was actually a pretty bearish signal.\n\ntl;dr things weren't bad enough for everyone to totally exit the market since policymakers saved the day. So no one started outright selling, but there was enough anxiety in the market to spark a rotation into megacap tech as a flight to perceived quality.
