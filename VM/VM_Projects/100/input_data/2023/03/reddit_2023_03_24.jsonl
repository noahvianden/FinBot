My one regret was not liquidating inearly 2008. All the signs were there. They appeared in 2007 when many investors who over leveraged themselves during the real estate boom started selling properties for losses (not the only sign but one I saw with many colleagues and friends). That spooked me but maybe not enough reason to sell. When the banks came under pressure the following year it was like a repeat of today. Bank fails small dip then rally. I should have sold then but u know DCA is king. Basically for a two year period prior to the crash I could have sold and protected so much capital and just have bought in right after the crash.\n\nI am practicing this somewhat anti once in a decade dca strategy now and it has preserved a ton of my capital. I started layering out in early 2022 and got aggressive before the first rate hikes ( I was paying close attention during two previous rate hike cycles and knew it would cause massive equity pain). Not wanting to be out I maintained my 401k in index funds which by March meant I was only half cash. In August I liquidated my 401k and that has saved me another 10%+. I'm now practicing a patient approach. No buying in brokerage but below 380 I allow new deposits in my 401k to go to index. Above 400 I liquidate. I adjust these values over time and watch market momentum but basically this has me back to 2021 all time highs in my acct. This banking crisis might not lead to a 40% down day but in the short or medium term equities will go down and preserving capital to take advantage of that is not a dumb move. Just don't try to time a bottom. Start layering in again when it gets low. The best advice I ever got was don't try to time the bottom or the top. 60% of profits are there for the easy taking if you are not trying to time the last 20% of a top or of a bottom.

They're not only the fastest growing automaker in history, but they're doing it with a very small number of models. The Model Y in particular came out of nowhere, and is growing at a mind boggling rate. It's probably the best selling car in the world right now. Tesla is probably making and selling them at a 1 million/year rate and the only other car close to that is the Corolla, which is probably below that rate right now. And with Berlin and Austin still ramping, the Y could sell well above 1 million this year.\n\nWhat crazy is that there's only a handful of models that have sold more than 1 million in a year. The Model T did it 100 years ago, then the VW Beetle, the Impala, the F150 and the Corolla did it a few times recently, plus the Rav4 might've gotten really close at some point, but I can't think of any others.\n\nThe Impala was far and away the fastest to get there (at least modern cars, so not counting the Model T), to go from launch to 1 million sales in a year, doing it about 7 years after launch. Every other car took *decades*. The Corolla that sold over 1 million in a year did look much like the original one (and probably didn't even share any parts), same with the F150. The Beetle didn't change forever, but it still took decades to get *really* popular.\n\nThe first Model Y was sold *three years* ago, in March 2020 (and started sales about 6 months early), and this year it'll probably be the best selling car in the world. That's an amazing fast change. A year ago you could buy a Model Y and it might be the only one in your town, and pretty soon it might be the best selling car in your town. That's a weird change, from being an \"early adopter\" with a brand new model that most people have never seen to driving the most popular new car in the world.\n\nCars like the Prius that had a reputation for \"being everywhere\" and \"too trendy\" actually took over a decade to sell 1 million total units, and have never had sales years that were much above 200k in the US. The Model Y will probably hit those sales in half the time.\n\nI'm sure there'll be people who will buy anything else, just to not have the \"popular car\". But then there's also a reason why the most popular car will be the Y, it's fucking fantastic. That's why it's going to blow all sales records out of the water.

I made it at first. Virtually everyone made it at first when they started investing/trading/etc... in fact, many people never get out of this mistake:\n\nYou're trying to understand the market in the frame of the market as a barometer of economic condition.\n\nIn reality, the market is a discounting mechanism designed to make money for some participants, and cost money for others.\n\nThe product of the market is not the economy, it is return.\n\nOnce you change the frame from trying to rationalize the market against the economy, and begin looking at it as a structure to provide return to its primary participants (institutions), it will start to make more sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, it's all about institutional positioning. They buy because they're entrusted with money to deploy it in the market, and not making money on long positions because it wasn't deployed is as bad as risking it and losing it since in this industry a lost gain is tantamount to a loss made in a bought position, because you're being measured against the returns of managers who bought, so there's a balance and some buying is always happening as institutions cost average their long positions hoping to maintain potential return. \n\nAlso some institutions have departments which are given ideal access to stock in order to generate liquidity, and as such are obligated to always sell or buy as long as there is not inherent risk. These institutional investors are called \"Market Makers.\"\n\nUnderstanding how options and share market makers work is essential to understanding why the market does not just take an elevator down without a financial liquidity crisis where all liquidity has dried up or where the risk of loss on the way down is too great to justify buying (or the selling so great that institutional buying can't compete with it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind that institutions are at least 80% of the market on any normal year. A relatively small number of players basically control most of the market. That's probably an even higher share during uncertain markets, since most people aren't really playing the market at the moment.\n\nMarket makers primarily make their money by scalping the spread. Basically, the bid/ask spread can be played to eek out gains in the process of matching up orders. By providing buys and sells in the market, MMs serve the purpose of ensuring that orders move, and as long as orders move there's pressure in the market in both directions as a function of structure. They can't do this alone, though, so they need to entice other buyers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMM scalping tactics are part of an underlying structure in the market which ensures that it doesn't move too far. Basically, institutions invest like businesses where positions essentially have to have an average target return rate, and money managers are subject to legal and professional risk if they underperform or don't execute against the business strategy with an eye to the balance sheet.\n\nAs long as the balance sheet says they have capital deploy and as long as the risk management strategy allows for it, and as long as the target equity has the target valuation for accrual, they can buy.\n\nBecause of these competing forces, they always have to consider buying once certain movements have been made in order to capture potential return and ensure the value of a portfolio. Also, hedges and contrary positions to their long position - often in the form of a protective collar - end up getting cashed in and deployed in order to ensure the neutrality of their position during problematic times, which means that most of the long positions in the market have a shifting center of gravity dictated by a balance sheet.\n\nThis center of gravity, once taken across the whole market, essentially creates the market pattern that happens during corrections, like the nice orderly pattern that we saw last year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, the indexes deleverage and de-weight losing stocks, meaning that the downward motion of the market naturally de-risks over time, generating more upward sweep in the market the longer a bear market runs by putting more successful stocks into higher positions of prominence in the index, pushing everything related to it up, generating more potential for buying among institutions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is why the market doesn't just capitulate because things \"feel\" bad. It's because it's really not an instrument for that, it's a mechanism for discounting relative valuations in order to return quarterly and annual value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo break this cycle and get the capitulation you're expecting, liquidity to market makers and institutions has to totally dry up, or something has to really break such that there is no upward signal potential to draw in money managers and market makers.

I'm glad it's helping people.\n\nThe challenge here is that the market is directionally indecisive right now, and while my predilection is that longer dated puts may pay off (or SPXU calls if you don't have enough money to buy SPY puts) the problem is that the dynamics I'm describing can make the market do wild things on the way there, eliminating their value during that period and causing a lot of stress.\n\nBasically, even if bears are right (and we have to consider that possibility with bank failures in the mix) then within the next year we could have a crash, but timing it is the real problem.\n\nSo the next place people will tell you to place bets is VIX, on the same theory that a crash is inevitable. This has the same timing problem and many of those people took out VIX calls in December/January and many got crushed on timing issues. (VIX has another problem going on, because everyone out there hedges with VIX, which basically means the market's volatility has its own volatility dynamics introduced through VIX derivatives. People develop linear expectations on derivative plays, then get washed out as the market flattens out.)\n\nBasically, any normal strategy in this market has a lot of directional risk, as well as cost to mental health that you have to factor in. We don't have a crystal ball, so we have to accept risk, or decide to take a less risky approach and stay out of a directionally-aligned bet with the knowledge it will also not generate as much return.\n\nIf you want to avoid risk and ensure gains, then high interest savings and treasury bonds are still good options. Whether now is a good bond buying point or not is up for debate, but a bond ladder will deliver its value at or around expected yield at the end of its term.\n\nIf you're looking for alpha, what I've been doing is swinging SPY/QQQ against SPXU/SQQQ, with 1/3rd of the money in the hedge ETFs to establish neutrality.\n\nI'll give you a much more simplistic version of the chart that I use to balance the positions that will work just fine for a basic strategy for swinging the hedge:\n\nGet on a chart on TradingView, open up SPY and set the chart to 1Y (daily candlesticks), then plot the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) 50 close, and the EMA 8 High and Low moving averages. Give them all distinctive colors/patterns so you can see them easily on the chart.\n\nAbove the EMA 50, the market is more likely to turn bullish, especially if it's moving up and away from the EMA 50.  The 50 day EMA acts like a relative signal line against the EMA 8 moving averages. This basically shows you how 8 days is tracking against 50 days of trading, which gives you an objective measure of the relative strength and direction in the market since just looking at the chart for momentum can introduce real bias into decision-making (we tend to see what we want to see in the chart).\n\nIf price action (candlesticks) is above the EMA 50, and the EMA 8 is above, then you have strong positive short term momentum and can take more risk on a long position correlated with the market (playing the market itself through SPY or VOO takes some of the individual stock uncertainty out of the equation, which is why I use SPY and QQQ for this).\n\nCandles above the EMA 8 low and below the EMA 8 High, and the market is in indecision... I call this no-man's land.\n\nMost people for these just use 2 or 3 closing-price moving averages, but I found that there's a lot of play and false signals with that. Mixing a close EMA 50 with a High and Low EMA 8 line set allows you to see the range that the market is trading on any given day against the longer trend. This reduces false signals by introducing the concept of a neutral zone.\n\nIn this neutral zone between the EMA 8 High and Low, you can accept risk based on your feeling for the market, but in this strategy, if you're uncertain, you hold a neutral position.\n\nIn this case, \"neutral position\" means that SPY and SPXU would be balanced cash-wise... let's say you have $900 in SPY... to make the position neutral, you would buy $300 in SPXU... that way if the market goes up or down, you remain neutral.\n\nIf it looks like the market may go up, then you can sell the short position to give exposure to the long position. Maybe you've decided that you can lose 5% of your SPY position on an upward move, and you have a potential breakdown support level at 10% down... in that case, you'd sell half your SPXU short position in the neutral zone to accept some risk, then if the market began weakening you have defined risk and some gains on the short to help balance the position.\n\nWhy balance a position instead of just buying/selling a position?\n\nWell, that's also a valid way of doing this, but what I found was that it made me look for entry points and that increased bias. What I also found was that I wanted to be in the market, and while holding a neutral position would cost around 1% in fees over a year (between SPY and SPXU) I wasn't always holding neutral. I would find troughs, sell part of the short position, let the market run, and when it felt like price action was weakening or it dropped below the EMA 8 High, I would then return the hedge to neutral position.\n\nBasically, the goal of this strategy is to detect liquidity troughs on the chart, use the chart to identify the market pattern, and us the EMA 8 and 50 to confirm that movement with an objective in/out signal, including uncertainty.\n\nLet's say we get a nice trough on the chart on SPY, and we move above the EMA 8 and I reduce my hedge to 1/3rd, then the market goes up 10% then dips into the neutral zone. I go neutral at 9%.\n\nThe idea here is to reduce loss and generate longer term alpha that way. It works in the other direction, too, by just flipping the logic.\n\nNote that none of this relies on predicting the future, the model is only about creating a strategy to try to capture the moves you want in the market.\n\nHowever, the market is going flat, I have to be honest and say that the work may not be worth it if there is no big movement for some time, as the erosion of a full neutral position may not make money in that circumstance faster than a 4%+ bond or money market account over a year.\n\nSo this is just to give you an idea of a type of strategy you could use to swing gains in this market. And if you want to try it, it doesn't hurt to see how it plays and if you don't have experience with charts, working with moving average trending is a skill all traders should have (even ones who don't believe in TA, because knowing how to objectively determine the strength and directional trend of the market still has uses outside of trying to predict the future).\n\nAny shorter term strategy that relies on a directional bias in this market is basically gambling, and that's fine. I'm not putting that down, I do it... but just going long or short and just buying puts or calls is not a strategy where I can guarantee a mechanism for generating gains in this market, it's purely a bet.  The strategy I've defined above, if played well, will most likely generate gains above the market, especially if we go down... and if we go up, the strategy detects that, too.\n\nThe strategy will not make you rich. The worst case is that you will ride through a crash and be invested at the bottom having retained most of your capital... or it'll go flat and you'll bleed slowly to fees maxing out at 1% per year (an acceptable price to avoid loss in a bear market). The key is not to be in the hedge too heavily when the market moves up.\n\nAlso, consider tax implications on this strategy. Swinging neutral positions may generate wash trades and trigger the wash rule and accumulate sells of small amounts that can build up taxes. If you have a good accountant, this should balance more or less, or if you have losses to harvest you can use that as a buffer/offset against gains on these trades, but do consider the tax implications for your situation.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Technical analysis bonus for this week:\n\nKeep an eye on SPY's directionality into Wednesday and the end of the week.\n\nIf we're testing 400 or above it before/on Wednesday, then that means that we broke the downward channel starting on February 2nd. This would also correspond to an EMA 8 high and EMA 21 touch pattern I was tracking during last year related to this troughing process I describe all last year.\n\nYou can see last year that there was a pattern through the year of a number of touch points on these EMAs that generates basically an inverted wave pattern, and when that pattern breaks resistance, that's when market rallies would happen (liquidity generation and burning off excessive short positions).\n\nDuring the last week, we've been in an indecisive pattern and to form a new accumulation (up) pattern, all we have to do is break above 400 on more than one close to break and hold it, and that would be an algorithmically bullish signal which would conform to the pattern from last year.\n\nBut in any case, to break that level and stay above it requires a change of the resistance trend since February, so still potentially significant.\n\nThis would be invalidated below 390, and the key resistance level drops to 395 before the end of the month (since it's a downward channel).\n\nA word of warning: This is based on the presumption of a return to last year's pattern. Over the winter, the market broke pattern so we may form a new pattern... also news may completely short circuit ANY pattern in this market.\n\nThe tactical key to playing this is waiting for the break of 400, then going neutral if the market doesn't hold above the EMA 8, with a maximum potential loss on an exit of the long around SPY 385 of around 4% if you went long at 400 (though an invalidation would break us below the EMA 8 High long before that).\n\nSo we have a risk-defined trade on these rules.\n\nIf we got that break above 400, SPY target is 415 or 420, providing a nice potential for return on a bear market rally (exact timing and route there is uncertain). Given that if this pattern happens, it means we've returned to the bear market trend, expect that run to fizzle out on the lower end of that target.\n\nNo predictions here, just a bonus planned trade for ya based on the chart patterns.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/7jk9opxku2qa1.jpeg?width=258&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb7f945f952551b5b98aa6b6fbdff9d8c37fc9a0", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Listen, I only get 30 minutes on the library computer to socialize, but sometimes I get carried away and have to trade a pudding 4-pack from the commissary to get my cellmate to give me his time.

This isn't rocket surgery. Go back to '08, look at the big, and lasting moves in the Dow since. They nearly parallel changes in the Fed balance sheet.\n\nSo, why are institutions entrusted with so much money that is forced into the stock market? Because the Fed has continuously manipulated the bond market and interest rate into forcing those actions. This has given corporations insane valuations relative to earnings (the return) and allowed for cheap leveraging of their valuations as well. This has lead to all sorts of distortions in the market and the real economy (ie shit getting sold at a loss - which is value/capital destruction, but we're OK with that essentially thanks to free QE money). \n\nAlso, the market is not a zero sum game with some winners and some losers. Specifically, individual actors (including investors that allocate their capital properly) can cause the growth they seek. While regards deploying their capital poorly do actually destroy it. QE has incentivized risker capital allocation and harmed real growth this way - ie more people propping up value destroying companies like Uber.\n\nThe \"real\" economy (highlight by OP) doesn't matter only as long as the Fed's shell game can continue, which might be a long time, but it is not forever. Ordinary people's production (which has been decreasing) and their spending power (also decreasing) matter to markets as well. If those things go down, so does the market absent distortions like QE.\n\nSo can QE just actually go on forever? Well, we have seen the answer is no. QE and federal government deficits funded ordinary people's lost production through COVID, now we have inflation. We're paying more to get less stuff done and less stuff of value made. QE creeped into the 'real' economy instead of just backing bank balance sheets and making corporate loans cheaper. More QE isn't going to solve this, its going to make it worse now. We need value destroying companies to die or value destroying portions of companies to close (ie, Facebook's dumb venture into the metaverse).\n\nYour last paragraph is your own capitulation to this point. The liquidity you reference is only there thanks to the Fed actions. But they can't keep providing 'free' liquidity in a stagnated 'real' economy. In fact, inflation and higher rates are already breaking stuff. Yes, SVB is small in the seem of things, but that's just the canary in the coal mine. The problem is debt costs are rising and we have A LOT of debt. Paying off this debt and rising debt maintenance cost IS a liquidity trap. Its going to happen at the Fed, its going to happen to our Federal Government and national debt, it will happen at more banks, it will happen to corporations and it will happen to ordinary people.\n\nAs an investor, you can probably still find the diamonds in the rough, where despite essentially secular decline, you'll see growth (this is probably why NVDA has gone bonkers on the idea that AI will take over and ordinary people will be broke, but NVDA and other AI software generators will be rich!).

All I did was explain \\*why\\* it wasn't just crashing on every bit of bad news.\n\nOn a point of fact, I largely agree with you on the following points:\n\n* The Fed manipulated the bond market with QE, and that influenced the stock market by reducing cost of capital and expanding access to cheap margin.\n* QE was responsible for the expansion of stock valuations.\n* There are trends of weakness in the \"real\" economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy post can be boiled down to the following factors which restrain downward slide:\n\n* Money managers compete against each other and primarily manage long positions for customers, and are paid by those customers to deploy capital.\n* Institutions protect their long positions with collars, and collars have ideal return at different points in the timeframe, which influences patterns.\n* Market makers are paid to provide liquidity to the market, and time their buys to generate liquidity.\n* Indexes rebalance and re-weight over time, resulting in resilience against the capital market trend.\n* In order to break this, an event has to starve the system of the liquidity necessary to keep it from regularly troughing and potentially reversing for a period of time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe last bullet point is NOT a capitulation of the rest of my argument, it's a logical conclusion of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow if you want to know my personal position on directionality for the market, over the next 6+ months it's down. The reason for that is because of decline in credit standards happening at banks. That will drive down the real economy and cause an economic problem \\*of some type.\\*\n\nWe don't know the extent of that problem that will happening. Anyone saying they know is not being honest, likely to themselves.\n\nI don't want to get too much into that argument here because it's immaterial. I was a permabear from 2009-2021 because I thought much like you that there was an eventual crash from the expansion that had to come.\n\nThat was wrong. I was wrong about that because I didn't take into account three things:\n\n1. People's greed.\n2. The system's ability to expand and adapt indefinitely.\n3. The amount of money the wealthy already had to prop things up.\n\nThat last part is key to the current situation. There's a tendency in permabear circles to think that the market flexes perfectly with the Fed's movements, but it really flexes with the range of addressable capital, and a lot of what the Fed pulled forward is currently idle in funds.\n\nSo the Fed can totally stop and that doesn't mean the market has to drop. To get that drop, banks have to fall out to the extent that they no longer have any capital (or real fear of that, which we don't have now), and we're not there and no one knows for a fact that we will get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI no longer try to guess the future. I focus on the mechanics. Like you said, you can't time the event. It could be 100 years in the future. I don't know, and I can't wait to find out.\n\nA short term credit crunch leading to a stock sell-off? That has a mechanic associated with it. I can get behind that.\n\n\"The market has to crash because it has to return to nature.\" That's a mistaken frame of reference. It has to do no such thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I would say the risk of a capitulation crash exists this year, but that doesn't mean that the market won't just trade sideways in a range or just oscillate down then up like last year fucking everyone who gets directionally committed trying to guess at a timescale along the way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn one last point, I never said that the market's a zero sum game. What I said is that some people have to lose, which is what happens when people buy at a peak. Someone had to buy there to generate liquidity for someone else to get out at that price. The liquidity cycle in the market creates winners and losers and that's part of the function of the market, and it's why you get these sideways moves and troughs.\n\nJust because someone's trying to explain the behavior in the market doesn't mean they're making a directional argument.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Chatgpt?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Pure autism. 0 silicon.", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "While this is true, the ad business is changing such that ad buying is going into ai generated text vs. images and videos.\n\nComing soon to your eyeballs - indecipherable text content generated by a bot who inserts xyz product or service into the conversation..", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Are you also chatgpt?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Found ChatGPT.

They were confident that these investments would bring in huge profits for the bank.\n\nBut things didn't go as planned. The economy took a turn for the worse, and interest rates went up. This caused the value of the treasuries and MBS to decrease, resulting in an unrealized loss for the bank.\n\nPeople started to get nervous and questioned the bank's investment strategy. The bank tried to reassure its customers that they had a long-term investment strategy and that they were confident that the value of the treasuries and MBS would rebound over time.\n\nHowever, customers didn't want to take any chances and started withdrawing their money from the bank. Despite the bank's efforts to calm the customers, it wasn't enough, and the bank went belly up.\n\nIn the end, the only thing that was left of the once-great bank was a pile of worthless treasuries and MBS. The investors were left scratching their heads, wondering where they had gone wrong.\n\nBut there was a silver lining to the story.  The bank is acquired by a giant bank.

That means less liquidity for withdrawals each time rates go up and meeting other obligations expected of the bank. At some point, insiders will sell their shares dropping the price sending new red flags for the overall market on more banking problems. Once their credit rating drops, the bank run starts and eventually collapse just like SVB did. The fed will step in printing another 2-3 trillion all while wiping out another 4-5 months of QT and furthermore prolonging rate hikes to deal with new funds printed that impact inflation. Contagion sends the markets into a frenzy and because rates have been prolonged and inflation isn't getting better, banks who are now invested in semi-risky assets now start to ping problems the same way SVB did. The next set of banks to likely see this will probably be [real estate banks](https://news.yahoo.com/commercial-real-estate-is-in-trouble-a-banking-crisis-will-make-it-worse-135630056.html) and the cycle repeats.\n\nWhile concern for banks failing is a legit problem, the consequences of their failure ultimately means printing more money, higher taxes and socializing the losses in an already crippling environment of high rates and high inflation all while the wealthy walk away richer than ever. To summarize, **banks failing means higher inflation.**\n\nThis is the vicious cycle that nobody seems to understand. Mainstream media isn't bringing it up either and when people question why markets aren't seeing a sell-off yet, it's because people don't seem to understand this horrible situation yet. In fact, some people think pausing rates will actually spawn a bull market. Apart from slashing rates, pausing rates is the worst thing the fed could do because it won't resolve the unrealized losses banks are seeing and the fed will lose it's grip on inflation. At best, you give banks time to secure funding and delaying loss of liquidity. In order to actually resolve the issue banks are having, the fed would have to *slash rates* which will have catastrophic consequences with inflation and the banks would likely end up failing anyways as a result of hyper-inflation.\n\nSo, it's save the banks or save the tax payer from inflation and you can't have both. The only realistic options the fed have is **letting the banks fail.** A lot of people will lose money, lenders all around the world won't see their money back and contagion will be just as awful for the markets (if not worse) than the problem itself but at least the means to protect the average consumer from increasing inflation is being addressed. I'd rather have it this way because in 6-7 years if done right, purchasing power will go back to normal and demand will return allowing for companies (and banks) to see more profit again.\n\nIf the fed chooses to pause rates or worse, slash them because they see the banks failing as a larger threat to the economy than inflation, purchasing power will become severely crippled. The moment QE is turned on, demand for money will instantly vaporize purchasing power and subsequently, the value of the dollar. This is because of the current climate of high rates and high inflation at the same time. Institutions, banks and anyone alike who have easy access to massive amounts of debt will be first to take it, use it and cover whatever problems they have before it devalues. That leaves the rest for consumers who will then demand more cash to cover for the devaluing dollar. This problem will accelerate overnight. \n\n**This is hyperinflation.** \n\nIf this happens, the world economy will be in shambles and the means to put out the fire will mean relying on Russia and the East's asset backed currency which means a finite amount of supply and seeing how uncoordinated most are in this part of the world not to mention their hatred of the USA and everyone else's at this point too. The east will see this as an opportunity and essentially \"rescue\" the USA if the USA bends the knee. This means cheap resources, labor, etc.  However, at this point, the whole country will be in a civil war and trying to get access to these resources will be difficult. I can see groups of people trading land and resources for guns the same way Africa has done with their conflicts in the past.\n\n***So, let's just hope the rich doesn't influence JP to slash or pause rates.***", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The goal of the market is not to reflect your arbitrary view of what reality is.. the goal is to take peoples money..", "score": 89, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's why I have become to love the market.

Meaning for every dollar they have on hand, they can lend out so much money. \n\nSo the reason it is typically inflationary is because it would increase the amount of lending the bank can do based on the fact it holds more cash, instead of treasuries. \n\nCue all the dumb crap they did in 2020.\nThe reserve requirement was set at 0%, (part of the justifications of this is that the central banks in Europe have had their reserve requirements set at 0% since 1990. Note- they didn’t add “…and it’s going well.” It was basically, “they’re doing it. Why shouldn’t we?”\n\nThey made the 0% reserve requirement permanent in 2021. (Or as permanent as an administrative policy can be. Until they go through the process of changing it). So the reason pushing cash is inflationary now has more to do with public perception. \n\nWhat’s **supposed** to happen is that banks need to keep a certain amount of cash on hand relative to the amount of loans it’s doing and relative to the amount of investing it’s doing. So pushing treasuries is **supposed** to make it so they can’t lend as much. \n\nNow? They can lend as much as they want; so credit hasn’t really been “tightened” by anything…it just becomes more expensive to the consumer because you get to pay more in interest. \nThey can also basically invest as much as they’d like because there hasn’t been a wall between consumer banking and investment banking for awhile now. (However, the reserve requirement was supposed to act as a barrier to their ability to do too much damage.)\n\nNow, banks that do a good job at managing their own risk and balance sheets may still be okay because they’d be cautious and use common sense. But MANY banks are going to take advantage of this newfound freedom to try to get as many interest payments as they can, and also to invest in what they believe is likely to be fast money. At your expense should it go wrong, of course. \n\nSo basically, it’s no longer technically inflationary to inject cash into banks other than the perception to the public that they’re in a better position due to liquidity; but they wrecked a mechanism to cause DISinflation (other than public perception) because they can no longer regulate banks into avoiding becoming over leveraged. \n\nReg T does a better job at protecting you than Reg D does at protecting an actual “safe” financial institution.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, if bank are irresponsible and mess around with the money that they get now.
