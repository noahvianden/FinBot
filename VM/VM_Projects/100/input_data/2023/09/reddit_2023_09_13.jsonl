I've got: Intel (30%), Raytheon Technologies (20%), General Dynamics (20%), Lockheed Martin (20%) & Northrup Grumman (10%). Since an invasion would effectively wipe TSMC off the markets, Intel would be poised to take-over microchip production/supply in U.S markets. AMD would likely go under or be forced to buy chips off Intel. Lockheed Martin does quite well selling air defense systems & is primary manufacturer for the F-35s. General Dynamics supplies a lot of the armoued vehicles (Abrams, Bradly, M10 Booker, etc) which would be needed to retake Taiwan and/or invade Chinese mainland. Raytheon works on a lot of high-tech military systems for naval, land & sea including radar & advanced sensor tech. Northrup Grumman has a lot of good stuff, but has too much invested in the comercial space sector IMO (including ULA). Since the war would likely transition into space, I don't see this side of their business necessarily doing too well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: *Deemed unethical*", "id": "16h8voz", "created_utc": 1694566735.0, "score": 106, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 168, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|8|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I have a small amount of $ to invest in a Taiwan Invasion Fund via stocks.

But I’ll go ahead and round up to 1MW battery pack. This is sort of a meaningless datapoint, because the size of battery on an electric truck doesn’t change the amount of energy that truck needs to consume in a year. What’s more important is the range on a single charge. I’ll once again use Tesla’s figure of 500 miles on a full charge of their “1MW” battery. Using the same total mileage as the diesel trucks (45,000 miles/truck * 4 million trucks = 180 billion miles), I divide by a very conservative miles per kilowatt (0.5mi/kWh), and get a total of 360 billion kWh.\n\nThis comes out to 360TWh per year with a fully electric truck fleet. 33% reduction in total energy demand, but again, the energy is now coming from a new place.

On the other hand, if a reasonably producing well is shut-in for a long time it can have its own consequences. Permeability variances within the producing set of inflow points (formation layers flowing into the wellbore) create groups of lower-pressure, higher-permeability zones, and groups of higher-pressure, lower-permeability zones. During production, the flowing bottomhole pressure will usually be low enough to maintain flow from all zones, but when flow is stopped, crossflow from high pressure to low pressure zones may start. Mixing of gases, oils, and waters from different zones can create many problems, some of which are extremely difficult to remove. Moreover, if a well is shut-in for a long time, the mixed fluids could lead to buildups of paraffin, asphaltene, or other emulsions both inside fractures and at the perforation.\n\nhttps://jpt.spe.org/twa/shutting-wells-why-its-nuanced-process", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "All of that just sounds like excuses. \n\n> Becoming uneconomical to produce...\n\nThat is just code for \"we want to maintain maximum profit margins\" instead of, you know, working towards the stability of the US dollar.
