COVID deaths which dramatically altered the labor pool. \n3. Supply chain disruptions caused by COVID responses primarily in China, but also issues like panama canal bottleneck.\n\n#1 is ending and should see a massive whiplash as both stimulus ends and student loan repayment kicks back up. This was happening regardless of Fed rates.\n\n#2 is a permanent alteration to labor pool. I told someone several years ago that this will take 5 years or so to shake out because some places will have to close and their labor will go fill gaps at the remaining businesses. Specifically look at restaurants. How many restaurants do you see that are understaffed these days? How many gas stations are clearly understaffed? That labor pool isn't coming back so either those businesses limp along OR enough of them close to get the others back to a reasonable level of staffing. Considering a lot of lending is on 5 year notes Im betting that as businesses reach that refi period a lot of excess businesses will close shop because the cash flow no longer works. When that happens folks lose their jobs and walk across the street to a similar business and are immediately hired. \n\n#3 The myriad reasons for supply chain disruptions are not going away at the same time and for the most part rates from the Fed aren't going to make a massive difference. Global food prices for example will remain elevated until the Russian invasion of Ukraine ends. Asian manufacturing will get going again, but it won't be in China. It takes time to get those factories in new locations running and no one is in a hurry to over invest or ramp up to capacity quite yet. I say not in China because the Chinese government has done some things that ran off foreign investment. Those folks relocated to Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, etc. Then you got the Panama Canal water level issue. Basically half the traffic that was getting through can go through right now. That isn't going to get better any time soon. \n\n\nMy take away from all of this is simple. COVID caused a lot of things to change. The new normal post COVID is probably going to settle out in 2026-2027. The worst of the changes will be front loaded and have already occurred, but the last of the systemic changes will be resolved by then. I don't know what all that will entail. I don't think anyone does because there are too many interrelated things in motion that have to reach the new equilibrium. Anyone wanting to take bets on all that is welcome to do so, but I would offer this simple advice. If a company survived the past several economic rough times they are likely to do so again provided they aren't drowning in debt. So instead of worrying too much about the stock price of the good companies perhaps a better thing to do is to identify the poorly run companies and avoid them.

I live in Brazil and I am a regular Mercado Libre customer (here it's called Mercado Libre, in Portuguese. But it's the same company). Brazil is one of the largest markets Mercado Libre operates, if not the largest. So being a regular Mercado Libre customer in Brazil for the past 5 years I would say I can have a fairly good insight on its moat from the customer perspective.\n\nHere Mercado Libre has beaten the concurrency for the past 5 years or so. Amazon has not half the popularity of mercado Libre, simply because Mercado Libre has built a high customer base throughout the years and also because most of the sellers are on Mercado Livre, but few are on Amazon. Mercado livre is the one stop place for technical equipment in any field, from dentistry to sound equipment. Huge variety and great customer support. So far, that would be a great moat.\n\nBut recently there is a crucial aspect of Mercado Libre's customer relations that is making me think the current management is not as cautious as it has been in the past: Brazilians (and probably customers for other countries too) are simply being unable to connect to their accounts on desktop computers. A malfunction on their login system on browsers makes it almost impossible to use your account. The only way to access your account as a customer is by the mobile app. There is no 2 step authentication and no way to use your phone to login on your desktop. It's simply not possible for Brazilian customers to login on their accounts if they attempt it using a PC. The Brazilian internet is full of complaints about it and it has been going on for a very long time. So it's certainly not something that is affecting few users, it's widespread. And Mercado Libre never addressed this issue.\n\nWhile this may seem a trivial issue, I'd say it's a red flag. A company that has conquered a great portion of the market that suddenly incurs in such carelessness may or may not keep growing. I think it's just too many people complaining for the company to ignore it. \n\nAmazon has not half the variety of sellers that you find on Mercado Libre. But Amazon has fast delivers, and a great user interface. I myself created a recently an account on Amazon to search for stuff I could not buy on Mercado Libre because I could not access my account. In the end I used mercado Libre on my phone and made the purchase. But this was simply due to the price: it was cheaper on Mercado Libre. But I wonder how many other frustrated customers created their account on Amazon and bought from Amazon instead from buying from Mercado Libre.\n\nWhen you're shopping for expensive technical equipment you want to use your desktop browser, so you can open many tabs at the same time, compare vendors, prices and products within Mercado Libre vast inventory. But if you are pushing your customers to Amazon by preventing them from using their accounts on their desktop in the Brazilian market, you must have something wrong with administration.\n\nIf this was something that had been spotted and solved quickly, most people would not even notice the issue. But it has been going on for more than a year. According to.the older posts I've seen. And this is terrible for customers of technical equipment, a segment that Mercado Libre excels.\n\nSo this raises a red flag on whether the current administration is going to sink Mercado Libre. I think this is a red flag because it is an indication of mismanagement. What If be does start switching to Amazon to recover their customers?\n\nI would not regard Mercado Libre as a long-term investment. I don't believe on its moat and that is what Amazon needs to take its place. And you will not see info on how many vendors may have opened stores on Amazon on Mercado Libre's reports. It's a very important thing that can't be on the reports. You must know the market to realize this. And this is very dangerous for Mercado Libre.\n\nI do think it's currently undervalued but I also think it may not perform well in the future if it's giving away its customer base.
