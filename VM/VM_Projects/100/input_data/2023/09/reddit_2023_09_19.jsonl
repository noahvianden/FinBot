In short, you need enough cash to cover the close/reopenen cycle.  Afterward, your cash balance will move up/down based on gains or losses from the day before.

I recently wrote about one, Sylvia Bloom, late last year.\r  \n\r  \nHere's another secretary, though, who's just as inspiring -- and instructive. Grace Groner teaches us real life lessons from her success that we can draw from, and help us to grow much wealthier.\r  \n\r  \n**Meet Grace Groner**\r  \n\r  \nGrace Groner attended Lake Forest College. That's relevant because upon her death at age 100 in 2010, the college received a rather hefty donation from her -- to the tune of $7 million. But, the thing is, Grace never made more than $20,000 a year.\r  \n\r  \nGrace grew up, went to college, got a job as a secretary at Abbott Laboratories, and stayed at Abbott for 43 years. She never married or had children, and lived in a simple one-bedroom apartment, until she bought a small one-bedroom house. She didn't own a car, but did enjoy traveling.\r  \n\r  \nSo how, exactly, did Grace end up a multimillionaire by the time she passed away? Well, she invested in stocks, and as you may know, the stock market is one of the best ways to build long-term wealth. It seems she actually only bought three shares of stock (for a grand total of $180, that’s about $60 per share), in her employer, Abbott Labs. She bought these three shares in 1935 and held on to them -- for decades.\r  \n\r  \nSo what did she do right, that we too might do, in order to get as wealthy as we can? Here are the smart things she did:\r  \n\r  \n•\tShe invested in stocks.     \r  \n•\tShe invested in a company she was quite familiar with, instead of one that was being hyped up in the financial media.\r  \n•\tShe bought shares of a healthy dividend-paying stock, which means she got quarterly payments from the company no matter whether the country was prospering or in the throes of the Great Depression. (Abbott has paid dividends for 385 consecutive quarters -- that's more than 96 years.)\r  \n•\tShe hung on to those (three) shares, through thick and thin.\r  \n•\tShe wasn't swayed by emotions, selling in a panic when the market crashed or getting greedy and looking for more exciting stocks.\r  \n•\tShe reinvested her dividends, which helps investments grow even faster.\r  \n•\tShe let the principle of compounded growth work its magic on her investment -- over 75 years, from 1935 to 2010.\r  \n\r  \nYou get the idea by now. You, too, might find some healthy and growing dividend-paying stocks and invest in them for many decades, reinvesting your dividends.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \n \r  \n**Coca-Cola IPO Lists on the NYSE**\r  \nAsa Griggs Candler incorporated the Coca-Cola Company in 1892.

Instead try to find a company you really are excited about their future. Then check to see if the company is trading for what you think it is worth. If it's not, that is your sign to invest in that company. Don't go all in on the 1 play, but be prepared to hold it for years and years unless the reason you bought has changed. In the Tesla example these are things i was looking out for to sell, if EV sales went down, if Tesla didn't have a wait list, if a competitor came into the space with real market share, if they couldn't break ground on their planned gigafactory ect. One thing not on my list was sell if the price went down.\n\nI did sell post split, but that is because I reevaluated it and decided I thought it was overvalued.\n\nThis strategy takes a lot of research.

Through a flurry of leaked documents involved in the court case between the FTC and Microsoft, it has been revealed that the software giant has been looking to acquire Nintendo since the year 2020. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes that the acquisition of Nintendo by Microsoft would be a “career moment” for him, and he believes it would be a good move for both companies.\n\nIn his email to Microsoft’s Executive Vice President and Commercial Chief Marketing Officer, Takeshi Numoto, and Chief Marketing Officer, Chris Capossela, Spencer stated that it’s just taking a long time for Nintendo to see that its future “exists off of their own hardware”, but he is firm in his belief that the acquisition will happen “at some point”, and that Nintendo will eventually see things the way Microsoft does. Nintendo has yet to comment on the leaked statement from Phil Spencer.\n\nAddressing Numoto, Spencer stated that he totally agreed that Nintendo is the prime asset for Microsoft in the Gaming business, and that, today, Gaming is the company’s most likely path to consumer relevance. He mentioned that he has had numerous conversations with the LT of Nintendo about tighter collaboration and felt that if any US company would have a chance with Nintendo, Microsoft would probably be in the best position. According to him, the unfortunate (or fortunate for Nintendo) situation is that the Mario maker is “sitting on a big pile of cash”. He said that Nintendo has a Board of Directors (BoD) that, until recently, have not pushed for further increases in market growth or stock appreciation. He clarified that he said “until recently”, as Microsoft’s former BoD member, ValueAct, has been heavily acquiring shares of Nintendo.", "id": "16mtamt", "created_utc": 1695135515.0, "score": 820, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 329, "comments": [{"body": "Not gonna happen.\n\nNow this would be an attempt to monopolize the videogame industry.", "score": 1270, "replies": [{"body": "Especially after the Activision acquisition", "score": 417, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe internally they already gave up on Nintendo a while ago and that’s why they went for Activision instead.\n\nWouldn’t be surprised if it’s their “consolation prize”.", "score": 200, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, I’m assuming they made a long shot goal of acquiring Nintendo while the Wii U was flopping as well as early in the Switch’s lifespan before it took off.\n\nThere is pretty much no chance Microsoft would be able to acquire Nintendo now.

Lots of online commerce sites leverage everything else including Visa and Mastercard.  If you're a new business and don't have Paypal/stripe/square/etc then you're not going to be losing customers either. \n\n In addition, eBay is moving away from PayPal \n\n\\> eBay and PayPal today confirmed the signing of a previously-announced agreement to offer PayPal as a way to pay on eBay until July 2023. This new agreement builds on the payments partnership between the companies to make PayPal available as a payment option on eBay’s new intermediated payments model. \n\nAnd that's the rub - what corner of the commerce (e- or otherwise) will you be locked out of if you don't take PayPal?\n\nNone.  After the Icahn fiasco with eBay and the spin off, PayPal was up to $300/sh or so, and now has nothing to do but crater.  They capitalized on selling things off, like [x.com](https://x.com) (from their pre-eBay days) to raise money.  I don't recall if they're still in Chennai, Arizon or Austin at this point, but it looks like a consolidation of employees as well into their San Jose CA headquarters.\n\nPlus the political bent of PayPal has taken the focus away from making money for shareholders into some bizarro world of being socially conscious.  \n\n**Fuck that, make me money.**  \n\nI don't want to hear about not effecting transactions for pot, drugs, porn or guns.  If two people want to trade money for gambling on webcams while smoking pot and showing off their guns - then take their money.\n\nBut no, PayPal has a bunch of nonsense including the crap they had to walk back when stating they're going to shut down accounts.  That screws over the shareholders and doesn't make me a shareholder more money.  \n\nDisclosure: Long time PayPal investor (10+ years) with still over 6-digits invested.
