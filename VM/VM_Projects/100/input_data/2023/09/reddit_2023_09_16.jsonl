{"title": "The Future of Apple: Time for a Reality Check or a Steady Hold?", "selftext": "The tech community is buzzing with opinions about Apple’s latest release, the iPhone 15, and it's clear that the reception has been more tepid than previous iterations. As long-time Apple investors, we've enjoyed the highs of groundbreaking releases, but is it time for a reality check? Is AAPL overpriced, or are we merely on the cusp of another wave of innovation that will take the stock to new heights?\n\n## Mild Reception for iPhone 15\n\nEven the most avid iPhone users appear somewhat unimpressed with the latest features. The question that looms is whether Apple has reached a plateau in terms of smartphone innovation. After all, how much better can a phone camera get? Is faster processing power enough to justify upgrading?\n\n## AAPL Stock in Rough Waters\n\nThe stock has been wobbly, and many are wondering if a market correction is overdue. The high valuation of AAPL stock might seem unwarranted based on current product releases. So, should investors cut and run or stick around for the next big thing?\n\n## Hidden Potential: Siri and LLm\n\nWhile it's easy to focus on tangible products, let's not forget Apple's potential in software and services. Rumors of significant Siri improvements and the much-talked-about LLm feature could turn the tide for the tech giant. We've seen how software services like Apple Music and the App Store have become significant revenue streams; could a next-gen Siri do the same?\n\n## Never Rule Out Innovation\n\nApple has always been a frontrunner in technology. Whether it's introducing the first iPhone or changing the way we listen to music with the iPod, Apple has continually set new industry standards. As investors, perhaps what we need is not skepticism but patience. \n\nSo, to my tech industry peers and fellow Apple stockholders, I'm eager to hear your thoughts. Is it time to be wary, or should we hold on for what could be another exciting chapter in Apple's story?", "id": "16k2bko", "created_utc": 1694853482.0, "score": 98, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "Pro tip: do the opposite of whatever the general consensus of here says", "score": 172, "replies": [{"body": "Basically when fearful,get greedy\n\nWhen greedy, become fearful", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Warren Buffett", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Amazing how did you know that", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Apple will either continue to grow or raise their dividend.

So if I buy one and my ssd went bad, which happened on my moms MacBook Air out of warranty, she didn’t get I couldn’t fix it. I always fixed thing, she got mad and thought I was not helping and I got screamed at until I left.\n\nShe got a MacBook m1 after I told her that her laptop couldn’t be fixed. Someone charged her $400 to reinstall it a few times and I finally told her it’s not worth $400 and she was halfway to a new MacBook, thing is if it’s storage fails, it’s out of apple care or if it is the laptop is done for.\n\nSo having had Nvme go bad, having had such bad luck with my last MacBook. I have an iPhone, but I haven’t been tempted to get a MacBook at all bc Lenovo upgraded me and apple didn’t.\n\nMy brother had less problems in 2008 and they replaced an  early MacBook with a unibody metal one, they comped apple care, so way back I would have gotten a new computer, an AirPod failed in the 9th month and resetting it fixed it. I was going to get an Apple TV but they wouldn’t replace the AirPod bc it was out of warranty, even though I had called in, it’s less than two years old. My five year old sennheiser headphones still work fine, they need new ear things to look new, the AirPods sounded better, but $69 for one bud is a lot. It turned me off from buying an Apple TV or even a new mac. Bc I had such a bad experience, I used macs from 2004 until 2016 and haven’t had one since. My customer support has been better.\n\nSo it’s like if I don’t need a new laptop with a processor similar to an m1, if I have lost faith in their previously amazing customer service, why should I buy another apple product? I have an iPhone bc it’s a legit good device but it’s a 13 and I see no need to upgrade it until it stops getting software updates, security updates, so 3 more years of os but also I’m annoyed about the AirPods and MacBook, and Lenovo gave me a laptop with twice what my original one was…. Dunno if they have better customer support, why buy apple?\n\nIt used to be 1. Vastly better hardware/os 2. Customer service 3. Ecosystem.\n\nMaybe macOS is better than windows 11, but my laptop had multitouch and I can play civ 5 with friends on the 2-1 form factor, I’d need a MacBook plus an iPad with sidecar or an iPad with a similar game. GeForce 1650-max q means forza and a lot of new games run. 4k hdr screen.\n\nTo get a MacBook that nice would be expensive. I also don’t trust the company if it breaks or I get a defective system. I also can’t fix it myself.\n\nI could replace anything in the Lenovo.\n\nIf the m1/8gb is enough for desktop use, than why get an m2 or m3 unless you make movies or edit pictures or do graphics? I can do Corel painter 2023 with gpu acceleration right on my screen, I don’t need an iPad for sidecar for that either.\n\nThe game thing is also a limit. Intel macs came with subpar gpus but they could play games, I don’t know about new ones, I could stream from my gaming pc, it’s what I do with the Lenovo with anything that needs 4k, I just don’t see the need to replace it, I don’t feel apple will hook me up if it’s messed up.

In a way, basically a Lynch pick.  I’ll explain.\n\nI’m 40. I’m not on social media of any sort.\n\nI have 3 kids. 18, 14, and 11.  My oldest does not use facebook, she says “Facebook is for old people.” She goes on Instagram once in a while because she’s into baking and home decor, so she likes Instagram for inspiration.\n\nFull disclosure, I don’t let my youngest ones use social media because I think it’s unhealthy. However, literally all their friends whose parents allow social Media apps, use Snapchat.  My youngest started grade seven this year, all her friends have phones, all those kids use snap as their social media of choice. My kid in grade 10, same deal, snap is everywhere with kids that age.\n\nMy kids have a step sister who is 13.  My ex and her husband are constantly fighting with her over social media.  She was on Snapchat, was messaging a bunch of strangers and not being safe or smart with her Snapchat usage. So her parents took her off Snapchat and all other social media.  But she keep finding creative ways to sneak it.  Snapchat is a status symbol in her age group. She seems to feel like if she isn’t on Snap, she doesn’t exist.  And I’ve got a feeling that she isn’t the only kid in this world who feels way, who feels lost without Snapchat to keep track of her friends, know what going on in her group, and get validation.\n\nTLDR: with my kids and their age group, (11-18), Facebook is “old people social”, and they don’t use it.  Some use Instagram, but mostly they don’t use any social media other than Snapchat. And they use it constantly.\n\nOnto the next age group I see (18-24):\n\nMy 18 year old and her friends use snap pretty much exclusively to communicate. They don’t text message or phone each other. They send each other snaps, they use snap maps and location to know where each other is.\n\nI have a niece who is 24 and some of my friends have kids similar age to my niece.  Within that group Snap is pervasive for communication as well.  Instead of texting or calls, it’s all snaps or snap video clip-messages.  Kids in that group use snap as their dating app too, instead of apps like tinder.  They can simply add other people in the area and start snapping each other, and that’s how they hook up.  \n\nI have friends slightly older than me (42-46) with kids similar age or a bit older than mine, and they see the same thing. Our kids use text message or the phone to talk to us “old” people, but it all snap all the time with all their friends. I have a few of my friends who started using snap just to talk to their kids….\n\nTLDR: 18-24 year olds use Snap almost exclusively as their communication/dating/everything app.\n\nObserving some of my younger friends (28-33) I see the same thing. These guys use more of a blend, they use Facebook extensively for their business advertising and they post their pictures etc on Facebook and their wives like Instagram the same way my daughter does, inspiration for home decor or crafts, life hacks, etc.\n\nBack to those 28-35 year old guys, for day to day communicating with their friends and wives/girlfriends, it’s all Snapchat all the time.  I bet within that demographic, Snap use is probably easily 3-5 times usage/interactions on Facebook/Instagram.\n\nTLDR: 28-35 year olds use a blend, but Snap dominates their casual social messaging over other apps.\n\nAmong guys my age, I see a lot of Facebook use, and Instagram.  My age guys don’t communicate over Facebook, we just call each or text each other the traditional way.  Facebook is used a lot for market place and business promotion.  Instagram is used to look at the “instawhores” shaking their bootys.  \n\nTLDR: lower Snap usage as you get older. My age group is still stuck in 2013 with our Facebook and Instagram. Just like our parents with their VMs and fax machines.\n\nFinal TLDR: \n\nI think we are about to see a huge shift in social media usage with snap dominating.  Facebook/Meta whatever will lose relevance as young generations view it as “old people social” and out of fashion.  \n\nIf Evan Speigel et al can figure out how to properly monetize, put ads in without it interfering too much with the user experience, this company will be worth 50 times what it is now.  Meta is currently worth 776B, Snap is worth 14B.  To my thinking and observations, there no reason why Snap can’t be worth the same as meta if management can monetize.\n\nWhen I was in Australia in 2007, the bar tender at the restaurant I was at told me about Facebook. He was also Canadian, working down there. He told me it was a great way to stay in touch with family and friends. I had never thought of it. My wife was on MySpace or Bebo or some other similar app.  I wasn’t interested in it, thought it was gimmicky. But that bartender was in it. I didn’t have any money at the time, but he saw the shift happening that I didn’t see.  Even $1000 into Facebook in 2007, I bet I’d be retired by now….\n\nI got Netflix in 2017, I thought, this is a great idea. Did I invest in it?
