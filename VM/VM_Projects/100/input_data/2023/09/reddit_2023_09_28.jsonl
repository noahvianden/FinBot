{"title": "How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide", "selftext": "Wall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.\n\nThe 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today‚Äôs dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla‚Äôs other operations are worth.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:\n\n1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars\n\n2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.\n\n3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations\n\n4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations\n\nTheir assumptions are as follows:\n\n> Our model is based on estimates of Tesla‚Äôs future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year‚Äôs FactSet analyst consensus.\n\n> Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.\n\n> Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla‚Äôs cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%. The total of all these discounted estimated cash flows gives the theoretical enterprise value of Tesla‚Äôs core automotive business now.\n\n> We have left the value of its other businesses as a separate assumption within the model to arrive at a total enterprise value. Market value would also include the company‚Äôs cash or debt position, which we have not modeled.\n\nPersonally, as a Tesla bull who owns the stock, I believe Tesla is worth north of $1 trillion based on 10 million cars at $38k and 17% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, and $200B for other operations. I also believe that assuming 5% terminal growth post 2030 is too low. \n\nWhat do you think?\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/how-much-is-tesla-worth-you-decide-78b25ab1", "id": "16uih1b", "created_utc": 1695913562.0, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "that's not WSJ.

{"title": "The everything bubble and why it can‚Äôt be blown up again.", "selftext": "INTRO\nI bring you a story, a story of how the FED and its economic policies have doomed the economy ,a recession and a bear market is lurking on the horizon like has never before been seen.To Convince you of my theory , and to break it down , I will be splitting this DD into 3 parts .\n\n\n1. The Everything Bubble \n\n2. The coming long-run slowdown in corporate profit growth and stock returns.\n(why it can‚Äôt be blown up again)\n\n3.How did this happen?\n\n\nPART ONE \nTHE EVERYTHING BUBBLE AND WHAT IS IT. \n\n1. What is a bubble? \n\nAn economic bubble is a period when current asset prices greatly exceed their intrinsic valuation, being the valuation that the underlying long-term fundamentals justify.\n\n2. Okay, so what is the everything bubble?\n\nThe expression \"everything bubble\" refers to the correlated impact of monetary easing by the Federal Reserve (and followed by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan)on asset prices in most asset classes, namely equities, housing, bonds, many commodities, and even exotic assets such as cryptocurrencies and SPACs.The term is related to the Fed put, being the tools of direct and indirect quantitative easing that the Fed used to execute the monetary easing, and to modern monetary theory, which advocates the use of such tools, even in non-crisis periods, to create economic growth through asset price inflation.\n\nTo put it simply , the federal reserve and the banks have irresponsibly used Quantitative easing and the Fed Put to flood the market with cash , artificially creating expanded asset prices in every sector. \n\n3. Are there examples of this so called bubble?\n(Due to Reddit issues , this section will be in the comments )\n\n\n4. How do you identify a bubble?\n\nTraditional approaches to detect stock price bubbles rely on historical data. Past prices are used to estimate the fundamental value of an asset. A bubble is then identified by the difference (if any) between the price observed in the market and the estimated fundamental value.\n\n\nNewer approaches use option pricing to be able to determine in real time if there is a bubble in the underlying asset , a few examples of this here.\n\nhttps://hub.jhu.edu/2021/03/16/model-detects-stock-bubbles-in-real-time/\n\n\nWe can use both the traditional and modern approaches to look at the s&p and determine if we are in a bubble ,\n\n\nFirst the traditional approach \n\nWhile it's indeed important to remember that no valuation measure is near perfect , I do believe that the Shiller P/E is a reasonable method.\nThe main advantage of the Shiller PE ratio is that it eliminates the fluctuations in the regular PE ratio caused by variations in profit margins during business cycles. The regular PE uses the trailing 12 months earnings per share (EPS).\nThe Shiller P/E gives investors a read on whether the stock market‚Äîas represented by the S&P 500‚Äîis overvalued or undervalued. The higher the Shiller P/E ratio, the more overvalued a market.\nFor context, over more than 100 years, the average and median Shiller P/E ratio has been around 15 or 16, spiking up significantly higher often before market crashes.\n the all-time high in the Shiller P/E ratio was December 1999, when the figure reached 44.19. This high coincided with the dot-com driven rally in tech stocks of the late 1990s. Based in part on that record high ratio, Shiller correctly predicted that the dot-com frenzy would turn out to be a bubble.\n\nHere is the chart\n\nhttps://www.longtermtrends.net/sp500-price-earnings-shiller-pe-ratio/\n\n\nThe current shiller P/E ratio is 30.64 although in 2021 reaching a staggering 39 , the average being around 16.5 indicating a very overvalued market, for historical context, The only other times where the ratio has been higher was the 2000.com bubble at 44 which left the market relatively flat for the next decade ,and the Great Depression in the 1920s.\n\n\nFor the Modern approach \nI recommend looking at this study below \n\nhttps://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2021/08/05/how-to-predict-a-stock-market-bubble-in-real-time.html\n\nit relies on cross-sectional option price data.\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simple,‚Äù Dr Kwok said. ‚ÄúFirst, get the sale prices of the stock option contracts at various strike prices. They are useful for uncovering the distribution of discounted future stock prices. Then calculate the fundamental stock value as the average of discounted future stock prices. Subtract this from the observed spot (current) stock prices to obtain bubble estimates.‚Äù\n\nWhile the math here is a little above my pay grade , the strategy is back tested multiple times in different studies at different colleges by different experts coming to the same conclusions, their findings were Bubbles were positive and economically significant in the late 1990‚Äôs, during 2006-2007 (prior to the GFC), and after mid-2014 to the present day. \n\n\n5. If we are in a bubble, how big is it? \n\nA superbubble is when asset prices are multiples from historical valuations and the average price trend due to extreme speculative conditions. A superbubble in the financial markets is when assets are priced at three-sigma the standard deviation from the historical trend. This is where we are today.\n\nSome examples of previous modern superbubbles in the financial markets are the 1929 stock market crash, the 1970s, and the 2000 dot-com bubble. These events are extreme in historical nature and can see drops in prices of 50% to 90%.\n\nLegendary investor Jeremey Grantham has been publicly saying the US is in a superbubble of stocks, bonds, and real estate for almost a year. He said recently that this bubble has still not really popped. Grantham saw the 1980s Japan stock bubble and the 2008 financial crises coming and warned people of both of them before they occurred so he‚Äôs a good source for viewing macroeconomic trends.\n‚ÄúOnly a few market events in an investor‚Äôs career really matter, and among the most important of all are super bubbles,‚Äù Grantham explains. ‚ÄúThese superbubbles are events unlike any others: while there are only a few in history for investors to study, they have clear features in common.‚Äù\n‚ÄúPrepare for an epic finale‚ÄîIf history repeats, the play will once again be a tragedy. We must hope this time for a minor one.‚Äù Grantham said.\n‚ÄúThus we could say the current event, so far, is looking eerily similar to these other historic super bubbles,‚Äù Grantham said. \n\nPT2&3 WILL BE POSTED A DAY LATER AND WILL BE A CONTINUATION OF MY THESIS THIS PART IS JUST TO INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT\n\nPART 2 BELOW\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/5lzhkPRRoY", "id": "16u82bk", "created_utc": 1695881108.0, "score": 219, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|95|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7lpz/test_5/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7fo9/test_2/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7jna/test_5/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7j8r/test_4/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7f88/test/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7eqq/the_everything_bubble_and_why_it_cant_be_blown_up/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7sni/the_everything_bubble_and_why_it_cant_be_blown_up/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16ewejx/is_the_weed_market_undervalued/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: We‚Äôre in a bubble of stocks, bonds, and real estate.
