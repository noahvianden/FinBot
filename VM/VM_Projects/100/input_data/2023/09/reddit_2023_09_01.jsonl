I'm big into physical data centers, HVAC, electrification, companies that will benefit from IRA/Infrastructure spending and reshoring. I also invest mainly more in small-mid cap companies.\n\nA lot of the positions I've moved into like a year ago, so haven't been buying much, but my most recently position is CWCO. It's a really interesting company and worth looking into. \n\n As far as what is working well today: \n\nCLH - industrail waste management company, benefits from reshoring/building and is an amazing company and never really expensive. Right now the foward PE is 21, PEG 0.77, PB 4, PS 1.74. It's up 52% YTD, 48% on the 1Y mark, and 140% on the 5Y. \n\nIESC - they have like no analyst coverage. They do electrical work for like for different segements, but really bullish on the housing and data center segments. \n\nAIT - one of the most boring companies in the world, do they like power fluid transmission and is a play on industrail automation. Continues to beat and raise guidance on every quarter. \n\nNVT - Electrical component maker. Used in things like data centers. \n\nJBL - reshoring play. I bought heavily on their earnings dip a few quarters ago, when it like 78 a share. \n\nCWCO - as mentioned above, they are a water play. They do water desalination, but they own like 50% of another company called PERK which is allowing them to win US contracts. They are going to be building and mainting water facilities in Hawaii and AZ. \n\nLMB - a transfomational business, where they have two segments of work. They do HVAC. Traditionally did mainly just new builds, but moving away from that model going more like becoming the installer and maintance for the systems. Helping companies save money on their power bills as well. EPS has been exploding because of how good the margins are in the that segment they are going after. \n\nITT - they make break pads. Another boring company like AIT i bought last year when it was really cheap. Really stoked on their acquisition they made on a space component company. They are seeing like 15% organic growth in all their segments and raised full year guidance and EPS. \n\nThat's just to name a few.

I think there are a lot of crazy youtube'rs out there making wild claims.  I think it can get into $2tn in the next 2-5 years, which would be a stock price of $630.

I'm at a stage in my life as we start to set up for retirement where a sudden $28,000 windfall would be put to good use.  If I did get called out on 1 or 2 blocks, I'd probably hold off on writing any more for a while.\n\nI think the other key thing I would impart to people is to absolutely base your hopes/goals for the stock price ... not off the price itself, but based off of the market cap and then work backwards from that.  Because honestly, that's what the big funds all do.  They don't care if it's $100/share, $200/share, $300/share.

I'm not that experienced and I never use covered calls yet I feel like I should", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sure.\n\nSo there are two types of options, calls and puts.  They are contracts they give you the right to buy or sell a stock at a specific price during a certain timeframe.  The contract is always for 100 shares of the underlying stock.  You can either buy an option or sell one.\n\nThere are a lot of permutations on that, but “writing a covered call” typically means someone is selling a call contract AND they already own the underlying shares (again, blocks of 100).  It will have a strike price and expiration date.  It will allow the buyer who paid the premium to “call away” those shares at the strike price during the time window.\n\nSo for my specific example yesterday I wrote calls with a September 15 expiration date.  The strike price is $280.  Because I was the one writing the call, I pocketed the premium - $220 per contract direct into my pocket immediately.  That money is guaranteed and can’t be taken away from me.  However, now the clock is on to see if I will be able to retain my shares as well (I.e. the option expires worthless in the hands of the purchaser).\n\nIf Tesla stays below $280 between now and September 15th then the options will expire worthless and I will keep all my shares.  And then I’ll probably do the same thing again.  Over the past year I’ve made nearly $10k doing this and have not lost any shares yet.\n\nIf Tesla goes above $280 (especially if it’s above $280 on the close date) then I will likely lose my shares.   Let’s say Tesla is at $300 on close date, my shares would be “called away” from me at $280/share despite the fact that the market price is $300 - because I wrote that contract.   My 100 shares per contract will be turned into $28,000 cash.  The option contract buyer could then go and sell their new block of 100 shares they just got for $280 on the open market for $300, so they would be “up” $2,000 on that trade (minus the $220 they had to pay me for the contract in the first place).\n\nGiven that I got my shares in 2017, my cost basis is like $13 so I’m just being forced to lock in like 2,000% gains anyway - so it’s kind of win win for me.
