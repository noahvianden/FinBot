On a split-adjusted basis, that is AMC’s lowest close on record, according to FactSet.\n\nAMC was widely expected to sell additional shares after the successful conversion of the preferred APE shares into AMC common stock in August. It followed the settlement of a lawsuit objecting to the move.\n\nThe theater chain sold millions of shares of common stock in recent years after becoming one of the so-called meme stocks popular with retail traders. The sales helped AMC stabilize itself after the Covid pandemic effectively halted the theatrical movie business.\n\nHowever, AMC used up its allotment of stock and needed shareholder approval to issue more. The company issued the preferred APE shares as part of a strategy to change its corporate voting structure and get shareholder approval to sell additional common stock.\n\nAMC said in the filing Wednesday that it will sell the new shares through “at-the-market” offerings, without a specific time frame. Citigroup, Barclays, B. Riley Securities and Goldman Sachs are listed as sales agents in the filing.\n\nThe U.S. movie business remains below pre-pandemic levels, and the ongoing strikes in Hollywood have clouded the release slate for the rest of 2023 and 2024. AMC and pop star Taylor Swift announced last week that the theater chain is serving as the distributor for a concert movie of The Eras Tour to be released in October.", "id": "16cs732", "created_utc": 1694124594.0, "score": 564, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 382, "comments": [{"body": "AMC sells more stock than movie tickets", "score": 691, "replies": [{"body": "Thats what happens when the market offers a company free money for no reason", "score": 214, "replies": [{"body": "Management doing the smart thing to stay solvent here.

There’s no reason to force Ukraine into cobbling together drones made out of a bunch of civilian commercial equipment.\n\nIf the pentagon wants Ukraine to be able to use Starlink and not have to worry about potential ITAR restrictions they needed to make a contract with SpaceX, which is what they did in June.\n\nTOS of Starlink:\n\nStarlink is not designed or intended for use with or in offensive or defensive weaponry or other comparable end-uses. Custom modifications of the Starlink Kits or Services for military end-uses or military end-users may transform the items into products controlled under U.S. export control laws, specifically the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 C.F.R. §§ 120-130) or the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 C.F.R. §§ 730-774) requiring authorizations from the United States government for the export, support, or use outside the United States.\n\nSince Starlink is providing a live service, if they allow the modification of the dish to be a part of a weapons system and then allow its continued use in that role, that puts them in violation of ITAR.\n\nGoing against ITAR is how Blackwater, the largest private security contractor in the world, got shutdown and essentially made to be the Pentagon’s bitch.\n\nEdit: I didn’t write this comment initially.

They needed to do more in your eyes. You think the US gov should give 100s of billions to ukraine but expect spacex to foot the bill of this, indefinitely? makes a lot of sense for a smooth brain like yourself I guess.\n\nYou're acting as if the US gov is just giving spacex money. Do you not understand what a service is?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo you're margin comment:\n\n[https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-was-elon-musks-ukraine-starlink-funded-biden-white-house-1749103](https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-was-elon-musks-ukraine-starlink-funded-biden-white-house-1749103)\n\nDefinitely not even close to 80% of the 80 million. That was the vast majority spacex and doesn't account for the service. your source is disingenious and doesn't account for the cost of the service along with conflating the intial period of donation with the continuation of the service. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then in February this year the company decided it would restrict Ukraine’s use of Starlink for offensive military purposes. This is entirely the reason the US is going to put up their own satellite constellation to ensure no private company has the ability to switch off or limit their field communications. The \"Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture\" PWSA will be similar to starlink but built by trusted military companies like Lockheed Martin and others. SpaceX will likely launch them. So far $5 Billion is earmarked for this program.\n\nYou apparently are not familiar with ITAR. Civillain tech cannot be used as weapons, i.e in an offensive attack.\n\nThe International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) control the export and import of defense-related material and services. ITAR rules prohibit exporting certain types of technology, especially satellite technology, to foreign militaries. ITAR may apply to Starlink if it is modified for military use or if it is exported to a foreign military.\n\nStarlink is a civilian service that uses satellites in low Earth orbit to provide broadband internet.\n\nThe terms of service for Starlink prohibit integrating terminals into weapons.  However, custom modifications for military use may make Starlink subject to ITAR. which is what you are describing at the 5 billion dollar project from the pentegon.\n\nSo you are again, wrong. He didn't shut it off cause you and the rest of the idiot hive mind of reddit think he did because he was mad or whatever. Its the law. And again why the pentagon has the new project.\n\n>So what did we learn, Elon claimed to provide a service at no cost that was primarily paid for by the US and allies governments, private donation and then came to terms to have costs covered so no charity at all. After 12 months decided to change the rules on use, because apparently they never considered starlink might be used militarily. This highlighted significant risks for global military and ensured long term Starlink would not be needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this is false.
