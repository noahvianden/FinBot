And the current world and demographics has an abundance of money supply and less demand.  By rights, rates *should* be quite low, and so they were.  That's been true for two generations and continues to be true.  There's trillions in wealth hoarded by previous generations that's being quietly rolled over to their children.  It's not post-WWII.  We aren't building our country from scratch.  If rates were not being tampered with by Feds, perhaps 2-3% was normal and healthy, based on pure supply and demand.\n\nWhat central banks/Feds do is actually artificial manipulation of that reality.  Zero percent wasn't the true cost arising from supply and demand, it was an attempt at artificial stimulation.  Current rate jacking is an attempt to distort the true price of supply/demand.  \n\nUnfortunately most civilians think fed rates are truth, but they're not.  They're a \"market adjustment\" to the laws of economic physics.\n\nAs I said *before* the fed did their first rate jack: \"This is not going to work.\"  And it hasn't.  The reason is that most of our inflation wasn't because of fed rates, it was due to things like the pandemic, corporate gouging, severe undersupply of housing, China issues, supply chain.  \n\nYou can't solve a problem caused by those things by addressing something completely different.  It's like doing foot surgery for a toothache.  \n\nEach fed rate jack had no impact on inflation (as predicted) and so the blind Feds just decided to double down, triple down, quadruple down.  Surprise.  It's not working because it doesn't really address the true root causes.\n\nAnd now all this rate jacking is probably going to start breaking things rather than fixing them.  Making housing unaffordable isn't a \"solution\" per se.  It's adding another fire to fight.  Same with causing bankruptcies, defaults and mass layoffs.  Those don't help an economy.  They only help tweak their bastardized number that gets reported as \"inflation\".\n\nBetter solutions would have been to make it clear company officers and boards could face criminal charges for gouging.  Could have done measures to rapidly increase available housing supply.  Could have used government powers to solve and prevent supply chain boondoggles.  Things like that would have tamed inflation better than these blind rate hikes.\n\nThese and other measures stand a lot better chance of working if we have full employment and affordable housing, and if we're not dealing with bombshells of bankruptcies and delinquencies and artificial interest rates draining personal and governmental coffers.\n\nThat's not to say some rate hiking wasn't needed or useful.  Moving rates out of the sub 1% range re-arms central banks to give them options they had used up.  A slow grind of resetting values because of the Trump admin printing 40% extra dollars was needed.  But better we do that with a percent a year over twenty years than by trying to do it all in four years of suicidally elevated rates.\n\nContinuing to jack rates so far outside the rules of economic gravity is not only going to be futile, it's going to cause some level of catastrophe.\n\nIt's like the entire public, including people who should know better, has just given the job of inflation fighting over to one entity, and that entity has only a hammer, and that entity has no sense of ever not using their hammer.  They'll use it on nails, but they'll also use it on screws.  And when that doesn't work, they'll use it to try and clean the windows and to try and tie their shoes.  \n\nWe should have been doing multi-pronged inflation fighting measures, with the Fed being just one small part of that.\n\nInstead we have an \"Inflation Reduction Act\" that is actually just a massive job stimulus and spending bill, which does the opposite of its name.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Which company do you penalize?

It's somewhat crazy for example that our DoD is dependent on a megalomaniac with a private company who routinely meets with murderous foreign dictators for fun.  Past governments would have turned Starlink into a very controlled situation in the flick of a lamb's tail.  \n\nAnd besides law/crime, you can apply all kinds of massive carrots and sticks.  Oil barons are colluding with KSA to keep oil supply artificially tight.  Government could say produce now or lose licenses leases and leeway.  \n\nSimilar with housing.  Imagine if the creative energy that goes into producing some micro transaction video game were applied to smarter rapid construction housing?  We built more housing in a month post WWII than we do in a year now, and that's after 75 years of advancement.  A committed effort to massively increase low cost housing could be the mother of all stimulus programs that also *lowers* one of the biggest drivers of inflation.\n\nWe could be using carrots to do efficient building construction and design, like all the other smarter civilized nations do.  \n\nThere's a universe of attack vectors besides just sitting back and letting the blind mole rats in the fed just jack rates and not understand why that has done nothing constructive and will continue to do nothing constructive.\n\nAlso, your idea of going after one gouger doesn't have to be the way.

Similarly, brokerages have access to data about their customers' activities, including what stocks or options they are interested in, what they're buying, and what they're following. This data is incredibly valuable and can be monetized by the brokerages.\n\nEssentially, brokerages can leverage this data in multiple ways:\n\n1. **Targeted Advertising**: They can use the data to serve targeted ads to their customers. For example, if you've been researching electric vehicle stocks, you might see ads related to the electric vehicle industry.\n2. **Improving Services**: Brokerages can use the data to enhance their services, such as providing personalized stock recommendations or alerts based on your interests.\n3. **Selling Data**: Some brokerages may choose to sell aggregated and anonymized data to third-party companies, including hedge funds, for market analysis and trend identification.\n4. **Understanding Customer Behavior**: Brokerages can analyze this data to gain insights into customer behavior, which can inform their business strategies and decision-making.\n\nIt's important to be aware that while brokerages are in the business of facilitating trades, they also have a financial interest in using customer data to generate revenue. This doesn't necessarily mean they are actively trying to work against their customers, but their primary goal is to make a profit.\n\nTherefore, it's crucial for investors to be informed, make well-researched decisions, and be cautious when trading, especially with options or other complex financial instruments. Markets can be volatile, and investments carry inherent risks.
