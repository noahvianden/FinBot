Let me address your first point, then the numbered points. While there is something to be said for experience our issues on behalf of our temps have nothing to do with experience. It's not some sort of token that when you have enough, you're in. We have \"temps\" who have spent the entirety of this contract (2019 just before the pandemic) working 6x 10 hour days and sometimes Sundays as well. This schedule is forced by the company and the \"temps\" are still making $15.78 to start, the same wage I made when I started in 2013. They could have hired these employees but then they would have had to pay them better which is what our union's plan was to get them their due. The company ran on the backs of these guys. Many of them have left at this point only to be replaced by new guys who are in the same boat. The few who are still here from the pre-pandemic era are going on 5 to 6 years in some cases. They are not just striking with us now as full members of our union but many of them plan on leaving if this contract sucks for them. If they could have earned this, they have. They would've had the experience in 4 times over in any industry other than ours. Many of these guys train people who come to their teams for the day and know their areas better than many full timers.\n\nAs to your bullet points:\n1) The companies are already raising the prices on you and pocketing the difference. If we win a decent contract it will not just infuse our local economies with billions of dollars that the companies and shareholders aren't spending locally, it will have a ripple effect to other companies like Tesla, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen and others who build in the US but aren't union.\n2) The systems we're using are already taking the work of white collar workers, giving it to us on top of our duties and cutting their jobs (see WCM).\n3) Customers are free to take their business elsewhere, say hi to the Kia Boyz for us and I hope your support of foreign car companies doesn't nuke your local economy.\n4) The companies will not go bankrupt (record quarter after record quarter) they are trying to turn public sentiment against us. Investor op-eds have already come out in our favor saying a strike would be more costly than paying us and the only demand that is out of line is the 32 hour work week. The government bailed out the companies, not the union. My union brother's and sister's work and sacrifices paid the company's loan off. We signed away our pensions, COLA, froze raises and cut wages in order to keep the company afloat. Now we're finally knocking and asking for some of what we gave up back.\n\n\nTo summarize:\nYour armchair assessment is appalling and you're embarrassing yourself.

Over the years, it has been clear how the cars have improved vertically, from one model to the next. But now that I have donated my early cars to an automotive museum, I am driving the latest Model X, and can compare horizontally, from my white Model X on stage with [@ElonMusk](https://twitter.com/ElonMusk)  \n for the first deliveries, to the Plaid X today.  The new X is *amazing* compared to where it started, with many fit and finish improvements, silent chassis rigidity, insane acceleration, longer range, drivetrain tuning, heat pump, and a more elegant interior design with no clunky AC vents. And it’s much *less* expensive. A number of controls and sensors have been removed (forward radar, ultrasound, and side-radar for door clearance detection). The steering wheel column is smooth with no stalks. Once the UI is streamlined, it seems obvious in retrospect. For example, the cameras and drive history can tell if I want to go forward or reverse.  It guesses correctly 100% of the time.  And this is just one subset of the full AI driving stack in development.  So many features that are standalone modules in legacy cars are just derivatives of the FSD stack, like auto high-beam adjustment, proximity alerts, and auto windshield wipers.  All of this is seen by the cameras.  And removing the stalks is an example of Elon’s mantra: “the best part is no part. It weighs nothing. Costs nothing. Can't go wrong.”  I am reminded of a passage I wrote for the Steve Jobs obituary in *BusinessWeek*: “Jobs was the master architect of Apple design. Often criticized for bouts of micromanagement and aesthetic activism, Steve’s spartan sensibilities accelerated the transition from hardware to software. By dematerializing the user interface well ahead of what others thought possible, Apple was able to shift the clutter of buttons and hardware to the flexible and much more lucrative domain of software and services. The physical thing was minimized to a mere vessel for code.  Again, this came naturally to Jobs, as it is how he lived his life, from sparse furnishings at home, to sartorial simplicity, to his war on buttons, from the mouse to the keyboard to the phone. Jobs felt a visceral agitation from the visual noise of imperfection.” — archived here: [https://flic.kr/p/atvnG7](https://t.co/uZOcl0HX0Q)\n\n[ ](https://twitter.com/FutureJurvetson/status/1702390041962750011/photo/1)", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "So far nothing beats keyboard and mouse though...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "i believe the context is phones and cars not desktop/laptop computers", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "https://x.com/Jack_Raines/status/1702158063833055361?s=20", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I have been noticing Chamath has been trying to rebrand as the \"good guy\" again lately, while the world should know he's a proffesionap pump & dumper", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Nobody cares about the uyghurs!", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "divide snatch drunk naughty station poor melodic quickest insurance murky -- mass edited with redact.dev", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Do not bow down to the capitalist pigs!", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|3utCNx5N58Gnm|downsized)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[https://youtu.be/eXonrPDVesc?si=O-IX\\_3AMDCQXZWf\\_](https://youtu.be/eXonrPDVesc?si=O-IX_3AMDCQXZWf_)\n\nWalter Isaacson interview by Rob ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Whoa, one step closer to elon interview", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "\"Sure\"", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Cool to hear Walt has listened to Tesla Daily for 2 years.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Rob’s always been a good interviewer", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I have to go to the office today 🙄", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "You guys work?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not selling any TSLA, so yep", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Let them fight", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Uaw wants new battery plants unionized.

It took many more hours to install the Solar Roof compared to a conventional roof, because of all the connections that needed to be made.  Elon had replaced several executives in charge of the project, but nobody could seem to make the product economically viable.  \n* Elon observed Solar Roof install and told engineers at the site he was displeased.  One engineer pushed back and said he'd been working on roof projects for 20+ years.  Elon snapped at him, demanding to know how many roofs he'd actually installed, not just designed components for.  \n   * Elon lost his temper and began shouting and cursing that engineers needed to be installing the hardware they were designing, so they'd know the problems that installation workers would face on a daily basis\n* Solar Roof hardware did improve dramatically in the months that followed, but the product is still not easily scalable because of the labor involved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy take: Solar Roof won't be a profitable product for Tesla, unless Tesla Bot becomes smart enough to install it.
