The issue is that it's not *just* 4% in a vacuum, it's 4% on the heels of much higher prints in the previous year or two during Covid.  It's also an issue because the notion that we can move the goalposts to 4% seems to justify the way we've been going until now.  \"Don't worry, it's just 4%, it's not much higher than 2%\".  Meanwhile we do nothing to address the root causes of stagnation or structural inequality.\n\nMy impression is that Mr. Volcker (our Mr. Volcker) is on to something with the idea that it's \"every man for himself\" out there in this climate and the people who can't get raises for whatever reason are going to be left behind.  That said, it's true that this needs more evidence, so maybe he and I are wrong.  As I said in another comment, I think it's wrong of you to dismiss his personal experience, however.  He personally is hurting from inflation, he shared some things like how tuition for his kids went up 7% suddenly, and that's hurting him.  It's clearly causing him some distress.  I don't think it's right of you to say \"nah dude it's just 4%\", when that's not the thrust of his argument. \n\nOf course, he's just one anecdotal data point, so more evidence is needed, sure.  I'd like to see how things play out, and I'm a bit lazy to go and find specific numbers and data right now.  My impression is that some people are hurting from inflation, but you're right, the burden of proof is on me.  So maybe I'm wrong.  I won't try to push it as fact, but it is my feeling. I'm sure all of this will become more clear as time goes on, and we'll have more data points to work with. \n\nI think perhaps Mr. Volcker did get a bit caught up in 2% vs 4%, that's true, but like I said, I think you missed the deeper thrust of his argument.  As for calling you a Wall Street shill, no need for name calling, certainly not.  But there are some arguments to be made that monetary policy, as well as general government policy, has flavored the rich over the last few decades and drastically increased inequality.
