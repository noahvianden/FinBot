Honestly about 95% of my core trading strategy relies on heavily levered treasury futures and the correlation and direction of different parts of the yield curve to equities so I have a lot of thoughts on this.\n\nIt's not the most likely outcome IMO but anyone considering this needs to seriously consider some stuff before looking at this as \"rates are high so they'll probably go back down in the future\". The bond market outright does not work that way. It has massive momentum and mean aversion. We've basically had 2 states of the bond market in the past 75 years. Really bad until 1980 then really good until 2022 which like '94 and '99 being the slightest blips before the following years immediately after were great for bonds.\n\nThe current situation is significantly worse than I think is widely understood and that includes the 1970s.\n\n1. Our debt to GDP is 3x+ higher than the 70s. The deficit this year is outrageously worse than projected. Tax revenue in bear markets (2022) sucks, the market has barely bounced, and we are issuing debt on the short end of the curve, the most expensive part since the market is barely budging the belly and tail of the curve up, at a much larger volume and higher rate than anticipated. The deficit is seriously about 50% worse than forecasted for this year, this is the federal government regardless of anyone's political views they do not miss deficit projections by 50% unless bad shit is happening that was not anticipated.\n2. The majority of mortgages are fixed at about 3%, corporate issuance tends to happen in the intermediate range and rates were recently negative. Raising rates is not moving the needle like it has in the past. This is not \"baby boomers in prime home buying age\" like it was in the 70's. Ask yourself how much inflation has really impacted you if you own a house with a 3% mortgage. It has. Do you feel it like prices are up 20% since covid as in your household budget is 20% tighter all else equal? Hell no let's just be honest it sucks but this is not hitting homeowners as much as lower income folks and renters who frankly, matter less for getting inflation down than someone with a $150k income debating buying a vacation home or going on a family vacation - it's just how it is, people can't pull back on non-discretionary items so they get crushed and people who can well, they tend to own a massive cheap line of credit or a paid for home\n3. Since the fed has only blunt instruments and has to choose between inflation and unemployment eventually, they may have to force real unemployment and this can spiral, and spiral worse than it has before. There is not a lot of dry powder to pass a massive stimulus package when a recession hits. If tax revenue is down and debt to GDP grows because of a stimulus package and flooding the market with so much debt there is still too much US debt issuance in the market, rates will not go down by as much as we want them to. This is a special kind of hell and would put on the table a lot of possibilities some people talk about and I don't take seriously at the moment (US as reserve currency being #1 which some very smart people like Ray Dalio seem genuinely concerned about). Keep in mind, the fed has 0 control over fiscal policy or how much demand there is for US debt on the open market other than huge amounts of QE. QE is this situation is like beyond nightmare fuel. The fed simply cannot do QE unless inflation is below target. The entire reason to trust long dated US debt is that the fed has done a good job keeping inflation in check since the 1980s and QE if inflation is still 2%+ would completely erode this belief and yields would be incredibly unstable in the belly through the tail of the yield curve for a long time. This would basically bring us back to the 70's where the fed tried to directly control prices and moved rates like maniacs every few months.\n\nSo that's a wall of text but as someone who has to spend a lot of time thinking about this, people should know there is real major risk here and bond prices have shown historical patterns of mean aversion not mean reversion like equities do. The longest drawdown for bonds in US history was decades (stocks for the long run by siegel outlines these, I don't have the exact numbers on hand).\n\nIf the S&P is 4500 with a CAPE of 35 and it crashes to 2250 with a cape of 15, it's pretty likely we're going to see the S&P go up to 4500 if rates are lower when the market gets some momentum in a short amount of time.\n\nThis is not how the treasury market works. Bad times can be very bad for very long times (30 years until 1980ish) and very good for very long times (40 years after 1980ish). QE helped us a lot but there are very strong theoretical reasons why it is not tried in inflationary regimes. Volcker didn't even tell the fed to adjust the target rate, the fed from '80 through '87 took control of the full yield curve by just controlling money supply and letting the rest fall into place. This was great when debt to gdp was 30% and totally manageable. 4x those debt levels...debt service at 15% yields could outright break the bond market.\n\nI would not try this until there is actual serious momentum behind falling yields for like over a year. Sure that means you'd be buying the equivalent of bonds in 1983 not 1981.

No one will vote for the taxes that would take. So we either default which we clearly aren't going to opt for unless the nuts prevent a debt ceiling increase.... or we inflate our way out. That could come in several forms, but the likely route will be to reduce fed rates to 3% or so and then monetize the debt. 3% would basically be there so that people will feel like they have liquidity in the housing market. Monetizing the debt though would effectively set us on a course for sustained inflation. If anyone has a realistic path other than those please speak up. \n\nThe weird part about that is I could see stocks dipping for awhile and then going onto a steady upward path that roughly matches inflation.

The talks never reached an advanced stage, according to the report.\n\nThe revelation comes as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to prove to a federal judge that Google violated antitrust laws by abusing its dominance over the search market. Google’s deal with Apple to share ad revenue in exchange for default status in Safari, and whether that agreement made it impossible for challengers like Bing to compete, have been a key part of the ongoing antitrust trial in Washington. Microsoft’s alleged sale effort appears to bolster the government’s contention that Google locked up the market to the point where its top competitor was willing to throw in the towel. It also shows that Apple, the world’s most valuable company, preferred to stick with the Google deal than pick a costly battle in search.\n\n[https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-reportedly-tried-to-sell-bing-to-apple-in-2020](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/microsoft-reportedly-tried-to-sell-bing-to-apple-in-2020)", "id": "16v5j80", "created_utc": 1695974436.0, "score": 730, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "\"Apple now receives an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion in annual payments — up from $1 billion a year in 2014 — in exchange for building Google’s search engine into its products.

Such performance should be a cautionary tale for those declaring the death of value.\n\n> If the underperformance of the value premium in U.S. stocks since 2008 was a sign that value was dead, we should see similar underperformance outside the U.S. From 2008 through July 2023, the MSCI EAFE Index returned 3.2%, but the Dimensional International Small Cap Value Index returned 5.2%, outperforming by 2.0 percentage points annually.

International looked a lot rougher...  \n\nAnyway, I was actually discussing this with someone else, but AQR put out a really nice article about 'value stocks' and some common myths/facts about it. If you get some time this weekend, [do check it out](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Journal-Article/Fact-Fiction-and-Factor-Investing). It might answer your more qualitative questions about why SCV, without just spitting out numbers.\n\nMy short counter is that large caps have *always* had natural barriers to entry and resistance to downturns. In past decades, in countries across the world. The academics who study SCV show the premium is robust to all of these. E.g., Larry Swedroe showed the value premium / small cap value premium existing in other countries after 2008. The premium has persisted from the time of Roaring 20s, world wars, Cuban missile crises, etc.\n\nSecond, everything you're saying about large caps having better moats / financials, that belief (which is true) is part of the reason there is a premium at all. If nobody was scared of small cap value volatility, much of the premium would likely disappear. So the bull case for value stocks is in part investors gravitating away from them. It's the same thing about ESG: it often has perverse impacts, by creating a discount on fossil fuel or tobacco stocks. This discount then creates opportunities to buy in 'cheap' and ultimately profit from the large cash flows relative to the price paid.\n\nI'll stop there, and I'm glad I had this exchange so I could refresh myself on some of this data.

As always, my view is a more broad-based.  There was plenty of capital in '08, the issue is what happens when it dries up.  Actually I read a great quote from Kevin Warsh last night, from 2007:\n\n\"The benefits of greater liquidity are substantial, through higher asset prices and more efficient transfer of funds from savers to borrowers. Historical episodes indicate, however, that markets can become far less liquid due to increases in investor risk aversion and uncertainty. While policymakers and market participants know with certainty that these episodes will occur, they must be humble in their ability to predict the timing, scope, and duration of these periods of financial distress. . . . If moored from fundamentals, confidence can give way to complacency, complacency can undermine market discipline and liquidity can falter unexpectedly. . . \"\n\nOf course, you could argue that liquidity falling off is a black swan.  Maybe.  But if the argument is \"as long as liquidity is ample, things will be fine\", I think that's dangerous.  That's why Kevin says \"moored from fundamentals\".  If there is a fundamental issue underneath, which arguably there is with the CRE issue (and others, like high valuations at a time when the price of money is not cheap), it's more likely that we might get caught swimming naked.\n\nI think this is a reasonable take on my end.\n\nBTW, NLOP actually isn't a great idea IMO simply because the point of the company is to unwind itself (I didn't initially realize this).

William White agrees with me on this (I've cited him before), as do Kevin Warsh and others economists.  The problem is you never know what's going to break or where, and it's impossible to keep your eye on everything all at once.  The economy is a complex adaptive system which, if anything, tends towards disorder.  Animal spirits do not help.  And there is a lot of money in shadow banking and in NBFI's (non-bank financial institutions).\n\nAs for the Fed swooping in, certainly some lessons have been learned.

And even if they do work, are they not just kicking the can down the road?\n\nObviously I have no clue if I'm right or not, I won't say \"yeah this is definitely the way things are\", but it makes sense to me and I think the reasoning is more or less sound.

No.  China has achieved amazing GDP growth in the last 50 years thanks to these policies.  Hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty.  (These policies, combined with, of course, an opening up of markets.)\n\nLook up South Korea's development model.  They were basically a military dictatorship.  I've been reading about East Asian development the last few weeks/months (and a bit more over the past few years).  Think of the CHIPS Act except on a much bigger scale.  Things like that are what Korea did and what China does.  Japan did exactly the same thing - which worked until it didn't (that's a topic for another day).\n\nIn sum - there is an enormous grey area between total free market and total control.  Both USA and China are in the middle, each leaning further towards the opposite extreme.  IMO the ideal is somewhere in the middle there.\n\nAs a society we're still learning (and debating) about what works and what doesn't.

If you look what happened in New York at the beginning of the pandemic and extrapolated it out to the whole country..... locking everything down might have been prudent. I mean, from a health standpoint, if everyone is locked down a virus can't spread. End of pandemic. Probably not really feasible though. On the other hand, don't make me wear a mask consequences be damned probably isn't the best public health measure either.

On the flip side, China has some very big issues caused by poor planning. Even more extreme, North Korea has virtually no innovation.\n\nYes, US free market then is a prime example of \"runaway capitalism\".  As for China's issues, I'm not really well-studied on that.  I recently just got finished studying China's \"economic miracle\", ie, the run up from Deng until now. It's truly amazing what they've been able to accomplish, and when my mind was shut off to it I just had no clue about what a success China has been.  I'm not up to date on recent Chinese events though, which is something I intend to rectify.\n\nMy impression is that the real estate problem in China, for example, is just a case of overshooting.  This isn't  just a pre-GFC speculative bubble where people were solely flipping houses just to speculate.  I mean, China is a country with over 1 billion people, over the last few decades they *needed* incentives to get things built.  And it worked marvelously.  My instinct is that the empty houses and stuff is not \"poor planning\" per se, but rather the inevitable consequence of overshooting on those targets.  It would have been impossible to get it done perfectly, and I think they were aware of that.  They were willing to accept some degree of waste as long as resources were being mobilized en masse.   (Nowadays it's different, they have to be more pinpointed in their approach.)\n\nAs for North Korea, I think it's apples and oranges.  They're ideological \"allies\", but really China went a completely different way with Deng.  They recognized the benefits of the free market.  I don't think North Korea ever did that. They remained isolated.\n\nRe: Covid.   I always understood that the idea of lockdowns was to flatten the curve in order that our health system wasn't overwhelmed.  I dunno.  The way I always looked at it was, hey, I'll stay home and wear a mask if that seems like the best way to protect myself and my neighbors.  I think Chinese culture, which is more society-minded, had an easier time accepting that, too - even before the government came in with harsh restrictions.\n\nThen again, there are great benefits to individual freedom - ie, innovation and creativity.  The US excels at that.\n\nIt all comes back to the same thing for me - the truth is somewhere in the middle and humanity is still trying to figure it out.

The company’s services, used by the C.I.A. and Western militaries for more than a decade, were deployed to track emergency room capacity and direct supplies of scarce equipment.\n\n> Palantir charged the government just one pound.\n\n> The deal provided the company with a valuable toehold. Since then, Palantir, which is chaired by Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor and one of President Donald J. Trump’s major 2016 donors, has parlayed the work into more than £60 million in government health contracts. Its biggest reward may be yet to come: a seven-year contract worth up to £480 million — about $590 million — to overhaul N.H.S. England’s outdated patient data system.\n\n> But an outcry over Palantir’s rapid ascent within the N.H.S., the beleaguered but beloved public institution that provides free health care across the country, has been building for months among some lawmakers, doctors and privacy campaigners.

So if you touch any of it and break it....you can't go back.

Talk about a pull yourselves up by your bootstraps moment. Walking from Venezuela to Texas. Holy shit. What a great filter, those who have the physical and mental capacity to make that journey will contribute to 🇺🇸 and be forever grateful if treated correctly. Is it about breaking the law and cutting in line? Elon has shown he is ok with that (Covid lockdown). Taxes? No, most illegals pay without claiming anything and no refund. Maybe they mooch by sending kids to school and using the emergency room when they get in a construction or farming accident? Maybe, They will vote for dems? No, Florida Cubans sure don’t coming from socialist systems that collapsed would only push them to the right. But they are bankrupting New York… Well conservatives sure seem to dislike nyc and ca, so why do they care now. \n\nThe only thing I can think of is because they are brown and don’t speak English. The out group of you will. The same things happened to Irish/German/Italians in the past if you study history or have been to Ellis island museum. The out group becomes in and the cycle starts again. \n\nI don’t understand the disconnect and can’t put it on anything other than picking on the out group. Elon talks about the baby crisis, doesn’t migration stop that?

Not saying Elon does that, but he doesn’t exactly follow the letter of the law either.\n\nAs far as chi and nyc supporting migrants,  I think it is more of a situation where migrants are going to where the money is (cities). In the last few centuries tenement housing and slums would take in the new migrants, but that is unsanitary and illegal now for good reason. \n\nIf it were up to me I’d deport a few Americans to make room for more migrants who could contribute.
