Look at this chart: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/272120/revenue-of-tesla/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272120/revenue-of-tesla/).  There are years of very high YoY growth, like 2013 compared to 2012, and years of mediocre YoY growth, like 2019 compared to 2018.  However, the general trend has been upwards, and I see no indication that this will stop anytime soon.  Tesla's goal is to displace as many gas and diesel vehicles, as quickly as possible\n* **Delivery of goals** \\- Elon Musk has been the chief culprit of promising things too soon.  He originally said that Model S would be delivered in 2010, and it wasn't until 2012.  Model X was supposed to be introduced in 2013.  It wasn't until 2015.  FSD software is perpetually pushed back.  However, in general, Tesla has a track record of eventually delivering.  The sales numbers are real.  \n* **Competition** \\- Tesla has never centered its business strategy on being a monopoly automaker.  I've never heard any Tesla executive, not even Elon Musk, say this.  They know they can't transition the world to sustainable energy alone.  Tesla's sole competitive strategy is to innovate as fast as they can.  Toyota recently tore down a Model Y and its engineers were stunned at the pace of innovation (https://uk.motor1.com/news/655116/toyota-engineers-label-modely-work-of-art/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis last point about competition may be the most important.  Most people assume that competition will \"catch up\" with Tesla.  Most people aren't considering that Tesla doesn't stand still.  The entire culture of the company is oriented towards *accelerating* the pace of improvement.  Other companies are giving chase, but Tesla is pulling away\n\nTesla also has many non-automotive products either for sale, or in development, such as stationary battery storage for power grids (currently about 1.5 Billion USD/quarter, but growing fast), and AI training systems (used for in house FSD training, but potential Software as a Service down the road).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You take what they did at the beginning and just apply that infinitely to the future and feel smart.\n\nNo.  \n\nWhat myself and a small number of people actually do, is continuously monitor Tesla's progress as a business.  That means reading the SEC regulatory filings, watching factory construction progress on YouTube, monitoring customer feedback, and a lot of other due diligence research *over the span of years*. \n\nGrowing wealth in TSLA is not easy or fast.
