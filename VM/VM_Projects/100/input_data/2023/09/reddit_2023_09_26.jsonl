It pointed to so-called anti-discounting measures the company uses to punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering lower, more competitive prices than Amazon, which translates to keeping prices higher for products across the internet, the FTC said.\n\nAmazon also ‚Äúeffectively requires‚Äù that sellers use its ‚Äúcostly‚Äù fulfillment services in order to obtain the vaunted Prime badge for their products, the FTC said, which in turn makes it more expensive to do business on the platform.\n\nThese tactics have degraded the shopping experience on Amazon, the FTC added, and forced sellers to pay expensive fees to market their goods on the site, while facing no other choice ‚Äúbut to rely on Amazon to stay in business.‚Äù\n\nThe lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Antitrust Paradox.‚Äù Khan argued in the article that the prominent antitrust framework at the time failed to capture the true extent of Amazon‚Äôs dominance and potential harm to competition. Through her work at the FTC, Khan has sought to reset that framework and push the boundaries of antitrust law through risky legal battles.\n\nAmazon sought Khan‚Äôs recusal from antitrust investigations into its business, arguing that her past writing and critiques showed she had prejudged the outcome of such probes.\n\nThe charges are the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers saw as anticompetitive practices. Amazon was one of four Big Tech companies investigated by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which found it held monopoly power over most of its third-party sellers and many suppliers. The majority Democratic staff at the time alleged that Amazon shored up ‚Äúcompetitive moats‚Äù by acquiring rival sites like Diapers.com and Zappos.\n\nAt the time, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that ‚Äúlarge companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.‚Äù\n\nFounded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from an online bookseller into a retail, advertising and cloud computing giant with a staggering market valuation of roughly $1.4 trillion. The company has sought to expand its dominance by entering verticals like health care, streaming, and grocery, acquiring primary care provider One Medical, legendary film and television studio MGM, and upscale supermarket chain Whole Foods.\n\nThose moves have attracted intense regulatory scrutiny. The House subcommittee report also accused Amazon of abusing its position in online retail to harm third-party merchants who rely on the platform to sell goods, and alleged it uses ‚Äústrong-arm tactics‚Äù to bully retail partners. The FTC is also reviewing Amazon‚Äôs planned $1.7 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot\n\non antitrust grounds. Amazon recently paid roughly $30 million to settle two privacy lawsuits brought by the FTC concerning its Ring doorbell and Alexa units. The agency followed up in June with a lawsuit accusing Amazon of tricking users into signing up for Prime,  while making it too difficult for them to cancel.\n\nAmazon‚Äôs marketplace has transformed into a linchpin of its e-commerce business since its launch in 2000. The company had already expanded beyond its origins as a bookseller to offering things like CDs and videos. But once it opened its doors to third-party sellers, it supercharged the number and variety of products for sale on its website, earning it the moniker ‚Äúthe everything store.‚Äù\n\nThe third-party marketplace has given Amazon access to a higher-margin business than just selling books. It has also increased the fees it charges sellers to do business on its site, run advertisements, and tap into its fulfillment and delivery services. In the first half of 2023, the company collected a 45% cut of every sale made by sellers in the U.S., up from 19% in 2014, according to the nonprofit Institute for Local Self Reliance. Sales from third-party sellers now comprise 60% of total units sold, the company recently disclosed.", "id": "16ssaqy", "created_utc": 1695744951.0, "score": 283, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 126, "comments": [{"body": "> The agency laid out a two-pronged strategy by which Amazon ‚Äúunlawfully maintains‚Äù its monopoly power.

Subsidies may disappear. E.g. In germany VW has stopped several EV production lines because people aren't buying EVs since subsidies by German government disappear. EVs are subsidized in US, is that going to be the case with different governments, legislations and economical conditions?\n\n- Many countries and regions are already electricity starved and ramping up electricity production isn't simple. Look at Japanese grid, look at Europe. Look at most of Asia/Africa/South America. Is there enough electricity and will be there to meet EV demand?\n\n- EV production is highly dependent on rare minerals whose prices are sky rocketing and that we may be unable to produce enough.

What are their drawbacks?\n\nI could go on and on with so many different of your arguments and provide countless counter arguments for those.\n\nAnd, at the end of the day, you need to open an excel sheet and do your own math for how much do you think a company like Tesla is going to make in the future (based on facts, realistic projections, taking into account many unknowns)?

Many are not.\n\nBut let me tell you: you just can't make solid investments repeatedly by such low effort thesis and looking for internet validation.

Sell puts, get assigned, sell calls, wait for underlying to go up, rinse and repeat. \n\nSeveral days ago, the Fed has made a few things clear:\n\n1. A soft landing is no longer the base case scenario.\n2. Rates will be higher for longer. The market had been forecasting four rate cuts next year but now the Fed's own dot pot says that only two are likely possible. \n\nYou might say \"Lol, I'm willing to be assigned AMD at $90, LFG!\" You say that and get assigned. But in the coming months, I bet you that AMD might go lower and you'd be kicking yourself for not waiting. You try to sell calls to lower your basis but find that unless you sell a call at your cost basis several months out, it's barely worth the bother. And you are out of buying power to sell puts on other stocks but you are also unwilling to sell AMD at a loss. \n\nThis scenario above has happened to me a few times in the past because I blindly sold CSPs. \n\nThis subreddit's name is called \"Theta Gang\". You are selling theta, and selling CSPs are only one of many ways to sell theta. For example, the market is going down right now. You could instead sell naked calls or call credit spreads. Yes, they say selling naked calls is dangerous but it can help you if done in the right market environment. Yes, losses are theoretically unlimited from selling calls but not in an environment where stocks are going lower. \n\nI too had a bias against selling spreads, ICs, and calls. CSPs seemed \"less dangerous\" to me, but in an environment where stocks are selling off every week, selling CSPs in such an environment can be just as dangerous to your trading portfolio as selling naked calls in a bull market. Sure the underlying might not go to zero, but are you willing to stomach a 20% unrealized loss with no clear indicators of when your underlying might go back up?\n\nThe trend is your friend.

EVs for ride sharing and taxis are near the 100k yuan mark ($15k) but home users never buy them. Mainstream high-end cell phones are $300-$400 but I personally go with $200 ones, which gives you top-tier performance with a low-tier shell. $1000 phones exists but doesn't sell well, except iPhones. $400 is as good as it gets in all perceptible ways.
