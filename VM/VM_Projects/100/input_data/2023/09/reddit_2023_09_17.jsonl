Intel is an integrated device manufacturer (IDM). As a result, Intel designs and manufactures its own chips.\n\nIn recent years, Intel has struggled with innovation. Competitors such as TSMC, AMD, and Nvidia have chipped away at Intel’s market share. The previous CEO, Bob Swan, failed to foster a culture of innovation vital to operating in the semiconductor industry. After being replaced in 2021, Bob Swan’s successor, Pat Gelsinger, immediately shifted the company’s focus towards IDM 2.0, focusing on technology and manufacturing capacity. This initiative comes at significant capital costs partially offset by Western nations’ subsidies in the aftermath of global COVID-19 supply chain disruptions.\n\nWhile risks remain within the plan, IDM 2.0 creates a unique value proposition for potential clients. First, Intel’s current node roadmap is technologically superior to its main competitor, TSMC. Furthermore, Intel will have a geographic monopoly on advanced semiconductor nodes. TSMC’s announced expansions in the United States will no longer be generations behind Intel’s at the estimated time of release.\n\nAs a result of these factors, Intel trades at a discount to its Intrinsic value.

They had a 10nm process that had a... 43%? forging failure rate (only 57% of forged chips were usable due to Intel's insistence on remaining with a monolithic process), and released a couple of higher-end chips at massively inflated prices with those dies, but mostly they kept adapting the 14nm process until we had 14nm+++.

You fail to look at opposing sides or to actually showcase where someone could further take your findings, which again proves your bias.

Oop, that's not true either, because of classic Intel core bloat, it's actually esentially the same perf/watt too. \n\nOh, and companies better start praying that they don't need the higher L3 cache of the MCM variants, because only monolithic SPR competes with Milan in perf/watt lol, level out the playing field with MCM designs by both AMD and Intel, oof... \n\nThere's a reason I say Intel's design teams aren't up to par.

And management bumped up projected full-year adjusted earnings to as much as $490 million.\n\nNet new memberships increased by 39,000 in the first quarter versus 25,000 in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nTotal memberships increased 9% to 813,500.\n\nAnd first quarter average center revenue per membership increased to $667 compared with $580 a year prior, thanks in part to more in-center offerings.\n\nLife Time opened three new centers in the first three months of the year and will open seven additional ones by the end of the year.\n\nI have had some winners in my 10x portfolio. Kite Pharma, Myokardia and Proofpoint – were bought out at huge premiums to our initial entry prices.\n\nThe ten-baggers have to meet six minimum requirements .\n\n1.They must be tremendous innovators, offering products or services that no one else does.\n\n2.They must experience terrific sales growth. In this case, top-line expansion has to be 30% or more, at least initially.\n\n3.They must protect their margins. A firm must be able to defend its market niche from competition with patents, trademarks or brand names.\n\n4.They must beat consensus estimates. In the short term, share outperformance is all about beating expectations. Even if a company operates at a loss, it can still register as a significant beat if the loss is much smaller than expected.\n\n5.They must be small cap to midcap companies. Megacorporations simply cannot grow at the high rates of smaller firms.\n\n6.They must be relatively unknown. Investors who recognize opportunities early have a substantial advantage.\n\nI also don’t use my usual 25% trailing stop in this portfolio.

{"title": "Taking out personal loan to buy 1-2 year leap covered calls while paying it back with regular income and cashing out or rolling over at expiration?", "selftext": "I recently turned 28 years old and have decided that I will basically have no life in 2024, 2025 and possibly 2026 in order to work 15-16 hour days everyday. I have been doing this for most of 2023 already so I know I can do it and I know how much it sucks. I am aware of the downsides of working this much but I figure short term hating your life is worth it if it means long term prosperity.\n\nI will be taking home $8k per month after taxes from work assuming I’m able to consistently get these hours week in and week out. The pay is consistent and predictable but there are variables. I probably net after all my personal expenses around $6-7k per month.\n\nI originally wanted to buy covered calls expiring 2 years out each month with my income, that way if it drops I can average down. But the problem with this is, it will take about 8-12 months before I get to about $50k worth and if the stock moves up then I’m screwed. I'm not worried about it dropping much to be honest.\n\nSo I thought why not take out a $25k 48 month loan, and make $3,000 monthly payments on it. But take the lump sum and buy into the position. That way I’m locked in. I would then use the remaining amount left from my income to continue to buy the same CC each month. To be honest, I probably wouldn't qualify for this type loan until mid to late 2024 which is when I expect my credit score to finally recover. I would do the plan discussed above until I can qualify for the loan.\n\nI’m looking at $coin. I don’t think C is going anywhere, and I think Coinbase is basically going to be the last man standing in the US. Also the premiums are ridiculous. I am not a C guy.\n\nI’m looking at airlines such as $aal, $ual, $dal, and $luv. Yes I know, airlines have been historically terrible investments but the US is basically consolidated and the industry is incredibly cyclical. Prices almost always begin to rise in anticipation for travel season and then drop after. Southwest is not going out of business for one. Only issue is the premiums though, they are really low. I think airlines will drop another 10% across the board which I guess will give me time to save up and accumulate.\n\nI'm also looking at banks and financial services companies such as $jpm, $bac, $gs, $c. I really like $jpm and $gs but they are still really expensive, I would want a 15% drop before I jump in. Traditional banks also don't have a bunch of premium either.\n\nI have included a list of some all the play's I am considering.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------\n\n$coin 150CC exp 2026. Premium $23, max profit $9,054 (152%), breakeven $59.46.\n\n$coin 100CC exp 2026. Premium $33.35, max profit $5,137 (105.6%), breakeven $48.63.\n\n$coin 80CC exp 2026.

Premium $11.525, max profit $1,214 (94%), breakeven $12.86.\n\nI have telling anyone who would listen that Affirm is a great stock to buy and swing. I thought the fair value around this time last year and throughout 2023 was $12.50. So the covered call having a breakeven around that price is great. The only risk I see is Apple encroaching and basically taking the market right from under them in the US market. Also Klarna steadily increasing their presence. Affirm stock is also incredibly volatile as I have learned and can and does easily move 2-5% daily, 10-20% weekly, and sometimes 30% within a month.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$sofi 10CC exp 2026. Premium $3.525, max profit $446 (80.5%), breakeven $5.54.\n\nSofi is a company I have been watching for years and have traded over the years. I think the company will probably hit $20 within the next 5-10 years but will most likely stay range bound between $5-12 within the next year or two.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$aal 12CC exp 2026. Premium $2.25, max profit $291 (32%), breakeven $9.09.\n\nEven during the depths of covid, $aa did not drop below $8 so I feel like the risk/reward is favorable compared to other airlines which are still significantly above covid low's.\n\n$luv 27.5CC exp 2026. Premium $7.85, max profit $566 (25.9%), breakeven $21.84.\n\nSouthwest is essentially at it's covid lows with more room to drop. I probably wouldn't touch this until it's around $25-26.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$rivn 25CC exp 2026. Premium $10.575, max profit $1,139 (83.68%), breakeven $13.61.\n\nI think Rivian will survive and will probably go on to get close to $50 within the next 5-10 years. I bought in at $12 and was waiting for it to hit $10 before jumping in but that did not happen, bottomed at $11.68 and I have regretted not getting in ever since.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$pltr 15CC exp 2026. Premium $6.325, max profit $599 (66%), breakeven $9.01.\n\nPalantir is a company that I think will survive. The government space is slow but has tremendous moats and longevity. Its commercial AI projects look promising but will most likely take 2-5 years to play out. At a $9 breakeven, the risk/reward is not bad.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$ttwo 140CC exp 2026. Premium $36.30, max profit $3,339 (31%), breakeven $106.61.\n\nThis is a play on my expectations for strong demand and sales for the new installment for GTA (Gran Theft Auto videogame). Only issue is that I think the stock could drop another $10-15 and the payout is really low, for 15% risk, I would want more money otherwise I'm better off dumping money into spy.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$spy 440CC exp 2026. Premium $71, max profit $6,763 (18%), breakeven $372.37.\n\nThis does not seem attractive at all considering how expensive the contract is, and that we are near 52 week highs and I expect a 10% drop at some point. But Spy margin requirements are incredibly low, the stock pays dividends, and simply owning shares could set me up for a low time.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$snow 160CC exp 2026. Premium $58, max profit $5,566 (53%), breakeven $104.34.\n\nI like Snowflake and it's got a sticky product that will last the next 10 years. Only probably I have is the price. I think this is a $130 stock that's currently trading for $160. Could also easily drop to sub or slightly below $100. Databricks if it IPO's will likely have better upside and risk/reward.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$mstr 340CC exp 2026. Premium $144.825, max profit $14,404 (74%), breakeven $195.96.\n\nI am a bit surprised the risk payout is not as great as you would imagine, only 74% considering this stock has a 90% margin maintence. This would be a pure C play but at only 74%, it seems coinbase a slightly safe play although not strictly C.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$meli 1,400CC exp 2026. Premium $435.50, max profit $43,884 (46%), breakeven $961.16.\n\nMeli is South America's Amazon. It is incredibly expensive but still growing. My concern is on price and would want to buy in if the stock drops to $1,000. It's currently trading just below $1,400. Also should a depend recession occur, the stock could easily cut in half but I don't see that happening. The margin maintence is 40% and I could buy one covered call per 8 to 12 months and just forget about it which would make life easier for me.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n$snap 10CC exp 2026. Premium $3.40, max profit $424 (73.6%), breakeven $5.76.\n\n$snap 15CC exp 2026. Premium $2.19, max profit $803 (115%), breakeven $6.97.\n\nSnap is not going anywhere in the short term and is generally a good swing trade. Leading up to earnings the stock has risen $2-3 for the last 3 quarters before dropping $2-4 each time immediately afterwards. ATM CC seem like a reasonable risk/reward but 15 strike seems pretty attractive. Worst comes to worst, Snap gets acquired probably for $15.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "16l85k0", "created_utc": 1694975233.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.29, "num_comments": 143, "comments": [{"body": "If you hate working 16 hours right now wait till you are working 16 hours to pay back a stupid 25k loan + interest for years after you took it out and lost it on a whim.\n\n\nDont take risks with money that isnt yours", "score": 117, "replies": [{"body": "I thought you were only supposed to take risks with money that isn’t yours", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "This is the way!

The 3 year loan is paid off in 1 year. But it locks me into the position. It saves me almost 5 months. Without the loan, if Coinbase stock shoots up past $100, well I'm stuck and my cost basis will be higher if I continue buying. I think $coins real value is somewhere between $50 to $150 per share. It's a big spread. This becomes even more riskier and important if I buy on margin but I have learned my lesson and don't want to repeat the mistake of buying on margin since I always time it wrong by buying too early.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "NOT even a single person on the thread has said this is a good idea.\n\nThink.
