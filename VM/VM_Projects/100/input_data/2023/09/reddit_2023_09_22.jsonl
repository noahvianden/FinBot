The average analyst eps consensus is pretty low compared to last year's number. We'd need to beat their estimate by 30% to keep our ttm earnings the same. If not, ttm earnings go down and PE gets even higher with a flat share price. If that trend doesn't reverse hard for q4, then we earned less this year than compared to last.

This would allow up-listing to NYSE / NASDAQ.\n\n**DATE** = November 27th, 2023 or before\n\n**2a)** **SAFE Banking Act** in the Senate which will allow financial services to work with Cannabis companies to get business loans and allow up-lisintg to NYSE / NASDAQ.\n\n**DATE** = Wednesnday, September 27th for the committee vote / Mark-up and then full \"Floor-Vote\" shortly after\n\n**2b)** **\"Garland Memo\"** to replace the former rescinded \"Cole Memo\" which gave guidance to Financial institutions and USA Cannabis companies could up-list to NYSE / NASDAQ on this alone.\n\n**DATE** = Anytime, although some people think it would be introduced along side of SAFE Banking Act.
