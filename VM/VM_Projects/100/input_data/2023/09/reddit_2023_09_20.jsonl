I also added $DIS into some of my friend‚Äôs portfolios since I‚Äôm gaining more confidence in their execution. I have not allocated any $DIS into the portfolio of my elderly friends/family.

I‚Äôm only up 11% on $BN year-to-date. But it doesn‚Äôt matter that the stock barely moved compared to the rest of asset management businesses such as $KKR because I actually want my businesses to have their stock price ‚Äúno change‚Äù while the business continues to execute so I can keep buying more for cheaper. You must know what you own otherwise you‚Äôll do foolish things ‚Äúif no change.‚Äù On another topic, if you don‚Äôt believe in a company that you bought, the worst thing you can do is wait for it to bounce up so you can sell at break-even. You don‚Äôt even believe in the company so why would you trust it will eventually bounce?
