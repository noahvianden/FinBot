In recent years bmw is increasingly moving away from sports/ performance cars towards more and more luxury cars, like limousine style vehicles and their SUV line up. Bmw actually introduced some new color and materials in their line up with a finish that rivals Mercedes. \nOn the other hand Tesla's cars especially on the higher end of the budget are also quite renounced nowadays - the model X and model Y are both huge cars rivaling the spaciousness of a GLE and the model S is comparable in dimensions to an amg bi turbo V8 sports coupé, might even be bigger. Now of course everyone always says \"but the build quality???\" And yes Tesla is not spending the same amount of money on the inside of the car as Mercedes is but a Mercedes with comparable stats dimension wise usually already runs you to at least 1.5 times the price and is the slight quality improvement on the inside really worth that amount of money ? And one could add that performance wise the race is not even close, Teslas do not have the best suspension granted but the handling of the cars are second to none, a model Y drives like an amg gt because of its low center of gravity, the electric motors enable an acceleration that is not comparable to combustion engines or any electric car Mercedes has on the road. The model S steps that performance gain up a notch and is really only rivaled by something like the rimac nevera (an electric hyper sports car that costs 20x the price of a model S). Tesla is still in a place where it rivals traditional car manufacturers.

Through that Mercedes had a large focus on near proximity data and sensors, there is a reason why every drive assistant in modern cars will not go a significantly higher speed than 130 km/h, that's because the faster the vehicle is the further down the road the car has so analyse to make good decisions, the complications grow exponentially with increasing speed and Mercedes had a lot of catching up to do when Tesla first rolled out their version of drive assist because Mercedes focused way havier on the comfort applications of drive assist like parking and lane keeping. \n3rd criticism where criticism is due, Tesla is far away from perfect and some claims made by them are way out of proportion. On the other hand Mercedes has also had their fair share of trouble with driving assist (reminder to Mercedes first iteration of emergency breaking ...)

They have risk to become a focal point of attack with additional mistakes, like what happened to target and bud. As a big brand, they have a lot of value to attack both because it will cause engagement, but also because it deters other brands if successful. \n\nI believe it is mostly about keeping childhood separate from the various activist topics that very popular on left Twitter.

There’s probably an opportunity for a competitor to do right of center kids programming or even ‘not left’ kids programming at this point. \n\nThis fits into a broader parental concern that large institutions (schools, corporations) want to do values education from a very early age on values that remain controversial (not just agreed upon societal basics like be nice to people, don’t steal, think about how others feel, etc), specifically very liberal post modernist views that emphasize gender, race and various grievances, teaching kids how to do political activism, and teaching current issues as doctrine rather than discussion topics. Most people tend to get along and didn’t raise a fuss, but it’s past a critical point, particularly in communities where conservative views can be shared, which is why Disney is oblivious to this (because you can’t really share those views there). I think Disney’s risk is very large on this because they aren’t risk managing much and have made editorial decisions that don’t seem like they would be profitable but do agitate non-left parents. I’m guessing the most senior execs know, but the creatives won’t be on board so it’s a very hard thing to manage.
