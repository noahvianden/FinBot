The bet hasn’t paid off.", "selftext": "Spotify’s $1 Billion Podcast Bet Turns Into a Serial Drama\n\nThe prospect of podcast riches led to aggressive investments in celebrity deals and original programming for what appeared a sky’s-the-limit media frontier  \nSpotify spent more than $1 billion to build a podcasting empire. It struck splashy deals with Kim Kardashian, the Obamas and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It paid $286 million for a pair of podcast studios and spent $250,000 and more an episode on exclusive shows to lure new listeners.  \nThe bet hasn’t paid off.   \nMost of its shows aren’t profitable, according to people familiar with the matter, and the company has recently cut staff and programming to slow its losses. The company, which has struggled to report consistent profits, lost €527 million, equivalent to about $565 million, in the six months ending in June, on €6.2 billion in revenue.   \nNo one in the business is making much money on podcasts, but Spotify, which has spent far more on the medium than its rivals, has more to lose than most. Spotify’s competitors, including Amazon, Apple and Google, tech behemoths with their own audiostreaming services, have other, more profitable businesses.  \nSource: https://www.wsj.com/business/media/spotify-podcast-gimlet-harry-meghan-kardashian-59866a5d", "id": "16as3pc", "created_utc": 1693929634.0, "score": 5600, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 1209, "comments": [{"body": "Really dumb idea to focus on a few splashy mainstream names.\n\nSuccessful podcast products cater to niche interests.

If they can’t show you display ads and monetize all of those programmatic placements, it’s a problem. \n\nPodcast ads take effort to create; don’t have a single unified platform through which they’re easy to access or where you can find true show demo details, which, in and of themselves, are hard to capture (there are tools out there but nothing quality on the native podcast platform side); are difficult to track; and, above all, are hitting an audience not necessarily in a buying mode. Commutes being killed for many over the last few years didn’t help either.
