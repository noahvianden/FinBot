The lower the PEG ratio, the more the stock may be undervalued given its future earnings expectations. Adding a company's expected growth into the ratio helps to adjust the result for companies that may have a high growth rate and a high P/E ratio.\r  \nAccording to legendary investor Peter Lynch, a company's price and expected growth denotes a fairly valued company, which typically is a PEG ratio of 1.0. When a company's PEG exceeds 1.0, it should be considered overvalued, while a good company with a PEG of less than 1.0 is considered undervalued.\r  \n**What Is Considered to Be a Good PEG Ratio?**\r  \nIn general, a good PEG ratio has a value lower than 1.0. PEG ratios greater than 1.0 are generally considered unfavorable, suggesting a stock is overvalued. Meanwhile, PEG ratios lower than 1.0 are considered better, indicating a stock is relatively undervalued.\r  \n**The Bottom Line**\r  \nWhile the P/E ratio is more commonly used by investors, the PEG ratio improves upon the P/E by incorporating earnings growth estimates.

What's most impressive is in the past couple of years, their costs are now rivaling in-house R&D costs for big Pharma, such that big Pharma has been contracting R&D to Ginkgo. Small projects for Ginkgo can take a few months, large projects for big customers (where the real value is) could take a few years. But this is an exponential play, because again, every project they work on adds to their codebase (IP) and makes future projects easier. \n\nBut to get an idea of some of their customers: Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck, Biogen, Moderna, Selecta Biosciences, Aldevron, Sumitomo Chemical, Givaudan, Cargill, Bayer, ADM, Corteva and lots of start ups in the biotech sector (in which they usually accept equity stakes with less cash up front), creating a long term biotech ETF essentially in Ginkgo. \n\nAnd then the other wing of their business - biosecurity, they pivoted with COVID impressively fast to get into schools across the U.S.A. for K-12 testing, making hundreds of millions with ~40% margins. The K-12 COVID testing has essentially ended now, but their long-term biosecurity business is beginning to bloom by getting contracts with a ~ dozen or so countries to monitor for pathogens and working directly with DARPA and IARPA in the U.S. government, which they've already been awarded federal contracts.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Shhhhhhh!
