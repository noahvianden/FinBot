I've seen some argue higher interest rates are better for the long term since it increases the hurdle rate for investments, leading to better capital allocation. When interest rates are 0, you get capital flowing to unproductive uses with possibly low ROIs, lowering long term GDP / productivity growth. \n\nBut the problem is what constitutes 'high interest' rates. Economists conceptualize a 'natural rate of interest,' and when the Federal Funds rate is above this theoretical quantity, policy is restrictive; when it is below it, policy is dovish. The natural rate can fluctuate over time. The natural rate is determined by factors like demographics, confidence to invest, global inflows/outflows of capital, etc.\n\nIn Japan post bubble crashing, for example, their natural rate fell quite a bit. So even near 0% interest rates were 'hawkish' and they saw deflation. In the US for many years the natural rate was likely quite low and the low federal funds rate wasn't insanely dovish. But now the natural rate is moving up so something like 3-4% interest might still be expansionary when 4 years ago it might have been extremely restrictive.\n\nSo perhaps the real claim is that a higher natural rate of interest is better, as that fundamentally reflects a strong economy / demographics. The hurdle rate is higher but that's fine since there is opportunities to meet that hurdle rate.

(Even if someone invests in a solar energy firm, without government support there's no guarantees that there will be sufficient buyers in a depressed economy).  Plus, people are scared and prefer to hoard cash rather than invest, even if money is essentially free.  This is the often-referenced liquidity trap.  0% nominal rates may even be a signal to the market that \"things are not well\", causing more hesitance.\n\nThis is why fiscal policy is important in these situations.  I think the USA and the West finally started to get the message what with the CHIPS Act, IRA, etc. These are welcome changes.  Furthermore, 0% rates may lead to \"evergreening\" of unproductive zombie firms, or misallocations of capital in general as you mentioned.  They may also inflate asset prices.

Complex life arose due to variation over time with constraints.  The constraints are the rules of reality.  \n\nAn AI would not need to be intelligent to make leaps and bounds toward an objective, but it DOES need a perfect or near-perfext feedback loop with reality.  \n\nIf an AI is going to design a rocket ship engine it needs to make the engine and fly a payload.  It cannot know for certain the behavior of that engine until it turns that engine on in reality.  That provides feedback that allows it to improve and iterate.\n\nUntil then, computers are only ever an abstraction, which only interact with reality through a separate abstraction of human intelligence, which clumsily interacts with reality through imperfect, slow flesh suits.\n\nAn AI could develop anything possible in our physical reality, even without general intelligence, if you were to give it a legion of robot bodies and a goal to achieve.  Because then it can use real world resources and test scenarios in reality to receive feedback and improve.\n\nOf course this is how we wind up with a paper clip factory scenario.
