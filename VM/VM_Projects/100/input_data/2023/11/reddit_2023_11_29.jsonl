{"title": "US economic growth for last quarter is revised up to a 5.2% annual rate", "selftext": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Shrugging off higher interest rates, America's consumers spent enough to help drive the economy to a brisk 5.2% annual pace from July through September, the government reported Wednesday in an upgrade from its previous estimate.\n\nThe government had previously estimated that the economy grew at a 4.9% annual rate last quarter.\n\nWednesday's second estimate of growth for the July-September quarter confirmed that the economy sharply accelerated from its 2.1% rate from April through June. It showed that the U.S. gross domestic product — the total output of goods and services — grew at its fastest quarterly rate in nearly two years.\n\nConsumer spending, the lifeblood of the economy, rose at a 3.6% annual rate from July through September — still healthy but a downgrade from the previous estimate of 4%. The economy also received a lift from companies building inventories in anticipation of future sales. Also driving the third quarter growth was an uptick in spending and investment by governments at all levels, federal, state and local.\n\nThe U.S. economy, the world's largest, has proved resilient even as the Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher interest rates have significantly increased consumer and business borrowing costs. But they have also helped ease inflationary pressures: Consumer prices rose 3.2% last month from 12 months earlier, a marked improvement from the 9.1% year-over-year inflation recorded in June 2022.\n\nThe U.S. job market is cooling from the red-hot levels of the past two years. But it's still healthy by historical standards: Employers are adding an average of 239,000 jobs a month this year. And the unemployment rate has come in below 4% for 21 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s.\n\nThe combination of easing inflation and resilient hiring has raised hopes the Fed can manage a so-called soft landing — raising rates just enough to cool the economy and tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economic-growth-last-quarter-133558430.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAaxSG3WR1-7mbPrJ9yyCC1cZUFNru2b4N5pYyb4RSQO_AC9pUKytnHAdXW5TCuCxBf820rYwtmIRyukCZ6r7wLwtck61m_EpXMAKKPM71gpvTHpeJdYuoDTSUGg-1bUzzDUy_r9vJLhfqukZ5Ifv2sOR5z7lqBvQMDPzS3YlU_-", "id": "186q0dv", "created_utc": 1701266346.0, "score": 400, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "Bears in shambles", "score": 164, "replies": [{"body": "But they won on Monday?", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "EYyY, wE GAtT ThE tAp PiCk, WeRE GaAAnNA bE Da NeW PaCKurSE!", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nowhere is safe", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Umm...

They’ve gone downhill.  The last 4 orders I made with them have all been screwed up:  delivering me 2 mid-range GPUs instead of 2 HDDs (I’ll take that deal if they could do that more often…), delivering me HDDs instead of SSDs, losing an order of RAM (likely on UPS but Newegg took weeks to get me a replacement even after they supposedly worked with UPS to investigate). \n\nAnd finally I ordered 2 2080ti GPUs when they were new at the time which UPS delivered to the wrong address.  Immediately opened a support case with Newegg to tell them UPS marked my order delivered but I didn’t have the GPUs so Newegg opened an investigation with UPS where the driver claimed they delivered the package but UPS mailed me a paper copy of the investigation which included a picture of where the truck was on Google Maps at the time of delivery along with that location’s address, a couple miles down the street.  Newegg essentially said tough luck, UPS delivered it (I guess fuck the address, that part doesn’t matter?) so they would not refund or replace.  So I filed a police report, gave them a copy of the UPS investigation and Newegg emails, and filed a chargeback on my credit card and gave them a copy of everything.  Rep I talked to for my credit card said that was one of the most egregious chargeback claims she’d gotten.  Newegg didn’t reply to the chargeback investigation so I got my money back by default but I don’t think they could’ve said anything to defend themselves.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Previously, there’s lot of rebates for those computers stuff, seems in last 8-9 years they all gone, what’s had happened?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Think manufacturers stops probably manufacture rebates is an older business model.
