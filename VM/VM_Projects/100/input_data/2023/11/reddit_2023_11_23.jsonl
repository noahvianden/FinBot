{"title": "VIX options strategy", "selftext": "Hi all\n\nJust want to run my VIX options strategy by the option experts.\n\nSo - I did some stats and found out that 80% of the time the VIX has been between 14 and 25 (over the time span that the VIX is available).\n\nSo, if I sell cash secured calls with strikes = 25 and cash secured puts = 14 (if available), I have a 80% chance to close the deal in my favor.\n\nSo, what is with the risks:\n\n* Spike crash (happens from time to time) --> VIX can go up to almost 90\n* Regular crash (we all know) - VIX will be between 25-40 for 2-3 months\n* Period with Vola > 25 of > 3 months --> happened from 2008-2009\n* Periods with Vola < 14\n\nHow to hedge:\n\n*  In any case a bear call hedge, i.e. selling a call at Strike = 25 and buying a call at 50, which will leave me with a risk of 25 --> so I need $2500 per trade in cash to be called cash secured, i.e. with a portfolio of 100k I could open 40 positions of that risk profile\n* I am experimenting with additional hedging like Long Calls/ Puts on the UVXY but this would be the topic of a different threat. \n\nMy experience so far (over a few months)\n\n* The difficulty of cause is if you need to roll in case your Short Call is ITM. However, this can be done w/o too much of a loss.\n* Annual win rate is 20-35% p.a.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nWhat additional risks do you see?

However, on the other 20% of the time that it is above 25, there is quite a large range where VIX can be between 30-40 and in some cases, greater than 60. If you sell the 25 strike and buy the 50 strike for peace of mind, one of the problems you will encounter is the large delta disparity between the two. The potential problem this would create is if the VIX does rise to say 35, the short call would increase way more than your longs would increase. This means that if you have to close it out, you would have to buy back for much more because the short 25 call would be deep ITM, while  your long 50 call would still be OTM if the VIX is at 35.  All of a sudden, it would cost you 3.00 to 4.00 to close out something you sold for 0.40 wiping out several months worth of gains. This can happen all across the different strikes so even if you stagger into different months, you would still suffer a large drawdown. In fact, the the options with more DTEs (further out) would be affected more since they are more sensitive to Vega. If you are selling credit spreads, you are short Vega. A rapid rise in the VIX and those positions would get destroyed because volatility would increase.  Another thing to consider is the theta. The position is originally theta positive if the VIX stays below a certain level.  If the VIX\ndoes rise to 35, the theta could shift to negative because that‚Äôs the nature of spreads. As the underlying goes through your short strike and closer to your longs, the theta could swing from positive to negative.  You now have a situation in your hands.  Do you close out now that the VIX is at 35 and take a loss or do you wait and hope for a retracement.  If you wait, the VIX can continue to rise which would compound your loss and put you deeper in the red.  In addition, you now have theta working against you (40 contacts would have a large negative theta) and you will lose money in each passing day.  Your $100k account could easily\nbe down $15-25k even on a non-black swan event.  If a black swan event were to occur like Covid, the VIX could very well go through your longs and you could be 50-60% in the red and your delta could be at -700 (negative) or higher.  This means a 1 point rise in VIX underlying (from 50 to 51 for example) and your position would be down $700. A 10 point rise (from 50 to 60) and you‚Äôre down another $7k.

So why should they not believe their own hype?  It's worked beautifully... for them.\n\nMore bad news is the fact that by overpaying and handing out golden tickets to any and every warm body who called themselves a creative, they inflamed a content inflation problem that's now eating them.  They set a bar so high, and it's a content spending level that their competitors Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon can easily spend, but which Netflix can't (sustainably). So now their costs are getting bid up by enterprises that can afford to lose money on streaming in perpetuity.  Netflix cannot.\n\nYou speak of paying down debt.  Netflix, despite their executives misleading claims of \"profit\" was technically heading for insolvency, but was rescued in the nick of time by the mother of all miracles in the form of a pandemic.  In terms of their business needs, it was perfect for them.  They fully saturated and pulled forward years worth of evolution and subscription.  \n\nBut notice that despite this windfall of all windfalls, they only made one super slender tiny token payment to debt during that bonanza.  \n\nAnd another problem that their fans and executives don't like to know or speak about is that much of their debt is rolling over between now and 2025, and it will have to be re-ssued at drastically higher rates than it has been.  \n\nI have strategies that are a bit less blunt in terms of just straight content cost slashing, but that's another discussion.  The key message is that Netflix has been hugely deceptive about their true total viability and \"profit\", and it's not quite the profitable juggernaught they imply.  \n\nThere is a path out of this, but the mindset and past behavior of their executives makes it questionable whether they'll clearly see the problem or the solutions.\n\n> I‚Äôm talking 70-90% temporary cut while focusing on a handful of content/new seasons for like 6-12 months.

However their account receivable has gone up to $8B from $3B in Q1 2023. (page 4-5)\n\nWhich means they have declared net income of approximately $5B this year which are \"account receivable\"\n\n> Accounts receivable refer to the outstanding invoices that a company has or the money that clients owe the company. The phrase refers to accounts that a business has the right to receive because it has delivered a product or service. \n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp\n\nTheir AR is increasing every quarter which means they are lending out their products to customers .\nAR is negative for Revenue Recognition Practices: This situation might raise questions about the company's revenue recognition practices. There could be concerns about whether the company is aggressively recognizing revenue without a firm basis for believing the receivables will be collected.\n\nSo what's happening: NVDA is handing out products on credit to customers. There is no guarantee the revenue will materialize especially if the product is given on credit to startups that fail.\n\n\nHistorical Precedents:\nDot-com Bubble: During the dot-com bubble, many companies reported high revenues but had equally high receivables. This was a red flag that revenues were being recognized aggressively without ensuring collectibility.\n\n\nMillion dollar question: Can you short it? NO.\n\nThe stock market is like a Quantum Mechanics. Observing it will change the outcome. That is, the stock market will ALWAYS move against retail bets. Do you feel like you are in a truman show where every play you make moves against you? That's because the stock market is designed algorithmically & psychologically against the herd. \n\nThe market news (almost 100% of them are owned by hedge funds) and all the technical signals exist just to gas light you into playing a position that is guaranteed to lose.\n\nThis is not exclusive to NVDA. A huge chunk of companies reporting have significantly higher Account Receivable in their earning reports pumping up their ER.\n\nBut there is nothing you I can do. \n\nIt's all just the same thing over and over; we can't help ourselves. And you and I can't control it, or stop it, or even slow it. Or even ever-so-slightly alter it. We just react. And we make a lot money if we get it right. And we get left by the side of the side of the road if we get it wrong. And there have always been and there always will be the same percentage of winners and losers. Happy foxes and sad sacks.
