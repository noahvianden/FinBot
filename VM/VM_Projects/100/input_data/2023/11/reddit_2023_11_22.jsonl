Elon Musk may be unconsciously biased against Jewish persons, but genuinely believes he is not antisemitic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWalter Isaacson describes a disturbingly similar pattern with Elon's father, Errol Musk.

Errol Musk further told Isaacson: \"I don't have anything against the Blacks, but they are just different from what I am\"\n* On *p. 469*, Isaacson describes a rambling, conspiracy laden Father's Day email from Errol to Elon, in which Errol writes that Black leaders in South Africa are anti-white, and that \"with no Whites here, the Blacks would go back to the trees.\"\n   * Errol's statement here is pretty obviously racist, despite Errol's prior claims that he isn't racist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's been my observation that Elon has many similarities to his father Errol, perhaps as the result of a combination of genetics and abusive upbringing.\n\nMy suspicion is that while Elon may actually not believe he is antisemitic, he could also have biases which are showing in his behavior on Twitter.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Personally, I believe in #1.
