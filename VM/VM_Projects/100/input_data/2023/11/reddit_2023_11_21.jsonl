{"title": "Ford to scale back plans for $3.5 billion Michigan battery plant as EV demand disappoints, labor costs rise", "selftext": "[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/21/ford-scales-back-ev-battery-plant-in-michigan.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/21/ford-scales-back-ev-battery-plant-in-michigan.html)\n\nFord Motor\r is scaling back plans for a $3.5 billion battery plant in Michigan as consumers move to electric vehicles more slowly than expected, labor costs rise and the company moves to cut costs.\r  \n\r  \nFord executives including CEO Jim Farley and Chair Bill Ford initially announced the facility in February. It quickly became a political target due to its connection to Chinese battery manufacturer Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., or CATL. The plant is a wholly-owned Ford subsidiary, but the U.S. automaker is licensing technology from CATL to produce new lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries for EVs.\r  \n\r  \nFord said Tuesday that it is cutting production capacity by roughly 43% to 20 gigawatt hours per year and reducing expected employment from 2,500 jobs to 1,700 jobs. The company declined to disclose how much less it would invest in the plant. Based on the reduced capacity, it would still be about a $2 billion investment.\r  \n\r  \nThe decision adds to a recent retreat from EVs by automakers globally. Demand for the vehicles is lower than expected due to higher costs and challenges with supply chains and battery technologies, among other issues.\r  \n\r  \nReductions at the Marshall, Michigan plant are part of Ford’s plans announced last month to cut or delay about $12 billion in previously announced EV investments. The company will also postpone construction of another electric vehicle battery plant in Kentucky.\n\n“We looked at all the factors. Those included demand and the expected growth for EVs, our business plans, our product cycle plans, the affordability and business to make sure we have we can make a sustainable business out of this plant,” Ford Chief Communications Officer Mark Truby said during a media briefing. “After assessing all that, we are now good to confirm that we’re moving forward with the plant, albeit in a slightly smaller size and scope than what we originally announced.”\r  \n\r  \nTruby said the plant is still expected to open in 2026, even though the company halted production of the facility for roughly two months during collective bargaining with the United Auto Workers. The talks ended last week as Ford-UAW employees ratified a deal that included significant wage increases and a path for battery workers at the plant to be included under the record agreement, if organized by the union.\r  \n\r  \nThe UAW did not immediately respond for a request for comment.\n\nIncreased labor costs factored into Ford’s decision to scale back the plans, according to Truby. Ford CFO John Lawler last month said the new deal would add $850 to $900 per vehicle assembled in labor costs.\r  \n\r  \nLawler declined to estimate how much the deal, which runs through April 2028, will cost the company. Deutsche Bank estimated the increase to be $6.2 billion during the terms of the deal.\r  \n\r  \n“We’re still very bullish on EVs and our EV strategy, but clearly, while there is growth, both in the U.S. and worldwide, clearly, the growth isn’t at the rate that that we and others had expected,” Truby said. “We’re trying to be smart about this and how we move forward.”\r  \n\r  \nThe plant has received political pushback from federal and local officials, including protests by residents in the rural Michigan city. U.S. lawmakers also have sought to review the licensing deal between Ford and CATL amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China.\r  \n\r  \nTruby reiterated Tuesday that the company still believes it’s better business for the company and U.S. to license the technology instead of importing batteries from overseas. The plant is expected to be the first in the U.S. to produce LFP batteries.\r  \n\r  \nLithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries the plant will produce are deployed instead of pricier lithium-ion or nickel cobalt manganese batteries, which Ford is currently using. The new batteries are expected to offer different benefits at a lower cost, allow Ford to increase EV production and profit margins.\r  \n\r  \nFord, which is currently sourcing LFP batteries from CATL, follows Tesla\r in using LFP batteries in a portion of its vehicles in part to reduce the amount of cobalt needed to make battery cells and high-voltage battery packs.\r  \n\r  \n", "id": "180l6ss", "created_utc": 1700584709.0, "score": 332, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 268, "comments": [{"body": "Maybe if you didn't have to wait 6 months to a year for a model of a car that you can't even test drive because the dealer doesn't have it on the lot people would be more likely to buy the EVs.

It was a rhetorical question.\n\nDon't tell me dealership aren't part of the problem. Go over to r/Ford or anything other Ford sub and go down a few post and you'll see the problems with dealerships. I also know because I worked at one for 5 years and have seen the issues first hand. Including buying a brand new 2017 Ford Focus RS in December of 2018 and had the finance lady send my loan application that I didn't fill out to 5 banks, when I was already approved with my bank. I watched my credit score drops from close to 800 down to mid 600s because they were all denied due to just buying a new car, debt to income ratio. She waiting to send them until after the loan with my bank was already on my credit. All while I worked there. And yes the people who keep buying these cars at ridiculous prices are also part of them. On top of that my orginal loan had to be canceled because the same lady doubled the amount of my trade. Then had to reapply, which also is not great for your credit. It looks like you just paid off a $40k loan and then took out another $40k loan days later. \n\nPlus my orginal comment isn't just entirely directed at you. So take it with a grain of salt. It is a combination of problems with wholesalers, people and dealerships. You obviously don't work at a dealership so you don't control or have a say in what they do. Wholesalers, dealership and people are all peices of the puzzle that makes the car market what it is.\n\nAnd the Maverick issues isn't just with the Mavericks. It has happened with Mustangs, Broncos, Rangers and even when the Focus RS came out, etc. A customer special orders a car. He/she selected all the features and colors to their liking. Dealership sees an opportunity to sell the vehicle to someone else for well over MSRP. Never once contacting the original buyer about anything at all, especially when the buyer is calling multiple times a week and keeps getting excuses. That is not okay, you just fucked over a customer and sold their car they special ordered to the highest bidder. This isn't a wholesaler cutting a deal on a newer or used car. It was special/customer ordered vehicle were only so many of those vehicles are alloted to dealers.\n\nWhen the RS came out, Ford wouldn't even allow the same color to be ordered until after an allotted time or so many other colors were sold. You could only have 4 or 5 RS orders in at one dealership. Especially in 2018 when they made a lot less and only in two colors. Some people ended up paying $20k+ over MSRP because some dealers were putting in fake orders, then saying the customer never picked it up. Ford corporate didn't like that very much because it gives the Ford company a bad name. Some Ford dealers were forced to either close their doors or sell it to someone else. The Ford dealer I worked at ended up having to shut down or be sold because the owner had so many red flags with warranty work and book issues. He sold it.\n\nEdit: You sound like a drug dealer saying you didn't make them take the drugs, I just supplied them. You don't get to just drop all accountable for your actions. I didn't stab him, I just held the knife while his body made contact with the knife and it just so happened it broke his skin.

Thanks for your contribution in regurgitating what was already discussed though. Not sure why you're so triggered by this? To you happen to be one of the people I'm referring to by chance? \n\nPlease define most dealers. Because every single dealer around me in a 3 hour and half hour drive was overflowing for awhile. Then when the chip shortage hit the new vehicles dwindled down and after a few months the used cars took their spots and the used car hype began.\n\nWhat does having to pay employees have anything to do with this discussion? It is not anyone's fault by your own for picking that job or career. Your employees can go find another job if they don't think they are getting paid well or fearful they might not be able to pay bills. It isn't a charity, it's a business. So because employees need to be paid, let's just fuck over customers? And your excuse is whelp I need to pay my employees so it's okay. Fuck outta here. Then what happens when word gets out your dealer continuously rips off customers and people stop buying from you? I have the perfect dealer for you to call and ask them why they now own it. \n\nOn top of all that do you even know how dealers pay their employees? Now before I go into this, some dealers are a bit different, I've worked at 3 of them. Sales are on a commission meaning the higher the price they sell a vehicle for means more money, techs are flat rate, 2 of the 3 paid even the lube techs on flat rate, finance gets a flat pay and then kick backs from the banks and the from the deal they did. Some places have the parts department also paid on a commission or a cheap hourly pay or a mix. Service advisors also are on commission or a salary. Sales is the lowest income for a dealer, techs and parts department make up majority of the income coming in at a dealer. A salesperson makes around $200 per new car sold, they make a percentage on the used cars sold. Sales job is to get vehicles on the road so the techs have work. Your job is to give the customer a welcoming experience so they bring their car back when it's broken. When techs have work, parts get replaced. The money techs bring in by working on vehicles can literally pay everyone working in that building. \n\nSo with all that said, the new/used vehicles slowing down does not hurt the dealer as much as you think. The only ones hurting would be sales, and if it got that bad the money parts and techs bring in would go to sales as a base pay. I live in an oil boom town and this happened before. When the boom died down in 15 and 16, the techs didn't have any problems with the amount of vehicles coming, it actually increased and we were already 3 months wait to just look at your vehicle. Parts also saw an increase in parts being sold. Sales/commercial was the only one effected. When you're in sales you are told to put money aside incase of a extended slowdown. It is not the dealers responsible to make sure your life choices are enough to pay your bills.\n\nUsing the excuse dealers need to pay their employees is a cop out and is an absolute ridiculous statement. You can have your opinion and make up whatever excuses you want to make yourself feel better on the matter, but you're not going to change my mind due to my own personal life experiences with not 1, not 2 but 3 dealerships. Actually if you count the Semi truck dealership it would be 4.\n\nAnyone that get triggered by this or wants to argue is more than likely a scummy sales person that makes excuses to justify and validate their actions.

However, suffering this massive decline, but manage to maintain positive, aka \\~50% growth as opposed to the usual 200% we see throughout this year, is still \"an offset\"\n\nThere's always dirt you can choose to talk about if you believe the outlook is negative.  Practically, I don't think they confidently stated that they would \"crush it\".  It seems to me they only said \"we will definitely remain positive in growth\".  \n\nHuge difference.\n\nThat said, I can never understand how their current situation works.  Like you said, their products are having orders piled up for years.  If all China's orders disappear, it really just means the orders behind them get moved up.
