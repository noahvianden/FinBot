He has been with Berkshire Hathaway for more than two decades, most recently overseeing the company’s energy holdings as the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.\n\nAbel first joined Berkshire Hathaway when the company acquired a controlling interest in MidAmerican in 1999, by which time Abel was the energy company’s president. He became CEO of MidAmerican in 2008 and the company later changed its name to Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Abel’s handling of matters reportedly impressed Walter Scott Jr., a shareholder in CalEnergy who also happens to be a childhood friend of Buffett’s and a member of Berkshire’s board of directors.\n\nWarren Buffett’s portfolio has seen an average annual return of 20.0% compared to the S&P 500’s 10.2% gain during the period from 19653. More than $249 billion of Berkshire Hathaway’s $335 billion of invested assets can be traced back to only five brand-name stocks. However, it’s important to note that despite above-average performance, there have been many years Berkshire underperformed the market and there have been many individual stock trades that have lost mountains of money.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Greg Abel himself recently purchased $24.6 million in Berkshire stock, increasing his stake in the company by about 30%. This shows his confidence in the company’s future prospects.\n\nRonald Olson, a Berkshire director since 1997, at an investing conference on Thursday said the company’s directors were satisfied that Abel - designated in 2021 as Buffett’s successor — has the ability to lead after the billionaire investing legend is no longer in charge.\n\nAbel has \"made very, very savvy investment decisions\" and will have a \"wide berth\" to continue once he takes the company’s helm, Olson said. Greg Abel, as the successor, brings his own strengths to the table, and it will be interesting to see how Berkshire Hathaway performs under his leadership.\n\n\"Greg will keep the culture,\" said executive vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway Charlie Munger, when discussing Berkshire's decentralized operating structure— this unprompted and candid declaration was a bit of a surprise, but the individual in question isn't.\n\nAbel had long been considered one of the front-running heirs apparent for CEO, along with his fellow board member Ajit Jain, Vice-Chair of Insurance Operations.\n\n**Ajit Jain's role at Berkshire Hathaway after Warren Buffett**\n\n**Ajit Jain, who is currently the Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations for Berkshire Hathaway**, will continue to play a significant role in the company after Warren Buffett. He has been with Berkshire Hathaway since 1986 and has made significant contributions to the company’s growth.\n\nJain heads Berkshire Hathaway’s reinsurance business, providing coverage against major catastrophes and generating tens of billions of dollars of premiums for Berkshire to invest. His work has been instrumental in the growth of Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance portfolio, which now accounts for a significant portion of the firm’s revenues.\n\nWhile it was suggested in the annual letter to shareholders in 2014 that both Jain and Greg Abel could be appropriate successors for Warren Buffett as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has confirmed that Greg Abel will be his successor. However, Jain’s role as the Vice Chairman of Insurance Operations is expected to remain crucial to Berkshire Hathaway’s operations and success.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "i doubt its gonna drop that much. investors of BRK know very well Warrne Buffet is not a young guy. \n\nIm not super familiar with the firm but im pretty certain they have a solid succession plan in place.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Should we be?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It will go up 15%.

A developer is always going to want to maximize profits, while a person contracting to build a home has other factors to decide.\n\nI could be wrong, but it ultimately comes down to the price of the land. If the land is cheap smaller homes are feasible for a profit. If the land is expensive it makes more sense to make the home bigger.

But if the same land is $150,000 now your 1000 sq/ft build is $305,000 making it feel like you are paying $305 sq/ft which is probably higher than other homes on the market you could move right into. Now you look at adding a second floor increasing your sq/ft by another 1k and it costs only 50% more to build at $232,500 + $150,000 for land and your total is $382,500. Divide that by 2k and you get what looks like $191 sq/ft for your home. So that's why you'll see old houses that are more modest in size next to a McMansion built recently.

{"title": "Bitcoin is going to the fucking moon.", "selftext": "Hello dumb fucks,\n\nI’ve been watching Bitcoin and the crypto sphere for quite some time now, I really do believe Bitcoin could see an exponential increase of value here soon. Here are my reasons being:\n\n1. Bitcoin is theoretically the best hedge against inflation. \n\n2. Current monetary assets are not backed by any real commodity. \n\n3. The theory behind Bitcoin and the idea of scarcity will be key to keeping this monetary asset as a highly valuable item. \n\n4. As the internet grows (and I believe it will grow even more within the next decade as we become more interdependent on the web and the innovation behind technology forcing us to keep up with current technological trends) will force us to think about buying commodities that will allow us to have leverage in transactions over the internet\n\n5. Optimism is growing. With the introduction of spot ETFs and the 4 year “halving”, this could realistically fuel a massive bull run as it creates a sense of panic for retail investors to start buying up Bitcoin commodities to not feel left out. \n\n6. The classic hype surrounding scarcity. As is the same idea with diamonds, gold, and birkins, the price point is driven higher with low supply and high demands.\n\n7.
