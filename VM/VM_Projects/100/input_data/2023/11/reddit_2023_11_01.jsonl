The lower EBIT was primarily driven by lower net pricing,* ***higher launch-related supplier costs****, as well as higher warranty,* ***engineering****, spending-related, and selling, general & administrative costs.*", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">Ford Model e‚Äôs second quarter 2023 EBIT loss was $1.1 billion, a $570 million higher loss than a year ago, with an EBIT margin of negative 58.9%. The lower EBIT was primarily driven by **lower net pricing**, higher launch-related supplier costs, as well as higher warranty, engineering, spending-related, and selling, general & administrative costs.\n\n**Edit: i just re-read your comment and realized the above statement was made in Q2 while i was under the impression it was in Q3. Nonetheless, i believe my statements below are still relevant as Q2 EV sales were significantly higher than Q1. On a wholesale basis Q1 EV sales were 12k, while in Q2 they were 34k. That said, in Q2 Ford actually raised the price of the lightning by $4k only to later drop it by $10k at the start of Q3. Also, margins actually improved in Q2 versus Q1 from -102% to -59%. But again, my assessment still stands. Nominal costs are higher and that's just a function of linear scaling. I'm sure however you'll find the same boilerplate in the Q3 statement about higher EBIT costs. Point is, the reason margins dropped is because  they cut prices and their EVs aren't profitable. Furthermore the impact of cutting prices has a greater negative impact on margins than scaling production and associated costs.**\n\nOkay here's the thing though.\n\nFirst of all, we don't know by how much each of these different things impacted their financials, all we know is many of them are higher in Q3 than Q2.\n\nBut we do know that Ford's production/sales was up in Q3 versus Q2.\n\nIn Q2 retail EV sales were 14,843 but wholesale was 34,000.\n\nIn Q3 retail EV sales were 20,962 and wholesale was 36,000.\n\nI believe it's safe to assume some of these negative impacts scale linearly with production and sales.\n\nOf the ones listed above, i imagine \"launch-related supplier costs\" (whatever that means), \"warranty\", \"spending-related\", and \"SG&A\" all scale linearly with production/sales. I'm not sure about \"engineering\" as Ford isn't clear about what that means, nor is Ford clear about the definition of some of these other items - so it's really difficult to understand how they're impacting the financials.\n\nBut, assuming they do scale with production and sales, even if whole sales figures (which is what is reported on their financials), is up just 2,000 units QoQ, or just +6%, and if the associated costs with all of these is proportional (meaning +6%) then Ford's statement is technically true.\n\nBUT\n\nFord's EBIT margins went from -59% in Q2 to -75% in Q3.\n\nIf you'd like to explain to me how a +6% increase in the above line items has such an impact on EBIT margins, i'm all ears.\n\nHowever, there's one other line item that impacted margins which does not have a linear relationship with sales - at least not in Q3.\n\nAnd that item is \"**lower net pricing**\". For whatever reason you chose to focus on all the other items seemingly ignoring this one, which is in my opinion, the most important.\n\nWhat we also know is that Ford cut prices on the Mach E around $3-4,000 (representing about 6% of the price) and between $6-10,000 on the Lightning (or 6%-15%).\n\nAnd EBIT margins were SIGNIFCIANTLY lower in Q3 following these price cuts which occured late in Q2 DESPITE flattish QoQ volumes.\n\nIn my opinion, that means most of the negative margin impact QoQ was the result of the price cuts.\n\nAnd nothing you presented really provides any evidence to suggest that Ford isn't losing tens of thousands of dollars on every EV they sell.\n\nIs it $30,000 or $20,000 or just $10,000? Who knows. Ford doesn't want investors to know. And if they don't want investors to know it's probably because the results aren't good.\n\nI mean come on, if Ford's EV margins were anywehere near positive why wouldn't they break them out from all the other crap? If they were good they would be. They would be highlighting them and talking about them, but they aren't. In fact i suspect they're worse than they seem.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if all that other bullshit yolu mentioned isn't somehow improving the margin optics, otherwise why are they lumping it all together like that?

[In early February of 2023 Ford shutdown the Mach-E production factory](https://insideevs.com/news/565684/ford-mache-production-suspended-mexico/) citing \"chip supply constraints\", [only to re-open it a month later stating production capacity was doubled to 200,000 annually.](https://www.macheforum.com/site/threads/ford-increasing-mach-e-production-in-response-to-strong-customer-demand.26569/)\n\nSo logically one would assume that the 22,000 whole sale EV increase QoQ was mostly driven by Mach-E.\n\nAnd what happened to EBIT margins in this quarter? Well they miraculously improved to -59%. Still terrible, but less terrible than Q1.\n\nThrough simple deductive reasoning, this implies Mach-E margins are better than -59% while Lightning Margins are probably worse than -102%.\n\nHowever, it doesn't end here.\n\n[In mid July 2023 Ford cut prices on the Lightning by $10,000. That's AFTER they had raised prices on the Lightning by $4,000 in March](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a44564936/2023-ford-f-150-lightning-price-cuts/) which likely helped improve their margins over Q1.[This follows similar price cuts in May for the Mach-E between $1,000-$4,000.](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/02/business/ford-mach-e-price-cut/index.html)\n\nLo and behold Q3 results come in and Ford shows a mere 3,503 Lightning sales retail. Down nearly 1,000 units QoQ, approx 25%.\n\n[For the whole quarter Ford sold just 20,962 EVs total](https://insideevs.com/news/689912/us-ford-sales-bevs-2023q3/), while reporting 36,000 wholesale.\n\nThe Lightning represented 16.7% of retail sales, and 9.7% of wholesale.\n\nUnsurprisingly, due to the price cuts and despite a larger (presumed) % of Mach-E sales, margins tanked to -75% in the third quarter.\n\nSo what can we deduce from all of this?\n\nWell for one Ford had confidently stated earlier in the year that by the end of 2023 EV margins would near breakeven. This was based on the assumption production and sales would more ramp to more than 600k annually, or 150k quarterly.\n\nFord is no where near those numbers.\n\nSo it stands to reason any margin advantage Ford was counting on from economies of scale is not fully realized.\n\nBut Ford also had to cut the price of the Mach-E by at least 6% on average since they made that statement. They also had to cut prices on the Lightning between 6-15%.\n\nTherefore the EBIT margin on Mach-E is -6% to -10% at BEST.\n\nConsidering Mach-E production/sales are at least 3x that of Ford's other EVs, the implication is that Lightning (and/or E-Transit) margins are significantly worse than the reported -75% in Q3. That's just how the math works out.\n\nPersonally, i'm satisfied with my research and confident with my conclusions.\n\nIt's clear to me that Lightning margins are worse than Mach-E as evidenced above. From that we can look at the average margins and make a pretty good educated guess as to where they land.\n\nI have a good enough approximation of Ford's Lightning, and other EV, margins to know that they're terrible and not getting better any time soon.\n\nThe difference between you and me is, i don't need Ford to tell me their margins are shit.

Two components some might be missing:\n\nFirst, many individuals/companies bought second, third, or even more homes to use as AirBNBs.\n\nSecond, there are a significant number of homes owned by hedge funds.\n\nLet me be clear - This won't affect anyone's ability to pay their mortgage who wishes to continue doing so.\n\nNow here is where it gets tricky - IF the economy slows, and people stop paying for trips, then AirBNB owners will have to start selling their homes, which will push prices lower. There are already signs that this is happening. People who bought homes at sky-high prices are having trouble covering the mortgage due to less rental income.\n\nNow, couple this with large $ investors - who have gobbled up homes in the past few years, expecting gains of 10% plus. Remember, these hedge funds cannot simply sit on homes appreciating 2-3% a year. You can make more on your money buying 100% safe treasuries - which is still not a feasible profit margin for a hedge fund.\n\nHedge funds have to earn double digit returns to justify the fees (look them up - they are significant) that they charge investors. They will begin selling the homes they have to recognize some of the gains. There are data to indicate this is already beginning.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin is jobs. But not in the way most people think!\n\nJob mobility is a critical component of our economy. Just consider how many people move every year to take a new, better paying job. That is going to become much harder if a homeowner is selling a home at 4% rates and moving to a new area and buying at 8%.\n\nThat prospective employee is going to require a much higher salary to justify making the move.
