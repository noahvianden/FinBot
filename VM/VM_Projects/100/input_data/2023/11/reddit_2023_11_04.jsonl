Now we’re going to organize like we’ve never organized before.”\n\nDoing so would greatly assist the union’s bargaining efforts and membership, which has been nearly halved from roughly 700,000 members in 2001 to 383,000 at the beginning of this year. UAW membership peaked at 1.5 million in 1979.\n\nThe UAW has previously failed to organize foreign-based automakers in the U.S. Most recently, plants with Volkswagen\nand Nissan Motor fell short of the support needed to unionize. The UAW has previously discussed organizing Tesla’s Fremont plant in California with little to no traction in those efforts.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the recent efforts are gaining traction at any other automakers, but Fain has vowed to move beyond the “Big Three” — Ford, GM and Stellantis — and expand to the “Big Five or Big Six” by the time its 4½-year contracts with the Detroit automakers expire in April 2028.\n\nThe deals include 25% wage increases that would boost top pay to more than $40 an hour, reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments, enhanced profit-sharing payments and other significant pay, healthcare and workplace benefits. The contracts must still be ratified.\n\nThe union has already received significant interest from non-union automakers in light of the tentative agreements, Fain said. And last month, he rejected comments from Ford Chair Bill Ford arguing the company and union should be working together to battle non-American automakers.\n\n“Workers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda, and others are not the enemy — they’re the UAW members of the future,” Fain said. \n\n**Toyota**\n\nFain has taken particular aim at Toyota in recent days.\n\nThe automaker earlier this week confirmed plans to hike wages at its U.S. factories. The new rates would see hourly manufacturing employees at top rates in Kentucky receive roughly 9% pay increases to $34.80 an hour.\n\nFain on Thursday called that pay raise “the UAW bump,” joking that UAW stands for “U Are Welcome” to join the union’s movement. \n\n“Toyota isn’t giving out raises out of the goodness of their heart,” Fain said. “They could have just as easily raised wages a month ago or a year ago. They did it now because the company knows we’re coming for ’em.”\n\nToyota, which has 49,000 hourly and salaried U.S. workers, said the “decision to unionize is ultimately made by our team members.”\n\n“By engaging in honest, two-way communication about what’s happening in the company, we aim to foster positive morale which ultimately leads to increased productivity,” the company said Friday in an emailed statement. “Working together has provided a history of stable employment and income for our team members.”\n\n**Tesla**\n\nThe UAW has so far not been able to establish enough support to force an organizing vote at Tesla’s facilities, including its Fremont, California, plant where the union previously represented workers when it was a GM-Toyota joint venture.\n\nFain on Thursday told Bloomberg News he believes organizing Tesla and taking on CEO Elon Musk is “doable.”\n\n“We can beat anybody,” Fain told Bloomberg. “It’s gonna come down to the people that work for him deciding if they want their fair share... or if they want him to fly himself to outer space at their expense.”\n\nStill, Musk has historically clashed with union proponents.\n\nAs some workers sought to form a union at the company’s Fremont factory in in 2017 and 2018, Tesla was paying a consultancy named MWW PR to monitor employees in a Facebook group and on social media more broadly, as CNBC previously reported.\n\nTesla also terminated the employment of a union activist named Richard Ortiz in 2017. And in 2018, Musk said in a tweet, “Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing?”\n\nThe tweet violated federal labor laws, the National Labor Relations Board later found.\n\nAn administrative court ordered Tesla to reinstate Ortiz and to have Musk delete his tweet, which it concluded had threatened workers’ compensation. Tesla appealed the ruling, and Musk’s offending post remains on the social media platform which Musk now owns, has rebranded as X and runs as CTO and executive chairman.\n\nIn February, a different group of organizers filed a complaint with the NLRB claiming that Tesla had fired more than 30 employees at its Buffalo facility in retaliation for a union push there by Tesla Workers United. Tesla called the workers’ allegations false, saying 4% of its Autopilot data labeling team in Buffalo had been terminated due to performance issues.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws against workplace discrimination, sued Tesla in September, alleging widespread racist harassment of Black workers, and retaliation against those who spoke out.\n\nAnd in late October, just over 100 of Tesla’s service employees in Sweden, members of the industrial labor group IF Metall, walked off the job for a short strike. Hundreds of mechanics and technicians at non-Tesla shops also agreed not to repair any of the EV makers’ cars in solidarity. However, Tesla has so far refused to negotiate with IF Metall.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "id": "17nk0yf", "created_utc": 1699098733.0, "score": 203, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 184, "comments": [{"body": "That’s gonna be tough given Tesla is non-union and the employees are given Tesla shares.", "score": 132, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla, Honda, and Toyota.  \n  \nActually throw all the transplants in there.

Of course there are really good teachers who might help the smart kids be even smarter or pull up some percentage of the struggling kids. But, shockingly, the average teacher is quite average. Unfortunately, a large segment of the American population is treated like human garbage, and this gets reinforced in the schools, and then those kids grow up to have kids who are also unprepared for school.

{"title": "To no one’s surprise, GM’s Cruise has been lying about their driverless tech capabilities for years. Calls on FSD.", "selftext": "For anyone unaware, as of last week Cruise has indefinitely halted all of their driverless robotaxis nationwide after a slew of issues (accidents, blocking emergency service workers, parking in front of fire hydrants, unsafe driving near pedestrians) culminated in one of their cars running over a woman and dragging her body for 20 feet before stopping.\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/gms-cruise-halts-self-driving-operations-regulator-safety-fears/\n\nThis comes on the heels of their promise for rapid expansion across the US from the apparent “success” of their pilot programs. \n\nNow that investigators are involved, we’re seeing how deep of a scam they were running to convince people they were market leaders in autonomous driving. \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/03/technology/cruise-general-motors-self-driving-cars.html\n\n> Half of Cruise’s 400 cars were in San Francisco when the driverless operations were stopped. Those vehicles were supported by a vast operations staff, with 1.5 workers per vehicle. The workers intervened to assist the company’s vehicles every 2.5 to five miles, according to two people familiar with is operations. In other words, they frequently had to do something to remotely control a car after receiving a cellular signal that it was having problems.\n\nIn essence, Cruise’s “autonomous vehicles” required remote assistance from a human to take control every 2-5 miles. On average, that means human pilots were required multiple times per passenger trip. That’s a fairly stark difference from what they were reporting a few years ago, where they claimed each car could drive 12,000+ miles before the autonomous system needed to be disengaged:\n\nhttps://www.ttnews.com/articles/new-autonomous-mileage-reports-are-out-data-meaningful\n\nGM has already dumped $10B+ into Cruise, and it seems fairly apparent the company’s tech is on par with Nikola rolling their EV truck down a hill (who were oddly enough yet another shoddy GM partner lol..). While Waymo is still operating at present, their vehicles have been reportedly experiencing many of the same issues. Regulators have lost trust in this tech, and will be rolling out stricter requirements and oversight. \n\nWhat’s the play? Tesla FSD imo is going to be what most of legacy auto turns to. They’ve banked more than 1000x the number of road hours of every other driverless company combined. Their accidents and incidents per mile are a fraction of a fraction of what Waymo and Cruise are reporting. I’m only holding shares, as we’re still many years away from nation-wide autonomous cars imo. But this news is concrete proof of what many have been speculating for years. These “L4” autonomous driving companies are full of it. They’re glorified trains on virtual tracks that are constantly being remotely operated by humans.\n\nLong puts on GM are also probably a smart move at this point.", "id": "17nz4bo", "created_utc": 1699141955.0, "score": 414, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 188, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|496|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17nz4bo/to_no_ones_surprise_gms_cruise_has_been_lying/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: -GM's Cruise autonomous vehicle subsidiary has been caught running a massive scam, with their \"autonomous\" vehicles requiring human intervention every 2-5 miles.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think all these fsd companies should train in south asian roads like India.
