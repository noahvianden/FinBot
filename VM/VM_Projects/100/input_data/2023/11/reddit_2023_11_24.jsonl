Assuming they don't give up on those intentions, the rescheduled meeting might presumably try to shock oil up again.

We're many years into doomsayers saying consumer bankruptcy monster is around every corner, and they are continually wrong.  The main thing to keep your eye on is jobs.  Everyone has a job and a job offer and they've had a raise or they're getting a raise.  Most of the economic boogeymen in life can be defeated by having a good job.  Cereal costs more?  My job will pay for it.  Gasoline up?  My raise more than covers it.  Credit card payment?  Spouse just got a promotion so it's not actually a big deal, despite a lot of public handwringing.\n\nWhen the job market starts to fail, that's when you can start being concerned.  \n\nThat said, there's tons of job economy stimulus happening now and in 2024.  So I think that could revive or prolong inflation.  But as mentioned before, I don't sweat over inflation.
