{"title": "Regarded math on why EVERYONE should be focused on TTWO", "selftext": "Background Information:\nTTWO Market Cap = 24 Billion\nTTWO biggest franchise? GTA (Previous game release was 10 years ago GTA 5 @ 265 million development cost)\nNext GTA release - within 2-3 years with 2 billion in development/ marketing projected costs\n\nThis is a guaranteed 3-10X play, GTA 5 sold 185 million units all together and let’s say that the average customer lifetime value was $60. Okay. That puts GTA 5 at about 11.1 Billion in revenue.\n\nNow keep in mind the following factors that have changed the gaming/investing landscape since 2013. We have had a fuck ton of inflation (more buk) , the console gaming demographic is older (most of us were kids in 2013), and let’s not forget the fact that GTA 6 will have a female protagonist so that opens up a whole new consumer demographic for the next GTA instalment. Now for the last juiciest TITTY stiffening fact, micro-transactions, when GTA 5 released it was during a time in which micro-transactions were not the norm and now pretty much every game has it. With a game as influential that GTA 6 is going to be and considering the above factors I think it’s safe to assume that a lot more units will be sold and there will be a much higher lifetime customer value on the game.\n\nSo let’s do some simple math.\n\nProjected 350 MILLION copies sold at $200 lifetime value, that is 70 billion dollars in revenue.\n\nTheir market cap is 24 billion… let that sink in.
