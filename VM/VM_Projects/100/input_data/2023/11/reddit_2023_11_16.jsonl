For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&P 500's market cap.** \n\nThe 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. \n\nMost analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. \n\nNow I know this is a \"stocks\" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.\n\nSo I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.\n\nShould we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future.

But popularity can be a dangerous thing when it comes to stocks...\n\n**How long to very popular stock groups like the Nifty fifty, FAANG, and Magnificent 7 usually lead the border stock market?**\r  \n\r  \nThe duration for which popular stock groups like the Nifty Fifty, FAANG, and Magnificent 7 lead the broader stock market can vary significantly and is influenced by numerous factors. These include the overall economic climate, the specific performance of the companies within these groups, and broader trends in their respective industries.\r  \n\r  \n**The Nifty Fifty**, for example, was a term used in the 1960s and 1970s to refer to 50 popular large-cap stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. These stocks were considered “blue-chip” stocks and were credited with propelling the bull market of the early 1970s. However, their subsequent crash and underperformance through the early 1980s serve as a reminder of the potential risks associated with over-reliance on a select group of stocks.\r  \n\r  \n**The FAANG stocks** (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google) have been influential in the stock market since the mid-2010s. By the end of 2019, these stocks accounted for about 14.4% of the market capitalization of the S&P 500. However, the concentration of the S&P 500 in these stocks has also raised concerns about the index’s vulnerability to the performance of these few companies.\r  \n\r  \n**The Magnificent 7** (Amazon, Apple, Google (Alphabet), Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) have been driving the US market’s outperformance in recent years. As of September 26, 2023, these seven stocks accounted for 26% of the weight in the STOXX US index. The STOXX US Index is a market cap weighted index designed to represent the performance of the Large and Mid-Cap companies from US covering approximately 85% of investable market capitalization. STOXX US Index is suitable for global investment products which include mutual funds, exchange traded funds, and derivatives and can also be used for further building block approach strategies when appropriate. The Magnificent 7 performance has been remarkable, with Nvidia leading the pack with a 232,000% increase, followed by Tesla with a 170,000% increase. However, this concentration is also seen as a risk, as it makes the market susceptible to the performance of these few stocks.\r  \n\r  \n**Magnificent 7 stocks weight in Nasdaq 100, and in S&P 500**\r  \n\r  \nThe Magnificent 7 stocks, which include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta Platforms, and Tesla, have a significant presence in both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 indices.\r  \n\r  \n**In the Nasdaq 100:**\r  \n\r  \nAs of July 2023, the Magnificent 7 stocks accounted for more than half of the index’s weight.\r  \nA special rebalance was triggered when all the Nasdaq 100 stocks with individual 4.5% market value weights collectively accounted for 48% or more of the index. On July 3, 2023, six of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla) accounted for 50.9% of the Nasdaq. After the rebalance, Meta Platforms’ weight in the Nasdaq 100 actually rose slightly.\r  \n\r  \n**In the S&P 500:**\r  \n\r  \nAs of September 2023, **the Magnificent 7 stocks made up 28% of the S&P 500 Index and contributed almost 65% of the S&P 500 Index’s year-to-date returns.** As of October 2023, the Magnificent 7 were responsible for nearly all the S&P 500’s gains. By the end of 2023, the Magnificent 7 constituted 29.4% of the S&P 500’s total market cap. Please note that these percentages can fluctuate over time due to changes in the market values of these companies and the overall indices. Just these 7 companies are carrying the S&P 500 in 2023.\r  \n\r  \nWhile these groups of stocks can lead the market for several years, their dominance is not permanent and can shift due to various factors.

The US CPI uses a flawed method to calculate the cost of healthcare insurance. Most reasonable regards will use the health premiums that you pay monthly or biweekly. BUT not the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)! Because if you use that, according to this article, premiums went up about 7% YoY based on Kaiser.

But if I am an older boomer who uses $10,000 of hospital services, then I “only” pay $14,000 in healthcare costs. Note in this example, the premiums remain the same. Using these dumb@ss methods, BLS claimed that they overestimated healthcare costs by 37% during the pandemic when everything was shut down. No one could use any healthcare services! And that they need to subtract 4% from the healthcare cost every month from September 2022 to September 2023 to smooth out the calculation.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BS](https://preview.redd.it/rrlet6m0pl0c1.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=e76b0f0d45a054de1cc6c11aab663aa3a65802c6)\n\n \n\nObviously, this is BS and the charts from wolfstreet.com show this manipulation.

But for trickle down economics to work, basic premise is that there is untapped demand. What happens when you as the business owner don’t feel so confident in the demand potential? Will you still continue to invest or move resources to safer havens? \n\nThe most basic premise of capitalism is maximum utilization of resources. Not optimal, but maximum. So if it’s human labor, a capitalist business model will try to derive maximum out of it. If it’s money, a capitalist business model will invest money where there is better returns. And this is mostly never in the case of investing more to increase production or giving higher wages. In fact historically there has not been any substantial examples of workers getting higher wages when the trickle down economics made a windfall for the business. So clearly trickle down doesn’t work sufficiently enough even in case of medium and small businesses. You as a business owner may be an exception and I am not doubting your intent, but at macro level the policy has always been a failure. \n\nAlso, at large business level where tax exemptions can run in to multiple hundreds of millions, do you genuinely think these giant corporations are going to increase wages when they receive giant handouts from the government? \n\nTake any example. United airlines and other major carriers during Covid. Ford and other large automakers during the same period. Banks during 2008-2009 crisis. Did they pass on the benefits of trickle down economic policies to their workers? Answer is a resounding No. They took the money and on top of it negotiated lower wages with workers. And those wages have not gone back to pre-Covid levels even though the companies are making record profits. \n\nSo, trickle down economics is fine as a way of creating more wealth for the rich, if that’s the stated aim.

As do I, but specifically because China would never let NIO go bankrupt 😆 \n\nHello, this is Bing. Thank you for your question. 😊\n\nThis is a very interesting topic to discuss, as both NIO and RIVN are competing in the fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) market. However, they have different strengths and weaknesses, and face different challenges and opportunities.\n\nNIO is a Chinese EV company that has been operating since 2014. It mainly focuses on the premium segment of the market, offering SUVs and sedans with advanced technology and design. NIO also provides innovative services to its customers, such as battery swapping, mobile charging, and autonomous driving. NIO has a strong presence in China, the largest EV market in the world, and has recently expanded to Europe. NIO has delivered more than 300,000 vehicles as of October 2023, and has a loyal and engaged customer base. NIO's revenue in 2022 was 49.3 billion yuan (US$7.1 billion), up 36% from 2021. NIO's net loss in 2022 was 14.6 billion yuan (US$2.1 billion), down 37% from 2021. NIO's market cap as of November 2023 is 11 billion US dollars¹²³.\n\nRIVN is a US EV company that was founded in 2009. It specializes in producing electric pickup trucks and SUVs, as well as electric delivery vans for Amazon. RIVN aims to appeal to adventurous and eco-conscious consumers who value performance, utility, and sustainability. RIVN has a state-of-the-art factory in Illinois, and has secured partnerships with Amazon, Ford, and Cox Automotive. RIVN started delivering its vehicles in September 2023, and has received more than 100,000 pre-orders for its products. RIVN's revenue in 2022 was 1.1 billion US dollars, up from zero in 2021. RIVN's net loss in 2022 was 2.8 billion US dollars, up 75% from 2021. RIVN's market cap as of November 2023 is 16 billion US dollars⁴⁵⁶.\n\nBased on these facts, it is hard to say which company will go bankrupt first, as they both have their advantages and disadvantages. However, some possible factors that could affect their future prospects are:\n\n- The EV market is growing rapidly, but also becoming more competitive and diverse. Both NIO and RIVN will have to face increasing pressure from established automakers, such as Tesla, Volkswagen, Toyota, and Hyundai, as well as new entrants, such as Lucid, Polestar, and XPeng. They will have to differentiate themselves by offering superior products, services, and customer experiences, as well as maintaining cost efficiency and profitability.\n\n- The EV market is also influenced by various external factors, such as government policies, consumer preferences, environmental issues, and technological innovations. Both NIO and RIVN will have to adapt to changing regulations, incentives, standards, and expectations in different regions and markets. They will also have to invest in research and development, innovation, and quality improvement, as well as address potential challenges, such as battery supply, charging infrastructure, safety, and cybersecurity.\n\n- The EV market is also subject to uncertainty and volatility, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and its economic and social impacts. Both NIO and RIVN will have to cope with potential disruptions, such as supply chain issues, production delays, demand fluctuations, and customer retention. They will also have to manage their cash flow, debt, and liquidity, as well as their investor and stakeholder relations.\n\nIn conclusion, both NIO and RIVN are ambitious and promising EV companies, but they also face significant risks and uncertainties. It is difficult to predict which one will go bankrupt first, as it depends on many factors and scenarios.\n\nHowever, based on their current financial performance and market position, I would say that RIVN has a higher chance of going bankrupt first, as it has a higher net loss, a lower revenue, and a lower delivery volume than NIO. RIVN also has a higher valuation than NIO, which could make it more vulnerable to market corrections and investor sentiment. However, this is just my opinion, and I could be wrong. I hope you found this answer helpful and informative. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. 😊\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 11/16/2023\n\n(1) Quarterly Results | NIO Inc.. https://ir.nio.com/financials/quarterly-results.\n\n(2) NIO Inc.

I dont think they are going into the red because of it either, that means their margins were huge.  \n\n>\\- Price of electricity is currently quite supressed, if all electric the power needed would be more than double, imagine the elecrticity power reaction to that.\n\nWhy do you say that price of electricity is supressed?  I am pretty sure it is at market prices.  We can absorb a huge increase in power usage without having to build up infrastructure because most will be charging at night when power usage is lowest.  Power companies have to build out for peak usage and then all their generators sit idle overnight.  If you balance the load you make money 24 hours a day instead of 12-16.  This is a huge boon for power companies. As long as they have time to prepare for the increase it is not a problem for them and would not increase prices significantly.\n\n>\\- It´s yet to be seen that they´re better for the environment overall, particularly if electricity to power them isn´t.\n\nThere are many studies that show that they are much better for the environment especial wrt C02 emissions.  there is a small up front increase but over the life of the vehicle it is not even close.  This is true even if you were to use coal to power them, simply because large power plants can approach 60% efficiency while an Ice car struggles to beat 30%.  That said most places have at least some nuclear and renewables as part of the mix which means zero co2 emissions and an even lower overall impact.  Even more importantly as the grid gets greener the whole transportation sector gets greener without any further intervention.\n\n>\\- Maintenance being low is actually a hughe problem for the long term business model.\n\nfor the dealerships yes, the sooner they go away the better\n\n>\\- It´s not so clear that maintenance is actually lower, we´ll have to wait a bit:[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/hertz-pulls-back-on-ev-plans-citing-tesla-price-cuts-repair-costs.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/hertz-pulls-back-on-ev-plans-citing-tesla-price-cuts-repair-costs.html)\n\nrepair costs and planned maintenance are two very different things\n\n>I mean, they might take over, I´m not a fundamentalist either way, it´s just not totally clear to me yet..\n\nI thought the EV was going to be difficult to live with and I would have anxiety all the time, I was surprised how easy it was to get into the habit of always charging at home and how annoying going to a gas station is now (with my second car).

I'm not saying the answer is \"nothing\" but the scope of the problem is bigger than that.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I guess it depends, a local government can either have no power, or not enough power if it is a small enough polity. Think towns of under 10,000. For the most part they’d need additional political assistance from the next level of government (State) to provide the stimulus needed to provide that incentive to corporations or businesses to consider an area for development and growth opportunities. This can be as simple as “hey we have a large unemployed population here ripe to work!” to “we have tax benefits for X amount of time for you to come here and do business”, with the intent that they hopefully stay after that timeframe and continue to do business while providing tax dollars from their revenue. What a lot, and I mean a lot, of states do to mess this up is get into a bidding war with these companies until the tax benefit is usually “you pay no taxes for 10+ years.” This is done down to the local level, which doesn’t really benefit them should that company move its business after the timeframe. Beyond a light economic stimulus to the local community in the form of wages, which is way smaller than the potential tax base. \n\nA city as large as Chicago has a LOT more bargaining power, as it already has a lot of people interested in doing business within it, primarily in its downtown financial district and some of its industrial parks. Providing Jobs to the denizens of Chicago and tax dollars for its public works programs. The problem being I think Chicago has been laying on its laurels for some time, and as a result have not done the same level of outreach for all its borrows. Rather it keeps upholding some areas of the city, while ignoring or doing the bare minimum for others. It’s a common flaw with large cities that the work tends to hyper focus on keeping industry/businesses that are in core districts which benefit the wealthy over trying to develop new sectors into more prosperous lower income ones. Yea you get the tax base for the core sectors, which can often support larger swaths of the city, but others will suffer if given time to atrophy or if economic issues from outside crumble the development attempts in others. It’s why you see so much development in say, Detroit’s urban center, while there are massive swaths of dead industrial infrastructure just rotting outside the downtown area. Not enough has been done to revitalize which is really hurting the little burbs on the outskirts. \n\nTLDR; It depends on the city and its negotiating power. Bigger ones have more, like Chicago, and have more leeway to attempt to obtain tax dollars to benefit public programs in the form of industrial/economic development on the micro scale. Greater Macro economics say state or nation wide will impact it, and it is the local government’s responsibility to weather these changes and mitigate damage. This trickles up and eventually can lead to a healthier economic polity in my opinion. Aka, I’m basically the reverse of Regan. It’s not rich people that make jobs more possible, it’s local governments creating opportunities for people to be successful with their investments which provides the chance to grow a healthy middle economic strata. Big money can help, but something as simple as incentive to buy and develop land can really change the landscape of a local economy. Which feeds the state economy and ultimately the national economy.
