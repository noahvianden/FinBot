{"title": "Apple beats estimates thanks to iPhone and services, but records fourth consecutive quarterly sales decline", "selftext": "[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)\n\nApple\r  \n reported fourth fiscal quarter earnings on Thursday that beat analyst expectations for sales and earnings per share, but revealed that overall sales fell for the fourth quarter in a row. Every hardware business outside the iPhone declined year-over-year, with big drops in the iPad and Mac segments. \r  \n\r  \nApple highlighted stronger-than-expected 16% growth in its online services division to make up for weakness in hardware sales.  \r  \n\r  \nApple shares fell less than 1% in extended trading.\r  \n\r  \nHere’s how Apple did, versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations: \r  \n\r  \nEPS: $1.46 per share, versus $1.39 per share expected \r  \nRevenue: $89.50 billion, versus $89.28 billion expected \r  \niPhone revenue: $43.81 billion, versus $43.81 billion expected \r  \nMac revenue: $7.61 billion versus $8.63 billion expected \r  \niPad revenue: $6.44 billion, versus $6.07 billion expected \r  \nWearables revenue: $9.32 billion, versus $9.43 billion expected \r  \nServices revenue: $22.31 billion, versus $21.35 billion expected \r  \nGross margin: 45.2% versus 44.5% expected \r  \nApple didn’t give formal guidance, but CFO Luca Maestri usually provides data points on the earnings call. Analysts are looking for $122.98 billion in revenue for the December quarter, which would be a return to year-over-year growth in Apple’s most important quarter.  \r  \n\r  \nNet income was $22.96 billion, versus $20.72 billion in net income a year ago. For Apple’s entire fiscal year, it reported $383.29 billion in sales, down about 3% from Apple’s fiscal 2022. Quarterly revenue declined less than 1% in the September quarter. \r  \n\r  \nThe company’s iPhone sales were in line with Wall Street expectations and increased more than 2% from last year. It was the only hardware line for Apple to show growth in the quarter, and the period only included about a week of iPhone 15 sales.  \r  \n\r  \nApple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that the iPhone 15 was doing better than the iPhone 14 did during the September quarter last year.  \r  \n\r  \n“If you look at iPhone 15 for that period of time and compare it to iPhone 14 for the same time in the year-ago quarter, iPhone 15 did better than iPhone 14,” Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach. He added that Apple’s more expensive Pro and Pro Max iPhones were supply constrained because of high demand.  \r  \n\r  \nApple’s Mac and iPad businesses both suffered during the quarter. Maestri, Apple’s CFO, had warned on a call with analysts after third-quarter results that iPad and Mac sales would fall by double-digit percentages. \r  \n\r  \nMac sales came in below Wall Street expectations, falling nearly 34% on an annual basis. Apple held an unusual nighttime launch event for its new MacBook Pro laptops and iMac desktop last month. While sales of the new devices aren’t included in the quarter, Apple was signaling that new products could boost sales once again thanks to its new M3 chips. \r  \n\r  \nCook told CNBC that the Mac comparison is to “an all-time record” fourth quarter, which followed a huge supply disruption and pushed what would have been third-quarter sales into the last quarter of 2022. “So, the comparison point here is very difficult,” he said. \r  \n\r  \n“I think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter. We’ve got the M3, we’ve got the new products, and we don’t have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said, referring to an unusually strong market for Macs in 2022.  \r  \n\r  \nCook said that that overall market for personal computers is “challenging.” \r  \n\r  \nRevenue from iPads was also down big, declining 10% from the same period last year. Apple did not announce new products ahead of the holiday season this year.  \r  \n\r  \nApple’s services business was a bright spot. Apple recorded $22.31 billion in services revenue, outpacing analyst expectations and increasing over 16% on an annual basis.  \r  \n\r  \nApple’s services division includes online subscriptions like iCloud storage and Apple Music, as well as warranties from AppleCare. A big chunk of Apple’s services business comes from its deal with Google for the default search engine on Apple’s browser, Safari, which has been highlighted in recent weeks as part of the Department of Justice antitrust case against Google. That payment to Apple is worth an estimated $19 billion this year. \r  \n\r  \nCook said services components including App Store sales, advertising (including the Google deal), iCloud, payment services, and Apple Music did well in the quarter and hit an internal Apple record, signaling continued growth. \r  \n\r  \n“Every main service hit a record,” Cook said.  \r  \n\r  \nMaestri also noted in a statement that Apple’s installed base of devices, or the number of iPhones, Macs, and iPads currently in active use, reached an all-time high during the quarter, although Apple did not give an exact number. Analysts say that growth in Apple’s installed base signals future growth in its services division.  \r  \n\r  \nCook said that Apple had over a billion paid subscriptions, which include both Apple’s own services as well as apps on the App Store that bill on a recurring basis.  \r  \n\r  \nApple’s wearables business unit includes headphones like the company’s AirPods as well as Apple Watch sales. It, too, shrank year-over-year, dropping over 3% on an annual basis.  \r  \n\r  \nApple’s business in Greater China, its third largest market, is under the microscope as investors worry about increased competition from Huawei. Greater China sales were basically flat year-over-year, and Apple reported $15.08 billion from the region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.  \r  \n\r  \nApple said it would pay a dividend of 24 cents per share this month and said the company had spent $25 billion during the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.

Ads were (barely) relevant for cable/DTH TV since they used to buy content from 3rd parties and paid pspm (per subscriber per month), so ads revenues were slightly more profitable (per unit) than subscription revenues. I’m saying slightly because TV used to have narcotraffic-like direct margins (think about 70-80% on subscriptions). However, usually ads accounted for 10% of revenues, subscriptions for 80%-90%. Also, considering Netflix doesn’t buy a lot of premium content anymore, they don’t have high pspm costs for content on subscriptions revenues. They are, and always will be, prioritizing subscriptions over ads, and that’s not even close.\n\nSo, considering they don’t give a flying fuck about ads, why are they launching ads-supported products? Just one word: DUMPING. Netflix has been dumping the content/TV industry for years. Do you remember when you paid 9.99$ for a shitload of content, and thought “those motherfuckers cable companies are ripping me off?” Well, Netflix was burning cash as much as my wife’s boyfriend is burning condoms, and they used to do that knowingly, just to put cable companies out of the market, planning to raise prices once they achieved that. That’s dumping, and they were able to do that because of low interest rates. They knew from the beginning that they needed to get in the 16-20$ range for their product to be sustainable (which, unsurprisingly, is not far off from what cable asked for the same type of content…). However, these continuous price rises left a part of the market unwilling to pay (and Netflix tiering before introducing ads sucked big time). Hence, to squeeze that lower tier of the market they launched the ads supported product (also, it gave them something to reduce costs per acquisition and upsell customers at a later time, another thing we hated from traditional cable…). But again, their priority isn’t getting more customers to a less profitable product, no one likes catering to the poors.\n\nSource: 10+ years being an executive in the pay tv industry", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "“Executive in pay TV” = Filming your wife and her boyfriend for her OF.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "That’s the side gig.

{"title": "\"Why did the Dot Com bubble burst?\"", "selftext": "\" It’s always difficult to identify a single catalyst that causes the bursting of an asset bubble, but in the case of the internet bubble, two factors seem to have played at least some part in the industry’s rapid decline, which began after the tech-heavy [Nasdaq composite](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/n/nasdaq-composite) peaked on March 10th, 2000.\n\nThe first factor was rising interest rates. The [Federal Reserve](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/federal-reserve) raised the [fed funds rate](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/fed-funds-rate) (which informs most other interest rates) several times over the course of the years 1999 and 2000. Higher interest rates tend to motivate investors to move money out of more speculative assets (like internet company stocks) and into interest-paying assets like bonds.\n\nThe second factor was the onset of a [recession](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/r/recession) in Japan in March of 2000. News of this recession spread fast and led to a wave of fear that triggered a worldwide selloff, moving even more money out of speculative equities and into safer, fixed-income instruments like bonds.\"\n\n**HMMM, it really seems like this is exactly what's happening now. The FED is going to increase interest rates, which will kill startups. The venture capital will dry up when investors realize that bonds are safer than the stock market. Earnings only look good right now because of inflation, and sky high PE ratios will soar on bad earnings. Hedges will switch strategy to shorting the market once they realize there is more money to be made off of puts than on calls. China is already hitting major economic turmoil which will have global effects. Consumers will not have any money to spend on goods because they all have 20% car loans and 9% mortgages, and their 500 dollar student loan payments just resumed.

The decision changes as the inputs change, and you can make this more and more complicated for increasingly distinct outcomes.\n\nYou can see this in games like Tic Tac Toe, which have simple rules, and it's simple to model \"intelligent\" behavior in a machine that plays the game... And then compare that to a game like Chess, which requires significantly more inputs to make intelligent decisions.\n\nThe other dimension of modern AI is predictive capabilities - giving a machine the ability to *predict* an outcome according to statistical probabilities based on some input. For example, if I said \"Bah bah black _____\", a machine that has been trained on a hundred million hours of people talking might predict that \"sheep\" is the most likely word to fill in the blank with 90% likelihood.\n\nHow does that translate to the real world?\n\nWell, AI in one form or another has been commonplace for the last thirty years - you just don't know it because it's not sexy.\n\nDocument understanding, sentiment analysis, speech to text, GPS navigation, actuarial loan procedsors, web search, etc - all are forms of AI, just with a different name. It's a running joke in our field that \"We'll have AI when we can do X!\", only for us to develop the ability to do \"X\" and move the goalpost.\n\nThis current iteration of that is \"Generative AI\" - which is admittedly an amazingly powerful innovation. Generative AI literally just means AI that fabricates some output according to an input - it \"creates\" something out of thin air. And personally, I thought we were still 10-20 years away from the first commercially viable tool.\n\nThe major difference between ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, etc and previous attempts is that these tools are actually *useful*, even if they're far from perfect. \n\nWhat's it good for? Well, we're still figuring that out. Right now, intelligent note taking and virtual assistants are proving useful, and in the art domain, smart fill in Photoshop that lets you \"make up\" something that fills a gap has been quite useful.\n\nYou have to remember, we're in the *very early stages* here. It's not too dissimilar to the first Ford Model-T - nothing is inherently NEW about the technology (engines had been around for decades), but it was the first \"consumer ready\" device. People derided the vehicle because \"it's unreliable, we have horses, why not take a street car\", etc... But just twenty years later, cars had passed all of those hurdles, and a century later cars would be so commonplace and integral in our economy that it would make someone from the 20's head explode. \n\nFrom a computer scientist's perspective, all behavior in our world can be mathematically modeled...although we sometimes struggle to understand how complex such a model may need to be. But as compute power increases, as our ability to compile databases improves, the reliability of generative AI will only improve.\n\nBoth I and my mom are computer scientists - she worked in linguistics and natural language processing, I work in AI and automation. She's joked with me before that the technologies we're working with today are roughly identical to what they were fiddling with in the 80s... the difference is that we have hundreds of orders of magnitude more compute power than they did.\n\nThus, bet on NVidia - the modern graphics card era has done more to democratize AI development than any other technological innovation.\n\nBet on Microsoft, because they are figuring out how to package generative AI into a useful tool for Windows machines.\n\nBet on Adobe, because the ability to artificially insert \"images\" in a photo are going to put a lot of digital artists out of a job. \n\nIt's the Model-T era of AI integration, it's only going to get more sophisticated from here.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I ain't reading all that, but I'm happy for you, or sorry that happened", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That's why you're in /r/wallstreetbets", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "TLDR: blah blah...something...it's all smoke and mirrors right now but it won't be.

{"title": "Time to Bet it All on Apple Earnings 🍎", "selftext": "Gang, earnings saga continues and AAPL is stepping into the earnings today, after-hours. The Wall Street crystal ball is predicting a slight glow-up in earnings to $1.39 a share from last year's $1.29, despite expecting a tiny dip in revenue to $89.28B from $90.15B. That's about a 1% slip.\n\nAAPL shares are showing off an impressive 32.5% gain this year, riding the high on dope tech and that globally-desired fruit logo. But even with those gains, analysts are side-eyeing AAPL's growth and are thirsty for those numbers to start climbing again.\n\nWe're all ears on the current quarter – it's the jolly season, so you know it's gotta be good, right? Apple hasn't offered official guidance since 2020, but their money man Maestri might drop some breadcrumbs for us. Hopefully. \n\n**What I'll be paying attention to**\n\nBy far, the most important part of the Apple story is still the iPhone, their golden geese - bagging nearly half the sales last quarter even with a slight 2.4% drop to $39.67B. Apple launched new iPhones in September with a lighter, redesigned titanium body, a longer telephoto lens, and a USB-C charging port. So we’ll get our first insight into demand for the new 15's. AAPL's been hyping up their iPhone game, promising a sprint from last quarter with around 49 million of those shiny new toys shipped. While they haven't offered official revenue guidance in several quarters, I'll be looking to hear any directional guidance into year-over-year revenue growth in the iPhone, as well as any disclosures regarding sales at the end of September and into October. Per the latest [Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-smartphone-market-Q3-2023), Apple’s market share was 17% in third-quarter 2023, lagging Samsung’s 20%.\n\nArtificial intelligence remains a priority across technology earnings reports. I believe Apple will be keen to promote its AI advancements within existing products but will likely keep its future AI ambitions close to the vest. We need to further understand Apple’s AI efforts in more detail, and see how that might be a revenue driver in the future. \n\nServices are the next leg of meaningful growth for Apple. I still view services as a bit of a lagging indicator, as many of these services are coupled with earlier purchases of Apple hardware. This still isn’t a bad thing, however, as these services create stickiness to the iOS ecosystem, which underpins Apple’s wide moat. In addition to iPhone revenue, I'll be interested to hear any commentary around services, particularly with some macroeconomic concerns and the financial health of consumers worldwide. Even as the Google trial in Washington DC highlights how much of that is from Google paying Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones, and puts that reportedly $19 billion per year deal at risk over antitrust. Apple is expected to report $21.42 billion in services revenue, offsetting some weak hardware revenue, and which would be an 11% year-over-year increase.\n\nNow, Macs and iPads might not have everyone's attention this quarter, people are expecting to see a bit of a slump from last year's high. Apple's been straight-up about expecting a \"double-digit\" percent nosedive there, blaming difficult comparisons to a good quarter in 2022 when sales popped after prior supply issues. That's definitely not good. Apple executives could focus on the fact it just released new MacBooks with chips on Oct. 30 with new chips to stoke more interest?\n\nThe mood among analysts, especially in regard to expectations for the fourth quarter, is changing. [Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-woodring-3a739722/) says that there are four forces working against Apple in the December quarter: An unfavorable comparison, a strong dollar, iPhone supply issues, and a cautious consumer.\n\n“Sentiment has turned more challenging for shares of Apple in recent days with increasing concerns around the lower demand for the iPhone 15 Series in China, as well as lackluster consumer spending momentum globally,” wrote [JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samik-chatterjee-94896518/) earlier this week in a note to investors.\n\n**China**\n\nOne data point from a market research firm [tracking smartphone sales](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/18/apple-iphone-15-sales-look-like-theyre-starting-off-slow-in-china.html) suggested that iPhone 15 sales started off slow in China this year. Uh oh. I'm worried that renewed competition from Huawei in China could be making the iPhone less competitive in the company’s third-largest market. It could show up in Apple’s future guidance.\n\n“Apple does have a China problem. I think when it comes to the phone, my sense is it’s going to be soft in China for the Sept. quarter,” [Deepwater Asset Management founder Gene Munster said earlier this week.](https://twitter.com/LastCallCNBC/status/1719140526497140978)\n\nThere’s some disagreement among analysts whether the Huawei competition is a temporary or permanent factor for Apple.\n\n“Importantly, we believe the data suggests increased competition from Huawei in China is likely to be a headwind next year,” Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang wrote in a note last month.\n\nBut like, we all kinda know that the new premium Huawei device is pretty much technologically inferior.\n\n“We expect Huawei-related pressure on iPhone to be temporary and moderate into FY24 due to significantly outdated chipset on the Mate 60 series,” he continued.\n\nThroughout the quarter, buzz from the financial grapevine, specifically a piece from the Wall Street Journal, spotlighted China's play to ditch foreign tech within government walls. This move turned heads on Wall Street, sparking chatter about Apple's shifting stars in the East and fanning the flames over whether a surge in national pride or looming regulatory storms might have Chinese customers giving Apple the cold shoulder.\n\n“With Huawei’s unexpected launch of Mate 60 Pro and Chinese government’s ban of using foreign phones for government workers, iPhone market share in China has been a big concern for investors,” wrote [Citi analyst A. Malik].\n\n**Global iPhone Sales**\n\nIn other regions, investors want to know if the iPhone 15 is selling like hotcakes, or if it’s not moving off store shelves as fast as previous years. Analysts call the strength of any given year’s iPhone sales the “cycle.”\n\n“We are in the camp that [iPhone 15] is not a good cycle on demand weakness and elongation of replacement cycles,” [Barclays analyst Tim Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-long-34b7481a/) wrote.\n\nWhile analysts track ship times on Apple’s website and third-party estimates for iPhone sales, there’s no substitute for color from Apple CEO Tim Cook or sales numbers, either from the week or so the iPhone 15 was on sale in September or through its unofficial guidance for the December quarter.\n\nAnother factor is that some analysts are pointing to supply constraints on some iPhones, particularly the higher-end and more expensive “Pro” models which could push some sales out of the December quarter and into the January quarter.\n\n“However, we are more cautious on the December quarter given iPhone supply shortages and uneven consumer spending, and believe Apple will guide to a revenue range that is both below normal seasonality and consensus expectations,” wrote Woodring, the Morgan Stanley guy mentioned earlier.\n\n**Price targets?**\n\nThere are quite a few analysts who are long term bullish on the stock. \n\n* [Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives](https://www.wedbush.com/analysts/daniel-ives/) reiterated an Outperform rating with a price target of $240 on Nov. 1, 2023. \n\n* [Evercore Group analyst Amit Daryanani](https://www.evercore.com/bios/amit-daryanani/) reiterated an Outperform rating with a price target of $210 on Sept. 28, 2023.\n\n* [UBS analyst David Vogt](https://stockanalysis.com/analysts/david-vogt/) reiterated a Neutral rating with a price target of $190 on Sept. 27, 2023. \n\nBut others not so much\n\n* [BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wamsimohan/) reiterated a Neutral rating with a price target of $173 on Oct. 24, 2023. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 77%.\n\n* [Barclays analyst Tim Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-long-34b7481a/) maintained an Equal-Weight rating and cut the price target from $167 to $166 on Oct. 30, 2023. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 70%.\n\nAll of these analysts are reported to have an accuracy of over 70%. \n\n**What to do for Earnings**\n\nI hate to say it, but given what I've read, it seems like Apple won't be doing too hot. That being said, it's tough to predict a direction when all the professional analysts are fairly 50/50 on the matter. I'm pretty sure last time I did an Apple play, I just got a straddle and ended up being 30% in the profit. However, historically, the company doesn't even move that much with earnings. We're looking at an average of 4.9%. I'd be lying if puts didn't look appealing right now. However, just as a lotto, I'm going to grab some AAPL 11/3 170p at about 80 bucks a pop. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too.

And its not just because of corporations.\n\nSince the 1960s-1980s, housing development is at 1/10th -1/15th of the rate of those years. With the cost of materials rising as well as many more requirements to adhere to building codes, and requirements to acquire permits, which can take upwards of 6-12months or more to get. Housing development is coming to a standstill as developers cannot cover the cost of materials as their profit margins are becoming very low thus making the projects put on hold which has resulted in about 2/3rds of all current building projects to be paused.\n\nThe average contractor is also gone up from around mid 20s to late 30s early 40s... There just aren't enough new people coming into the business. There is a huge demand for housing and in general the public supports things liek government housing and developments, until the government housing is in their own neighborhood then they vote for the party that doesn't support government housing. \n\nAs well as around 60% of all home ownership is by self-owners, who are using the increased values of their properties to re-mortgage and finance their lifestyles. Buy investment properties and use funds to finance their other projects. 20% are corporations and 20% and secondary homes as investment properties. The 20% of corporations also include homeowners who incorporate to buy and manage multiple investment properties.\n\nThey all vote to maintain and increase the values of their own properties, they have no incentive to lessen the value of their properties. They know the market is unachievable for the masses, but if the choice is between allowing their properties to lose value to allow younger generations a foot in the door to buy properties, vs maintaining and increasing property values and worsening the economic standing of future generations, they are in masse chosing the latter.\n\nin 2022 only 105M voters voted. Over 148M did not vote. Only 1 out of 5 eligible voters under the age of 35 voted. in some states only 15% of those under the age of 35 voted. If you want to change the direction of the country and you want to make a future that is livable for not only our kids but their kids and their kids, then i emplore you to sign up and register to vote. Because getting 60 senators isnt a far unachievable goal, just 800K votes in 2020 over 3 states, where 25M eligible voters didnt vote, would have given democrats 5 more senators, and would have stopped 90% of the bullshit that mancin and sinema did to water down bills and stop bills. It would also had removed the ongoing fight against womens rights to choose over their own bodies. and the current boogeyman culture war that republicans are pushing. In states where democrats have achieved enough seats, like minnesota, they are implementing, rent control, paid parental leave, ban on corporate buying of rental properties, food for school children, paid sick days. and many more things.

With the increase of supply, comes the increase of demand which leads to more production and more profit. We are not in a time of great unemployment, we have the highest employed population ever in modern history with highest production rate.\n\n> You keep growing the population and thus exponentially increasing housing demand over decades of urbanization, concentration in major metropolitan areas, and even having high rises and small apartments only draws in more people… so of course this means increased competition for housing and roommates and whole immigrant families pool money to bid for a single housing unit, and thus skyrocketing housing costs since many will join bids to pay.\n\nHousing costs have risen even in non-urbanized concentrated major metropolitan areas. NOT just because there are more people, but because there isnt enough supply being made. Youre not having people of 4-10 years olds looking for new housing. You have housing developers looking at strictly major metropolitan building projects as they are more profitable than single home builds in the suburbs or 1-2 hours away from working areas. \n\nMajor concentrated urban buildings are also fairly new in comparison but housing has been a issue for a while now. its not a long-standing issue because the growth of us population has been increasing every decade. Lower supply, lower amount of housing builds, more cost, more restrictions, more zoning laws, leads to higher cost in housing. And homeowners do not want to change that.\n\n> Then to deflect from this population growth issue, people blame capitalism and racism. Even though if exponential population growth was that awesome for themselves and their economies, countries with over-population problems wouldn’t keep trying to get people to leave, but would instead fight to keep them.\n\nWho brought racism into this? .... \n\nAnyways, capitalism is the concentration of wealth into one subsection of population because they have created and pushed the system to funnel money in that direction. Regulations and laws are meant to prevent that and ensure that population and the system receives a steady balance that benefit all.\n\nIF your point of overpopulation and immigration were the primary reason for these increases then those would be reflected as less/no cost increase in population that have remained steady and safe, but evidence proves that to be false.\n\nNo country wants their citizens to leave, but when you have corrupt governments and systems where people cannot feed themselves or fear for their lives or their families lives, then they will want to immigrate. Just like americans now are looking to immigrate to europe as they provide a safer place to live. And also because you want to maximize your chance of prosperity. If you knew you had a chance to earn 10-100x more in another country and be safe and have access to a life you cannot achieve where you are, would you just say \"Oh well i was born here so i will die here poor and hungry no matter what opportunities lay elsewhere?\" \n\nOne thing anti-immigration and overpopulation people always forget, increase in demand means opportunity for supply. If profitability was there, then supply would be easily met and provided. Its not like the massive boon of the 50s happened in a vacuum, as if population stayed the same since the 1900s.
