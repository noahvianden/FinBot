{"title": "Barron's - \"What Recession? Consumers Still Have Plenty to Spend.\"", "selftext": ">*A resilient labor market and healthy household finances should keep a recession at bay, even if the postpandemic spending boom loses a bit of its vigor.*\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/recession-consumer-spending-4223572c?mod=hp_LEAD_1\n\nAfter two years of sustained spending, rising interest rates, and punishing inflation, American consumers are still on a roll. Consumer outlays account for about 70% of the U.S. economy, and the Covid-era spending spree has kept gross domestic product on a path of surprisingly strong growth. Real GDP grew nearly 5% in the third quarter, according to early estimates, the best showing since the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAfter two years of sustained spending, rising interest rates, and punishing inflation, American consumers are still on a roll. Consumer outlays account for about 70% of the U.S. economy, and the Covid-era spending spree has kept gross domestic product on a path of surprisingly strong growth. Real GDP grew nearly 5% in the third quarter, according to early estimates, the best showing since the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nThe spending boom is bound to lose some vigor as savings erode and higher rates bite: Real personal-consumption expenditures are on track to rise 2.2% this year, according to FactSet estimates, below last year’s 2.5% growth rate and 8.4% growth in 2021. Yet relatively healthy household finances, a resilient labor market, and substantial housing wealth suggest that consumers still have plenty of firepower and that the U.S. economy will avoid a recession next year.\n\n“The consumer has the potential to keep the U.S. economy afloat for quite some time,” says Olu Sonola, head of U.S. regional economics at Fitch Ratings.\n\n**Still Spending**\n\nConsumer spending has moderated from the highs of the Covid pandemic era, but remains healthy.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1bx8M\n\n**Jobs and Spending**\n\nA healthy labor market has been the driving force behind consumer spending, including a 3.1% annual jump in retail sales\n\nin the past three months. With the unemployment rate at 3.9%, near historic lows, the majority of working-age Americans are earning regular paychecks. “Consumers are spending so much because of what’s happening in the labor market,” says Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, which first hit the U.S. in February 2020, sent much of the economy into a tailspin, including the labor market. Yet in 2021, with Covid vaccines on the market and government stimulus flowing, growth in nonfarm payrolls exploded upward to average a gain of 605,000 a month. \n\nAlthough job growth slowed last year to a monthly average gain of 399,000, that was still more than three times the estimated level of 100,000 monthly gains needed to keep the economy on an even keel. Job growth has normalized further this year, but remains elevated at a three-month moving average of 204,000 as of October.\n\nJob openings, meanwhile, are still elevated relative to prepandemic levels, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics reporting 9.6 million vacancies in September. That’s down from the high of more than 12 million openings in March 2022 but above the 6.7 million vacancies recorded at the end of 2019. There are still 1.5 jobs available for every unemployed person seeking work.\n\nPlentiful openings and low unemployment continue to put upward pressure on worker pay. Compensation costs for civilian workers climbed 4.3% in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis, according to the latest Employment Cost Index. While that is below the 5.1% peak growth rate recorded in the second quarter of 2022, wage gains have outpaced inflation since May 2023. Since wages account for the bulk of Americans’ total income, pay gains have an outsize impact on financial security and spending power.\n\nGiven falling birthrates, lower immigration, and the growing number of baby boomers entering retirement, many labor economists believe that tight employment conditions will persist. The BLS projects that total employment will grow only 0.3% annually over the next decade, far below the 1.2% annual growth rate recorded from 2012 to 2022. \n\n“As long as you don’t have enough children and immigrants coming in—and if you don’t have policies that help parents stay in a labor market, and especially women—then you’re going to be challenged with labor as the baby boomers retire,” says Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board.\n\n**Household Finances**\n\nHigh spending levels haven’t yet compromised most household balance sheets, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Banks. In part, that’s because Americans’ wealth grew by 37% from 2019 to 2022, according to the Fed’s latest Survey of Consumer Finances. \n\nRising rates of homeownership, an increase in home values, a rising stock market, and higher incomes all helped drive up household net worth. More significantly, consumers got a helping hand from the government in the form of an unprecedented $814 billion of stimulus payments supplied to U.S. households to combat the economic fallout from the Covid pandemic. As a result, households’ real median net worth grew to $192,900 by the end of 2022, up from $141,100 in 2019—the largest three-year increase on record.\n\nIn all, Americans generated $2.1 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic, estimates the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Many households further improved their financial footing by taking advantage of low interest rates and extra savings to pay down debt. For example, the share of credit-card holders who carried a balance declined from 50% to 45% from April 2020 to December 2021, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. And about a third of outstanding home mortgages were refinanced in this period. \n\nAlthough household indebtedness has risen since then, only 3% of Americans’ outstanding debt was in some stage of delinquency at the end of September, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. By comparison, delinquency rates hit a record of nearly 12% in 2009 and stood at 4.7% at the end of 2019. \n\nMoreover, consumers used an average of only 24.1% of their available credit-card allowances as of the third quarter, still below the prepandemic level of 24.6%, according to TransUnion. Both modest delinquency rates and low credit utilization are key indicators of financial health and spending power. Current measures of consumer debt and borrower distress “don’t look worrying,” Edelberg says.\n\nJust 9%, or about $190 billion, of excess pandemic savings remained as of this past June, the San Francisco Fed estimates. Yet consumer spending has persevered. In addition to the aforementioned job-market strength, cooling inflation has helped reverse some of the previous loss of purchasing power. In particular, gasoline prices have fallen this year, while food-price inflation has decelerated.\n\n**Confidence Problem**\n\nIronically, Americans’ confidence in their personal financial situation and the broader economic outlook has been persistently grim in recent years, according to various sentiment surveys. Based on the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index, Americans’ confidence has fallen sharply since the start of the Covid pandemic and now stands at the same levels as those recorded during the 2008-09 financial crisis. \n\nWhile confidence readings hinted at more optimism earlier in the summer, the index has trended down for the past four months. “There are a lot of things consumers are worried about, but definitely, inflation and higher interest rates are affecting their mood,” Peterson says.\n\nA poor outlook typically translates into conservative spending patterns. Yet in another irony of the postpandemic era, consumer sentiment hasn’t been an accurate predictor of spending trends.\n\nTo be sure, some Americans—particularly lower- and middle-income households—are pulling back on purchases, citing rising financial stress. Allie Kuopus, a media-relations coordinator in Illinois, frets about rising interest rates and higher prices for everyday goods as she works to square her monthly budget, which must also cover student loan payments, car payments, and emergency veterinary bills. Even after taking on a second job as a CrossFit coach and frequently dog-sitting, Kuopus says she has balances on almost all of her credit cards, a situation she calls “very stressful.” Bank of America\n\nreports that credit-card spending among people earning less than $50,000 a year showed almost no growth in October after rising 1.75% year over year in September. \n\nBut that slowdown might not have much of an impact on overall trends because spending is concentrated largely among higher-income households that typically earn more than $200,000 a year. High earners have accounted for 39% of total consumer spending since 2004, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nHousing wealth and white-collar employment typically drive confidence and spending among the nation’s highest earners, whose real disposable personal income is still above prepandemic levels on a per capita basis. A 40% rise in national home prices and a 30% gain in the stock market from pre-Covid levels have both helped to fatten their accounts.\n\n**Saving and Splurging**\n\nThat’s not to say spending won’t moderate in coming months, or that more-ominous headwinds don’t loom. KPMG forecasts that consumer spending will average 1.6% growth next year, down from an estimated 2.8% this year, with spending expected to be weakest in the second quarter of 2024. The firm expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates in June, easing the cost of purchases made on credit. \n\nFitch economists predict that spending will grow only 0.6% next year, as monetary tightening increasingly weighs on consumer demand. But it sees real personal-consumption expenditures rebounding in 2025 to healthier annual growth rates of nearly 2%.\n\nFitch’s Sonola projects that a pullback in spending on durable goods will account for a significant portion of any spending slowdown as consumer appetites wane. The current level of inflation-adjusted spending on durable goods is higher than the trend seen in the five years preceding the pandemic, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, while the share of durable-goods spending relative to overall consumer spending is one percentage point higher than in 2019. This has been driven, in large part, by pent-up demand for vehicles after the supply-chain problems and chip shortages of the early 2020s.\n\nHigh interest rates, too, will cause many Americans to think twice about buying items that need financing, Sonola projects. Just ask Kuopus, who recently had to shell out $24,000 for a used Toyota Corolla after the brakes on her Honda Civic gave out. “The interest rate was disgusting,” she says, noting that even with a significant down payment and a six-year lease, she is financing the purchase at a rate above 8%.\n\nWhile spending on durables might slow, services spending is projected to remain buoyant, in part because consumer attitudes have shifted since the pandemic. Since June 2021, growth in services spending has surpassed growth in spending on goods, and Deloitte expects\n\nthat trend to persist. The firm forecasts that personal-consumption expenditures for services will rise 3.1% this year and 4.7% in 2024.\n\nMany consumers probably will find themselves splurging on some things while cutting back on others. Imani Reed is one. The New Jersey resident has pared back expenses for everyday needs to afford travel and concert tickets. Reed says she has “absolutely no regrets” about having shelled out more than $1,600 to see Beyoncé in concert in Vancouver this past summer, even after a canceled flight unexpectedly added $450 to the trip’s price tag.\n\nGiven that wealthier Americans are the primary drivers of consumer spending, however, the question is what might get them to cut back. A labor shock seems unlikely, although it can’t be ruled out, especially given the high amount of high-yield corporate debt taken on in 2021 and early 2022 and now set to be repriced in 2024. When companies are forced to refinance at higher interest rates, that can lead to layoffs as they seek to maintain profit margins. The market easily shook off job cuts in the tech sector in 2023 after years of frenzied growth, but more-widespread losses could be harder to ignore. \n\nBeyond a jobs recession—and a broader economic one—the answer isn’t clear, especially if the Fed effectively declares “mission accomplished” on taming inflation and begins cutting interest rates next year. That scenario is the consensus view on Wall Street, although there is widespread debate about the timing of such cuts.\n\nSo far, the U.S. economy has escaped a hard landing even in the face of sharply rising interest rates, while a soft one has been experienced unevenly. Much could change in 2024 as the Fed fine-tunes monetary policy, the U.S. faces tough spending decisions and a presidential election, and geopolitical tensions grow.\n\nStill, “as long as people have jobs, they will continue to spend,” Sonola says.\n\nSee you at the mall.", "id": "17y4pin", "created_utc": 1700307608.0, "score": 286, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 220, "comments": [{"body": "Difficult to argue that the consumer is healthy when the savings rate has eroded from a pre-pandemic 7-8% to approx. 3%.

You draw down your rainy day funds for that, and once it's depleted, you cut down spending to save more and replenish that rainy day funds. It's the latter part that's a risk. Consumers cut down spending to replenish their excess savings, businesses fire employees because sales aren't as strong, fired employees further cut down spending, and the domino falls\n\nConsumers ARE spending down their savings. Excess savings were about 2.5 trillions in early 2022 and have gone down to around 400 billions, concentrated among the top 20% income group. The drawdown rate was roughly 80 billions a month. If consumers savings rate remain steady and doesn't improve, the excess savings will run out by 1st half of next year. \n\nConsumers aren't increasing spending. Real spending have stayed around 2% for the last 2 years.

So while we are probably not in a recession yet, I would not take any confidence in the strong economy yet, especially now when the fed is saying the risk are balanced.

You could always refinance when rates drop.  Realistically, the property is likely to appreciate at around a 3% cagr, so in 30 years it will be worth roughly $1,225,000.\n\nAssuming rent in your area would cost you $1,200 and will increase 5% annually, and taking into account annual repair costs and insurance, and transaction costs, the net present value of you choosing to purchase the property would be around -$200k, but the IRR would be positive at around 4%.  Not to mention after the mortgage is paid off, you'll see substantially more return on your investment.  Apart from the financial, peace of mind at owning your home is invaluable.\n\nRegarding buying dividend stocks/ETFs....in short, bad decision.  You say 20k a year is livable in your area, so making some assumptions, I'd ballpark dumping 20-30% of income is roughly 12k per year into dividend payers.  Assuming an initial dividend yield of 4%, and annual growth of 2%, it will take roughly 12 years to take in 20K from dividends with an initial investment of 150K + annual contributions.  That's pre-tax, and in 12 years 20K will only be worth about 16K today (2.5% inflation).  I'm guessing the cost of living in your area will outpace this. So really you'd be looking at closer to 14 years to net 20K pretax from dividends.\n\nDividends are just a form of returning earnings to shareholders, and not one I'm particularly fond of.  Any dividend, and especially higher yields, indicates the company has no better use for the cash. Ie limited investment and growth opportunity, so anticipating capital appreciation that outperforms alternatives is unlikely.  Further, you can always sell stocks or fractionals if you need to generate cash - essentially making your own dividend.\n\n\nIf you are looking for fixed income, I'd look at TIPS and Munis right now.  Even 20 yr treasuries are a better bet than dividend stocks IMO.  However, if you are solely choosing between a house and Divs, the house would be the better financial decision in terms of wealth maximization, and likely peace of mind.\n\n\nBest of luck with whatever you choose.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}

All jokes aside it is a hot button topic and probably not something the board should be members of while overseeing a $90 billion new technology company.  The question apparently is now, should the entire board be removed except for Sam and Greg?\n\nUpdate: Board now asking Sam Altman to come back. Ilya's days could be numbered: [https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo)\n\n**Original Post**: This story is made for an epic Apple TV+ drama. On one side you have the Y-Combinator entrepreneurs and innovator Sam Altman and on the other side is an enigmatic figure that believes strongly that AGI should be in the hands of humanity. Not corporations.\n\nThe quote from Winston Churchill comes to mind \" If you're not a liberal at twenty you have no heart, if you're not a conservative at forty, you have no brain.\" Politics aside, this guy (Ilya) is in between having a heart and no brain.  First and foremost, there was no reason to fire Sam in the coup manner he did this past Friday afternoon. I've read it all, i've listened to it all. There was really no good reason.\n\nSecondly, and probably most importantly is the notion that OpenAI runs as a non-profit is a bunch of bullshit. You have developers making millions in salary and stock options which whether it is in private equity or not you are literally saying that one day you're going to be publicly listed and boom everyone is going to get some massive payout. Should a company that is going to have a public payout be allowed to be considered a \"non-profit.\" It just doesn't make any sense.\n\nNext, the ideology of Ilya Sutskever is ultra concerning for me. This guy is really trying to pull off the greatest stunt known to mankind. And the board, all 3 of the other members beside Sam and Greg, should be RIPPED for this. Microsoft not being on the board should be RIPPED for this.\n\nYou have this weird, the \"1st of its kind,\" corporate structure of a capped investment. All over the comments people are trying to excuse and explain that \"this is what it means\" and \"everyone knew it\" and \"it's all public information.\" As a side note, I've never thought about the importance of the board except other than the firing of Steve Jobs from Apple (At least they had some good reason that wasn't about something stupid; they were pissed they weren't making profit.)\n\nWhat they're trying to say with a capped investment is that until we make AGI or repay in profits or some bullshit agreement rider is that you have only so much to gain until we OpenAI take back full and unfettered control of the company. To hell with your original 49% investment at some point it will be all ours. And somehow, this ties into being a non-profit we're going to send all of our profit and money AFTER YOU KNOW we pay ourselves million of dollars per year in salaries and then give the rest to non-profit's such as the \"black girls code fund.\"\n\nKoombaya!!! Hippy Dippy! Sounds like bullshit right? It sounds that way because it is.\n\nAs an investor, a user and a person who works in AI and automation I had no earthly clue this timebomb was ticking. That the board members where on some fantasy island of bullshit.\n\nSo why was Microsoft so flat footed? Why can Microsoft be so out of the loop?  Well, I think what happened if you read everything correctly and actually listen to what Greg and Same and Ilya are saying you keep hearing over and over again about the \"Safety of AI\" and specifically the Safety of \"AGI\".\n\nWhat's Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). I work in AI and I can't even tell you what I think it means anymore because it's been so bastardized.\n\nHere's my opinion of what it is and why I think it is such a problem in this situation. Some people when they think about AI they think about a sentient thing. Something that can feel and can think and is \"self-aware\" all on it's own. **The AI god complex issue.** Man created it so who is the god now. All that nonsense. People think of Skynet/terminator, the Matrix, IRobot, Asimov. All of that science fiction stuff. Everyday people that aren't very knowledgeable of the situation may rightly think like this. What happens is that the sentient AI (which is nowhere near coming into existence) is being crept into the believe and understanding of the phrase Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\n\nHere's the problem and why Ilya should resign or atleast why i'll make a case for it. The problem is, AGI is not sentient AI. AGI for what it is or what it could be has moved the goal post. Everyone has moved this goal post. From Ilya to Sam Altman to Bill Gates to Elon everyone has moved the goal post for AGI. Pay attention because this is how to tie in an LLM into AGI.\n\nLarge Language Models. In one sentence. If you take enough text corpus examples and put it into enough compute running neural networks you get coherent responses. That's it folks. It raw brute force compute power. If said thing, is not trained on that said thing it will not show up in your LLM. PERIOD. It can't exist without huge and vast amounts of data and compute power.\n\nSo, forget about AGI being the matrix even though we (the AI leadership community) all want to sign an agreement promising that AI won't destroy humanity. I said it was stupid when they signed it and it's even more stupid now that it has come back to bite them in the ass. The new goal post moved AGI isn't sentient it's just more capable. Less hallucinations. I.e. maybe GPT 5. But the delta curve of that is not possibly known as it hasn't be released in masse. And even if it were \"better\" that's great but it's still not going to be able to do anything other than what it has been trained to do.\n\nThis is where instead of doomerisym of we won't annihilate the world perhaps Microsoft and tech community would be better served to define what AGI is. If there's a spectrum ok fine but explain that. Because AGI doesn't mean AI models can think and act on their own. They want that magic and mysticism in the public but really look where it just landed you. Time to rethink that stupid public talking point strategy; or they're just too naive to not understand this is how people may think when they hear the word AGI.  Just say that it is a better model, more reliable and has less hallucinations.\n\nFurthermore, they (tech community) want AGI to be this multimodel thing. Still, it has nothing to do with true self-learning self-teaching thought creating AI. It just simply states that there are obvious features in the models and their applications such as memory, handling text, video and audio. Those things don't make it AGI. They simply make it better working AI. Until one day we have the AI that people are thinking of. This ain't it.\n\nThat's really the point. Microsoft knows that this just a brute force trained with a lot of data and compute power AI. You can do Dal-E you can do video's, PDF's audio. It's just more and more brute force(tons of data and compute) models. That's in my thinking, why Microsoft agreed to the deal this way. Perhaps they're like well we don't have or won't have AGI (probably not until quantum computing is a thing) so yea whatever you guys. Perhaps the goal post movement of what AGI is. Well, that's were the lawsuits are going to fly I think.\n\nIt's literally the wizard of Oz trick. The man behind the curtain is hugging face. lol.\n\nAnd here's the part that makes Ilya's entire argument (AGI safety for humanity) nonsense. This guy needed all of that compute power he need all of that money and now he wants to pick up his toys and go home \"for the greater good of humanity.\" OpenAI could not exist without private equity. They didn't go to Russia and get state funding. They didn't go to the US and get federal funding. They didn't go to China and get that funding. They went right to the US private equity funding mechanisms and specifically Microsoft.\n\nAnd they put a little rider in the agreement that IF WE ACHIEVE AGI then YOU GET CAPPED. Well, dude you're not at AGI. Nowhere near it. It has been documented and said that current transformer technologies won't be able to create AGI as we are thinking of it. The proper way to think of it. A little bit of SELF-REASONING and Learning and SELF-CREATION. Nowhere fucking near that.\n\nSo to Sam and Microsoft why not commercialize this thing that we have now? Why is it crazy that Sam is trying to make money for the company? Why would the board go through the drastic action of firing the CEO for NO GOOD REASON? Not worried about safety. Well, the safety guy quit along with a bunch of other KEY figures. So that argument is out the window. You're own safety guy quit in solidarity of Sam Altman. Just fly's in the face of your stupid safety argument.\n\nWhy are we safe? Because these models can not do ANYTHING that they haven't been trained to do. They don't think, they're no sentient, they don't feel or are aware of their existence. AT ALL. And the crazy person who tells that there is something that does this is a KOOK and is probably bat shit crazy.\n\nSo, in my opinion this is about power and control and profit versus non-profit and the supposed relation to AGI (which doesn't fucking exist). It's like saying IF god comes back to earth I will change my ways. The man replies ok but i'm going to need you to change your ways now so that WHEN god comes back to earth you have done all the right things now so that you will be ready for him WHEN he comes. Problem is, some of us don't believe in god so...\n\nYou can believe (in god/AGI) if you want to but if you put that in an agreement that effectively states when \"GOD/AGI SHOWS UP\" and the people signing the agreement look at you funny and say OK i'll sign that. You can't change the goal post of the definition of god/AGI showing up to make it seem like OMG god/AGI is almost here.\n\nIn anyevent, Ilya should resign. He's too unstable to be leading this technology. He thinks he's more important than he is. In follow up, Microsoft needs to get a seat on that damned board. This is a progressing shit show and it would be a lot better if it weren't.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/report-sutskever-led-board-coup-at-openai-that-ousted-altman-over-ai-safety-concerns/](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/report-sutskever-led-board-coup-at-openai-that-ousted-altman-over-ai-safety-concerns/)", "id": "17yg6qu", "created_utc": 1700341960.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 244, "comments": [{"body": "So what should I buy?", "score": 134, "replies": [{"body": "Puts on Nvidia", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "You want puts on the best weapons dealer that sells guns to all sides in an all out war?

The author questions the firing of Altman, criticizing the way it was handled and suggesting there was no solid justification for it. There's skepticism about OpenAI's non-profit status, given the high salaries and stock options of developers, raising doubts about whether a company anticipating a public payout should be considered a non-profit.\n\nThe author finds Ilya Sutskever's ideology concerning, especially regarding the handling of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) development. They argue that AGI, often confused with sentient AI, is currently just advanced computing rather than self-aware intelligence. The piece criticizes the \"capped investment\" structure of OpenAI and suggests that the organization's commitment to non-profit ideals is insincere, given their financial practices.\n\nFurther, the author questions Microsoft's role and awareness in these developments, especially regarding safety concerns in AI. They argue that the AI community, including OpenAI, has shifted the goalpost on what AGI means, moving from a concept of self-aware AI to a more advanced but non-sentient computing model.\n\nThe narrative concludes by suggesting that Ilya Sutskever should resign due to his handling of these issues and calls for Microsoft to take a more active role in OpenAI's governance. The author expresses concern about the future direction of AI development, emphasizing the need for clarity and responsible management in the field.\n\n  \n I asked:  can you give an assessment on your perspective of the information? \n\n  \n**ChatGPT**\n\nAs an AI, I don't have personal perspectives or the ability to provide assessments based on subjective viewpoints. However, I can offer an analysis based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Leadership and Governance in AI Organizations:** The text reflects common concerns in the tech industry about leadership decisions, transparency, and governance in major AI organizations like OpenAI. Such concerns often revolve around how decisions are made and the implications these decisions have on the direction of AI research and development.\n2. **Ethical and Financial Aspects of Non-Profit Status:** The skepticism about OpenAI's non-profit status amidst high salaries and potential future public payouts highlights a broader debate in the tech community. This debate centers on the ethics of profit-making in organizations that are involved in advanced technology development and claim a non-profit status.\n3. **Public Understanding and Definition of AGI:** The confusion and misconceptions around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as highlighted in the text are significant. There's often a gap between public perception and the current scientific reality of AI capabilities, especially concerning AGI. The text underscores the need for clear communication and realistic portrayals of AI advancements.\n4. **Role of Major Corporations in AI Development:** The text's mention of Microsoft's involvement with OpenAI brings up the broader topic of how large tech corporations influence AI research and development. Their investment decisions, partnerships, and strategic priorities can significantly shape the AI landscape.\n5. **Safety and Ethics in AI Development:** Concerns about AI safety, ethical use, and the societal impact of AI technologies are central themes in current AI discourse. The text echoes these concerns, especially in relation to the development of more advanced AI systems like those proposed under the AGI umbrella.\n\nOverall, the text touches upon several critical issues in the AI field, including leadership ethics, organizational transparency, public understanding of AI technologies, and the role of large tech companies in shaping the future of AI. These are ongoing topics of discussion and debate within the tech community and society at large.\n\nI asked:  can you give more context to point 3 \n\n**ChatGPT**\n\nCertainly! Let's delve into the context and accuracy of point 3 regarding public understanding and definition of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):\n\n### Understanding AGI\n\n1. **Definition of AGI**: Artificial General Intelligence refers to an AI system that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence broadly across a wide range of tasks, much like a human being. This is in contrast to Narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks (like image recognition, playing chess, etc.).\n2. **Current State of AI**: As of my last update in April 2023, no true AGI exists. Current AI systems, including advanced models like GPT-4, are considered Narrow AI. They are highly specialized and operate within the parameters of their training data and programming. They do not possess general understanding or consciousness.\n\n### Public Misconceptions\n\n1. **Science Fiction Influence**: Public perceptions of AGI are often influenced by science fiction. Movies and books frequently portray AGI as sentient, self-aware entities (think Skynet in \"Terminator\" or HAL 9000 in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"). This portrayal significantly differs from the current reality of AI technology.\n2. **Media Representation**: Media coverage can sometimes blur the lines between the current capabilities of AI and the speculative potential of AGI, leading to misconceptions about what AI can currently do.\n3. **Overestimation of Capabilities**: There's a tendency to overestimate the capabilities of current AI systems. While they can perform some tasks with remarkable proficiency, they are far from having the generalized understanding and adaptability of AGI.\n\n### The Gap in Understanding\n\n1. **Technological Reality vs. Expectation**: There's a gap between the technological reality of AI (as it currently stands) and public expectations or fears about what AI might become. This gap can lead to misunderstandings about the immediate impacts and potential risks of AI.\n2. **Shifting Definitions and Goalposts**: As the text suggests, there can be a shifting narrative in the AI community about what constitutes AGI. This shifting narrative can contribute to public confusion. For instance, improvements in AI capabilities are sometimes misconstrued as steps towards AGI, even when the fundamental nature of the AI hasn't changed from being task-specific.\n3. **Role of AI Community and Media**: Both the AI community and the media play crucial roles in shaping public understanding. Clear communication and responsible reporting are essential to bridge the knowledge gap and set realistic expectations about AI's capabilities and future development.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, while advancements in AI are significant and rapidly evolving, the concept of AGI remains a theoretical and aspirational goal rather than a current reality. The public understanding of AGI is often clouded by misconceptions and influenced by fictional portrayals and media representation, which can lead to a gap between expectations and the actual state of AI technology.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "That summary is as long as the original post", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "Lol to be fair it is 3 total summaries.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "ChatGPT made it worse.

Wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\\_general\\_intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)\n\n\\>  An **artificial general intelligence** (**AGI**) is a hypothetical type of [intelligent agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent).[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-NYT-20230630-1) If realized, an AGI could learn to accomplish any intellectual task that [human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_beings) or animals can perform.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-2)[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:10-3) Alternatively, AGI has been defined as an autonomous system that surpasses human capabilities in the majority of economically valuable tasks.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:1-4) Creating AGI is a primary goal of some [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) research and of companies such as [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI),[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:1-4) [DeepMind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind), and [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic). AGI is a common topic in [science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) and [futures studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_studies).\n\nOdd, who is notation 4? Hmm, who could that be that wrote an update to what the definition of what AGI means. Oh it's OpenAI themselves.\n\n4. [\"OpenAI Charter\"](https://openai.com/charter). *openai.com*. Retrieved 6 April 2023.\n\nI'm not going to go into a diatribe about how the definition is purely related to Effective Altruism and not rooted in technical reality. But I will show you that just a few paragraphs down in the same article they describe AGI in a much different way.\n\n\\>  Terminology\n\nAGI is also known as strong AI,[\\[10\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKurzweil2005260-10)[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Kurzweil_2005-08-05-11) full AI,[\\[12\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-12) human-level AI[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-:2-5) or general intelligent action.[\\[13\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-FOOTNOTENewellSimon1976-13) However, some academic sources reserve the term \"strong AI\" for computer programs that experience [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) or [consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness).[\\[a\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_Strong_AI-14) In contrast, weak AI (or narrow AI) is able to solve one specific problem, but lacks general cognitive abilities.[\\[14\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-15)[\\[11\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Kurzweil_2005-08-05-11) Some academic sources use \"weak AI\" to refer more broadly to any programs that neither experience consciousness nor have a mind in the same sense as humans.[\\[a\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-Searle's_Strong_AI-14)\n\nRelated concepts include artificial [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence) and transformative AI. An artificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical type of AGI that is much more generally intelligent than humans.[\\[15\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-16) And the notion of transformative AI relates to AI having a large impact on society, for example similar to the agricultural revolution.[\\[16\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-17)\n\nIt seems as if they wanted to water down and dilute the understanding and meaning of what AGI is for perhaps I don't know contractual obligations?\n\n[https://openai.com/our-structure](https://openai.com/our-structure)\n\n* Fourth, profit allocated to investors and employees, including Microsoft, is capped.
