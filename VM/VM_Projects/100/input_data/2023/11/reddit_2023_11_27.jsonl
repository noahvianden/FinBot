Faking you have a cryptopunk is impossible as long as someone knows how to read etherscan.\n\nGaming. This one hasn’t caught on at all but to me is the most obvious one. Yes, I know all gamers hate NFTs and yada yada. But as soon as there is an actually fun game and someone gets an in-game drop that they fiat out and buy a lambo with (or a cryptopunk), everyone is gonna quickly forget their misgivings. I played WoW growing up and CS, Dota, and FIFA more recently. I got drops worth thousands of $ but of course all those funds are locked within the game’s ecosystem. Getting a rare in-game drop that I can choose to fiat out and pay my mortgage with sounds a lot cooler than having two thousand steam $ that I can only use to buy more skins or games. As soon as this transition starts, it’s gonna quickly pick up momentum and before long, the idea of spending money to play a game in steam where you can never get any $ out will seem archaic and predatory.\n\nThat idea of controlling your assets and not just having them live in some game dev’s database underpins a lot of my belief in the future of NFTs. Decentralization is the future, or I certainly hope it is bc without it the future looks bleak for humanity. It was just a few years ago that the Canadian government froze and seized bank accounts of protesting truckers. Not good, regardless of your political leanings (if the truckers generate no sympathy that’s fine - I’m sure you can imagine then how Trump or this dude in the NL being elected could lead to similar things happening to folks on the left).\n\nThere are countless other use cases I could talk about. Simple ones like how annoying logging into accounts has gotten online with the 2FA prompts and how unsecure that method is compared to the ease and security of me using my eth wallet to login somewhere. More complex use cases like using NFTs to eliminate bots on social media platforms.\n\nThe skepticism is fair. The people making most of the noise in the NFT space are still largely charlatans and frauds. But there are some serious people working on serious projects and if you can find those, I think there is significant upside.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for explaining your well thought out thesis in detail!", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "VOO.", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "The S&P 500 is the stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.\n\nThe average historical return of the S&P 500 is around 10% to 11%.

There may be positive or negative predictions about what the market will do next.  These descriptions may include references to “The Dow” or The S&P 500 or the NASDAQ 100.” \n\n\nSometimes the financial news will indicate that the market is up while a particular stock or stock sector is down or vice versa. Since each stock performs separately, financial services companies have developed several ways to evaluate overall stock market performance.  \n\n\nIn 1962, Standard & Poor's Financial Services Company created a list of 500 large companies bought and sold on stock exchanges in the United States.  S&P wanted a way to measure the overall strength of the US economy, so they used the performance of these 500 companies to track how well the stock market was doing. The S&P 500, still represents the broadest measure of the U.S. economy.  It changes daily as the prices of the 500 companies fluctuate. \n\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, often referred to as the 'Dow', is the oldest measure of stock market performance, dating back to 1896. The Dow represents 30 large cap stocks as determined by the Wall Street Journal. \n\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 created in 1985, represents the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It is generally regarded as a measure of the technology sector’s performance.\n\n\nThese three ways to measure stock market performance are called “indexes” or “indices.” The performance of the three indices is usually pretty aligned, though sometimes one performs better or worse than the others during a given period of time.  But together, they give a good indication of how the market is doing, and you can check their performance on any given day in the financial news.  \n\n\nMany investors like to compare their personal performance to one of these indices to see if they can “beat the market.”  To \"beat the market\" means to achieve a higher rate of return on an investment portfolio than the overall market average. In other words, if an investor's portfolio outperforms a stock market index such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, then they are considered to have \"beaten the market.\"\n\n\nThis is a common goal for many investors, as it can lead to higher profits and a greater sense of success.  \n\n\nFrom Novice Investor’s Guide to Stocks, Funds, and Options, Second Edition.

There were other tasks that he knew how to do but wasnt allowed to do even if the person who did THAT job wasn't in that day.  They would just not do it until that guy was back in.\n\nThat's incredibly expensive, inefficient, and horrible.  That ONLY happens with unions.  Forcing a company to be this uncompetitive and this full of pork kills their competitiveness.  You are about to get to watch Tesla, Hyundai, Kia, and the Chinese EV's absolutely smoke GM, Fiat Chrysler and Ford.  We probably get to bail out GM again in a few years, much of which is due to unions pushing to decrease EV plans to \"protect jobs.\"  Clearly this is a bad thing.\n\nUnions are super important when there is a ton of abuse and such things, especially early on.  They were 100% necessary when there were NO worker protections at all.  Unions cease to be valuable and become a negative when they continue on for too long, well past when they have gotten the necessary protections, but with each new leadership trying to get more and more than the prior.  More worker protections, more oversight over firing, etc.  Costs go up, productivity tanks.\n\nConstruction unions consistently charge more than double for the same project while taking 3-4x as long to complete it.  Electrical unions force a protection racket at convention centers, requiring you to buy their 200 dollar extension cord rental, and will cut your shit in half if you plug it in yourself.  People IN unions love that it's nearly impossible to fire them.  People working WITH unions hate them because it's such a mixed bag of decent workers mixed with lazy or incompetent workers, or 5 guys to do 1 guys job type nonsense.  The amount of housing that DOESNT get built every year because local governments enforce that the work must be done by unions is absolutely gobsmacking.  \n\nUnions have some good aspects, but almost always seem to overgrow their needs and become the problem.  Corruption becomes super common.  What's the solution to a union that has worn out it's usefulness.  No one ever wants to talk about that part.\n\nIn your example you should have been federally guaranteed severance and I'm pretty sure given contract law you would have been with or without a union due to your contract.  The company should ALSO be allowed to get rid of it's entire ops team if it decides to, at the cost of severance etc.\n\nIf they end up needing to build it back up again, guess what, the CEO or VP that decided to kill it is getting fired.

A bunch of Tesla mechanics are already members of IF Metall, a blue collar metalworkers union.\n\nIf there is no collective bargaining agreement in place at a company, and enough already unionized employees desire it, they can have their union(s) start pressuring the employer to sign. Since employees can belong to different unions in the same workplace, the biggest union by membership at that workplace gets bargaining rights for the CBA.\n\nIn this case, IF Metall wants Tesla to sign the agreement for car mechanics: https://www.ifmetall.se/globalassets/avdelningar/forbundskontoret/block/avtal2023/kollektivavtalen-2023-2025/motorbranschavtalet.pdf\n\nThis would only apply to people employed as such, it wouldn't cover any other employees, because these agreements are by sector. However, with one CBA in place, other unions would of course push for agreements for their sector employees, if they have any at Tesla. The more \"white collar\" an employee is, the less likely it is they'll be unionized and want a CBA, so managers and salespeople probably would never want one, but there's probably a bunch of lower-level office workers that could push for one. But that would be some other union pushing for that, IF Metall only cares about the repair technicians.\n\nAlso, Tesla would be eligible to join the counterparty to the motor vehicle sector CBA, the motor vehicle employer's alliance, MAF. The CBA is re-negotiated every couple of years between MAF and IF Metall, and these negotiations are big things, essentially between everyone employed in the motor vehicle sector, against every employer in the motor vehicle sector. And once the new CBA is in place, you can have a workplace negotiation where employees at a company negotiates with management at that company about company-wide raises and benefits on top of the CBA. And after that, you as an individual can negotiate raises and promotions and benefits on top of that.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n•\t⁠No-one is striking \"to unionize\".\n•\t⁠No-one is voting to unionize.\n•\t⁠Unions are per-sector, not per-employer or per-workplace.\n•\t⁠Different unions represent different employees at the same workplace depending on what they're employed as.\n•\t⁠Different unions negotiate collective bargaining agreements for their sector that apply nationwide.\n•\t⁠Employers can join an employer's alliance that acts as the counterparty in these negotiations.\n•\t⁠CBAs do the work of minimum wage laws and benefits laws, setting standards per sector, negotiating wage increases, regulating workplace standards and safety, etc.\n•\t⁠All employees in that sector at that employer is covered by the CBA, you don't have to be unionized to get the benefits, you don't have to be a member of the negotiating union to get the benefits.
