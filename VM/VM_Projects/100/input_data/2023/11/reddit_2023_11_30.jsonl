Let's assume you bought a median house in 1975. [Median house price was $40k](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS). Looks like a $100k house would have been pretty luxurious indeed. Let's assume for sake of argument it's $45k.\n\nYou put down $9000. You have a 30 year fixed mortgage for $36k at 9%. Your monthly is $290. We could do some digging on utilities and property taxes but assuming they follow a broadly similar cost split to what I currently pay, taxes would add about $70 and insurance $24 a month. A total mortgage of $384/mo. According to the 28% rule this is easily affordable on $1371/mo or $16.5k/year.\n\nMinimum wage in 1975 was $2/hr (~$4.2k/year) and median was [$11.8k](https://www.multpl.com/us-median-income/table/by-year). You'd have needed about 3.9x minimum wage to afford the house on a single income, or 1.4x median.\n\nNow in 2020, [that same house probably sold for $330k](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS). So first you need to have $66k in cash, then even at ideal rates (2.75%) that's a principal+interest payment of $1078, make the same assumptions about tax and insurance and we have a monthly mortgage of $1429. Affordable on $61.2k a year.\n\nNow minimum wage was $7.25 (~$15.1k/year), median income was [$68.0k](https://www.multpl.com/us-median-income/table/by-year). So you only need 0.9x median to afford the same house! Although you do need 4.1x the minimum. This also ignores that the only comparable metrics I could find were household median, not individual median, and so the 2020 metric is being MASSIVELY inflated as the 1975 metric would very likely be a single earner while 2020 is very likely two earners.\n\nThe best stat I could find for median individual income in 2020 was about $42k.

These questions are kind of pointless after the fact, because they're implying you're looking for an investment that will carry no risk, and there's no scenario in existence, where you could lose. But no such thing exists, or will ever exist.\n\nThere's always going to be *some* risk. Some forms of risk might be more probable than others, but the whole point of investing is assessing potential risk vs. potential reward, and figuring out the point where the latter outweighs the former. \"What if this happened?\" is a question that can literally always be asked. If it stops you from investing, you're never going to invest in anything.\n\nHeck, how do you actually know for sure you're even going to be alive 1 month, 1 year, X years from now, to enjoy your investment returns? Shit happens, and you never know when it's going to happen. At some point, you have to actually make a decision despite that. Kinda the same in life really, but I don't want to get too philosophical.\n\nAnother mistake is making assumptions based on the share price falling. Just because something fell 70%, doesn't mean it was justified. But it also doesn't mean it was NOT justified. It doesn't really mean anything on its own. It's your job as an investor to analyze the actual underlying business (on a much deeper level than looking at a bunch of popular metrics like P/E) to evaluate whether that drop was justified or not. Obviously, nobody ever said that's easy, it involves not just having the required knowledge, but - often more importantly - overcoming your emotions, your biases, etc.\n\nWith that said, one of Buffett's key investing principles is investing in companies in industries you know a lot about, and are familiar with their business model. Because then you can more accurately judge whether a 30%, 50%, 70% decline is an actual investment opportunity, or just a turd being a turd. If we take the entire history of the stock market, and all the companies that have ever existed in it, then vast majority of the time, a big decline (of that one specific company's stock) is NOT an investment opportunity (statistically speaking).\n\nOn the other hand, when there's any major correction, the overwhelming narrative on Reddit and other social media is that everything is going to proverbial zero, and there's not even a single company in the entirety of the stock market, that's worth buying.

No stock is priced \"appropriately\".\n \nEvery single stock is worth exactly what investors are willing to pay.  How they come to that decision could be based on many factors - but ultimately if no one wanted to buy Cocoa-Cola then the price would fall to 0.  If everyone wanted it... the price would rocket.  To think that the underlying value of the company has anything at all to do with the real price... is delusional.\n \nThe real reason why index funds \"seem\" to work is because they carry such a massive weight of their own that they essentially become a market force.  Once an index fund includes a specific stock that acts as a solid floor for that stock - which reenforces the trend of index funds being solid in performance.\n \nBut, if you want to grow your wealth in an active way (this is not /r/investing, nor is it /r/wallstreetbets) the best bet is to move with the herd.  Don't be first, and don't be last.  Hear good news about Google?  Grab some shares and hold for the rise.  Don't just buy and hold.  Get a 1-2% bump in value and move on.  Determine your exit price before you enter (both to the upside and downside) and make sure it is in alignment with your risk tolerence.  But buying META after a 75% drop?  That's gambling imho.

A staggeringly small number of investors can set prices. Efficient markets aside, if lots of fund holders suddenly turned into stock traders, they probably don't have lots of unknown information and wouldn't have drastically different opinions about prices.\n\nI have to say I can't recommend your \"don't be first, don't be last\" advice to anyone, though have my congratulations if you're beating the market over the span of decades by timing it. That liar Warren Buffett's advice for the masses is to buy an S&P 500 index fund early and often and keep it for as long as you can. It guarantees market average performance forever, something the vast majority of fund managers and advisors can't do.\n\nIf you're saying you've tried and failed as a value investor, I'd love to hear your experience.
