I also like his take on charting and indicators.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hi Insurance.  Larry has written many books over his long trading career.  The two I have found the most value in are \"Long Term Secrets for Short Term Trading 2nd Edition,\" and \"How I made One Million Dollars....Last Year....Trading Commodities.\"  Long Term Secrets is his most comprehensive and considered by most to be his Magnum Opus.  I keep a notebook on traders that have influenced me over the decades, I take notes on books and articles and interviews... Under the Williams Sections I will just share a few random notes:  \"Larry uses a holistic approach, neither technical nor fundamental, he approaches markets t from 7 areas, 1. Fundamentals 2. Trend  3. Accumulation/Distribution or OBV 4. Momentum (Overbought/Oversold) 5. Sentiment (Commitment of Traders Report) 6. Seasonal Patterns 7. Market Cycles.  *Combine everything* but only use ONE INDICATOR for each area.  ie. 1 Trendline, 1 oscillator, 1 volume indicator etc.  Simple charts--too many things on a chart will lead to the inability to make a decision, more is not better.\"  My favorite quotes from Larry: \"Trend is the basis of all profits and trend is a function of time.\"  \"I trade small positions and try to catch large profits over  several days or weeks.\"  Which ties directly into his money management which he adamantly and continually states is the foundation and most important part of any trading plan.  He loves to give examples that he has backtested where the only difference between profitability and loss is the money management and Risk/Reward, not the strategy or entries and exits.  His biggest lesson after a lifetime of trading is that the key is \"You can not lose more $ on your losers than you make on your winners.\"  He recommends a Risk/Reward of a minimum of 1:2.5  So a $2,000 stop loss requires a $5,000 exit target, and you let the trade go til one of those is hit.   In closing, there are countless interviews and presentations on Youtube and Broker sites with him presenting his ideas.  My go to oscillator is William's %R with a (10) rather than (14) period.  Been using it long before I even knew who Larry was, back when I was trading Currency Options in the early 2,000s.  He certainly doesnt have all the answers, but I take from his what makes the most sense to me and is most conducive to my style and current strategy.
