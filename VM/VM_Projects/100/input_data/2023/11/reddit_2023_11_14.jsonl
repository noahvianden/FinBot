Both companies have fought to limit revealing the deals’ details, citing potentially anticompetitive effects.\n\nThe incidental disclosure from Alphabet’s expert witness Kevin Murphy, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was not expected. Murphy’s testimony came as part of the company’s efforts to fight the Justice Department’s claims that the company illegally maintains dominance over search and advertising markets.\n\nWilliams & Connolly antitrust partner John Schmidtlein visibly cringed when Murphy revealed the number, Bloomberg News reported.\n\nThe search default agreement is a major focus of the proceedings. Judge Amit Mehta has described the Apple-Google deal as the “heart” of the case. It’s a number Wall Street pays attention to as well. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has estimated in a note to clients that Apple would see $19 billion in 2023 revenue as a result of the search engine default deal with Google.\n\nNeither Apple nor Google immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai defended such deals when he testified in the proceedings. But Google’s competitors have described the arrangement as damaging to their business. Microsoft\n\nCEO Satya Nadella, for example, pushed back in detail when he testified in October.\n\nNadella said that “every year” he had held the top job at Microsoft, he had “dialogues” with Apple over a default search engine deal for Microsoft’s Bing, even if that meant billions in short-term losses. Nothing had yet come of those talks, Nadella said.\n\nNadella said that the idea of an “open web” was a misnomer. “Everybody talks about the open web, but there really is the Google web,” he said on the stand.", "id": "17v4p9n", "created_utc": 1699975814.0, "score": 558, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "I am so used to googles search and how it presents the results, I do not understand how bing presents their results and I do not feel satisfied and I immediately perform the same search on google and feel satisfied ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|neutral_face).", "score": 253, "replies": [{"body": "Bing is garbage", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "Google is getting so much worse.

ICE cars will be apart of the market for the foreseeable future, several decades at least.

EV early adopters are already in the market.  The mass market is skeptical about EVs; many don't have easy access to charging, drive to much, or in isolated areas, to make charging practical.\n\nConsumer demand is simply not there for a huge market shift in the near term.  Automakers are slowing their EV rollouts specifically for this reason.\n\n>Point being, consumer sentiment WILL shift in favor of EV's in much larger numbers sooner or later, and if traditional automakers aren't ready then they're going to feel a lot of pain as their ICE sales tank, especially if they can't produce and sell enough EV's to counter-act those ICE losses.\n\nICE SUVs and trucks are where the consumer demand is.

We are talking decades here; not years.\n\n>The fact that so many automakers are pushing the break on their shift to the EV transition\n\nThey are doing this because customers don't want to switch to EVs.

Compare Tesla's user interface to that of a Hyundai Ionic 5 or Volkswagen ID.4.  Tesla's interface is smoother and easier to use.  Tesla's control of their entire hardware platform and software stack, means they can more easily update their software.  Ford CEO Jim Farley explains the basic problem for other car companies:  [the software is all written by 150 different companies and they don’t talk to each other,  Even if I had a high-speed modem in the vehicle and I had the ability to write their software, it's actually their IP.](https://www.thedrive.com/news/ford-ceo-explains-why-legacy-automakers-take-forever-to-issue-ota-updates)\n\nFord is trying to bring this stuff back in-house, but it remains to be seen if they can recruit the talent necessary to do all the hardware and software themselves.  Volkswagen has thus far done a mediocre job of this (which in part [cost former VW CEO Herber Diess his own job](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagens-ceo-diess-leave-company-2022-07-22/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(2) Hardware.  Tesla has had entire teams devoted to developing custom silicon for its autonomous driving and AI projects.

This is the major test of the end-to-end artificial neural network approach.  Everything comes together here:  \n\n1.  Tesla's custom silicon for running artificial neural networks\n2. The vision ANN system developed by the Tesla team led by Andrej Karpathy\n3. The planning ANN system that has been under development by the Tesla team under Ashok Elluswamy   \n4.

If the mainstream predictions prove incorrect, and they generally have been incorrect in the past, that will help TSLA valuation.  \n* FSD 12 is the big wild card here.  If it has its \"ChatGPT\" moment, I think it's possible TSLA valuation soars next year.  If FSD 12 gets bogged down, drags someone like Cruise automation's car, or worse (like killing someone), we may be in for a lot of hurt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor some historical valuation context, we're now at the end of year 3 of the current valuation range.

Golds price has historically been manipulated by the federal government until we moved away from the gold standard in the 70s. The government used to suppress the price of gold when we were on the gold standard. This was all a part of the [Bretton Woods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system) system which required exchange of currency for standardized gold bullion. FDR started a policy that basically artificially fixed golds price to 35 bucks a Troy ounce until 1971 when the US essentially ended the Bretton Woods system. Gold shot up in price about 700ish% where it was around 200-300 and ounce. Since then gold floats close to 2000 an ounce over around a 50 year period. The return of gold over that period has been about 4-5% nominal. No I am not cherry-picking because golds nominal return over the 87 year period is also around 5% even with the government artificial suppressing prices.\n\nAlso US stocks compounded over 87 years at 8-10% nominal return would be somewhere around 400x-4000x depending on where the money was invested. So basically 20 bucks in indexed equities would have returned anywhere from 8000 bucks to 80000 bucks depending on what nominal equity return you use. \n\nTLDR: golds nominal return is about 5% over that time period and that return was amplified by old monetary and fiscal policy.

{"title": "Are We In A Student Loan Bubble?", "selftext": "Hey y'all. So I need some advice. Basically I believe that we're in a Student Loan Bubble. Americans hold 1.8 TRILLION dollars in student loan debt, with 92% of that being Federal. There are only 9 federal student loan servicers, and they've all dropped the ball when it comes to loan repayments. For example, my servicer Nelnet $NNI has had their website crash over 10 times since September. Their official hold time is 90 minutes to talk to a customer service rep, but I waited 2.5 hrs. Hundreds of thousands of students have been incorrectly billed. My loan was bought and sold three times during the pandemic. American credit card debt is at an all time high, and many students have no ability, intention, or budget to repay their student loans. I believe I read a report that said 50-60% of students don't intend to repay their loans. They haven't had to for 3 years, and many students were pissed off when loan forgiveness was cancelled.\n\nNelnet has a debt to equity ratio of 4:1, P/E 17, and their profits and cash flows are down. If you go on Twitter (X) there are tons of students who are pissed off. Another thing that makes me upset is that Nelnet laid off hundreds of employees, and used the money to buy back their own stock. The issue is the exec board owns 50% of the stock (and has 70% of voting power). Institutional investors own 30% and it's a low volume stock.\n\nNelnet aggressively acquired the loan portfolios of other companies, and IMO they will have to pay the piper when they realize that students are not paying back their loans.\n\nThey are also under investigation from the Department of Education for violating their contract. It blows my mind that the major media outlets are not reporting on how many students are not paying back their loans, and investors seem unbothered by NelNets horrible financial stats.\n\nIs there anything I can do to increase publicity and make someone look into this and write a news story on it?\n\nFull disclosure bought put options when their stock was at $100 and I'm currently up 120%. Their stock was worth $60 before Covid, now at $86. I certainly don't think they are worth 40% more now, but given how low their volume has been I don't think investors are aware of how much trouble they're in.\n\nAny recommendations would be helpful. I've seen a few analysts set a price target at $91, but they didn't acknowledge any of the IT issues or student sentiment. \n\nI truly believe if investors knew what percent of students were paying back their loans, they would pull out.\n\nTYSM\n\n-Vladimir", "id": "17vbybi", "created_utc": 1699995278.0, "score": 47, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|9 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I can promise you this, those loans will never ever be paid off.\n\nDunno if that means it’s a bubble", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "I can’t understand why shareholders can’t see this obvious truth.

Why?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4p5l2lu6si0c1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=900c7f04b7e2faeac24ada2d3cf9431fc1a5859f\n\nVast majority of outstanding mortgages are under 5%. And most of that is under 4%.\n\nPeople with interest rates this low (like me) are building equity at incredible rates. Not including insurance and taxes, half of my mortgage payment goes to principal. Half.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nEven if a mild recession hits and unemployment jumps to, say, 5%. People will have more room to maneuver. They won’t be rushing to sell for a loss just to get out of it. Payments are low and locked in (not this ridiculous ARM bullshit). You aren’t going to have a crash like ‘08.\n\nWe also have a chronic under supply of single family homes. We basically have old folks staying in their larger homes for longer, and we have 2 generations of people entering family forming and prime earning years. Lower supply, increased demand, neither of which have easy fixes.\n\nWe need either a MASSIVE recession, or a recession that is primarily financial in nature (like ‘08) for prices to tumble.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean prices are overvalued.\n\nSo again, please tell me, what datapoint are you using to say prices are overvalued?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If we can get rid of Airbnb that would help the housing market", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Right now is the cheapest homes will be in the next decade.

Do adjustable rates still exist for real estate? Sure, but not enough to cause a crash on MBS like we saw in 2008. However, **the amount of adjustable rate loans for commercial loans is like, 100%.**\n\nLet me repeat that:\n\n# NEARLY EVERY COMMERCIAL LOAN IS ADJUSTABLE\n\nThis past summer, we saw a monsterous level of loans requiring extensions which were all approved. Most of these extensions expire next summer (2024) and if you think anything will change between this past summer and next summer, it won't. The full effect of rates is only beginning hence the rational to pause rates now however, that still doesn't save most of these commercial loans. Especially with WFH being a thing and the decline of purchasing power, demand won't increase enough for these people to pay the loans. To add insult to injury, **these regional banks are heavily overleveraged on treasury bonds too which were all purchased when rates were low. So, once they do not receive the money that was lent out, they'll need to begin acquiring liquidity which will be those treasury bonds and will have to sell them for a loss.**\n\nDO YOU SEE THE PROBLEM?\n\nWhen defaults happen, we're going to see a tsunami of regional banks collapse.
