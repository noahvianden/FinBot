Sure that isn't 50%, but considering the down time in China, I wouldn't say that EV demand has fallen of a cliff.

The media loves to jump on anything negative concerning EV's, so that's echo'd everywhere.\n\nOEM's aren't trying to compete with Tesla on pricing this year. It's not unlikely that Tesla's price cuts have done significant damage to the OEM's. They are left with billions in investments in a type of car that they are losing money on, when they sell them, that also hurts their own profitable type of cars.\n\nThe future for Legacy OEMs never looked good, but the last two years, a lot of future products were promised, a lot of factories for both EV's and batteries.

EV's share has increased while the average price is still higher than the average ICE vehicle.\n\nI don't think it makes sense to look at cars this way, since the cost over time of ownership is the more relevant number, but a lot of consumers don't see it that way.\n\nLook at ICE prices compared to the time Tesla had insane margins, including dealership mark-ups, it's not just BEV's that have gone down in price. Tesla's margins were insanely high, propped up by underproducing with high demand and a market that was going crazy. Dealership mark ups are not great today, but you can see a big change.
