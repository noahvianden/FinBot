I realize everyone's valuation models are a little different.\n\nI have a couple ways of doing it, but the simplest to explain for filtering supremely overvalued stocks is this. I basically ask the question: could this company deliver more distributable cashflow to me as a shareholder over the next 10 years than a bond of similar safety.\n\nSo, let's say we're looking at MSFT. I would compare to 10+ year A-rated corporate bonds (roughly 5.5% right now) or Treasury bonds (4.6% right now). I take 75% of MSFT earnings yield (no company can distribute 100% of earnings yield, and even 75% is very high that would pretty much eliminate growth), and then I check to see what type of annual earnings growth would have to be achieved in order for my equity portfolio to equal the portfolio growth of the bond portfolio. Right now, MSFT has an earnings yield of 2.8%. So, starting year one as though we were actually getting 75% of this (2.1%), I then see how much annual growth we would have to achieve to equal roughly 5.5% from bonds. In this particular example, we would need 20% growth annualized over 10 years for our MSFT account to equal A-rated corporate bonds. 15% growth would equal a bond portfolio of roughly 4.3% over the next 10 years.\n\nThe interpretation is this: MSFT would have to distribute 75% of their earnings as dividends (they presently distribute 25%) AND grow their earnings at 20% per year in order for us to receive the same cashflow as A-rated corporate bonds over the next 10 years. If we add in the fact that MSFT stock could lose valuation, whereby those holding the stock could have capital losses, I just don't see the bullish argument in support of MSFT stock right now.\n\nI have several other techniques to value a company, but the conclusion is the same.

So if you think company __ is undervalued but give it no benefit of multiple expansion, you suddenly get some tailwinds to help get there. Though that might prompt me to sell it earlier.\n\nI made a prediction in late October of this year that Meta will hit $500 in 12 months, or 53% higher than today's price. This was my comment from 6 days ago with some rough math justifying that. Multiple expansion (if it happens) will make achieving it trivial \n\n> You can put me down for a prediction (if you don't make predictions what's the fun of all this) of $500 a share by end of 2024. I'll be crude about it: take 2025 GAAP EPS estimate of $19.85, assume META gets a 23x forward multiple on it by 2024 end, say buybacks boost the share price by 10%, you get roughly $500 [EDIT: 19.85\\*1.1\\*23]. I think they'll beat those analyst estimates.\n\nThe S&P 500 gets a median forward P/E of about 18-20 these days, and I don't think META getting a premium is that unreasonable. If META gets *no* multiple expansion and sticks to its current 19 forward P/E ratio, you get $414. A 25x forward multiple on 2025 earnings in 2024 gets you to $545... If META's share price stays completely flat from today to December 2024, the implied multiple at that time would be 15 which is a bit absurd imo. The share price will grow into its earnings.\n\nThen take more troubled stocks, like PYPL or CROX that I own. Multiples have compressed so much that an 'irrational' rally could see insane returns.

This continues Tesla's tradition of vertically integrating their products as much as possible.  \n* There was an interesting segment about energy efficiency and intelligence, with regards to biological vs. silicon today.  Musk noted that a biological brain can drive a car while using about 10 watts of power, which is far less than Tesla HW3 (100 watts) and supercomputing clusters (megawatt range consumption).  \n* Musk discussed the SEC settlement in regards to his 2018 \"funding secured\" tweet.  He accuses SEC attorneys of trying to win trophies (win high profile cases) so that they could later get jobs with law firms that earn $ from Wall Street.  Musk claims that the SEC won't go after hedge funds that lie about companies and then short those companies' stock, because the SEC lawyers ultimately want to represent those hedge funds.\n   * I was irritated that Musk tried to claim the moral ground by saying the SEC sold small shareholders down the river.  He's screwed us worse than the SEC over the past 2 years, and it's clear to me that he ignores his fiduciary duties to Tesla's stockholders\n* Musk seemed mentally coherent to me during the interview, which is a plus.

It only knows about the last two quarters right now, but I'll add more historical if it's of use.  Here's a sample:  \n\n\n***You:***   \n*Give me a quick summary of financials from the last quarter.*\n\n**$TSLA Investor:**   \nIn Q3 2023, Tesla's financial performance was characterized by the following key metrics:\n\n1. **Total Revenues**: Approximately $21.4 billion.\n2. **Operating Margin**: Decreased to 7.6%.\n3. **GAAP Net Income**: $1.9 billion.\n4. **Non-GAAP Net Income**: $2.3 billion.\n5. **Total Vehicle Production**: 430,488 units.\n6. **Total Vehicle Deliveries**: 435,059 units.\n7. **Operating Expenses**: $2.4 billion.\n8. **Year-over-Year Revenue Growth**: Slowed to 9%.\n\nThis summary reflects a quarter where Tesla faced challenges such as declining operating margins and net income, a slowdown in vehicle production and deliveries, and a significant reduction in year-over-year revenue growth. Despite these challenges, the company still achieved substantial revenue and maintained a considerable volume of vehicle production and deliveries.\n\n***You:***   \n*Any change in forward looking statements from q2 to q3?*\n\n**$TSLA Investor:**   \nIn comparing the forward-looking statements from Tesla's Q2 and Q3 2023 financial updates, the overall tone and content remain largely consistent. Both statements emphasize the company's expectations and plans for future development, production, demand, market growth, cost management, profitability, and investment strategies. Additionally, they address the development and improvement of Tesla's products and technologies, including the Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, next-generation vehicle platform, Dojo training computers, Autopilot, Full Self-Driving, and other software and AI-enabled products, as well as their battery cells, Supercharging network, and energy storage and solar products​.\n\nHowever, specific points of emphasis or additional risks may have been highlighted in one quarter over the other, reflecting the changing business environment and ongoing challenges. Key factors mentioned in the forward-looking statements include uncertainties in macroeconomic and regulatory conditions, risks associated with product launches and manufacturing, growth management, consumer demand, and supply chain dynamics. These factors suggest that while Tesla's strategic vision remains steady, they are aware of and actively managing various risks and uncertainties that could impact their future performance.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Q4 will save us", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "https://x.com/financialjuice/status/1723092414380835202?s=20\n\nNext week will be interesting.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Moodys downgrades the horse after its dead", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Happy Diwali lounge!", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://x.com/dirtytesla/status/1723739270874042646?s=46&t=mG-wx8ewMg03AyZIsmD4-g\n\nCypertruck will be an awesome vehicle.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "People hating on cybertruck for off road performance are gonna hate no matter what", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Too many reviews and vids.\n\nHaters will always find an angle.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "With standard tires and it’s a truck.

Others cite not wanting to spend $ at Tesla, because they feel the $ would support Elon and therefore enable more trolling and conspiracy theories on Twitter.\n\nElon can make this situation right by:\n\n* **Stopping further personal attacks on people** (like Yoel Roth and Dr. Fauci).  Elon's attack on Roth was particularly egregious because Elon deliberately misrepresented Roth's academic work.  I know from Elon's past statements re: lying short sellers, that he is well aware of what does and doesn't constitute credible sources and accurate information\n* **Stopping his encouragement and/or spread of conspiracy theories.**  I've seen Elon tweet things like \"interesting\" or \"concerning\" or \"!\" to boost visibility of propaganda.  This is usually in response to something like incomplete info that paints a distorted picture of an event (such as short video clips of the January 6th 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol).  Unsubstantiated tweets about things like the mass shooting in Allen, TX, or George Soros, are other examples\n* He needs to **acknowledge that he's done wrong by people like Roth and Fauci, pledge to do better, and stick to that pledge**.  This won't repair the damage overnight, but I think most people will forgive if he says \"I was wrong to do this\" and stops constantly rubbing inflammatory material in people's faces.  Eventually, the negative association between Elon's Twitter behavior, and Tesla's brand, should dissipate, if people no longer feel like $ spent at Tesla is supporting a culture of bullying and disinformation.   \n\nElon Musk can get back some of those potential customers he's alienated.

For some people, the entertainment value or \"pwning the libs\" from Elon's antics, may even be worth the loss of 1% of their net worth.   \n* People who are still in the relatively early stages of asset accumulation with few shares can also easily dismiss the effects of Elon's behavior on their portfolios, because they think they still have a lot of time before they need gains.  Some are even gleeful and openly characterize the misfortune of others being margin called, as an opportunity to pick up shares.  \n   * Many of the Tesla\\_Charts crowd claim they won't need wealth for many years.  Are they still going to be singing that tune in 2032-2033 if they become wealth from TSLA, only to have Elon do something stupid that trashes their net worth in short order?  Can they time the market and exit their TSLA shares in time?\n   * Older people, like Nateleb1234, may not have time to make up for losses.  Yes, individual stocks are volatile.  However, it is extremely abnormal for a company to have a CEO who repeatedly kicks shareholders in the face with violations of fiduciary duty. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't look down on people who have fewer shares.  When I participated at Tesla Motors Club forums 10 years ago, I was close to the bottom in terms of share count. \n\n \n\nHowever, I recognize that differences in amount of $ at risk and differences in time horizon, lead to vastly different incentives for people here.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "To clarify though, i am not calling you out on this.

Yes there are some “simps” with a relatively low tesla allocation. I dont think that discounts their POV whether or not i agree with their opinions.

Literally. Does that make my opinions and ideas superior to yours?\n\nYour second point on people thinking they have a long runway. \n\nIt is a differing POV versus some of the older investors. And that doesn’t take away from their right to have that opinion. It is a bet nontheless that may not work out by 2030, 2035, 2040. And hence should not be dismissed. \n\nIt would be the same as someone 30 years old telling a 50 year old investor “pfft sucks to be you lmao old man get good.” \n\nDoes it suck for older investors that their retirement is under threat? Yes.

So I had to solve that issue ASAP, plus I wanted more Mario after Wonder. I'm gonna be on a Mario bender all month because I'll be playing Super Mario RPG in a week too.\n\nSuper Mario Odyssey was almost a launch title, releasing about 6 months after the Switch. And let me just get this out of the way now, it really looks like a launch title. I respect Nintendo's decision to make this game run at 60 fps and to their credit, it always locks 60 fps with no drops anywhere. That said, this game has not aged well technically. When docked, it runs with dynamic resolution scaling from 900p all the way down to 720p with no anti-aliasing. I did not play it handheld but I'm told it runs with scan-line interleaving so the Switch only needs to render 640x720 every frame. Resolution is painfully coarse, jagged lines are everywhere with no AA, and there is only flat lighting on environments. I'm also not super happy with the some of the artistic decisions made in this game, the choice to use environments based on the real world tends to make the visual look of the game sometimes worse in some of the worlds.\n\nAlright, enough with the technical shit. Let's talk about playing Odyssey. For those who don't really follow the 3D Mario games, Super Mario 64 and Sunshine have sandbox type worlds which you explore on your own to reach the goal. Galaxy and 3D World are more linear, where you start at point A and traverse the world as a straight line to reach the goal. In that regard, Galaxy and 3D World are kind of like 3D versions of classic side-scrolling 2D Mario. Odyssey returns to the free roaming exploration of 64 and Sunshine, except thankfully no FLUDD. It is in every way the true sequel to the vaunted 64, complete with sometimes unworkable camera angles and inability to see Mario's position in space when you're trying to do some tricky platforming. That said, Odyssey brings back that spirit of creativity and freedom to problem solve that so exemplified playing 64. Playing Odyssey was like going back to my childhood memories of 64 in much the same way playing Wonder was with Super Mario World, that same joy and imagination and occasional frustration when Mario missed a jump because I couldn't see his shadow under him which was the only way to tell where he would land. Just like Wonder, Odyssey has that pure inexpressible fun that is so noticeably absent from a lot of modern video games.\n\nAs per usual with 3D Mario games, you collect items called Power Moons. Once you have enough of them, you can hop aboard your airship also named the Odyssey and progress on to the next world. Each of the worlds is unique, imaginative, and creative, even as some of them are a little bit strange to run Mario through. You visit a perfectly normal looking human city with normally proportioned human NPC's walking around with Mario who of course has his Mario proportions and I'm reminded of why the Sonic games which have human cities and humans alongside Sonic also look weird. The game's worlds seem to improve in both visual quality and artistic direction as it goes on, the first couple of worlds look really rough but the last few worlds look really good by comparison. Clearly, Odyssey evolved quite a bit during its development just going by how much more visually pleasing the last few worlds look compared to the first few worlds.\n\nJust as with Wonder, you constantly find yourself surprised by the sheer imagination by which new methods are given to you to explore and reach goals. The primary mechanic in Odyssey is using Cappy the sentient hat to possess and control enemies. Finally, you can experience what it's like to be a Goomba, or a Koopa Paratroopa, or most of the other classic enemies on the Mario list of villains. The football players from Super Mario World even make an appearance and you can bet it's amazing when you play as those guys. At the very end, you even get to possess and control the Big Cheese himself and it's a fucking riot to run around smashing through walls and breaking shit as Bowser. They absolutely nailed the creativity of controlling enemies and using them to navigate and explore the worlds. Just as the Wonder Flowers elevated Wonder to a new level of 2D platforming gameplay, the Cappy possession mechanic elevates Odyssey to a new level of 3D platforming gameplay and clearly differentiates and innovates beyond 64.\n\nPart of me wishes I had played this back in 2017, but the other part of me knows that in 2023 I have a Switch Pro controller and that really made my experience of playing this game much better over what I would have had to deal with playing this game with the Joy-Cons. The motion controls are already slightly annoying with the Pro controller, I can't imagine putting up with using Joy-Cons to play this game. That's what turned me off Galaxy back in the day too. But Odyssey overcomes it's technical limitations, it's occasionally annoying camera, the slightly obtrusive and unnecessary motion controls, and becomes a masterpiece because of the sheer amount of fun that you will have exploring it's many worlds and discovering what wild shit you can do as a Bullet Bill or a Podoboo. I can now say I played two GOTY Mario games in 1 year.\n\nFinal Rating: 2017 GOTY/10", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I can't wait to see how well the Mario RPG remake plays on the steam deck.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hate it or love it, but the simps will financially come out on top in a few years.\n\nMost of them just DCA into shares, while masturbating to Elon's interviews.
