With $6Bln over the next decade it just feels like they’re throwing cash at a demand problem (remodeling their cruise lines which has suffered since Covid), and they had to leverage up to do so. Very risky since remodeling hotels and ships won’t necessarily increase demand for said segments. Not like Disney is known for deferred maintenance in the quality of their experiences.\n\nTheir media segment has really become a joke. Disney with their cost of production being materially higher than the rest of the industry was never meant for 1-2 solid movies a year.\n\nIn my opinion their biggest strength is their intangibles. Their cash flow per share is about 2-3x net tangible assets per share, which tells you the bulk of their cash flow is generated from intangibles. \n\nThey totally overpaid for Fox though. Took their ROIC down to the 3%-5% level, it’s been there since, and that’s very mediocre. It’s the same range when you add the cost for the remainder of HULU, and consider 100% of the cash flow that generates. They’ll be lucky to see EPS be around 2018 levels by 2033. Especially against the uphill battle of wage inflation and labor unions. If they do return to 2018 levels in 10 years then it’s a pretty solid opportunity. \n\nBut this is a lot of “what if”. And I don’t invest when an opportunity is based on “what if”. It’s possible they could end up pulling a Kaiser Industries and spin off a lot of what they have, to really unlock value for shareholders, but I doubt that.

{"title": "I have seen the 8th Wonder of the World", "selftext": "And it's in Las Vegas.  \n\n(**TLDR at bottom for those who want to cut to the financial details**).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor several years now, I've been visiting the city, and occasionally finding myself driving past an enormous, enigmatic structure.  The thing loomed in the former empty space next to Wynn Resort, and at first glance, it looked only like an oddly-round building.\n\nAfter seeing it a few times, I eventually asked an Uber driver what I was looking at, and he told me it was something called \"The Sphere\".  He said they had been building it for a while, that no one really knew what it was exactly, or when construction would be complete.  I nodded and looked at it warily, assuming it would just be another neon-lit casino, adding to the clutter of the Strip.  It really was unremarkable at the time.  Hulking, jet black, covered in steel scaffolding.  Frankly, it looked boring.  Then I forgot about it for a while.\n\nMonths passed, and in September, a little over a month ago, I found myself back in Vegas to attend the Magic the Gathering 30th Anniversary celebration.  I stayed at Palazzo, just a few miles from the convention center.  My daily commute to and from the event saw me driving past Sphere several times, though initially just in the daytime.  I didn't actually see the thing in full darkness until the end of my second day.  \n\nI will remember this the rest of my life, it was truly that incredible.  It was around 8:30 PM, late enough to be completely dark.  I was heading back to Palazzo in a cab.  We left the Convention Center, and eventually made a turn onto Sands Avenue.  As we made the turn, I looked up from the phone in my lap, just as the Eighth Wonder of the World swung into view.\n\nThere are no words to properly convey that moment.  It was that breathtaking, that overwhelming, that surreal and wonderful and annihilating.  A huge portion of my field of view was occupied by what I can only call a tiny Sun.  Yes, an actual literal star, about 500 feet wide, sitting directly in front of me in downtown Las Vegas.  \n\nI've spent hours looking at filtered video of the real Sun.  I've watched its churning eddies, the roiling, seething coils of plasma and gas boiling and frothing at its surface.  I've stared transfixed at those videos over the years, imagining the noise and the violence of the thing.  The indescribable energy pouring off of it, the obliterating heat. Apparently the Sun fuses around 600 million tons of Hydrogen every second, yet in its entire 5.5 billion year lifespan so far, it's consumed less than 1% of its total fuel.  It had always been an abstraction to me, an ambiguous thing far, far away that only occupied a tiny portion of the daylight sky.  \n\nThen suddenly I'm looking at the Sun, right up close. \n\nThe cab continued on as the Sun filled more and more of my field of view.  Eventually we were right next to it, the dancing, writhing orange and yellow light filling the car.  There was no heat of course, but the illusion endured even up close.  I unconsciously pressed my face up against the cab's window as we slowly drove by, eyes rolling to trace the curvature of the star as it arced high up above me.  Then we turned another corner, and it slipped from view.\n\nI was speechless.  I stared straight ahead into the back of the passenger seat in front of me, attempting to process what had happened.  I felt breathless, and reached my hand to my chest, felt my heart racing there, adrenaline still coursing through my body.  I'm almost 49, and as a very seasoned traveler, I'd never seen anything like it. Ever.\n\nOver the next two days, I went and looked at Sphere as often as possible, from many different angles and from different distances.  I determined the structure is probably best viewed from about a quarter mile away, where it's gigantic, but not overwhelming.  \n\nApparently Sphere uses an AI art system developed by renowned digital artist Refik Anadol to create what it displays to the public.  Suffice to say, his work is astonishing, meshing perfectly with the capabilities and aesthetics of the structure.   Over the time I watched it, it transformed from the photorealistic to the abstract, from a glistening, blinking eyeball as big as a small mountain to a whimsical, flowing tapestry of blue and green that reminded me of octopus skin.  No matter what vantage point I had, I always found myself surrounded by transfixed tourists.  It's almost impossible to look at Sphere without being stunned.\n\nThe venue opened formally to the public at the beginning of October.  It's nearing the end of hosting a lengthy concert series by U2, and will likely be sold out for performing venues for the next century, assuming Vegas stays open for business.  It will be selling ad space on its surface to help with monetization, though it'll likely make more revenue from hosting events in its 18,000 person arena.  I haven't been inside the building yet, but praise for the early concerts there was beyond glowing.  Social media the world over is flooded by photos and videos of this thing as more and more people experience it.\n\nSphere's impact on Vegas itself will probably be transformational as well.  Consider how many people flock to cities like Paris, Berlin and Seattle to see mundane landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Brandenburg Gate, and the Space Needle, respectively.  Old, tired relics of a dead age that just betray expectations and bore your children.   When word truly gets out about how insane this thing is, it's going to draw millions more people to the city.  Every person who sees it will tell every person they know; it is impossible not to evangelize the experience.\n\nGuys, I can say unequivocally that Sphere is one of the most incredible things humans have built in the history of our species.   It's the most wondrous single thing I've ever seen on Earth, natural or artificial.  Forget the Great Wall.  Forget the Pyramids, the Coliseum, the Grand Canyon, the Space Shuttle and Niagara Falls.   Those things are remarkable and even wondrous, but they pale in comparison to the majesty of this structure in Vegas.  \n\nIf you haven't seen Sphere for yourself yet, it's worth the trip.  There is nothing like it on the planet, and I think the stock is extremely undervalued.  It could make a tremendous investment opportunity for the community, and unlike so many of the mediocre companies promoted here for the memes and the lulz, it's actually worthy of the attention.  \n\n**TLDR:**\n\nSPHR (Sphere's company) opened an 18,000-seat arena in Oct 2023 with sold-out U2 concerts for months.  Initial \"losses\" in the media were due to final $95M construction costs, not a consequence of operations.  Despite a $2.3B investment, SPHR's market cap is just $1.26B with a low P/E ratio of 2.04. The stock has grown 60% in six months. I've heavily invested and believe in its potential. Read the above for a more thorough breakdown.

They just keep the area generally clean and help customers deal with random issues at the kiosks as needed.  Big thumbs up there, you have anywhere from 1-8 other lines you can get in if you have a larger checkout order or just need more assistance, but overall, paying Target for their crap I bought is a reasonable experience.\n\nHome Depot is another example of self-checkout done well.  They have 1 person for every ~4 checkout lanes and they don't actually have full service lanes at the front anymore because those employees can manage pretty much everything you would need, and if you need more, you can go to a service desk or something to get more assistance, which you would likely do anyway, whether self-checkout existed or not.\n\nBut at all the grocery stores in our area all of a sudden, they went from their ~10 self checkout lanes with 2 employees managing them and their 2-5 full lanes open to having 10 of the regular small self checkout kiosks and 2 full self-checkout lanes, often with 0-2 people staffed to manage the whole situation with 0 full service lanes available.  On more than one occasion, I have seen literally 0 store employees within eyesight and the lines going all the way back to the wall and wrapping around the corner.  I have witnessed and contributed to dozens of carts just left full of groceries because it is a terrible experience, and that's what really makes me wonder why people aren't just walking out to their cars with these carts full of groceries instead.  You do all your work gathering your groceries, and then you're supposed to wait in an excessive line because they just aren't properly manning their store, everything is a mess, there are dozens of people around, everyone is frustrated, and yet... we all maintain decorum and wait our turn to pay our $100+ bill to the grocery overlords.\n\nNow, obviously, this is regional.  You go to different grocery stores in different neighborhoods, and some of those places HAVE to have proper staffing or the whole store would be robbed blind.

It's a tricky cycle for sure – the struggle between the desire for instant gratification versus investing for the future. But in a roundabout way, you're touching on an interesting point many people often overlook: savings. I mean, if your savings aren't keeping up with inflation, they're losing value. In the current climate, you have a pretty good point. \n\nA way to counteract this is by looking into high yield savings accounts. Most conventional savings accounts offer measly interest rates, close to 0%. But there are some accounts out there offering significantly higher rates, around 5% in fact. By placing your money into a high yield savings account, at least your money will be working a bit harder for you, and it might help outpace inflation. \n\nNot all banks are created equal though, so it's important to look around and compare.

I have been in tech and financial services so at a minimum, say you are interested in something the company does, doesn’t have to be a specific job. Main thing is just don’t be one of the herd and say idk and ask about company culture and what we do. Go to career fairs as a freshman and even if you don’t get anything, the experience of speaking to “adults” will be valuable for the next fair.\n\nLastly, when you start to get into Jr / Sr courses, it’s a lot of projects like a real job is. That is your experience and what you need to have on your resume along with speaking to what the project was, goals, how you went about them and results.

Even though each class had slightly better grades and test scores coming in than the year prior, this was the job matriculation rate at the top 25 school I attended back then.\n\n* In 2007, around 51% of students at my university had found a job before graduation.\n* In 2008, around 17% of students at my university had found a job before graduation.\n* In 2009, around 11% of students at my university had found a job before graduation.\n\nJobs in high-paying fields like finance and law were non-accessible for a while. There was even an article about Harvard Law School reimbursing tuition for students who couldn't find offers at graduation. My cousin, who went to a top 10 law school in 2009, was paid $60K (half salary) by a top law firm to \"sit tight\" for a year. They couldn't afford to pay her market rate, but they didn't want to lose top talent either. It was a weird time. She spent it doing pro-bono work out of Sweden or something.\n\nYou saw a lot of would-be finance bro's hop into tech. Around that time you had the rise of coding bootcamps, and a lot of success stories of people making $20K as a barista transitioning to $80K+ entry-level software developer jobs with no previous background in just 3-6 months. It was a $3B-$4B cottage industry that sprouted up out of the lack of preparation colleges had provided students for the job market.\n\nStill, home prices were outpacing salaries even during the financial crisis and any millennial who tried to do the math on living the American Dream (wedding, destination honeymoon, 2.5 kids, private school tuition, 3 bed/3 bath w/ outdoor space, Benz for the Mrs., Range for the Mr., etc.) realized there was no way our meager entry level salaries of $40K-$50K and nonexistent savings could ever pay for all that, even if we tripled it in 10 years. \n\nFew had learned how to invest, and no one trusted big finance institutions after the banks failed, which created the opportunity for fintechs like Bitcoin and Robinhood to emerge in the first place. At the same time, we saw the rise of the sharing and on-demand economies... Uber, Airbnb, Task Rabbit, Door Dash, etc. We also saw the rise of Instagram, which combined with Airbnb, put 100s of overlooked but (then) affordable destinations on the map... Lisbon, Cartagena, etc.\n\nThat's when millennial aspirations really started shifting from things like cars that said \"Look at how successful I am!\" to experiences like travel that said \"Look at the cool shit I'm doing\"/\"Look at the cool shit I've done.\" Add dating apps to the mix, and the fact that Uber had turned even luxury cars into a service commodity, and the well-stamped passport became our generation's S500.\n\nThe trend was born out of the harsh economic reality the millennials would never do as well financially as their parents (without inheritance), but it also seemed like a solution to a cultural problem millennials had long identified in older generations as well. That is, success does not equal happiness, and there's no point waiting until you're old and grey to finally start enjoying life.\n\nHence, the slogan, \"YOLO.\"\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that millennials have gotten A LOT more focused on investing as they hit their mid 30's and early 40's and start raising families. If remote work survives the current pendulum swing back to the office, I think you'll see a lot of single millennials and Gen Z leave the US on an American salary and grow roots elsewhere in the world like LATAM, SEA, Eastern EUR, AFR, etc.\n\nThey'll settle in places where you can still comfortably save your way to retirement rather than being forced to invest your way to retirement.

Or at a minimum make use of the AI tools available to you to make processes more efficient. The less time you use to do menial tasks, the more time you'll have to either make money or sip margaritas by the beach.  \n* Study Human Behavior\n   * Take classes in history, economics and psychology, maybe even sociology if you're really into it. The hardest challenges people face in business and life are more often \"why\" questions than they are \"how\" questions. Study the \"Why.\"\n* Study Business & Market Dynamics\n   * The best way to get wealthy is to obtain ownership stakes in appreciating assets.

While the global uranium supply is in a structural deficit that can't be solved in a year time.", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe know that the global annual uranium supply is in a structural deficit, that can't be solved in a year time and not at today's low uranium price (\\~75USD/lb)\n\nThe uranium market is in a structural global deficit and it can’t be solved in 12 months time.\n\nIn fact, the Total amount uranium needed for short term delivery is much bigger than the Total amount uranium available for short term delivery, while uranium demand is price inelastic.\n\nMany projects (needed to solve the global deficit) need a sustainable uranium price of \\~90USD/lb (other experts talk about 100 - 120 USD/lb), and projects need years of permitting and mine construction before starting uranium production.\n\nAnd because the uranium demand is price inelastic, the uranium spotprice is most likely going significantly higher in coming months.\n\n[https://blog.gorozen.com/blog/uranium-market-update-forecast](https://blog.gorozen.com/blog/uranium-market-update-forecast)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn December 2006 the uranium spotprice was around 72 USD/lb, in February 2007 around 75USD/lb, in June 2007 139USD/lb.\n\nBut between 2007 and today there was a lot of inflation, so 75 USD/lb early 2007 isn't the same as \\~75 USD/lb today\n\nBack in February 2007 the sector had enough with 55-60 USD/lb to have a global supply and demand in equilibrium. Yet the uranium spotprice went from 72 to 139 in 7 months time. How come?\n\nThe utilities increased their uranium spotbuying because they were a bit worried about the uranium supply in 2008-2010. And the uranium spotmarket was, and is even more today, a very tiny market.\n\nToday with all the inflation and Labour shortage a sustainable uranium price of \\~90USD/lb (other experts talk about 100 - 120 USD/lb) is needed to get global supply and demand in equilibrium again over time (It will take many years to achieve equilibrium again, because it take many years to restart and build enough new uranium mines).\n\nAnd today there actually is a structural deficit, not just a worry! By consequence, the uranium spotprice is likely to significantly overshoot the needed \\~90USD/lb (other experts talk about 100 - 120 USD/lb) uranium spotprice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But what about the evolution of global nuclear fleet?**\n\nEarly 2007: 435 operable reactors worldwide (total running reactors: 368,860Mwe), 28 reactors under construction and 64 reactors planned.\n\nToday: 436 operable reactors worldwide (total running reactors: 364,586Mwe (391k -27k)), 61 reactors under construction and 112 reactors planned.\n\nSource: World nuclear association\n\nThose 27k Mwe are from remaining 22 Japanese reactors not restarted yet + 6 Ukrainian reactors.\n\nJapan already restarted 11 of the 33 operable Japanese reactors and want to restart the remaining 22 reactors faster now = Unexpected additional uranium demand.\n\nAll German reactors are closed today, Germany can’t close them twice\n\nThe last 2 years many countries did a U-turn in favor of nuclear power (South Korea, France, Sweden, Belgium, The Netherlands, California, ...) which resulted in unexpected licence extensions of many existing reactors and new plans to build new reactors in the future.\n\nThe licence extensions (France, Belgium, Spain, South Korea, California, ...) of existing reactors have an immediat impact on the uranium demand.\n\nAnd India and China are massively building new reactors! Others building reactors are Turkey, Russia, Egypt, ...\n\nChina builds reactors on time and close to budget\n\nToday China has 55 reactors running and 25 under construction,but only \\~4.9Mlbs domestic uranium prod = Huge supply insecurity for China, so China is rushing to buy all uranium they can get before western utilities rush into the sector to restock and to renew their old LT contracts.\n\nAnd the global uranium supply isn’t ready for this, while it already is a structural global uranium supply deficit.\n\n**This isn't financial advice.
