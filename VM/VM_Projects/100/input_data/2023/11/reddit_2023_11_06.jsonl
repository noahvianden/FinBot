IDK, AAPL went from near bankruptcy to the Most Valuable Company in the World by disrupting entire industries. So, tinkering around the edges is not going to generate any kind of spectacular growth. In all likely hood AAPL is well past its dynamic growth stage, trees do not grow to the sky...\n\n**How did Steve Jobs turn Apple around?**\n\nThe company was founded in 1976 by two young computer programmers, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Its second product, the Apple II, was the first personal computer to achieve mass-market success. The Macintosh, released in 1984, introduced the modern graphical user interface to the mainstream.\n\nApple began to struggle after its board fired Steve Jobs from the company in 1985. When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, it was close to bankruptcy. Then Jobs led a spectacular recovery, introducing the iPod in 2001.\n\nWhen Steve Jobs took the reins at Apple in 1997, the company was in tough shape. It had a bewildering array of products, no clear strategy, and was losing tens of millions of dollars every quarter.\n\nIn 2001, Apple released the iPod music player. Customers loved its elegant click-wheel interface. More importantly, the iPod worked seamlessly with iTunes, Apple's jukebox software for the Mac, making it easy to get music from CDs (and, later, from the iTunes music store) onto their iPods. By the end of the decade, Apple had sold more than 200 million iPods.\n\n**The iPod had a profound impact on the music industry**\n\nHere are some key iPod points:\n\nDigital Revolution: The iPod, coupled with iTunes, transformed the music industry by promoting legal digital music downloads1. This had a ripple effect on the entire music industry.\n\nPortability and Personalization: The iPod made music portable and personal, leading to the decline of CD players and the Sony Walkman.\n\nReshaping the Music Industry: In 2001, the music industry was riven by piracy and had no idea how to solve it. The iPod, launched by Steve Jobs, created a digital music market and made Apple into a titan.\n\n**Sales: In 2007, 48% of Apple’s $7.1 billion record quarterly revenue came from the iPod.**\n\nUser Experience: The real advantage of the iPod was its integration with iTunes. Unlike other MP3 players, which required users to drag music files into folders, iTunes allowed you to sync your music automatically to an iPod.\n\nSo, the iPod not only changed how we listen to music but also reshaped the music industry in a more fundamental way.\n\n**Apple Inc. product sales breakdown 2023**\n\nApple Inc.'s product sales breakdown in 2023 shows a significant shift in the company’s revenue sources. Here are some key points:\n\n**iPhone:** The iPhone has been the highest grossing product for Apple Inc. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, **iPhone sales accounted for 48.5 percent of the company’s overall revenue.** This was the largest share of all Apple products.\n\nServices: Over the years, services have made a growing contribution to Apple’s net sales. In 2023, Apple Services was the second largest division, responsible for 22% of revenue.\n\niPad and Mac: In 2022, 232 million iPhones, 61 million iPads and 26 million Mac and MacBook units were sold.\n\n**Wearables,** Home and Accessories: This category has also contributed to Apple’s revenue.

It would have a lower PE ratio and a reasonable valuation based on assets and revenue sources. They might have a predictable but low revenue growth. To account for that, they pay out shareholders (who are part owners of the company, remember) a dividend that might be 3-5% give or take of the share price. It is based on revenue, though, and tends to be stable. Money paid out is also money that can not be revoked. \n\nLarge banks are an example. Hard to keep growing fast, but typically predictable and safe earnings. \n\nA growth company is typically valued higher because shareholders are basing the share price today on tomorrow's returns. A growth company that is large enough will struggle to maintain a forward lofty valuation. Rather than have their valuation (share price) drop, they can buy back shares as a temporary measure to support share price. \n\nDepending on the company, they may buy shares with debt (very common over the past few years), which is a risk in a high rate environment. It also means that the valuation, which was based on forward growth, is now based on hopeful further constraint of share supply. Even if the money was from profits, we now have a company inflating valuation above where it should be, to no guaranteed return for the investor.\n\nRemember, just because a share buyback happens one quarter, it may not the next. If a buy back is helping hold a stock price high, that is more risk to share price, which you only get when you cash out.\n\nSo, dividends tend to be paid from established, low growth companies. Investors do not expect high growth, which means lower share price appreciation. Dividends are paid from profits. A dividend paid is money in your account. \n\nBuy backs are often from companies that are trying to maintain a valuation. They couldn't figure out a way to grow the business, and they might not have stable enough profits to raise the dividend, so they bought their own shares. They might have taken on debt to do so.

But long term that won’t last and the Chinese giants will ratchet up prices.

The argument for 4680 is there if you need to power optimize instead of energy optimize, or if you need to energy optimize beyond the capacity of iron based chemistry and need the additional cooling for NMC. But then you don’t have the volume density prismatic. \n\nCATL and BYD are not stupid. 90 percent of all volume will be LFP.

The initial cells seem to be maybe even less energy dense than current 2170s, but 4680 still wins out at the pack level due to being a “structural battery.”  Then they start nudging the “knobs” along to progress towards the goals they outlined, mostly in the cell chemistry — for example, the first cells seem to have very little silicon content in the anode, so they will surely be ramping that up over time.  \n\nThis is all based on what I learned from watching the YouTube channel The Limiting Factor.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Another big factor is that the CapEx to setup the factory is much smaller.

Zelensky has been cool with Azov, even to the point of drawing international criticism for giving them a political platform, but when the reality of Ukraine's dire military situation settles in, and funding dries up, will he be as willing or will it be as practical to fight as they are?  What does Azov, the faction that has openly threatened Ukrainian presidents who aren't willing to fight before, do then?  Their history and world history shows that executing him is well within the realm of possibility.  \n\nFor three - The west and Zelensky have led the people of Ukraine down the primrose path.   Hundreds of thousands of young Ukrainians now lie dead.  How much do the people of western Ukraine who sent their children to die care about eastern Ukraine?  When the reality of the fact that Zelensky could have negotiated their way out of the war if he'd have been willing to give up Donbas and how the timeline of that coincided with the tens of thousands who died in places like Bakhmut, only for it to go to the Russians in the end anyways, how do they feel?  \n\nI could go on, but lucky for me I remember you're on the opposite side of this argument.

{"title": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Hits Record $157 Billion Cash", "selftext": "In short Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger, two of the greatest investors of all time leading one of the largest funds in the world just increased their cash position yet again this last quarter to $157 Billion. This would put their cash position at now over 20% of total assets under management which is totalling $746 Billion. Could Berkshire be preparing for an acquisition or a recession next year?\n\n**Case for Acquisition:**\n\nBerkshire Hathaway does have a strong history of acquisitions, some of Berkshire's most notable acquisitions are Geico, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom, Duracell, and more. That being said their most expensive acquisition ever to date was \" Precision Castparts Corp. \" in 2016 for $37 Billion. This would mean the current cash of $157 billion would be over 4 times more cash then their largest acquisition to date. And would be enough cash to purchase a company as large as Disney, IBM, or Verizon just for example.\n\nThat being said Berkshire Hathaway has only made a single acquisition since 2018 (Alleghany Corporation in 2022). Berkshire used to average more than one acquisition per year but since has severely dropped off.\n\n**Case for Recession:**\n\nWarren Buffet also increased his cash position before potential recessions and has a decent history of predicting these. As Warren Buffet has always beat the market during bear markets. [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/05/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-has-been-a-fortress-stock-during-recessions-and-bear-markets-heres-how.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/05/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-has-been-a-fortress-stock-during-recessions-and-bear-markets-heres-how.html)\n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nI believe that based on their huge acquisition falloff in recent history for Berkshire Hathaway, it does not make sense they are preparing to make by far their largest acquisition ever. But instead preparing for a bear market early to mid next year as Buffet has done in the past. And even if they did make a large acquisition (30-40 billion) they would still be holding way more cash than average.\n\nBased off this I am personally increasing my cash position in my own portfolio and selling off some my more risky assets in preparation for a 2024 bear market.
