I'm from the UK so ESPN doesn't broadcast here anymore however from what I've read about ESPN people are annoyed at the presenters not being from a sport background and talking about 'woke' issues. Disney needs to move away from woke issues to re-attract its previous customers. I think ESPN also needs to play hard-ball in negotiations with the leagues as others have rightly mentioned the environment has changed - streaming brings in less revenue than cable TV and so the sports rights should be reduced to compensate for that.

That's ok. It happens. Hell, I wish I could have bought target when it went public, but I wasn't born. FOMO is a great way to panic and make mistakes, \"oh no, everyone is making money over there! I should do it too!\" That's the fast track to buying high and selling low.\n\nBuy the company not the price.\n     If you think the company is great and has a good position and leadership, buy it despite the price. Tons of trash companies get super high prices (meme stocks anyone? Companies caught in an industry's bubble?) and loads of great companies get their price slammed and it's ok. An example? Clorox. In mid August they revealed they were victims of a cyber attack. This company makes bleach (obviously it's a huge conglomeration that makes a ton of stuff). My thinking is that Clorox deals in physical things people want. Not just want, but things people almost need. Data breach? Fuck it I'm buying in. Good company, good dividend, tons of bad press that I think is a very temporary issue.  I bought it October 23. I'm up 16%. They pay a reliable dividend so I'm planning on just hanging out and holding it.\n\nDivorce emotions from investing.\n     This one can be hard. For me, it resulted in losing money time after time after time because I couldn't follow rules 1 or 2. Then, I also started investing a little less. This meant I had more money day to day to pay my bills and I realized I could lose all the money I'm investing, and still be fine. I have my 401(k) and my job. Now I'm able to look at my investments without emotion. It's crazy. I bought Boeing at all time highs. The week before their 737 or 787 (can't remember) started having issues. Then followed by Covid. The stock TANKED. I wasn't upset at all. I just bought more to dollar cost average. My stocks that are in the red. I honestly laugh at them and don't worry about it.\n\nMake sure you can sleep at night.\n     Much easier if you've mastered #3. But don't make any investments that distract you. Did you buy a stock and then obsessively check the price right after you bought it. And kept checking it? Ever started really worrying about your recent investments? Probably not things you should be investing in then.\n\nLast, pick a strategy and stick with it.\n     Any normal boring investment strategy. Value, growth, dividend, 60/40, 50/50, literally whatever (other than chasing price). All strategies go through slower periods and more successful periods. And that's ok. Think of the slower down periods as your strategy being on sale.\n\n\n\nAll of these are easier said than done.

The rest can be made from off the shelf components. and the plastics can be built by a 3D printer.\n\nYou can build your own.
