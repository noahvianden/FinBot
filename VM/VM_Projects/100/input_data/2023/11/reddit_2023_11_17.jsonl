INTC has been lagging and with AI hype and new graphics alternatives to AMD/Nvidia I think they will increase market share.

Thing is, I'm also bearish overall on S&P500, not with longterm outlook, but questionable soft landing and either way I think earnings have peaked for now.  If the market wants to correct and companies have to cut spending chip makers will probably be hurt by overall decreased demand.  Short term negative, AI long term positive.

One of the original purpose of bonds as part of one's portfolio especially for those close to retirement, is if an economic slowdown happens, bonds will keep their value as equities fall. Of course bonds by themselves have an opportunity cost because over the long term they will never have as high returns as risk assets. However as one purpose of bonds is to hedge an equity portfolio and they usually have uncorrelated returns to equities, it is possible to use responsible leverage to maximize risk-adjusted returns as long as the negative correlation holds. This negative correlation historically is apparent during easing cycles and correlation becomes less negative, even positive, during inflationary cycles. As it is increasingly likely we are at the end of an inflationary cycle, the probability for an additional hike reached almost 0% yesterday, bonds will likely be a nice ballast to a risky equity portfolio. As such, increasing bonds, even applying leverage, should increase risk-adjusted returns. A good way to do this is probably through futures such as /zt, the 2-year duration, as it is highly correlated to fed funds rate and there is decent capital appreciation once short term interest rates fall in anticipation of an economic slowdown.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Problem is arguably bonds are already priced for 3% FFR.

This means if inflation isn't going parabolic again, the 2-year should at least be capped at 5%, it is currently at 4.9%. In fact with all the hand-wrigging the past months about inflation going up again, 4.9% rGDP, US debt levels, international selling, bond vigilantes, government shutdown, the 2-year hasn't really gone anywhere and did not dis-invert to the FFR. It was only long duration that moved up, which made a lot of sense as this move was likely due to high rGDP. I posited that the 30-year could not move past much higher than 5% as long as the 2-year did not move higher and this was confirmed with the 30-year holding above 5% for only a few days. So no, bonds are surely not \"priced for 3% FFR.\" Perhaps the long duration has less to fall since a recession isn't expected. Since the Fed is likely to hold for at least 6 months, it's possible the 2-year yield will test 5% again and that would be a decent buying opportunity for a nice equity hedge.

The company will be conducting a search for the permanent CEO successor. A spokesperson for OpenAI didn’t immediately return The Verge’s call for comment. \n\nThis is an extremely sudden turn of events. Just last week, Altman keynoted at the company’s DevDay conference, where it announced a suite of major new updates to compete with other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google. OpenAI arguably kickstarted the current AI arms race with last year’s hugely-popular ChatGPT.\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested billions in OpenAI, tells The Verge it will continue to partner with the company. “We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,” according to a statement sent by Microsoft spokesperson Frank Shaw.\n\nAltman has reportedly talked with Jony Ive, Apple’s former chief design officer, about making the “iPhone of artificial intelligence,” though Altman downplayed those rumors at a recent Wall Street Journal conference. He’s also the biggest shareholder in Humane, which just launched orders for its Humane AI Pin.\n\nAltman was a co-founder of OpenAI and initially served as a co-chair of the company alongside Elon Musk. Musk left in 2018 to avoid a conflict of interest with Tesla. \n\nOpenAI also announced that co-founder Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board, though Brockman will remain at the company.", "id": "17xolry", "created_utc": 1700253915.0, "score": 969, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 322, "comments": [{"body": "Interesting Friday\n\nFACEBOOK'S $META HEAD OF AUGMENTED REALITY SOFTWARE IS LEAVING COMPANY - Reuters\n\nSam is no longer CEO and Greg has stepped down from the Board.\n\nJim Chanos, Short Seller Who Took on Enron and Tesla, to Close Hedge Funds - WSJ", "score": 178, "replies": []}, {"body": "WHAAAAT.

According to some news reports¹², the board of directors of OpenAI announced the decision on Friday, November 17, 2023, on the OpenAI website. The board did not provide any specific reason for the ousting, but said that they \"appreciate Sam's contributions to OpenAI and wish him well in his future endeavors.\" Some of the possible factors that may have led to Altman's firing are:\n\n- **Conflict with Elon Musk**: Altman and Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but had a falling out over the direction and vision of the company. Musk resigned from the board of directors in 2018, citing potential conflicts of interest with his other ventures, such as Tesla and SpaceX. Since then, Musk has been openly critical of OpenAI, accusing it of being a \"maximum profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft\" and not caring about AI safety⁴⁵. Altman has defended OpenAI, calling Musk a \"jerk\" and \"totally wrong\" about the company⁴. The tension between the two may have influenced the board's decision to fire Altman.\n- **Controversial investments and partnerships**: OpenAI has received billions of dollars in funding from various sources, including Microsoft, which invested $1 billion in 2019 and became the exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI's services. Some critics, including Musk, have questioned the alignment of OpenAI's mission to create \"beneficial and trustworthy\" AI with its reliance on corporate funding and partnerships. OpenAI has also faced scrutiny for its involvement in controversial projects, such as the GPT-3 language model, which has been accused of generating harmful and biased content, and the DALL-E image generator, which has been criticized for infringing on intellectual property rights and violating ethical norms.\n- **Lack of leadership and vision**: Altman has been described as a visionary and influential figure in the tech industry, but also as a controversial and divisive leader. He has been praised for his role in leading Y Combinator, one of the most successful startup accelerators in the world, but also criticized for his involvement in some failed and questionable ventures, such as Loopt, Worldcoin, and Neuralink. Some observers have suggested that Altman may have lacked the skills and experience to lead a complex and ambitious organization like OpenAI, which has grown rapidly in size and scope since its inception. Altman may have also struggled to balance the competing interests and expectations of OpenAI's stakeholders, including its employees, investors, partners, and customers..\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 11/17/2023\n(1) Sam Altman ousted as OpenAI’s CEO. https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/17/sam-altman-is-out-as-openais-ceo/.\n(2) Sam Altman fired as OpenAI CEO.

Perhaps, sure, but then again this is Tesla, not some little unknown company, the mods matter. Then again I didn't let my mods call my top commenters dicksuckers and in the process caused an avalanche of important contributors leave. TL doesn't even remember why it exists. I was there at the beginning, I was part of it, I even tried to negociate with the TIC moderators to prevent the splitting of the communities. In the long run IMO TL became a different version of what it ran away from (and I can be wrong on that, but it's my POV).\n\n**TIC before TL existed:** the mods actually contributed regular material besides shitposting 95% of the time. Lately TIC has been a political shitshow with the lowest comment per members ratio in the daily thread you can find on reddit. The state of TIC today: The mods are mostly only involved in political suppression and spam filtering, most of them dont even own shares and have a strong bearish bias. I pushed for them when I was a mod (a few weeks) to require mods that are actually involved in the community and own stock, that got met with much resistance from moderators who have no business being there in the first place.\n\nFate has it that recently we've often had more comments in the TC quarterly thread on a daily basis than in the TIC daily thread. And then if you actually talk about post substance, there is just no comparison. How about comparing the amount of quality post between the 3 subs in the discussion threads? Now I know what you're going to say, \"You're just the same 5-10 in TC people posting most of the comments\". Well when we were on TL we had as much weight and our comments were just as meaningful, and today here it's not much different with the frequent posters.\n\nOn TC we need little to no moderation, the rules are pretty clear, no drama, try to post comments with a minimum of substance. That's it. The sub is the only Tesla sub where you can have research and investments discussed without being confronted with the emotional ramblings of a bunch of traders. Our community is also split on X, where we exchange just as much as on Reddit.\n\nFinally let me remind you that TC existed well before I left TL and it was made to complement this sub. I made it for the people here. The research was just buried in the noise here so it needed a place to breath and be easily accessible. Again, I could tell you that I left because of the whining but it's not true, I left like others because of the way your moderators behaved and thought something better was possible.\n\nNo hard feelings but this is my opinion. I don't blame you necessarily for your mods.

{"title": "Unpopular opinion: Elon Musk buying Twitter was a genius move", "selftext": "Most people don't realize how valuable is Twitter in general, and for Musk in particular. \n\nLet's start with the general value for any owner: \n\n* Twitter is massive: 0.5 billion monthly users, across much of the world.\n* It it especially popular among influential people: Twitter has the majority of top politicians, scientists, billionaires, writers, celebrities, etc. So, the owner of Twitter has the power to influence the people who run this planet. \n* Twitter is a massive data trove for training powerful artificial intelligence (AI). There are only a few bigger sources of data in the world.  \n\nTwitter is especially useful for Elon Musk:\n\n* The majority of traditional media is biased against him and his companies, for various reasons (from oil lobby to the left-leaning journalists being the majority). In the situation, it's nice to have your own mass media with 0.5 billion readers. \n* Musk's account on Twitter is one the biggest ones by the followers count, and it was so before the acquisition. Currently, he has about 160 million followers. And Twitter is the main PR channel for Musk. Buying Twitter allows him to keep it up and running.\n* Tesla is basically a robots company, making robots on wheels. And the manufacturing process heavily depends on robotics too. To make smarter robots, you need smarter AIs, and for this you need a lot of training data. And Twitter happens to be one of the biggest sources of such data. This could be especially relevant for the Tesla's android project, which supposedly will have the ability to follow instructions in natural language. \n* As I understand, Musk sees the far-left as an enemy of the Western civilization. Owning a major social network allows him to counter this threat, and to promote his political views at scale.\n* And his companies can run ads on Twitter for free.\n* It seems that since the PayPal days, he has the idea of building an \"everything app\", something like one of those extremely popular Chinese apps, where you can do practically everything human-related from a single app, from chatting to sending money to do dating to buy pizza to hire people etc. Twitter seems to be an excellent start for that. \n\nWas it worth 44 billion for Musk? \n\nHis net worth was about 250 billion at the time of the purchase. And his net worth today is again about 250 billion. So, the purchase has basically zero negative effect for him. But he has gained all the listed advantages. \n\nIf I were in his position, I would've made the same decision.", "id": "17xggdk", "created_utc": 1700231811.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 214, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Twitter is a valuable platform with a lot of potential, especially for someone like Elon Musk.

Said loans are also at rock bottom interest rates and I’d be shocked if they aren’t offloaded and restructured at some point in favor of Twitter. He basically bought out a large chunk of the company by leveraging it’s own balance sheet as collateral before he even owned it.\n\nWhat often goes unmentioned though is the advertising component of Twitter. Elon’s rigged it up so that basically all 500M+ users see all of his tweets. Officially, Tesla doesn’t advertise. But unofficially, Twitter has become the greatest advertising chamber ever invented. Ford and GM both spend $3B+ annually on advertising and don’t even get 1/10th the viewership that Elon’s getting every single day on dozens of tweets about tesla products. \n\nIn the past 24 hours he’s linked a Tesla Cybertruck release ad that’s got 37M views, a 3-minute interview with Joe Rogan and The Rock about the amazing features of the Cybertruck with 17M views, and a video of Tesla’s soundproof glass that got 5M views.

It’s very very hard to gain that. Once you have it, you have access to push a new product to 500million people on a daily basis. That’s what gives it the high multiple it deserves.\n\nGoogle tried with Google+, recently meta tried it with threads. They all realised how fucking hard it is to get people to use something. Even if you get people to try, it’s almost impossible to keep them and bring their friends on. The network effect is very very hard to create. You can throw as much money as you want, turns out people are very finicky and set in their own ways. \n\nThis is also why meta paid $19 billion for WhatsApp, which barely made any money back then. Even today, WhatsApp makes a tiny amount of money compared to what meta paid for it. It’s still a fantastic buy as it has such a massive network of users, life in many parts of the world will come to a halt without WhatsApp. \n\n\nTwitter is used by every head of state, every journalist. My family was visiting a rural village in middle of nowhere in india and the town council was tweeting updates about travel restrictions. That’s the kind of global reach that is seriously valuable. That kind of moat has some serious $$$$ value. \n\nTwitter has been very poorly monetised and very poorly utilised. There is so much incredible potential, $44 billion was not as bad of a deal as people think it is.\n\nTwitter should double down on enabling journalists to start directly producing content to uses, cut out these media houses as middle men, enable citizens to become journalists, enable influential people to directly interact with people. There is so much that can be done, it’s such a uniquely powerful company. \n\nJust 3 week back, Iranian supreme leader and Israeli government were tweeting shit at each other publicly for gods sake.

Original X gets acquired by the company that became PayPal in a sweetheart deal in order to take a competitor off the list and consolidate VC funds. Musk's so toxic and ignorant of computer architectures and software engineering that after causing significant personnel problems at the company, they kick him out - triggering his golden parachute - and rename the company to PayPal to rid them of the negative legacy, installing Peter Thiel back in place. (I actually dislike Peter Thiel more than Musk, so it actually pains me to write this paragraph, but it's how things actually went down. I also agree with the narrative that says that Thiel intended to enact the coup early on.)\n2. Elon Musk meets Michael Griffin, head of the CIA venture capital company. Michael Griffin has an idea to start a private rocket company (I wonder why the CIA would want a private company to send payloads to space... hmmm...) and realizes Musk - recently having been ousted from PayPal but who has some money - is a perfect rat hole for the job. Almost all of SpaceX's valuation comes from government contracts, most of them DOD payloads. \n3. Musk uses returns from these items to buy Tesla. However, the real key to Tesla's success is government subsidies. The government not only significantly bootstrapped Tesla's initial financing, but also provided significant offsets to buyers of Tesla cars, which allowed Tesla to sell cars at higher prices than the market would have otherwise supported. But even with that and a market valuation of $750B, TSLA boasts a measly cash and asset accumulation of $10B after debts. \n\nIn other words, the two things that comprise almost all of Elon Musk's net work - SpaceX and TSLA shares - are the product of government cash infusions, and in the case of TSLA valuations, the fact that the market is feeding money into the company far beyond what it should have for a reasonable valuation because of the promise of high beta returns and because it was driven up during the COVID boom when it entered the S&P 500 at a perfectly lucky time while it was heavily shorted.\n\nIn other words, his wealth has nothing to do with business prowess whatsoever.
