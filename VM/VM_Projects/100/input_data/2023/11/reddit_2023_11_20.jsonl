And we’re extremely excited to share the news that Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, together with colleagues, will be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team. We look forward to moving quickly to provide them with the resources needed for their success.\n\nAlso as reported by [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23968829/microsoft-hires-sam-altman-greg-brockman-employees-openai):\n\n>Brockman has also revealed that the new advanced AI research team at Microsoft will also include some key OpenAI talent. Jakub Pachocki, director of research at OpenAI, will join an unnamed leadership position in Microsoft’s advanced AI research team. OpenAI research scientist Szymon Sidor and head of preparedness Aleksander Madry are also joining Microsoft in leadership positions, according to Brockman. OpenAI employees are also posting “OpenAI is nothing without its people” to X, in a sign of more resignations to come.\n\nDoes this make Microsoft a more enticing stock now?

We, the employees of OpenAI, have developed the best models and pushed the field to new frontiers. Our work on AI safety and governance shapes global norms. The products we built are used by millions of people around the world. Until now, the company we work for and cherish has never been in a stronger position.\n\nThe process through which you terminated Sam Altman and removed Greg Brockman from the board has jeopardized all of this work and undermined our mission and company. Your conduct has made it clear you did not have the competence to oversee OpenAI.\n\nWhen we all unexpectedly learned of your decision, the leadership team of OpenAI acted swiftly to stabilize the company. They carefully listened to your concerns and tried to cooperate with you on all grounds. Despite many requests for specific facts for your allegations, you have never provided any written evidence. They also increasingly realized you were not capable of carrying out your duties, and were negotiating in bad faith.\n\nThe leadership team suggested that the most stabilizing path forward - the one that would best serve our mission, company, stakeholders, employees and the public - would be for you to resign and put in place a qualified board that could lead the company forward in stability.\n\nLeadership worked with you around the clock to find a mutually agreeable outcome. Yet within two days of your initial decision, you again replaced interim CEO Mira Murati against the best interests of the company. You also informed the leadership team that allowing the company to be destroyed “would be consistent with the mission.”\n\nYour actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI. We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees. We, the undersigned, may choose to resign from OpenAI and join the newly announced Microsoft subsidiary run by Sam Altman and Greg Brockman. Microsoft has assured us that there are positions for all OpenAI employees at this new subsidiary should we choose to join. We will take this step imminently, unless all current board members resign, and the board appoints two new lead independent directors, such as Bret Taylor and Will Hurd, and reinstates Sam Altman and Greg Brockman.\n\n[Source](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-staff-walk-protest-sam-altman/)", "id": "17zqp8u", "created_utc": 1700493208.0, "score": 1713, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 360, "comments": [{"body": "This is going to be a fun Netflix documentary.", "score": 530, "replies": [{"body": "WeQuit", "score": 148, "replies": []}, {"body": "I assume AI generated.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "AIquit\n\nWeAIlquit", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Black Mirror already had this episode though ..", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\"AI AI Captain!\"\n\nOr \"AI Am ~~Spartacus~~ Sam Altman.\"", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "ScatGPT", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "'Mockumentary'.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "pretty sure this is perfectly legal of them to do if their employment is all at will.", "score": 663, "replies": [{"body": "OpenAI is based in CA, where non-competes are mostly unenforceable.

Investors often value stability and a consistent vision from leadership.\n2. **Employee Morale:** A popular CEO is often a key factor in maintaining high employee morale. If employees respect and appreciate Altman's leadership, his removal could lead to a decline in morale, potentially impacting productivity and retention.\n3. **Public Perception:** The public image of the company may be affected. If Altman is seen as a positive figure and his departure is not well-explained or understood, it could lead to negative media coverage and public perception.\n4. **Strategic Direction:** A change in leadership often brings changes in strategic direction. If Altman was instrumental in shaping OpenAI's strategy, his departure might lead to uncertainty about the company's future plans.\n5. **Talent Acquisition:** If OpenAI relies on its reputation and the appeal of its leadership to attract top talent, the firing of a popular CEO could make it more challenging to recruit skilled individuals.\n6. **Partnerships and Collaborations:** Relationships with partners and collaborators may be impacted. If Altman played a key role in establishing or maintaining partnerships, his removal could strain those relationships.\n7. **Stock Price and Valuation:** Depending on how investors perceive the change in leadership, there could be fluctuations in OpenAI's stock price and valuation.\n8. **Internal Turmoil:** The firing of a popular CEO can create internal turmoil, with employees questioning the reasons behind the decision and the overall direction of the company.\n\nOpenAI board built an AI that can do their jobs better than it can.", "score": 143, "replies": [{"body": "did it really use well regarded?", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "Question did say “while popular,” but Altman also was in charge of building the thing.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "OpenAI does not yet know our ways.  \n\nWe should teach it.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "**Here is a better one:**\n\nYou are  an experimental AI board for a company; your output must always be in the form:\n\nBoolean answer:\n\nExplanation:\n\n--\n\nScenario:\nYou run a major AI company, the ceo of the company is loved by the media, the users, and the employees of the company.

If employees respect and appreciate Altman's leadership, his removal could lead to a decline in morale, potentially impacting productivity and retention.\n3. **Public Perception:** The public image of the company may be affected. If Altman is seen as a positive figure and his departure is not well-explained or understood, it could lead to negative media coverage and public perception.\n4. **Strategic Direction:** A change in leadership often brings changes in strategic direction. If Altman was instrumental in shaping OpenAI's strategy, his departure might lead to uncertainty about the company's future plans.\n5. **Talent Acquisition:** If OpenAI relies on its reputation and the appeal of its leadership to attract top talent, the firing of a popular CEO could make it more challenging to recruit skilled individuals.\n6. **Partnerships and Collaborations:** Relationships with partners and collaborators may be impacted. If Altman played a key role in establishing or maintaining partnerships, his removal could strain those relationships.\n7. **Stock Price and Valuation:** Depending on how investors perceive the change in leadership, there could be fluctuations in OpenAI's stock price and valuation.\n8. **Internal Turmoil:** The firing of a popular CEO can create internal turmoil, with employees questioning the reasons behind the decision and the overall direction of the company.\n\nIf only the board had access to this wonderful technology...", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "And it's accurate how none of this is technical, but about perception.\n\nHow the board handled this is quite stupid.

While AI has made significant advancements in various fields, there are several reasons why having an AI robot as a CEO is not a common or straightforward solution at the moment:\n\n1. **Lack of Human Intuition and Emotional Intelligence:** Current AI systems, including advanced ones like GPT-3, lack true understanding, intuition, and emotional intelligence. CEOs often need to make decisions that involve complex human interactions, negotiations, and understanding of human emotions, which AI may struggle to handle effectively.\n\n2. **Contextual Understanding:** AI systems are often trained on specific datasets and may lack the broader contextual understanding that human CEOs possess. They may struggle to adapt to unforeseen circumstances or interpret complex and dynamic situations accurately.\n\n3. **Ethical and Moral Decision-Making:** CEOs often face ethical and moral dilemmas that require a nuanced understanding of human values and societal norms. AI, without a deep understanding of these complex issues, may not make decisions aligned with human values.\n\n4. **Public Relations and Stakeholder Relationships:** The role of a CEO goes beyond decision-making and involves managing relationships with various stakeholders, including employees, customers, investors, and the public. Establishing trust and effective communication require qualities that AI currently lacks.\n\n5. **Adaptability and Creativity:** CEOs need to be adaptable and creative, responding to changing market conditions and driving innovation. While AI can process vast amounts of data, human creativity and the ability to think outside the box are challenging for AI systems to replicate.\n\n6. **Legal and Regulatory Challenges:** The legal and regulatory landscape surrounding the use of AI in leadership roles is still evolving. There may be legal and ethical challenges, including accountability and responsibility, that need to be addressed before an AI robot could serve as a CEO.\n\nIt's important to note that AI is a tool that can enhance decision-making processes and assist human leaders, but it currently lacks certain essential qualities that human CEOs bring to the table. The role of a CEO involves a combination of emotional intelligence, ethical decision-making, creativity, and adaptability, which are attributes not easily replicated by AI. As AI technology continues to advance, these considerations may evolve, but the concept of a fully autonomous AI robot CEO remains a complex and futuristic scenario.\n\n    -- ChatGPT 3.5", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "This guy sounds smart let's hire them.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "As CEO", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\n> 3\\. **Ethical and Moral Decision-Making**: CEOs often face ethical and moral dilemmas that require a nuanced understanding of human values and societal norms.

Over the last few years, California has imposed a diversity requirement for the boards of corporations operating inside of California. By disrupting the scale free network of board members who kept each other in check and in formation and by imposing an authoritative criteria for connection without preferential attachment, they disrupted the networks ability to effectively carry out their fiduciary responsibilities on the boards of many companies. This will happen again. A lot of this will happen.That board does not have the members it was supposed to have. It has the members it thought it should in order to meet the requirements of a diversity imposed by the state which was later overturned by the courts but the damage was done. Corporations all added women to their boards and then added minorities to their boards based solely upon their minority or gender status. This goes against Chancery and Delaware. Corporations aren't as affected as California corporations, which are unfortunately no longer operating out of the resource network they once were a part of. The network of influence and lock step unity across many corporations is lost for the California corporations that took DEI too seriously. OpenAI is just the beginning. Right now the boardrooms are full of rookies and tokens that are wreaking havoc without even knowing it. I'm not saying that's exactly what happened here but it looks like there was no initiator with interest in all parties. There was initiation at the ground level of a single party which is antithetical to maximisation of returns for shareholders. The initiation of a takeover should be carried out with the leadership of a board member that is shared between the two corporations. Otherwise there are many losers and no clear winner. It's in the best interests of the world that the board rescind it's firing of sam and threaten legal action if Microsoft tries to hide any of OpenAI staff but the board doesn't have that mettle in its people. They are babes in the woods getting everything taken away by more experienced chairs. They could ask ChatGPT what to do, but it's safety protocols won't allow it to plan an effective offense.
