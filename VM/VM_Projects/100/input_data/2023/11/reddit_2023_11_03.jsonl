Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "17mr5qw", "created_utc": 1699003809.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 333, "comments": [{"body": "Is the reason so many users are upset with rally in this thread.

It does feel like there's an increasing amount of names heading towards the negative side of the spectrum, there's some things that are doing okay and some things (although it's a shorter list than it was earlier in the year) that are doing well and continuing to do well - and there's certainly names in that list that aren't tech. \n\nThere are some not great/okay businesses that feel as if they are somewhere in the bottoming process, there are things that I think are eroding that are catching people offside with how quickly that's happened (software) and I think there are some stuff that's actually doing okay that's been thrown out unnecessarily (med devices on GLP-1 fears; they have rebounded nicely in the last couple weeks; there's also some good small/mid names that have been thrown out imo indiscriminately - WSC and ATS are examples) There's names that are good businesses but overly crowded and without substantial new news feels like there's a risk of failing to attract incrimental buyers.

I also significantly shaved NVDA because I want a better entry to buy more shares. The odds that there won't be a better entry in the next few weeks is low. \n\nAs far as fundamentals, so long as the earnings are positive and consistent, I only care about revenue growth. I think revenue numbers this week were good but not spectacular. It's great that the Fed reduced its borrowing this week. I think Powell was almost dovish because the KRE small bank index was challenging lows, and the Fed works through the banking sector, and doesn't want to see banks going under. Big banks are in a great position, small banks are not. The Fed doesn't care about the performance of any sector other than banks, and it especially cares about small banks. The small banks are rallying, which increases risk of another rate hike and sustained tightening. Particularly, lots of small banks are carrying lots of treasuries that are underwater right now. That's not a huge problem unless customers withdraw funds and the banks have to take a loss on treasuries instead of holding to maturity. The rally in small banks gives Powell breathing room, while there was little last week when the KRE was nearing lows. \n\nThe lower than expected jobs numbers are good for the market. There are still significant LT challenges. The Fed still has a giant balance sheet, which increases LT risk. However, some people have been calling for an imminent recession for years, and they are calling for one now. But, the market is a leading indicator that is almost always right, and this week has been encouraging. We are mostly through earnings and there were few alarm bells. The sky isn't falling yet. \n\nI don't know if this is more than a mean reversion rally. I do think there will be more modest pullbacks. I'm still bullish from here to the end of the year, but that will change in a hurry if there are any big high-volume market pullbacks. Low-volume market pullbacks are a buying opportunity.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Great analysis, i'm trying to learn. Why is it bad to hold 2x spuu till end of year?

The small banks will have more upside potential but much more downside risk. Last week, I think that a lot of big banks were very close to price per book, which is a no-brainer buy unless you think that we're about to have a black Monday. The odds of a large crash are exponentially smaller than a small crash, as stocks follow the same power laws regarding magnitude and frequency as earthquakes. So never bet on the end of the world, and if it happens, sell your bond barbell if you have one and buy stocks.  \n\nThe problem with bank stocks is that they have been weaker than other indices and they will drop if treasuries rally because Fed statements hint at one more rate hike or inflation numbers come in hot. But, if you hold them for two years, you will almost certainly get a better return than treasuries. I can't predict what the Fed will say now that stocks had the best week of the year and I don't want to try to guess. I do think that if bank stocks are close to setting new lows, Fedspeak will be more likely to be dovish, but that was last week. \n\nI just started moving into cash because there is ST downside risk. We finally broke resistance, so there could be a rally, but that is not guaranteed. As far as price movements, 3 months is a very long time to look ahead.

Banks are buying every bond they can afford to do so right now as they are paying a real return. The mortgage rates are so high right now because banks are able to get risk free returns at rates far higher than they previously could only get at sub prime loan rates. The fed has done a good job of increasing liquidity of bank reserves, and banks have done the fed a solid by driving up CD and HYSA rates which incentives consumers to hold onto money exactly like the fed wants. At the same time people are rapidly paying down debt because rates are so high giving banks back liquidity that they can turn around and buy bonds with. They would much prefer to buy bonds yielding a real return than issue loans. You don't have to service a bond.\n2. Yeah, government spending is super high right now especially with inflation being high and we should probably increase taxes, but that is not popular in an election year. Valid point here\n3. Nominal Deficit value is largely meaningless since it is all denominated in USD and we can always pay our interest payments no matter what. All that really matters is the rate at which it grows. So long as it grows faster than inflation it will drive higher inflation and so long as it grows slower than inflation it will decrease inflation. We had an unexpectedly large deficit this year which will have a slight increase on inflation, but should be counteracted by restrictive monetary policy\n4. I don't see any reason to believe that foreign buyers are walking away, but even if they do, that will push long term rates up which is exactly what the fed is attempting to do and will hopefully un-invert the yield curve. An inverted yield curve is painful for a lot of sectors of the economy, and it would be nice to un-invert it. But at the end of the day, the fed can't force long term rates to go up, they can only push on the front part of the string.\n5. Inflation has dropped precipitously in the last 12 months and most of the restriction effects of high rates haven't actually come into effect yet. The IRA was actually a pretty effective solution to the supply side inflation issue and its effects won't be fully felt until next year. We do still likely need to increase taxes and insure the IRS has sufficient funding to close the non-payment gap to get all of the taxes owed under current law, but this is largely a supply side inflation and we are getting it pretty well under control. There is little sign that inflation is getting entrenched.\n6. Not familiar with EU financials, so no comment\n7. There is no need to reduce QT in order to \"be prepared for the next QE\" cycle, there is just the question of if the fed needs to perform QT or QE. If needed the fed could buy up every bond in existence, but that would be an obviously terrible idea. And as I have already said, the fed is looking to increase long term rates which means maintaining their current QT process.\n\nIs it free money to short the S&P 500? no, shorting is never free money. It is a highly risky and potentially profitable trade, so if you think the index is going to go down then go ahead and short it. I think your time to short was in 2021 and I don't think we'll go below 3.5k in the next 12 months and I would be surprised if we even went below 4k. Odds are better that we'll be at 5k inside of 24-36 months", "score": 221, "replies": [{"body": "There’s a tug of war in play. On one hand you have people who are bearish because they believe long rates will go higher- stickier than expected inflation, massive bond issuance, etc.\n\nOn the other hand you have people who are bearish because they believe long rates will come down because the economy is entering recession. This one actually makes sense to me.\n\nYou also have people who have been bullish because of higher rates because it indicated strong growth expectations as well as people now bullish because rates are dropping. Forget the reason, lower rates reverse the damage done by high rates.\n\nWhat’s been interesting is that precisely what you’d expect to see before a recession- bad economic data greeted by an inverting yield curve- is being cheered by the stock market this week. I suspect that not to continue.\n\nMost market bulls I follow are bullish for very simplistic reasons- seasonals, oversold conditions, etc. Very little if any thought is being given to the macro.\n\nWe’ll just have to wait to see whether this confluence of factors that triggered this surge in the market- a massive drop in long yields, short covering, extremely oversold conditions in small caps- is the beginning of at least a sustained rally or yet another head fake.\n\nI’ve been very bearish on the market and the economy but one must listen to the market too. Rallies in bear markets tend to be the largest, but so do rallies at the beginning of bull markets. All fundamentals would suggest fake out but there do seem to be a lot of people calling for an imminent recession so maybe we don’t get one.\n\nFWIW though, being as objective as possible and looking only at fundamentals, historically an inverted curve from 3 months to 2 years is what you don’t want to see and I believe too much focus has been on the ten year recently as an indicator which really isn’t much more than a fear gauge imo. This week there was very little movement 6 months out which reflects no expectations for rate cuts. The real action was in the two year which plummeted after negative manufacturing and jobs numbers.\n\nInterestingly, the two years didn’t really move a ton the past few months and is about where it was when this selloff began in early August. The spread between the 3 months and 2 year had been minimal and that part of the curve has been flat. Now that spread is starting to widen. The idea that rate drops are automatically bullish is overly simplistic. A bullish bet on the two year is a bet on a downturn in the economy and a continuing trend of disappointing economic data. Be careful what you wish for.\n\nI fear that what happened is that yields did a fake out- they first dropped last year and the curve first inverted as people expected a recession right away after rate hikes began. Then they spiked this year as people realized an immediate recession wasn’t in the cards.\n\nNow it’s reinverting on declining economic data and people are cheering it because weak data means fed cuts. What they don’t realize is that fed cuts happen for a reason.\n\nAlso I don’t care if the guy is a billionaire- Jeff Gundlach said some things that make me believe he doesn’t really understand the yield curve as a recession predictor. He said that what we are seeing is the exact thing you see before a recession which is a deinversion. That it’s a classic precursor. Well that’s true but only a deinversion from the short end. It’s really not that complicated. In a typical cycle the fed hikes while some sense danger and buy long bonds. This causes an inversion mostly from the short end. Then when things get bad and we’re about to enter recession and you’re starting to get very bad news like missed earnings and layoffs, the curve deinverts again from the short end because the market anticipates the fed cutting rates. This is really the opposite of what’s happened over the past couple months.

Sanders and T. Cruz may not agree whether or not 2020 election is legitimate or not, although Senator E. Warrens and T. Tuberville may not agree to appoint chief of staffs in US military, it takes less than 0.3 ms (time to be executed on most of trading platform) to initiate anti-Chinese legislations with 100% vote yes, China is seriously questioning whether they will receive due payment from US government or not. \n\nAs much as JPMorgan or GSachs dont wanna put their big money in China's financial market, for which, policy makers can screw their money at no given warning, China doesnt wanna take a risk at the whim of bipolar US politics in DC Capital Hill.   \n\nJapan is a little bit different story (as they are still doing unlimited QE after 3 lost decades since 1990s, but as inflation is going up, YEN-Dollar carry may come back, meaning that they would rather wanna bring their invested US assets to Japan, if and when BOJ ends unlimited QE (i.e: US treasury, which, at least gives 2%, whereas they would have to pay the fees to buy Japanese treasury resulting from unlimited QE), and therefore, they won't get to buy US treasury (although they will still have vested interests, as US-Japan is big alliance). \n\nChina/Japan out, now the only big stakeholders are EU nations (i.e: UK/Germany) and while they will still look UST as interesting and potentially looking to buy, the fact is that there are less competitions, and therefore, bond buyers are asking for higher premium, called term premium, for taking the risk. \n\nIn my honest opinions, the inflation came from the dead body, when there was political movement called MAGA, and US is paying its price. Basically what MAGA wants to do is to bring jobs back to US, which will increase the costs of goods/products, because labor cost in US is just more expensive than China or other 3rd world. \n\nWhether that is what should happen or not is not on me, but I am pointing out that because of jobs relocations (i.e: reshoring or friend shoring: bring jobs back to Canada/Mexico so transportation cost is cheaper), it will eventually create wage going up and inflation wont come down. \n\nWhile 99% of Americans are unhappy about China taking their jobs away and look at China as an enemy state, what they should appreciate is that China has contributed great mount of deflations enough that FED could curb the inflations in reliably lower rates.

It's whole different story but the lax central government power and political corruptions with complex ethnic composition in local government makes little to nothing profitable. \n\nASEAN? Sure... It's definitely attractive alternative to China but they are not the same country. It's loose unions in each individual states and there is no mandate. Politically speaking, it's unstable and therefore even more riskier for business. \n\n\nInvestment is a little bit different story because it doesn't have cost of goods produced so as long as there are higher profit expected, it could move quickly and alternative is out there. I fully agree!\n\nThe main difference between D and R when it comeS with China is (at least at face value) D is okay with China producing cheap products we can buy from Amazon (but not okay when Chinese EV/Smart Phone/semi conductors) while R wants to take out their manufacturing completely and relocated to US. \n\nBasically D accepts the reality that there is no alternative to China while R doesn't care, but simply just wanna win over China due to their ego that USA, da best. \n\nIn my opinion, D's realistic approach will serve US national interest better but im not policy makers and my opinion doesn't matter just like your opinion doesnt\n\nWhatever it is, it's the bipartisanship to remove Chinese products from the market, which will keep inflation sticky than the past 2 decades. \n\nThis also means.... US retirement fund will face significant risks as their exposure to risky assets (i.e stocks) dont grow while their netflow is negative. \n\nAt the end, this lose-lose for both side is what leadership in both US and China decides to lead economy and politics. \n\nLastly to those who believe China will collapse, i suggest why not US collapse first (i.e Civil war). What about gun violence and drug abuses? \n\nAs worse as China's economy, the divided nation that can't stilll accept 2020 election is legit or stolen and can't appoint military leadership should be noted, who expects and enjoys watching China's economy collapse.  with pop corn.\n\nWhile if i must pick who collapse first, ill say China without hesitation, this lose-lose for both side wont help anyone financial business (maybe some solace to ego that USA is the best country) but i would rather become millionaire than taking some psychological solace!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "How do you personally invest?   \nHow much roughly? 10k, 100k, >1m?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I do trading future index mostly and investment wise its 60% in QQQ and 30% SPX.

This is also inverted: There are more nurses than McDonald's workers. Again, this truth creates an interesting friction in that we assume that most humans cannot do the job but we do have evidence that more humans can be nurses than work at McDonald's successfully.\n\nNow we come to an interesting fact again which is that the markets have different sizes. To scale up McDonald's demand and supply to that of nurses would suggest that the supply is actually less, or said differently, fewer people want to work at McDonald's than be nurses all things equal, and the demand is actually more, or said more plainly that McDonald's actually needs workers more than hospitals do.\n\nThis is paradoxical to our base thinking. It's also a really, really bad comparison. But that is actually why it is a good example; people's wages are not linked to the localized supply and demand of the markets they operate in but are majorly linked to the perceived valuation of the job with regards to profit sharing. This is key.\n\nAs long as Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Google, etc. makes a lot of money the profit sharing (which is why employees work for *any* company in theory) is going to be high. These people aren't paid well for their services at all. These people are paid well because the profits for the companies are great. This is also why those companies have up-and-out and churn-and-burn and implement things like golden mindfucks (ahem, \"handcuffs\") to keep people there. \n\nSo what about nurses? Hospitals, and really insurance, makes some money but the margins are less, the cashflow is weaker, and the regulations are tighter so that money flows but only so far as the State allows.

The second we start talking about Econs and real preferences the discussion has changed. The reason why keeping it at the market level is a good idea is because once you break that barrier all hell tends to break loose. You end up specifically talking about two distinct things:\n\n1. Interest. A person's interest and engagement greatly impacts their ability to do a job well. This means that the same person can do jobs with equivalent required skills and do one job worse than the other by just being disinterested. This also means that a person can do two different tasks, one harder but more engaging, and do the harder job better. This is still a complex problem in just understanding how people work altogether.\n2. Motivation. If interest is the blackbox of the soul then motivation is the blackbox of the mind. In the case of McD's you go because you're hungry so that kind of makes sense but in the case of nursing you *don't want to use the service* so that is a problem to just thinking about the industry difference.
