AI-generated code will happily suggest the use of third-party tools without actually understand whether they are a good fit for the job or not, and does not know about the internal tools of a company unless trained for it.

He has a track record of purchasing mining operations and developing them then selling them for thousand percent plus gains and I think he's in Nevada along with a few other players and these are billionaires that have the money and time to play the long run game. Maybe there's some other undervalued assets out there but I can't name one right now.  And out of everything you need to know about investing that's literally all that matters.  There's always a fire sale on something and the fact that in a world inflated on unbacked printed paper the commodity that was doing all the backing is completely being ignored right now is absolute gold.  Pun intended.  Oh another fact for the naysayers, ask them why central banks accumulated 70 billion in gold in 2022 the most since 1950?  It's hard for me to recommend krypto knowing how controlled It Is by the powers that be but part of that control is developing it because it is going to be the future. Considering they control the price as admitted in recent case versus SBF and obviously if you look at Price action versus printing of tether it's tough to say if this is to sustain development at whatever demand or also a trojan horse to crash the market and have people begging for regulation so all the major corporations instilling blockchains right now I can just jump in and save the Day. As far as companies go in technology, Tesla will be the most important company in the world for a very long time most likely. It's investment analysis as an EV company is fundamentally flawed by ignorant people that don't understand the future and the fact that Tesla makes EVS for fun and will net zero on that or operate at a loss if it has to, but it won't mean much as a tiny percentage of the revenue they take in being the largest energy company in the world and most dominant AI company in the world therefore being the most important robotics company in the world. Next market crash accumulate tesla and you'll be fine there. Finally I would consider owning some tangible gold and silver.  Nothing crazy but any amount put you into a very small percentage of world population so something to consider.

I normally operate with anywhere from $175k to $250k capital for this strategy. At most times, I have right around $200k deployed. This account currently has 1,700 shares gained through assignment with an average cost basis of $38. I have an open call option on those with a strike at $48.\n\nMy average monthly gains are around 4%. I have posted many screenshots and actual trades in my prior posts in r/TQQQ (home of the braindead, except for a precious few) if you care to see them.

The past is not an analogue for the present. Yet, the past can provide us with clues to decode the present. So, how have these cycles played out in the past?\n\nWhen the economy is doing great, more folks gain access to easy money and can afford to buy things that they didn‚Äôt have access to before. However, this creates a great imbalance in supply and demand, causing money to be worth less. In this case, something has to be done to increase the value of money.\n\nHave you ever played a video game such as an mmorpg, and wondered why the currency was worthless? This was a huge problem in many games of that genre. The problem was that there was a constant inflow of money into the game, but no way to lower the supply of money. This is why developers implemented ‚Äúgold sinks‚Äù to force players to spend in-game currency and take it out of circulation. In games with no gold sink, you are eventually forced into a barter economy.\n\nWell, the last 11 years have essentially been ‚Äúgold sink‚Äù-free, as the Fed pumps free money around the economy- and if it continues, the US dollar will become worthless. This is why the fed implemented rate hikes last year. Ok, so things are probably under control, right? Well‚Ä¶ probably not.\n\nThe issue here is that, even though the Fed has raised rates, inflation is still not under control. This is kind of strange. If you look back, every time the fed has raised rates, it has led to a recession. Well, where is our recession now? There‚Äôs something different happening this time.\n\nDo you eat fast food? Do you pay attention to how much you‚Äôre paying? Probably a lot more than you were a couple years ago, huh? Are you still eating fast food? You probably are. This is exactly the problem. People are seemingly unfazed by higher prices. It‚Äôs very easy to swipe a card. If you were instead handing over a $20 bill for your burger and fries, would it bother you then? Paying for things is just so damn easy now that people likely don‚Äôt even realize how much they‚Äôre spending! And this spending is getting dangerous‚Ä¶\n\nOverspending means a growing economy. This is making it pretty hard for the Fed to fight inflation. The only way the Fed can fight inflation is to become a gold sink. The fed has to raise rates. But, rates are already extremely high. Could a few hundred more basis points cause much harm? Probably‚Ä¶ and it would be devastating.\n\nIf you own a home, you already likely know the effect that a slight rate increase can have on a mortgage. It could affect your payments by hundreds of dollars per month. Now imagine this effect, but applied to trillions of dollars of corporate and consumer debt that has been racked up under ZIRP.\n\nSo, we are presented with two outcomes here.

There are certainly more than two potential outcomes - and while rates are \"high\" relative to the last 20 years, they're average at best when compared to the long view. As far as inflation is concerned, I think that we're in a very interesting transitory period wherein there has been easy money for the rich for decades and less so for the average consumer, where-in world population growth is levelling off sooner than expected, the global third world isn't becoming \"developed\" as quickly or universally as expected, automation, climate change, energy transition, and added to all that is the sudden reversal in globalization trends. Each of these pull inflation and the world economy in different directions and it is not clear in the slightest which of these forces will win out.\n\nI don't think it's correct to state that that this inflation cycle came like a bolt from the blue as has been done for the last year or so, I think that this inflation has been hidden from consumers for most of the easy money period: it has been in assets. You mentioned \"gold sinks\" this is an apt metaphor for what has happened with asset valuations - the rich have such an absurd amount of wealth that they've plowed it into everywhere seeking any return at all which has driven up asset prices tremendously. Now, with rates higher, it simply means that a new asset class has risen to the fore for new money investment by the wealthy: treasuries and bonds. But, again, there's still so much juice in the system that there are not enough assets to pump it into.\n\nIt doesn't matter what a burger costs in relation to the stock market because the vast majority of those squeezed by burger prices couldn't effect the stock market if they pooled all their ever-diminishing assets together to try. Yes, they may buy fewer new things with their diminished purchasing power but that doesn't change the fact that the wealthy still have to put wealth somewhere because the number must go up. This'll be true for quite a while, I think because if the consumer ends up too strapped and things get too bad, the wealthy will lobby to socialize the debt needed to keep the system's wheels turning and the government will provide bread and circuses: first through rate cutting and then through UBI or other stimulus. And, for a while yet, maybe years, the line will go up.\n\nThose other forces are far beyond anyone's ability to summarize in anything less than several PhD theses. But, suffice to say that they do not easily distill down into nugget-sized anecdotes. It's a vastly complex and living system - the economy and the financial instruments which have been built atop it are even more so.\n\nI also think this is one of the major reasons why the perennial bears on here get no fireball like they keep prognosticating for: sure you're poor and getting poorer. Sure, you'd like a massive recession so that there's a chance for you to get on the bus to wealth and influence like you've seen so many others ride, but simply wanting something doesn't make it so.
