Intel was one of the first companies I read about and then invested in. I remember the 90s and how big Intel Pentium was--dancing bunnysuit TV ads and people buying computers specifically for the Pentium processor. Once I invested in Intel I continued doing research and then had an \"oh no\" moment, and waited most of a year for the stock price to rise back up to where I bought it and then sold the stock I bought.\n\nSmartphones hit the mainstream in \\~2008 and Intel completely missed making a smartphone chip. It takes \\~5 years for the cycle from initial development to when chips are rolling out of the production line so at that time in 2011, the earliest they could have had chips for mobile was 2014-15 or so. Investing in them at that time would be betting they'd have something amazing for mobile in 2015.\n\nThe downside is by that time, smartphone chips would more or less be commodities. Basically there'd be lots of generic chips that more or less get the job done well enough coming out of Chinese factories, so there isn't a whole lot of space for Intel to put out a product that commands premium pricing in that environment. Very unlikely there'd be a Pentium Processor for smartphones.\n\nI invested at like low-mid 30s. The price started to go down and then took a year to get back to where I bought and then I sold at about the same price. In the years following that, Intel got a deal with Apple to design and make their processors. That was good for Intel's business.\n\nIn the time since then... in the late teens NVIDIA totally ate Intel's lunch with graphics chips which got bought up for crypto mining, which is stupid but if you can sell chips for it and make money, why not. The last year or two, Apple moved their chip design in-house and away from Intel. This is bad for Intel. Also Intel doesn't appear to have anything special ready to go for the AI stuff of the last year.\n\nIf Intel were a great company, they'd be working with (developing partnerships with/for) all these different facets of computing to have specialized chips ready to go when these new things hit: mobile, graphics cards, 3D, AI, servers/cloud. Like I wrote, the development cycle takes 5 years so they'd have to be in pretty deep and have their ear to the ground across the industry, and they'd also have some misses. For example they might have gone hard in 3D graphics in some sort of partnership with Facebook's headset thing, but Facebook's metaverse thing was a flop so what they would have bet on that wouldn't have paid off.\n\nBasically, Intel was huge in the late 90s. Since then it seems like they've been running on momentum and been behind the curve and missed every new wave of things. It is sad, because as you point out, they're the Great American Chip Company, but they've just been seeming to miss everything. The headwinds a chipmaker will be fighting is chips being commodities. The Pentium days will never return. In addition Moore's law is pretty much played out and silicon chips are up against the limits of physics now. They would have to be working on developing computing with light or quantum computing now and who knows if those things will ever lead to products for consumers or if they'll only ever be in labs or government applications.\n\nI haven't looked at the computer chip industry in a decade. I'm not entirely familiar with what Biden's programs look to be doing for bringing chip fabrication to the US. Intel may benefit a lot from that. Other American companies like Texas Instruments might benefit as well.

Coffee consumption seems to have taken off in Japan, so I wonder if there are China-specific reasons why it shouldn't share the enthusiasm.\n- Chinese consumer growth has a lot of space to go being a developing economy. Over the next decade, there will be tens of millions of new consumers who can afford SBUX coffee as a luxury. In a sense, coffee is saturated in the US/Europe (relatively speaking) in that everyone can afford SBUX coffee at least occasionally. This is definitely not true in China or say India. The enormity of the middle class population will be integral to new demand.\n\nSo I expect growth not only in number of stores (which tend to pay themselves back extremely quickly, like 1.5-2 years), but hopefully in cultural interest in coffee. The rise in median income will enable greater demand as well.\n\nMy only fear is of course Chinese regulators / geopolitical tension, in which case the thesis is wrecked.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "China has their own coffee brands and if sbux gets big enough there they'll just ban it.

[The figure was 10 cups a year in 2019, and expected to be 14 by 2025] The enormous growth of their middle class means more people will be able to afford their drinks.\n\nYou might be surprised to know that SBUX coffee in China is actually priced higher than in N.

Otherwise, it makes more sense to simply invest in bonds. The difference would be the risk premium.\n\nI am looking at evil tobacco.

There is a reason why employers are so desperate to get at home workers back into the office.

This is the original, the great granddaddy of them all. It not only spawned a media franchise which will celebrate its 70th anniversary next year, it also invented the entire genre of *kaiju* monster movies.\n\nThe original movie from 1954 is really amazing after 70 years of retrospect. The fact that they were able to do the VFX work which today is derided as \"man in suit smashes models of Tokyo\" before anything modern was invented and make it look the way it does is astonishing in both the amount of detail put into the model work and also the film techniques used to composite \"suitmation\" with live action. Today we might think it looks cheesy, and to be quite frank many of the Godzilla movies which followed after the original really did look silly, but this original film was able to heavily mask the limits of \"suitmation\" by simply being in black and white.\n\nYes, this movie is so old it is quite literally not in color. It features a mono, single, one channel soundtrack. And despite all this, as I said, it's amazing. Unlike the many sequels which progressively became more silly, campy, and cheesy, this film is a deadly serious allegory for nuclear weapons and specifically the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which occurred barely a decade before this movie was made. \n\nFor all the limitations of the technology of almost 70 years ago, this movie is *terrifying* as a nuclear allegory. Today, decades after the end of the Cold War and with fear of nuclear holocaust a fading memory of the threat it once was, it's mostly seen through the lens of cheesy depictions of video games like the Fallout franchise. But for post-World War II Japan, the only nation that nuclear weapons were ever used against, it was a very real national trauma which was not so much healed over as forgotten by successive generations.\n\nIt might not look super impressive in 2023 with the VFX technology we have today, but the scenes of Godzilla carving a burning path through Tokyo and leaving the city in flames behind him are no less powerful now as they must have been then. The fact that Godzilla is a man in a rubber suit, his atomic breath is a jet of water vapor sprayed from said suit, and Tokyo is a really big model doesn't change it one bit. \n\nThe 2014 American remake/reboot has much better VFX and is highly regarded because it takes the franchise seriously and respectfully, but stripped of the original nuclear allegory, it's still not as good as the 1954 original.

{"title": "I locked myself in a box spread and levered myself at 3.33x on SPY/QQQ", "selftext": "As if the story of 1RONYMAN was a tale of caution...\n\nTwo days ago, I was having some real FOMO on the bull market. I've been holding 2x ETFs ($SSO/$QLD) since the start of the 2023 bull run, but somehow I decided that this wasn't sufficient leverage for my personal risk tolerance.\n\nI've been fucking around looking for arbitrage opportunities lately, and the idea of a box spread intrigued me. If I sell a call credit spread and put credit spread that cancel each other out, I can effectively get interest-free margin, right?\n\nI ventured into the SPY options chain for Dec 2025 to see if I could get a perfect fill on these spreads. To my surprise, I could. I was able to get a $500 credit for selling a 490/495 put credit (for $166) spread alongside a 495/500 call credit spread (for $334) -- meaning a net loss of 0 at expiration.\n\nI started small, but when I made the first trade, my account value went up immediately. Due to the wide bid-ask spreads on the options and my \"risk-free\" order fill, Thinkorswim considered the position to be of positive value, even though it was actually 0.\n\nNumber go up. Ape brain kicks in. Free money. Unga bunga.\n\nSo, I got a little carried away and maxed out my margin such that I opened up a box spread credit to the tune of $40,000. I then used that pile of money to buy a bunch of shares of 2x bull ETFs. With my own capital included, this puts me in a position of $100k worth of $SSO and $QLD. In other words, 1.66x leverage on a 2x ETF which means a 3.33x levered position on SPY/QQQ, compounded daily.\n\nI then thought back to the tale of 1RONYMAN and considered the risk of early assignment. If SPY tanks, then my short 495 puts will have no extrinsic value left, and it's possible I get assigned early. This means I'll have to exercise my 490 puts, meaning I lose $40,000 in cash. In order to get the cash back, I'll need to sell back my 2x shares at a hefty loss. But also, this means my call credit spread will be left exposed by itself, meaning I'll have to sell even more shares low to buy that back too (but in theory, at least I should be able to buy it back at a lower price than what I sold it at).\n\nHaving considered this risk, I decided to see if I'd be able to close my box spread for the same price at which I opened it ($500 per spread). I cannot. The limit order isn't getting filled at $5.00. And I have no idea what price at which I could get the order filled. The natural price is $13.00, but that would mean I be buying the $40,000 loan back for $104,000, meaning a $64,000 loss. So it looks like I'm forced to keep the box spread open until Dec 2025, at which point I'll still be debited $40,000, but hopefully stocks will have gone up a lot by then.\n\nYesterday, I received my first margin call when SPY dipped a bit. I deposited more cash to cover it. That's the other thing. Even though I bought the shares using \"my own\" money from opening the box spread, TD Ameritrade still considers my position to be on margin.

BE PREPARED TO HOLD TO EXPIRATION AND ABLE TO MEET POTENTIAL MARGIN CALLS. \n\nlol there are 2 ways this trade blows up:\n\n1. Your biggest risk in this position is Rho. Significant interest hikes before expiration will lead to mark-to-market losses on your position. You could easily get margin called, and if you can‚Äôt meet the call, the liquidation will wipe out all of your profits and then some. \n\n2. Early assignment. Given that your options expire in about 2.5 years from now, it‚Äôs highly likely that one of your spreads will be deep in the money at some point. Any deep in the money American option is at risk of early assignment. There are other situations besides just dividend risk that could get you assigned. \n\nLet‚Äôs say you get assigned early on 40/80 of your short calls. What happens then? You start the next trading day short 4000 shares of SPY, long 40 calls, and short 80 put spreads. Yikes. \n\nThe short stock will have margin requirements far higher than the spreads, and you‚Äôre likely to get a maintenance call unless you‚Äôre in a portfolio margin account. \n\nIf you‚Äôre really unlucky, TD might auto-exercise your long calls. That leaves you short 40 call spreads and short 80 put spreads. So your net position is short 40 put spreads. \n\nCongratulations. Your position now has delta risk. Do you see how this goes badly for you now? Now you‚Äôve got to either post huge amounts of collateral and trade SPY shares to hedge your delta, or accept the risk of your now very very directional trade and the margin requirements that come with it, or close out the entire position for a big loss. \n\nWhen you think you see an arbitrage opportunity you should ask 2 questions: \n\n1. Why aren‚Äôt other people doing this? There are loads of HFT firms with much more capital and much better execution speed than me. Why aren‚Äôt they doing this already (which would eliminate the arbitrage)?\n\n2. Is this really an arbitrage? Or is the market pricing in some other risk that I don‚Äôt understand? (In this case, early assignment risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
