Mitigated damage to Tesla's brand by making clear that Elon Musk's political opinions do not reflect the values of Tesla as an organization.  The reality is that Tesla's reputation as a business is highly tied to Elon Musk's personal reputation.\n2. Communicated to the investment community that Tesla was still being effectively managed from an operational standpoint.  When Elon was sleeping at Twitter headquarters for weeks on end, this created the perception that nobody was managing things at Tesla.  By the time Elon addressed the issue in an unannounced Twitter Spaces meeting in Dec. 2022, TSLA valuation had already crashed due to the uncertainty that he and the board created.\n\nFailure to act shows poor judgment.  Failure should have consequences for these board members.\n\nTesla's current board cannot act as an effective counterbalance to the CEO, which is the entire purpose of having a board of directors.  The fact that the Tesla board is stacked with Elon's friends and family, is IMO bad for accountability.\n\nElon would instantly fire anyone at Tesla who did not do their jobs to the highest standard.\n\nWe shareholders should hold Tesla board members to the same standard, since they are our employees.\n\n**Edit:**  My intention is to continually vote against **every** person who was a Tesla board member in 2022, as they come up for re-election to the board at the annual shareholder meeting in future years.

Commodities should keep coming down, factories get more efficient, and hopefully this is the bottom of the expected margin range long term.\n\n*This is the first time Elon reiterated 1.8M and didn't suggest 2M was likely/possible. Then q3 may have less production than q2 due to factory upgrades. These add costs/downtime and may balance out any positive margin bump from the above. Elon also reiterates focusing on volume deliveries at the sacrifice of margins (because of FSD/razor blade model) and comments about affordability of the car with higher rates (Fed claiming they're going to raise rates 1-2 more times and stay high for longer). If that ends up being true, more price cuts or heavier inventory discounts may be needed.*\n\nEnergy margins are better. Autobidder has great potential. Demand is great and they're continuing to expand lines.\n\n*Solar and storage is down QoQ, probably from logistics. Energy is a heavily regulated space and will be hard to get into all markets.*\n\nMore training for FSD and licensing will hopefully 'solve' FSD sooner and make it even more profitable than limiting it to only Teslas.\n\n*I'm still a FSD level 4-5 soon skeptic (or to the point where robotaxis will make any reasonable contribution). When Elon says FSD will be ready and be as good as a human driver, that's a low bar since most drivers are terrible anyways. Being a great level 2-3 is certainly possible this year (as he says perpetually) but the golden goose 5-10x needs level 4-5 solved, orders of magnitude better than humans, logistics/systems in place, as well as regulatory approval. Dojo R&D adds another $1B in costs over the next year, but just a drop in the bucket once it works)*\n\n4680 progressing nicely, getting more efficient with higher yield and less scrap. Cybercell is supposed to be better and we haven't even seen its final form.\n\nFSD 1 time transfer is great for the customer and should allow early adopters to finally upgrade.\n\n*This could be interpreted as weak demand. S/X are being inventory discounted $8-10k. If FSD was truly desirable, people would just pay the full price and it wouldn't hinder people to upgrade if they wanted.*\n\nOverall, still long term bullish for the company. For the share price, I'm just cautious for the short/medium term. Everyone invests and thus responsible for their money in their own way. I invested in TSLA for high revenue/margins/earnings growth. Currently there's essentially no/low earnings growth in the short term despite higher volume and revenue. I have my personal PE/PEG ratios I'm happy to buy more shares at and where I'm willing to cap my share gains at while making theta on both sides.\n\nThis should all resolve in the medium to distant future, but in my personal situation preservation is way more important than making more.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Nice recap.
