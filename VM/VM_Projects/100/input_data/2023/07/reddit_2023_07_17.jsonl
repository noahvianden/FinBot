{"title": "WSJ - Europeans Are Becoming Poorer as Europe has tipped into Recession Early This Year. ‘Yes, We’re All Worse Off.’", "selftext": "An aging population that values its free time set the stage for economic stagnation. Then came Covid-19 and Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nEuropeans are facing a new economic reality, one they haven’t experienced in decades. They are becoming poorer.\n\nLife on a continent long envied by outsiders for its art de vivre is rapidly losing its shine as Europeans see their purchasing power melt away. \n\nThe French are eating less foie gras and drinking less red wine. Spaniards are stinting on olive oil. Finns are being urged to use saunas on windy days when energy is less expensive. Across Germany, meat and milk consumption has fallen to the lowest level in three decades and the once-booming market for organic food has tanked. Italy’s economic development minister, Adolfo Urso, convened a crisis meeting in May over prices for pasta, the country’s favorite staple, after they jumped by more than double the national inflation rate.\n\nWith consumption spending in free fall, Europe tipped into recession at the start of the year, reinforcing a sense of relative economic, political and military decline that kicked in at the start of the century. \n\n\nEurope’s current predicament has been long in the making. An aging population with a preference for free time and job security over earnings ushered in years of lackluster economic and productivity growth. Then came the one-two punch of the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s protracted war in Ukraine. By upending global supply chains and sending the prices of energy and food rocketing, the crises aggravated ailments that had been festering for decades. \n\nGovernments’ responses only compounded the problem. To preserve jobs, they steered their subsidies primarily to employers, leaving consumers without a cash cushion when the price shock came. Americans, by contrast, benefited from inexpensive energy and government aid directed primarily at citizens to keep them spending.\n\nIn the past, the continent’s formidable export industry might have come to the rescue. But a sluggish recovery in China, a critical market for Europe, is undermining that growth pillar. High energy costs and rampant inflation at a level not seen since the 1970s are dulling manufacturers’ price advantage in international markets and smashing the continent’s once-harmonious labor relations. As global trade cools, Europe’s heavy reliance on exports—which account for about 50% of eurozone GDP versus 10% for the U.S.—is becoming a weakness. \n\nPrivate consumption has declined by about 1% in the 20-nation eurozone since the end of 2019 after adjusting for inflation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of mainly wealthy countries. In the U.S., where households enjoy a strong labor market and rising incomes, it has increased by nearly 9%. The European Union now accounts for about 18% of all global consumption spending, compared with 28% for America. Fifteen years ago, the EU and the U.S. each represented about a quarter of that total.\n\nAdjusted for inflation and purchasing power, wages have declined by about 3% since 2019 in Germany, by 3.5% in Italy and Spain and by 6% in Greece. Real wages in the U.S. have increased by about 6% over the same period, according to OECD data. \n\n\nThe pain reaches far into the middle classes. In Brussels, one of Europe’s richest cities, teachers and nurses stood in line on a recent evening to collect half-price groceries from the back of a truck. The vendor, Happy Hours Market, collects food close to its expiration date from supermarkets and advertises it through an app. Customers can order in the early afternoon and collect their cut-price groceries in the evening. \n\n“Some customers tell me, because of you I can eat meat two or three times per week,” said Pierre van Hede, who was handing out crates of groceries.\n\nKarim Bouazza, a 33-year-old nurse who was stocking up on half-price meat and fish for his wife and two children, complained that inflation means “you almost need to work a second job to pay for everything.”\n\nSimilar services have sprung up across the region, marketing themselves as a way to reduce food waste as well as save money. TooGoodToGo, a company founded in Denmark in 2015 that sells leftover food from retailers and restaurants, has 76 million registered users across Europe, roughly three times the number at the end of 2020. In Germany, Sirplus, a startup created in 2017, offers “rescued” food, including products past their sell-by date, on its online store. So does Motatos, created in Sweden in 2014 and now present in Finland, Germany, Denmark and the U.K.\n\nSpending on high-end groceries has collapsed. Germans consumed 52 kilograms of meat per person in 2022, about 8% less than the previous year and the lowest level since calculations began in 1989. While some of that reflects societal concerns about healthy eating and animal welfare, experts say the trend has been accelerated by meat prices which increased by up to 30% in recent months. Germans are also swapping meats such as beef and veal for less-expensive ones such as poultry, according to the Federal Information Center for Agriculture.\n\nThomas Wolff, an organic-food supplier near Frankfurt, said his sales fell by up to 30% last year as inflation surged. Wolff said he had hired 33 people earlier in the pandemic to handle strong demand for pricey ecological foodstuffs, but he has since let them all go.\n\nRonja Ebeling, a 26-year-old consultant and author based in Hamburg, said she saves about one-quarter of her income, partly because she worries about having enough money for retirement. She spends little on clothes or makeup and shares a car with her partner’s father. \n\n\nWeak spending and poor demographic prospects are making Europe less attractive for businesses ranging from consumer-goods giant Procter & Gamble to luxury empire LVMH, which are making an ever-larger share of their sales in North America.\n\n“The U.S. consumer is more resilient than in Europe,” Unilever’s chief financial officer, Graeme Pitkethly, said in April.\n\nThe eurozone economy grew about 6% over the past 15 years, measured in dollars, compared with 82% for the U.S., according to International Monetary Fund data. That has left the average EU country poorer per head than every U.S. state except Idaho and Mississippi, according to a report this month by the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based independent think tank. If the current trend continues, by 2035 the gap between economic output per capita in the U.S. and EU will be as large as that between Japan and Ecuador today, the report said.\n\nOn the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, businesses are lobbying for more flights to the U.S. to increase the number of free-spending American tourists, said Maria Frontera, president of the Mallorca Chamber of Commerce’s tourism commission. Americans spend about €260 ($292) per day on average on hotels compared with less than €180 ($202) for Europeans.\n\n“This year we have seen a big change in the behavior of Europeans because of the economic situation we are dealing with,” said Frontera, who recently traveled to Miami to learn how to better cater to American customers.\nPeople enjoy the warm temperatures in a beach bar in the seaside resort of S’Arenal on Mallorca.\n\nWeak growth and rising interest rates are straining Europe’s generous welfare states, which provide popular healthcare services and pensions. European governments find the old recipes for fixing the problem are either becoming unaffordable or have stopped working. Three-quarters of a trillion euros in subsidies, tax breaks and other forms of relief have gone to consumers and businesses to offset higher energy costs—something economists say is now itself fueling inflation, defeating the subsidies’ purpose. \n\nPublic-spending cuts after the global financial crisis starved Europe’s state-funded healthcare systems, especially the U.K.’s National Health Service.\n\nVivek Trivedi, a 31-year-old anesthesiologist living in Manchester, England, earns about £51,000 ($67,000) per year for a 48-hour workweek. Inflation, which has been about 10% or higher in the U.K. for nearly a year, is devouring his monthly budget, he says. Trivedi said he shops for groceries in discount retailers and spends less on meals out. Some colleagues turned off their heating entirely over recent months, worried they wouldn’t be able to afford sharply higher costs, he said.\n\nNoa Cohen, a 28-year old public-affairs specialist in London, says she could quadruple her salary in the same job by leveraging her U.S. passport to move across the Atlantic. Cohen recently got a 10% pay raise after switching jobs, but the increase was completely swallowed by inflation. She says friends are freezing their eggs because they can’t afford children anytime soon, in the hope that they have enough money in future. \n\n“It feels like a perma-freeze in living standards,” she said.\n\n\nHuw Pill, the Bank of England’s chief economist, warned U.K. citizens in April that they need to accept that they are poorer and stop pushing for higher wages. “Yes, we’re all worse off,” he said, saying that seeking to offset rising prices with higher wages would only fuel more inflation.\n\nWith European governments needing to increase defense spending and given rising borrowing costs, economists expect taxes to increase, adding pressure on consumers. Taxes in Europe are already high relative to those in other wealthy countries, equivalent to around 40-45% of GDP compared with 27% in the U.S. American workers take home almost three-quarters of their paychecks, including income taxes and Social Security taxes, while French and German workers keep just half. \n\nThe pauperization of Europe has bolstered the ranks of labor unions, which are picking up tens of thousands of members across the continent, reversing a decades long decline. \n\n\nHigher unionization may not translate into fuller pockets for members. That’s because many are pushing workers’ preference for more free time over higher pay, even in a world of spiraling skills shortages.\n\nIG Metall, Germany’s biggest trade union, is calling for a four-day work week at current salary levels rather than a pay raise for the country’s metalworkers ahead of collective bargaining negotiations this November. Officials say the shorter week would improve workers’ health and quality of life while at the same time making the industry more attractive to younger workers.\n\n\n\nAlmost half of employees in Germany’s health industry choose to work around 30 hours per week rather than full time, reflecting tough working conditions, said Frank Werneke, chairman of the country’s United Services Trade Union, which has added about 110,000 new members in recent months, the biggest increase in 22 years. \n\nKristian Kallio, a games developer in northern Finland, recently decided to reduce his working week by one-fifth to 30 hours in exchange for a 10% pay cut. He now makes about €2,500 per month. “Who wouldn’t want to work shorter hours?” Kallio said. About one-third of his colleagues took the same deal, although leaders work full-time, said Kallio’s boss, Jaakko Kylmäoja.\n\nKallio now works from 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. He uses his extra free time for hobbies, to make good food and take long bike rides. “I don’t see a reality where I would go back to normal working hours,” he said.\n\nIgor Chaykovskiy, a 34-year-old IT worker in Paris, joined a trade union earlier this year to press for better pay and conditions. He recently received a 3.5% pay increase, about half the level of inflation. He thinks the union will give workers greater leverage to press managers. Still, it isn’t just about pay. “Maybe they say you don’t have an increase in salary, you have free sports lessons or music lessons,” he said.\n\nMathias Senn, right, a butcher in Germany’s wealthy Black Forest region, couldn’t find local applicants to replace four workers who are preparing to retire, so he hired an apprentice from India, Rajakumar Bheemappa Lamani. \n\nAt the Stellantis auto factory in Melfi, southern Italy, employees have worked shorter hours for years recently due to the difficulty of procuring raw materials and high energy costs, said Marco Lomio, a trade unionist with the Italian Union of Metalworkers. Hours worked have recently been reduced by around 30% and wages decreased proportionally. \n\n“Between high inflation and rising energy costs for workers,” said Lomio, “it is difficult to bear all family expenses.” \n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/europeans-poorer-inflation-economy-255eb629", "id": "1521i5v", "created_utc": 1689599269.0, "score": 1012, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 502, "comments": [{"body": "welcome to the future, peasants.", "score": 497, "replies": [{"body": "“You will own nothing and you will be happy”", "score": 211, "replies": [{"body": "Not really.

In buying power equivalents the increase in BNP has been smaller in the Eu than in the US over the past 20 or so years since 2000 but not by very much. The difference is about 4 percentage points.

When safe Treasury securities offer a 5% return, investors may rightly expect higher returns, around 7-8%, for riskier stock investments. This is because investors demand a premium for taking on additional risk in the stock market compared to the safety of Treasury securities.\n\nFor stocks with little to no growth prospects, an 8% return would typically translate to a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.5. This ratio represents the stock's price relative to its earnings per share, and a lower P/E is generally considered more favorable for investors.\n\nOn the other hand, for stocks that are projected to grow at around 5% annually, a P/E ratio of 13-15 is more reasonable. This range reflects the classic utility P/E ratio, which is associated with stable, slow-growth companies.\n\nFor stocks showing higher growth rates of 10-15% annually, a P/E ratio of 18-20 could be appropriate.

Of course stocks have more risk, so you wouldn't necessarily accept a PE of 24, but once you're talking about a growth stock that risk is off-set by a (potentially) higher return.

I’m interpreting it loosely here but I believe this is what is happening in markets today. People are so fixated on the classic indicators- yield curve, P/E ratios, Fed policy, and we as a society are so scarred from the GFC and dot com bubbles in recent memory that we don’t dare want to make the same mistakes, and the data is so widely available, I believe trying to use these indicators when everyone else is is not going to yield strong results.\n\nLet me give you an example of why this works. For the last two years there was an absolute fever pitch of fear about inflation. That caused the fed to change its policy which caused lots of companies, particularly in the tech sector to cut back on hiring and start laying people off. Meanwhile lots of people flocked to long bonds for safety inverting the curve in the process. Essentially large parts of the economy braced for a major recession while earnings were great. That is simply unprecedented. The entire thing ran counter cyclically. \n\nNow people can’t believe there wasn’t a hard landing and a crash but in reality it didn’t happen precisely because everyone expected it. So what does that have to do with high p/e’s? Well now that everyone believes there’s no opportunity where p/e’s are high the market is adapting and changing. Everyone is waiting for a classic setup where markets crash and p/e’s drop and we go into recession to buy so it’s virtually assured that setup isn’t going to come. Markets adapt to create opportunities where people think they can’t possibly exist.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Goodhart's law indeed holds relevance in the current market scenario. As society becomes increasingly fixated on the traditional indicators like yield curves, P/E ratios, and Federal Reserve policies, these indicators may lose their effectiveness as reliable measures of market performance.\n\nThe collective memory of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the dot-com bubbles has left a lasting scar on investors, making them cautious not to repeat past mistakes. However, when too many investors use the same indicators to guide their decisions, it can lead to market dynamics that defy conventional wisdom.\n\nA prime example of this phenomenon is the recent fear of inflation that gripped the market. As investors became obsessed with inflation as a potential threat, the Federal Reserve adjusted its policies, leading to actions like hiring cutbacks and layoffs in certain sectors, particularly the tech industry. Surprisingly, while large parts of the economy prepared for a significant recession, earnings remained robust, creating a counterintuitive situation.\n\nThe prevalence of such scenarios demonstrates how market expectations can shape market outcomes. When everyone expects a particular setup, such as a classic market crash and low P/E ratios, the market adapts and evolves to create opportunities where people least expect them.\n\nThe belief that high P/E ratios indicate no investment opportunities can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. As more investors wait for the perfect moment to buy during a recession, the conditions for such a setup become less likely to occur.\n\nIn essence, the market is highly sensitive to collective beliefs and expectations, and investors need to be aware of this phenomenon.

I currently have 220 shares.\n\nIn about 12 months, or when the share price hits around 385 (whatever comes first), I will sell about 80% of my shares. I plan to have a total of around 250 by July 2024 (in my personal situation this number of shares is a lot) if the price will hover around current price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why I hear you say?**\n\nThe reason I started piling up some TSLA is because this for me would be the fastest way to get enough funds to buy me one some day and I thought it would be interesting to take the risk to *use* TSLA to *buy* me a Tesla. I **never** had any trading/investment experience or plans for the **future**.\n\nLuckily, since 2019, I've been driving a Model 3 SR+ as lease through work (so it costs me almost nothing). I couldn't be happier driving around in my car the past 4 years.\n\nIn 2020 I decided to put the extra cash I saved due to not 'owning' a car anymore, aside. Since august 2020 I have put this money in TSLA and kept buying monthly.\n\nI have extended my lease until august 2024. So until then I will put all cash I can put aside into TSLA. So I'm lucky to drive around in the Tesla for 1 more year\n\nThe decision to sell approx. 80% of my shares is because I want to live in the 'now' more often. Sure, I can buy some cheap car and keep my portfolio of shares and see what it becomes after 10 years. But I have a wife, 2 kids, and we love to go on holiday every year with our car. We drive a lot throughout the year - though short drives. I enjoy keeping my car clean and getting software updates with new features. I like the Tesla brand. I want to be the father who buys the most safe car in the world to protect his family for the, hopefully, rare occasion something might happen while we're driving.\n\nWho knows what will happen to TSLA, or to me and my family personally, between now and 5 years? Or between now and 10 years? This is why I want to grab the opportunity to sell a big portion of my shares to buy a car I love without taking on some loans or 'owing' someone money again.\n\nIt's sometimes 'difficult' to read plans and thoughts of some bulls/investors to just buy and hold. Most are in a luxurious position and are wealthy *already* (this is my personal experience reading a lot of stuff online). I'm not wealthy, but I feel quite lucky to have over 200 shares right now in my situation and the little family life I live now.\n\nI will never have the amount of shares anyway to retire or to live a rich life.\n\nThe plan I now have will one day buy me my own dream car which I will drive for a very long time. Current goal is Model Y LR in either quick silver or midnight cherry red with white interior. This is more family proof than the Model 3 Performance which I always wanted.\n\nThe shares that I don't need to fund my car will of course stay in my portfolio unless I need it for a special occasion. So perhaps one day, those 50 shares I will have left will be worth 50.000 while I only spend 10.000 on it.\n\nIf TSLA tanks to 100 again the coming 12 months I'm fucked though xD\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading my story, you can subscribe to my OnlyFans for support!", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "You don't have to justify anything you do to anybody\n\nJust keep showing us those stonking boobs regularly is all we ask", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "LOL ok", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "you do you but imo us Dutchies are too allergic for debt, it's very ingrained in our society (see debit vs credit cards for example). if you can get a cheap loan from tesla by the time you want to buy (i think they currently give 3.5% on model 3) and you can pay the monthly installments, you're off way better doing that than selling your shares and paying upfront (if the rate goes up to 6%+ it'll be a different story of course). it's a simple opportunity cost analysis. if you care a lot about the ease of mind of the lower monthly payments its also fine but i recommend considering both options", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, I might consider that after all.
