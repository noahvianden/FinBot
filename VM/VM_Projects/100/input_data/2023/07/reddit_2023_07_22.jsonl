{"title": "Why you should never invest in INTC (Intel)", "selftext": "Atom - Intel flounders industry leadership role and gets crushed by ARM processors for mobile applications. \n\nNAND - Intel had NAND fabs in china that weren't even being close to profitable and sold to SK Hynix after wasting billions down the drain. \n\nOptane - Micron Technology  shut down Joint Venture 3DXPOINT leaving intel without their silicon.\n\nAltera -Intel purchased Altera the #2 fpga player for $17 billion  vastly over paying and seeing no ROI. Intel no longer breaks their fpga business out in their earnings presentations. \n\n4G/5G Modem - complete failure business abandoned \n\nBarefoot Networks - complete failure business abandoned\n\nGross Margins - INTC 38.4$ AMD 53% AVGO 73%  NVDA 67%\n\nTalent/Stock - If an engineer at intel got 200k in rsus after 4 years they would be worth $183,784. At nvidia 200k in rsus would be worth $2.1 million. Why would anyone want to work at intel? \n\nCapex: heavy cap ex requirements will keep pressure on margins\n\nCompetition: Intel faces stiff completion from AMD and NVIDIA when it comes to CPU applications. They are also missing out as the large datacenter customers develop their own custom silicon. \n\nGPU - shit show at first when intel rolled out their cards. So many bugs and just terrible performance but looks like driver issues are being addressed an they are already past AMD and closing in on NVIDIA when it comes to their up sampling technology. I'm not very bullish on their GPUs because they had over a decade of experience for iGPU. It remains to be seen if intel GPPU/XPU products will be adopted by the large data center customers.
