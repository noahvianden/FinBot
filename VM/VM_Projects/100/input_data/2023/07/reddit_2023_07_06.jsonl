In 2023, the volumes have surpassed predictions, particularly in the U.S where fleet sales are showing strength. European volumes have outperformed expectations, and while China’s growth remains steady, volumes are largely meeting forecasts. Additionally, the easing of raw material and freight costs from their peaks should lead to enhanced near-term earnings. Despite these advancements, there’s a considerable distance to cover before we hit the prime conditions expected in 2024-2026, making this a potential multi-year forecast.”\n\nWith these favourable trends, Bank of America analysts are anticipating robust 2Q results and raised 2023 outlooks, specifically from suppliers. Moreover, historical patterns suggest that auto stocks usually rebound just before hitting the volume trough and see substantial growth in the initial years of a volume recovery. Analysts are of the opinion that current indicators suggest the end of the downturn in the auto industry cycle, making this a potentially opportune time for investment.\n\n [Bank of America has raised their TSLA price target to $300 (from $225) - EV EDITION (ev-edition.com)](https://ev-edition.com/2023/07/bank-of-america-has-raised-their-tsla-price-target-to-300-from-225/)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You get what you pay for and I didn't pay anything for this b of a note.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "🤡 we think it’s going up $20 but don’t buy 🤡", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "gotta get clicks & stay relevant", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "😆", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Once aapl goes green...", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|Oqie3OUICmzccZfN1l)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Cmon musky do some🤣", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "The market is now closed! 2.58x beta today.\n\n| Name | Stock Price | Change Today | Today's Range | Volume |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| Tesla, Inc. | $276.54 | $-5.94 (-2.10%) ▼ | $272.88 - $279.97 | 116,073,306 |\n| NASDAQ Composite | $13,679.04 | $-112.61 (-0.82%) ▼ | $13,567.25 - $13,689.52 | 5,261,474,000 |\n\n[Support TSLA_Bot](https://ko-fi.com/markcreator)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Bullshit", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "After all these years, I'm surprised you seem to care.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I always care", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Did upvoteme buy a bunch of weeklies when nobody was paying attention?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "🚀", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I don't sleep great at the best of times", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "🚀🚀", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Initial claims slight up, continuing claims slight down.
