{"title": "Treasury Secretary Yellen does not see recession in U.S.", "selftext": "**WASHINGTON, July 17 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday the United States was making good progress in bringing inflation down and she did not expect the U.S. economy to enter into a recession.**\n\nYellen, speaking to Bloomberg TV from India during a meeting of Group of 20 finance officials, said slower growth in China could spill over to other economies, but the U.S. economy was on \"a good path\" to reducing inflation while the labor market remained strong.\n\n\"For the United States, growth has slowed, but our labor market continues to be quite strong. I don't expect a recession,\" Yellen said. \"The most recent inflation data were quite encouraging.\"\n\nData on Monday showed China's economy grew 6.3% in the second quarter on a year-on-year basis, accelerating from 4.5% in the first three months of the year, but well below expectations of 7.3%, as demand weakened at home and abroad.\n\nU.S. data released last month showed gross domestic product increased at a 2% annualized rate in the first quarter, a sharp upward revision from the 1.3% pace reported earlier, but still below the 2.6% growth reported in the fourth quarter.\n\nYellen downplayed the prospect for U.S. tariff cuts or reductions as part of the Biden administration's push to reestablish relations with Beijing.\n\nShe said Chinese officials raised serious concerns, especially about U.S. tariffs, during her visit earlier this month, but the underlying reasons that Washington implemented them in the first place, including unfair trade practices, had not been addressed.\n\n\"We have to see what comes out of the four-year review\" of tariffs, Yellen said, adding, \"But I would emphasize that really the underlying concerns have not yet been addressed. And we need to work on that going forward.\"\n\nShe said U.S. technology restrictions aimed at China were not meant to be \"tit for tat,\" but were focused on national security concerns, and in some cases, human rights abuses.\n\nYellen said the United States was likely to proceed with a new executive order restricting outbound investment that has also sparked concerns in China, but stressed that these would focus narrowly on three sectors - semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.\n\n\"They would contain a combination of notification requirements, and in a very narrowly scoped portion of these sectors, prohibitions, but these would not be broad controls that would affect U.S. investment broadly in China,\" she said.\n\nAsked if the order was finished, Yellen said, \"We want to make sure that we get it right, and we've been working on the details.\"\n\nShe said there was a \"good chance\" it would happen, but said it would come with a notice of proposed rulemaking, giving the public a chance to comment on any proposed controls.\n\nYellen said she did not know about the hacking of emails of Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and other government officials by a group based in China and did not discuss it with Chinese officials, but said the U.S. government had raised its concerns with Beijing.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal and Katharine Jackson; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Andrea Ricci\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/yellen-does-not-see-recession-us-bloomberg-interview-2023-07-17/", "id": "152kbww", "created_utc": 1689643593.0, "score": 197, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "Puts time baby", "score": 57, "replies": []}, {"body": "She is the Jim Cramer of cabinet members.

Economies often face trade-offs and adjustments to maintain stability and sustainable growth. However, it's crucial to remember that policymakers and central banks continuously work to manage these factors and mitigate potential risks.\n\nAs for the idea of bubbles, asset bubbles are a concern that arises from time to time.

Once again, predicting precisely when and how these bubbles will burst is challenging.\n\nIt's true that election cycles can influence economic decisions and policies, but it's essential to recognize that most governments strive for economic stability regardless of the political climate.\n\nAs individuals, we should stay informed about economic developments and be prepared for potential challenges.

There used to be a lot of excitement for the new Marvel or Star Wars movies.

They did great initially but the past two Star Wars movies were garbage. Rogue One was good. Hardly revived. Most people liked them because you're looking at Rotten Tomatoes and think that's what 'most people' think when in reality, most people felt DIS actually ruined the Star Wars brand with the new trilogy.\n2. Indiana Jones didn't make money. Check your numbers. You're just going off what Wikipedia says their budget it. That figure isn't accurate because it ignores distribution costs and the amount of funding that goes into a project like this where the margins are razor thin and you need a blowout because of the investment you put into it that could have gone to other projects. It's not easy to secure funding, pay for marketing, and get distribution partners when your movies are not as profitable as they used to be. Light Year is a Toy Story character. There should definitely have been more interest to it considering the popularity of Toy Story. They're only failing 5% of films? Firstly, that's false. Secondly, their films are underperforming which is why the stock is down. You can be PROFITABLE with some movies but be underperforming estimates - which DISNEY films recently have been doing.\n3. DIS doesn't own the distribution rights to SpiderMan. They can use the character but Sony gets most of the profits from the films. The only thing DIS owns is the merchandising and comic rights. Spiderverse is mostly SONY's doing - not Marvel. That's why when you look up Spiderman films in Wiki, they'll list Columbia (subsidiary of Sony) ahead of Marvel in the production and SONY as the distributor. I never said they didn't have any successful films. I'm saying their films are not as enticing and profitable as they were years ago.\n4. They're cutting Star Wars and Marvel costs across the board - not just for DISNEY+. Again, if they're performing as good as you are suggesting, why cut costs?

I don’t know what your talking about with Disney not making money from marvel Multiverse of madness, GotG 3, love and thunder all tripled their budget. Even ant man made money for every 1 that loses 100 million$ again 19 make just way more. The new little mermaid doubled profits.\n\n3. I didn’t know that about Spider-Man thank you but anyways it looks like they invest 25% of the money and get 25% of the profit form what I could find I could be wrong so looks like they made a ton of money on that too.\n\n4.

I put a lot of hard work into thinking about these things logically. This concept is really just a different way of looking at the price to earnings ratio. Price to earnings can be found 2 ways. 1. You can take the price per share and divide by the earnings per share or 2. You can take the market cap (all shares outstanding × Price per share) and divide by net income. \n\nThe mechanics here are very important to understand for an investor so I'm going to make up a hypothetical company. \n\nXyz corporation\nShares outstanding = 10\nPrice per share = $2\nTrailing 12 month net income = $1\nTrailing 12 month EPS = $0.10\n\nIn this example, the company is worth $20 ($2 × 10 shares outstanding). For public companies, this is known as the market cap.\n\nIt earned about $1 or $0.10 per share in the last 12 months. So you can buy this whole company for $20 and it's earning $1 or a yeild of 5%.\n\nAt the rate of 5% annually it will take 20 years for the company to generate its entire value in net income. This is the same as the companies price to earnings ratio which is also 20. ( you can do either $20 market cap/ $1 net income or $2 / $0.10 )\n\nSo really I'm just rearranging things to make it easier to think about logically. \n\n>If I put that money in treasuries, I'd get 5% or about $150 a year. AAPL's earnings are equivalent to an interest of 3.2% pet year.\n\n>So if AAPL could convert all shares to cash, they would be better off buying treasuries. 3B in treasuries paying 5% would earn 150B a year, and AAPL is making only 96B a year. \n\n>Is this the calculation right? AAPL has more risk than treasuries and earns less. What am I missing?\n\nYou should absolutely be comparing your investments to bonds. This is what warren buffett refers to as \"the risk free rate of return\" or \"discount rate\" so its very smart that you are already doing this. \n\nThat said there are a few caveats. When you buy a Treasury your yield is fixed and you can never earn more money. Apple presumably will be earning more in the future than it is today. So last years earnings vs today's market cap may yeild 3% but this year it maybe 4% and  5% the year after and so on. So you have to factor in sales or margin growth. As this will certainly lead to apples earnings expanding.\n\n\n>This makes AAPL seem like not a good investment. This also makes valuing companies seem so easy, why aren't all companies valued this way? \n\n>Lastly, is there a standard financial term for what this rate of return is? E.g. is there a financial term I can look up that will show 3.2% for AAPL?\n\nWell its a bit of an art because no one knows what the future earnings will be. That's what you have to estimate in order to figure out what the company should be worth today. In the case of Nvidia the numbers are so extreme that I think it looks really obvious but usually its hard to tell if a company is over/under valued \n\nThere is one more critical concept you have to learn. This is all a good starting foundation so it's ok if you don't understand right away but keep it in the back of your head as you continue on your investing journey.\n\nTo really be good you will have to learn the difference between net income and Free Cash Flow. Thats the last missing piece here. For example imagine a pizza company purchased a new car for their employees to make deliveries. You may think that this would be an expense and make their net income look lower. But actually it isn't because the equipment is assumed to be at full value when you purchase it. It falls in value or depreciate overtime so the company will count that as an expense slowly. But the fact remains that the initial purchase does not affect net income. However, they did use their cash to buy it therefore this cash is no longer available to the investor. This is why investors care about the free cash flow or the cash available after all other obligations are met.\n\nWhat Warren Buffet and many other investors do is they look at the free cash flow that the business generates and use this to value the company instead of net income like I used above. This is because free cash flow is what's used to pay the investors dividends (or buyback shares). Therefore free cash flow is directly analogous to yeild a bond pays an investor for holding it. For companies this is called the free cash flow yield and I personally spend a huge amount of my time trying to estimate what I think a stock's future free cash flow yield is as this is the key to figuring out if the stock is undervalued or not. \n\nHere's a video of Buffett says this is how he does it aswell (note bond cupon is the cash payment a bond makes to the investor)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/nYDhBp5xJhQ\n\nSorry for the huge essay but hopefully you find it valuable.", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "The term is the earnings yield.\n\nThe things you are missing that make cash/treasuries look worse are inflation and growth.

If the economy does well and the population increases (both things that have tended to happen in the long run), Apple's revenue and profit will rise.\n\nWith 2% growth and 2% inflation, the nominal value of your Apple investment will increase by 7% per year vs. 4% for the treasury bond or 5% for cash.
