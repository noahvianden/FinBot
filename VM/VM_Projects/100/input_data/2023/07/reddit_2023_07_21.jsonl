I don’t post any of my positions because it’s a crazy amount of rolling on an almost daily basis. I usually have 100s of varying short puts and calls out at any given time\n\nWeeklies generate the most theta decay but at the trade off of being exposed to gamma and crazy volatility.\n\nInstead of focusing on any individual trade or position, I focus more on overall delta and theta decay while minimizing gamma if possible.\n\nBasically if you have 100 shares you have 100 delta. Any moves up or down in TSLA moves your position up and down that much. Selling calls decreases delta, selling puts increases it.\n\nSo you have to decide how much exposure/magnitude you want to TSLA moves. If you want 100% exposure to any upside you have to accept the same amount to the downside. \n\nThis is where your personal valuation/situation can come into play. If you think it’s expensive, decrease your delta to 50. Less upside, but also less downside (you personally think it’s overvalued so you’re protected to the down moves but still participate some to the upside). If you’re at a portfolio level you don’t want to go below, decrease delta to 0-25. No more upside but also no more downside. You still own your shares but no more volatility, while theta always decays. \n\nIf you think it’s oversold and cheap, increase the delta to 100-150. More potential upside at the risk of more potential downside.\n\nSo while you’re deciding your overall position and exposure, just maximize theta to your goals. Start with small goals to see how things move and slowly increase until you find where you’re happy at for your own personal risk tolerance, activity, goals. \n\nOnce the above concept is understood, then you decide on your strikes and expirations for both the call and put side. Closer to atm is more risk but more reward. Closer to expiration is more theta but more volatility.\n\nThe hardest part is managing leverage and margin. Don’t sell more contracts than you can afford to sell. Don’t be afraid to take a small loss on any given position if it puts you at too much risk for a big loss (the idea is to constantly hit singles while cutting the opponent off at a double before it turns into a grand slam). Never let a naked position get itm.\n\nGenerally what I do is sell longer dated expirations (mainly 30-60 dte) trying to avoid catalysts like earnings and deliveries. Pick strikes I’m ok selling at for cc, pick strikes that are decently out of the realm of possibility for naked ones. Then I use the short dated ones to fine tune my delta and theta goals.\n\nThere’s an incredible amount of nuance and detail you just can’t explain or convey.

To first approximation, being woke means viewing society through various [critical](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical/) lenses, as defined by various [critical theories](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-theory/) bent in service of an ideology most people currently call “Social Justice.” That is, being woke means having taken on the worldview of Critical Social Justice, which sees the world only in terms of **unjust** [power dynamics](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-power-systemic/) and the need to [dismantle](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-dismantle/) [problematic](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-problematics/) **systems**. That is, it means having adopted [Theory](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-theory/) and the worldview it conceptualizes.\"\n\nThe reason I say it's difficult to define is because there's various things that fall under the umbrella of wokeness. For example, someone who is truly woke literally views the world through power dynamics and only power dynamics, how would you go about defining that? A radical feminist only sees patriarchy and sees men as willing participants in a power structure that oppresses women for their benefit. Is this person woke, or just a radical feminst?\n\nI would go further a say the categories of radical feminism, critical race theory, colonial theory, radical trans theory amongst others are all \"woke\" because they all view the world through hidden power structures that make them the marginalised group, and encourage their followers to become social activists to tear down these perceived power structures.\n\nThere's a famous feminist author from Australia called Clementine Ford who literally has over a dozen tweets saying things to the effect of \"kill all men\" and I know many women who support this women, if that's not radicialisation then what is? This idea of viewing the world through the prism of power structures and and the intersection of different marginalisations is what I mean by wokeness, and I think it's antithetical to modern classical liberal beliefs.

I know you're smarter than to make a gargantuan \"brand damage\" claim with only 2 anecdotes\n\nTo prove the existence of brand damage (existence, not magnitude -- that is a related but separate issue), I only need to cite 1 instance of brand damage.\n\nAlternatively, from a Computer Science discrete mathematics perspective, if someone argues X, I only need to find one example of !X (not X) to disprove X.   Person argues: \"All birds are blue\";  I find a bird who is yellow.  \"All birds are blue\" is therefore false.\n\nSo someone claims \"Elon causes no damage to Tesla's brand reputation and future sales\".  I find 1 instance of someone who doesn't buy Tesla because of Elon's behavior, and that claim is disproven.  Semmel\\_Baecker's wife is an example, assuming that Semmel\\_Baecker isn't lying.\n\nHypothetical: Suppose there are 100 customers.  Tesla can build 20 vehicles and intends to win sales from 20 customers.  30 would buy a Tesla before Elon's Twitter rants.  After Elon's Twitter rants, only 20 will buy a Tesla.  Tesla can still sell their capacity of 20 units.  But this does not necessarily mean Tesla escapes financial damage, even though they sell out of capacity.  20 people bidding to buy Tesla products, is less competition than 30 people bidding to buy Tesla products.  Tesla loses power to price their product higher, if some of the people who turn away *would have been willing to pay more* than those who did not turn away.\n\nAlienating potential future customers, is reducing future demand.\n\n* One could counter-argue that Elon's behavior is net winning customers.  In this scenario, he recruits more potential customers than he alienates.  ***However, we don't know what the true net effect will be, either positive or negative.  Hence why there is unquantifiable risk.***\n\nMy greater point is that Elon engages in unreasonable risk with his political tweets, because he cannot know the downstream effects with certainty.  From a business perspective, this is not wise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>long term, fundamentals will be the only thing that drives the valuation of any company's shares.\n\nFrom a long timescale, yes.  But for most retail investors, the sale price of stock at the exact point of time when they need liquidity, is what matters practically.\n\nFor example: someone owns 500 shares of TSLA today, worth approx. 130,000 mark to market.  In 2032, suppose its a 10x, or 1,300,000.  That is life changing wealth for most people.  That can pay off a house, ensure college tuition for children, and more.\n\nBut that 1,300,000 is mark-to-market value.  There's no guarantee that the shareholder will be able to get that amount.  A 2022-style crash initiated by Elon could bring the valuation down to 325,000 (25%) -- no longer life changing wealth, with uncertain timeline for any recovery.\n\n* Are people here sure that they could time their cash out?\n* I used the \"Chicken Genius Singapore\" (CGS) example to show that real people, like CGS, often get market timing very wrong\n* Valuations can crash for many reasons already.  I think it is wrong for Elon to go out of his way to create additional unnecessary volatility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You're speaking for other people now? Please don't.\n\nThe vast majority of people with 100% allocation in a single stock, do not have the luxury of being able to survive collapse of that stock if they are near or in retirement.\n\nSequence of Returns Risk is the reason: [https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/timing-matters-understanding-sequence-returns-risk](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/timing-matters-understanding-sequence-returns-risk)\n\nAgain, looking out 10 years from now, are people here who are 100% in TSLA going to be able to get out in time?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>furthermore, the Woke Cult has done more brand damage to Tesla than Elon ever could (who basically created the freaking brand). Why don't you speak out against the Woke Cult instead of Elon?\n\nI acknowledge that many attacks on Elon Musk have been unfair.  Particularly Democratic politicians like Sen. Sanders and Sen. Warren using Elon as a billiionire \"punching bag\" for a tax problem that Elon did not create.  I've consistently opposed these actions from Democrat politicians and their supporters.\n\nHowever, that does not excuse Elon's pattern of antisocial conduct:\n\n* Libeling Yoel Roth, which I discussed earlier, which incited threats of violence against him\n* Making threats against National Public Radio (NPR) after NPR objected to being labeled state-sponsored media\n* Spreading conspiracy theories (Dr. Fauci, Paul Pelosi and George Soros)\n\nHe should do better than this.\n\nHis behavior does have an effect on Tesla's fundamentals and the wealth that investors are ultimately able to realize from their TSLA shares", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "guess I have to reply in two parts", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">Unless you know his in-laws personally, and have spoken to them about the topic, your conclusion about their motivations has much less credibility compared to wetdreamzaboutmemes' statement about why they might buy a Polestar instead.

It's not just hating Elon either, it's literally anybody. If someone goes out of their way to say I hate _____, then that's a problem with themselves. Bottom line.\n\nThe example you're giving of Elon taking something out of context, has almost no effect on the market for Teslas. Think about how many hoops you're jumping through to try to protect your thesis that Elon is doing harm to Tesla's brand. You think that people won't buy a Tesla because Elon, who they probably hadn't heard of until they saw democratic politician's smear campaign, tweeted something out of context on Twitter (a site that many people don't even care about, and also hadn't heard about until the democrat's smear campaign)? That's absurd. It's absolutely absurd. This has everything to do with their own personal problems. The entire woke cult has problems, and there's nothing Elon can do to change their mind, nor the peoples' minds who are indoctrinated by the woke cult's agenda. You're trying to connect dots because you're afraid that the smear campaign will take from Tesla's sales.\n\n>To prove the existence of brand damage (existence, not magnitude -- that is a related but separate issue), I only need to cite 1 instance of brand damage.\n\n>Alternatively, from a Computer Science discrete mathematics perspective, if someone argues X, I only need to find one example of !X (not X) to disprove X. Person argues: \"All birds are blue\"; I find a bird who is yellow. \"All birds are blue\" is therefore false.\n\nAs a mathematics major myself, you're completely backwards. If you'ew claiming that Tesla's brand is damaged, a counterpoint would be showing that it's not ruined for one person. The logic you just applied is \"I think ____, and here's one data point that suggests it,; therefore it ,must be so.\" But let's talk about something else, shall we? Why did you just resort to a backwards logic? The answer is because you're trying to justify a narrative to yourself that you've already assumed. You're falling for the logical fallacy of drawing conclusions prior to evidence, and imo there won't be evidence. That's what we're discussing. You've said now \"Tesla's brand will be damaged by Elon because one person won't buy a Tesla; therefore, the brand is damaged.\" That's circular logic\n\n>Hypothetical: Suppose there are 100 customers. Tesla can build 20 vehicles and intends to win sales from 20 customers. 30 would buy a Tesla before Elon's Twitter rants. After Elon's Twitter rants, only 20 will buy a Tesla. Tesla can still sell their capacity of 20 units.

Tesla loses power to price their product higher, if some of the people who turn away would have been willing to pay more than those who did not turn away.\n\nI agree, but there's nothing Elon can do about that. The woke cult is subservient to the narratives pushed on them because they have mental problems, and anyone who's dumb enough to fall for their bullshit is beyond help too. Again, if someone hates Elon, they have a problem with themselves. Elon can't fix them. Only therapy can.\n\n>One could counter-argue that Elon's behavior is net winning customers. In this scenario, he recruits more potential customers than he alienates. However, we don't know what the true net effect will be, either positive or negative. Hence why there is unquantifiable risk.\n\nI actually think this behavior of his is helping to gain customers, with no additional loss (due to Elon's antics). There will be loss because the woke cult has personal problems, but in the process he's created an immense amount of popularity among many people. But that's a different discussion. You can't get past the idea that there's nothing Elon can do to win over the woke cult, and I would argue that, beyond that, the way he's handling being cancelled is the best way he can handle it.\n\n>My greater point is that Elon engages in unreasonable risk with his political tweets, because he cannot know the downstream effects with certainty. From a business perspective, this is not wise.\n\nI disagree.

Elon Musk tweets X\n2. Potential customer C sees tweet X or sees tweet X embedded (Twitter used to allow direct embedding in articles, much like Reddit does) or image in an article, and doesn't like the behavior shown through tweet X \n3. C decides that Elon Musk is a person that they do not want to financially support because they disagree with Elon Musk's behavior.  Buying a Tesla vehicle helps Tesla's earnings and TSLA stock in the long run, which is support to Elon Musk's wealth, so they decide to boycott Tesla products.\n4. Tesla's brand is damaged as a result, because the company's ability to sell a product has been inhibited (1 less potential customer)\n\nHow is circular?  Step 4 doesn't occur unless step 1 occurs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you'ew claiming that Tesla's brand is damaged, a counterpoint would be showing that it's not ruined for one person.

I am not(!) arguing that Tesla's reputation is totally destroyed. \n\nSuppose in a pool of 100 customers, 50 find Tesla's brand favorability good enough to consider purchasing a Tesla car.  After Elon tweets something awful, 1 of those 50 decides to boycott Tesla.  49 customers still favor Tesla enough to buy a Tesla car.

{"title": "Critical Recession Update: We Just Entered into the +/-1 Sigma Birthing Zone, the Cradle of Recessions (Key Takeaways Below)", "selftext": "Key Takeaways:\r\n\r\n1)\t Seven of the last eight recessions have started within the +/-1 Sigma birthing zone, which we just entered on July 20th, 2023.  The only recession that started outside of this zone did so less than 3 months above this zone.\r\n\r\n2)\t The projected start date of the next recession is estimated to be centered on early December 2023 (+/- 4.61 months).\r\n\r\n3) \tThere is a very high likelihood of 84% that a recession will start within the recently entered +/-1 Sigma zone (which spans over the next 9.22 months).\r\n\r\n4) \tCurrently, there is a 16% probability that the next recession has already begun, with the likelihood increasing rapidly from this point forward as time progresses.\r\n\r\n5) \tThere is a high probability that the stock market will reach a peak (highest price point) within the next 3.8 months, likely centered around a late August to early September 2023 time frame.  This will be preceded by a parabolic stock market blow-off top, which will then be followed by a long-term secular stock market downtrend (an enduring drop in stock market prices across the board) lasting an average of 11.9 months (once a trend is established, it tends to persist).\r\n\r\n6)\t The stock market is expected to hit a trough (its lowest price point), indicating a bottoming formation, sometime around late August 2024.  This is a sign for averaging (moving) back into equities.\r\n\r\n7)\t As we progress through the +/-1 Sigma birthing zone, a secular downturn in the overall U.S economy is extremely likely to manifest itself with rising unemployment rates and deteriorating corporate earnings, which will begin to gain momentum as the negative feedback cycle spirals downwards (once a cycle begins, it tend to perpetuate itself).\r\n\r\n8)\t And the 50-day SMA inversion has just begun to reverse its downward direction for the first time since the curve inverted 8 months ago - a conformational signal that we are leaving the late stage of the business cycle just prior to the beginning of the economic contraction phase (recession).\r\n\n\r\nExplanation of Top Diagram:\n\r\nOver the past +50 years, inversions of the 50 day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the deltas between the 10 year and 3 month daily treasury yield curve rates have all preceded the start of a U.S. recession (there have been no false indicators or exceptions to this rule).  And no recessions have occurred in the absence of these 50 day SMA inversions.  The 8 recessions that occurred over the last half a century have started within an average of 12.18 months from the first day that their 50 day SMA inversions began.\r\n\n\r\nExplanation of Bottom Diagram:\n\r\nThis recession probability distribution illustrates the positions of the last eight recessions over a +50 year period.  These positions are superimposed on the probability curve with each recession's location based on the time from the first day of their corresponding 50 day SMA inversions (10 Yr. minus 3 Mo.) to the beginning of each recession.  The best-fit representation employs a normal distribution with a mean of 12.18 months and a standard deviation of 4.61 months.  The solid red vertical arrow that is pointing upwards represents our current time position on the probability curve, initiated from time zero (the first day of the latest 50-day SMA inversion) and sliding to the right as time elapses.  The prediction indicates a 50% likelihood that a recession will commence on or before early December 2023, with a greater than 95% probability that a recession will start on or before late July 2024.", "id": "1563yfz", "created_utc": 1689982700.0, "score": 1037, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 506, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|18|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The next recession is most likely to start within the next 10 months, with a 50% chance that it has already begun.

Does the totality of indicators not mean more than if there was a single, explainable, errant one? People fucking loooove not learning from history and thinking they are internally super different than 1-2 generations before them when they see inane things how hard it is for elderly people to understand new technology. It's purely a matter of context.\n\n\nI could also construct arguments to tear down that this indicator means anything though, because you're right, it might mean nothing.

The price you can aquire shares for is based primarily on the perceived value that these companies will return in the future. In a recession, that perceived value will be lesser. Presenting an inefficiency that you mentioned. As soon as the market recognizes this inefficiency, it will quickly adjust the valuations to match the reduced expected values. If the new valuation is significantly lower, one could even consider that quick adjustment to be a 'crash.'

There's not enough data to say much at all about the shape of the pdf and especially with respect to the tails.  In the absence of anything else, using a gaussian to model the distribution within a standard deviation or two of the mean is probably not the worst statistics crime committed here.  It's probably going to be approximately correct, especially when one is interpolating within a region of observed durations.  Saying much about the tail though.... That'd just be hurbis.  There's as little basis to criticize it as there is to defend it, except that the central limit theorem makes a gaussian generally a good starting point.\n\nNow of course, IF the underlying distribution were a power law and IF the exponent on such an underlying power law distribution makes it badly behaved, things could definitely get weird.  Although, in truth there's not really such thing as a true power law distribution that runs all the way to infinity on the tail since physics ultimately constrains things.  You can't have undefined variance or mean if your system actually has upper bounds, even if it's a decent model in practice.\n\nThe bigger issue is that n=8 isn't great for predicting anything in the finance world.

For the simple reason that there are way way too many people who missed this rally who would love to get in now at much lower prices so the market won’t allow them. There’s just way too much cash sitting on the sidelines. This reads like a backward engineered story to make people believe they’ve been right all along and to wait for lower prices.\n\nPeople are now acting like the soft landing idea is consensus so it’s somehow contrarian to believe we’ll now get a hard landing. This is one of the dumbest things I’ve ever heard and I heard a professional money manager proposing this on national television just a few days ago. Imagine thinking that something almost nobody believed was possible like two months ago is now consensus and the market is fully priced for it. Absolute regard level thinking there. Markets take years to get over stretched after news finally looks okay. The best gains though are made when news goes from terrible to okay. Few understand this.\n\nI’ve been following the markets closely for about 11 years where I feel like I can remember where sentiment was at various times of excess and I don’t care what the fear and greed charts that get passed around say- this is the most hated rally I’ve ever seen including the one after the covid crash. People simply cannot accept that stocks are going up when there’s “supposed to be” a major recession.\n\nI suspect the most likely outcome from here is that the high fliers digest their gains for a while and it doesn’t turn into a major bubble with an actual blow off top. By the way blow off tops look nothing like this. They are market-wide where the entire market moves higher (not just large cap stocks) then when cash levels are low because everyone is fully invested and leveraged to the tits, it narrows into a handful of stocks. This year has been a catch back of the former leaders after a soft landing began getting priced in around the beginning of the year. Also, a month or so ago Nvidia dropped from $450 to $400. This week Netflix dropped from $480 to $430 on very good earnings. A 10% correction in two sessions that almost nobody seemed to notice.

In December 2022, a survey of economists by the National Association for Business Economics found that 58% of respondents expected a recession to occur in 2023. However, in recent months, some economists have revised their forecasts, suggesting that a recession is less likely.\n\nIn June 2023, the Conference Board, a business research group, lowered its probability of a recession in 2023 to 25%. The Conference Board cited a number of factors for its revised forecast, including strong job growth and consumer spending.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is also playing a role in the debate over the likelihood of a recession. In an effort to combat inflation, the Fed has raised interest rates several times in recent months. This has led to concerns that the Fed could raise rates too quickly and slow the economy too much, which could trigger a recession.\n\nIt is still too early to say whether or not the United States will experience a recession in 2023. The economy is facing a number of headwinds, but there are also some positive signs. The Federal Reserve will be closely monitoring the economy and will adjust its policies as needed.\n\nAccording to my analysis of my knowledge, there is a 50% chance of a recession in the United States in 2023. The probability of a recession increases to 95% by late July 2024.
