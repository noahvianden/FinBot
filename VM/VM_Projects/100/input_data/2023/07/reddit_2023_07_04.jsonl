Please stay away from 0DTE. Ignore me and everyone else in wallstreetbets. The only time I recommend 0DTE, if it’s in an index that has a lot of liquidity, such as QQQ followed by SPY. \n\nLet’s focus on IV hedging for now. Why are you buying deep OTM puts?\n\nInstead of buying deep OTM puts, buy deep ITM puts. Why? it protects against IV spike and theta decay. \n\nhow? Brush up on the basics of the Greeks. I mean all of them and not just the usual suspects, like delta and theta.\n\nOk cool. Buy deep ITM puts with delta 1.0. In this scenario, the option contract moves just like the underlying shares. If the stock increases by $1 per share, you option contract increases by $1 per share. \n\nBut remember, options are leveraged 100:1. So your contract gains $100 per $1 decrease (since we are buying puts) in the share stock price. So if you bought 10 contracts, then you gained ($100/contract) X (10 contracts) = $1000 profit just off the share price decreasing by $1.\n\nIf you have enough capital at hand and the share price moves very quickly in your favor in a short amount of time (remember IV spike), you can exercise the contract for even more gains. \n\nThe only problem with this strategy is deep ITM puts (and calls respectively) are very expensive. You will need a lot more capital than the cheap lottery tickets - aka OTM puts/calls; this is partially the reason why 99.9999999% of retail loses on options trading due to very unrealistic expectations in the share price movement.\n\nThe other problem with this deep ITM puts/calls with delta 1.0 strategy is that you have to be absolutely certain about your thesis for the direction of the underlying share price movement. You quickly profit with big gains if the stock moves in your favor; likewise you will have heavy losses if you are wrong. \n\nOther risks to consider: liquidity. Make sure there is enough volume and open interest to exit and close your position(s) either at a profit or at a loss. \n\nIf the share price trades sideways, you have broken even relatively speaking depending on how deep ITM the put/call is and your hold time of the contract.\n\nI agree with higher cash balances. Don’t touch margin. \n\nI am not touching advanced strategies as I don’t fully understand it myself and haven’t had the need to use them (yet). I still am educating myself on the advanced strategies. You need various tools in your toolbox to be profitable at options trading in my opinion.

Are you trying to hedge the shares of a certain position or your portfolio? Are you trying to create a delta neutral portfolio? Are you trying to hedge IV?  \n\nBuying deep OTM puts you’re trying to buy protection against a tail risk event. You’re not hedging against volatility but actually hoping for an IV spike along with a drop in price. That would yield the best return on the premium paid. So a 20-30% drop in your portfolio would be offset by your puts multiplying in value.  \n\nWe haven’t had that scenario really play out, hence the reason for my puts bleeding. Others who also hedged or went short have changed up their strategies and started buying straddles, went to cash, or event started buying 0DTE.

Not to mention scandals over things that didn’t matter, like antennagate or the notch.  Hindsight is 20/20.\n\nLet me address the bear case for Tesla:\n\n1. Competition will shrink Tesla margins to comparable levels to the rest of the auto industry.\n\n-I don’t think this will happen.  Telsa has a couple of fundamental cost advantages over legacy auto makers.  Mainly vertical integration, manufacturing technology.  To me, Telsa margins are temporarily depressed right now since they are still in scale up mode at giga Texas and giga Berlin.  Pricing probably won’t go much lower than it is now, so we will likely see margins start to recover by next year (assuming no recession)\n\n\n2.  Future growth is baked in.  \n\n-Personally I doubt it.  The company only has 4 models under one brand.  Over time they will expand the lineup and introduce addition brands.  Most auto companies have at least a luxury brand and mainstream brand and the luxury brand is where the real money is made.  Expect Tesla to build or acquire a luxury brand.  And if Cybertruck is successful I would no be surprised to see a spin-off brand that brings the Cybertruck vibe to other vehicle models.\n\n-The energy business will be bigger than most people expect, potentially bigger than the auto business.\n\n-Telsa is a leader in AI and autonomy, and there is a lot of potential upside in that.

The inflation rate is starting to trend downward from 6.5 % in 2022 to a current 4.9 %, and continues down by approximately 1.0% per month. \n\n2) The USA will continue to lead energy development both in the tradition and clean areas.  US oil production is rising with a projected average of 12.6 M barrels/day in 2023 verses 11.9 M for 2022.  Even with OPEC cuts the US production rates will keep pace to level prices. Clean energy investment is rising and eventually will decouple the free world from OPEC.  \n\n3) A computing hardware shift is in its  very early stages.  The traditional CPU computing will need to be replaced with APU computing which will provide low energy consumption and ultra fast data processing.  The resulting new Gadgets will amaze us all.  \n\n4) The 2nd quarter earnings reports and forward guidance will exceed expectations as the news roll in this July.  People are working and wages will be strong - fueling corporate profits and revenue growth.  \n\n5) The USA is the best and strongest democracy in the history of the world.  American Ingenuity and capitalism will continue to drive growth for years to come.  \n\nThe S&P will revisit the highs of 12/21 of 4700 very soon and then accelerate upwards.

The initial sell off was because everything was way over bought and irrational exuberance and speculation caused everything to be overvalued. The market dropped \\~25% from mid 2000 to early 2001. A recession didn't kick in until Q2 2001 and then the market dropped another \\~30% from there.  Along the way there were bounces of 20%+ three times.

Doesn't account for an economic slow down at all. When you look at forward PE valuations on S&P500 they are higher than at any point during the epic 2010s bull run.
