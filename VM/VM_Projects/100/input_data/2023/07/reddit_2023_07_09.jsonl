Check out this report I found by Morgan Stanley on the future of GLP-1 agonist drugs — the profit potential 5, 10, 15 years down the line is staggering. I highly recommend you at least scan the 55 page report. https://khn.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/Morgan-Stanley_Unlocking-the-Obesity-Challenge.pdf (released almost exactly a year ago)\n\nFrom the first page of the report:\n**“Obesity is the new hypertension and looks set to become the next blockbuster pharma category.** We believe the treatment of obesity … is on the cusp of moving into mainstream primary care management and that **the obesity market is where the treatment of high blood pressure was in the mid-to-late 1980's before it transformed into a $30bn market by the end of 1990's.** *Focus is shifting to the upstream cause as opposed to the downstream consequences of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.* Therefore we expect excess weight and fat loss to become treatment targets for obesity and for treatment guidelines to adopt obesity as a primary target ahead of other associated diseases.”\n\nAnd right now it’s all still injectables, and they are in their first generation too — in 2-3 years once Novo/Eli cracks the code for a pill based GLP-1 drug that is just as good as the injectable (or better — there are still some pretty gnarly side effects that have to be worked out) it will be a huge catalyst simply because **pills = quick and easy and needles = scary and harder to use.**\n\nAlso, if you want to see just how big of an impact Ozempic hype has had on Novo, check out google trends for “Ozempic” searches from 2020 till now, and compare it with Novos stock price: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=ozempic\n\nIf you really want to dive into this rabbit hole, I recommend perusing the results of Ozempic clinical trials. It’s impressive stuff, even given the side effects. Ethics aside, **it’s clear that American consumers care a lot more about pharmaceutical fixes to address a problem that has already been created than ways to prevent it in the first place — and GLP-1 drugs fill this niche for obesity.**\n\nSorry for the wall of text, lol. One more thing: GLP-1 drugs have some interesting effects not only on suppressing hunger, but other cravings/ urges as well. It’s a total shot in the dark (hah), but there *might* be some real promise in using GLP-1 drugs to treat addiction too.\n\nI really wish I had read up on all this a year ago. With long dated calls on NVO, I would have made an absolute killing. The devils advocate in me says it may be too late to get in on the action — but I personally think that this is such a long term trend that it will take the market *years* to fully price this in.\n\nI’ll end my post with this: **Novo made about $27 billion in revenue over the past year.

Gone are the halcyon days of healthcare where the insurance paid for it all and the provider could charge whatever they wanted because a third party was paying for.  They took too much, prices got too high, and there needs to be an adjustment.\n\nIt is also notable that during the pandemic, when one would think providers would be making money for increased business, a lot of healthcare shut down, and hospitals etc. were laying off because no one was using health care.
