{"title": "Why do households still have so much cash?", "selftext": "If you had to guess, how much money do American households have sitting in their bank accounts today compared to December 31, 2019?  \n\nThe answer: household checkable deposits is up a whopping 300% in the last 4 years.    The more I dug into this the more confused I became. \n\nHere are the household asset levels for different asset types over the last four years.  \nQ4 2019 ——>Q1 2023 in millions  \n\nCheckable deposits: from 980,550 to 4,188,022   \nMoney market: from 2,159,362 to 3,175,515  \nTime deposits: from 9,552,703 to 9,525,293  \nCorporate equities: from 29,122,532 to 35,820,586  \n\nThe growth rate of Checkable deposits has far outpaced other asset classes at a time where the big banks are not offering competitive interest rates. The pre COVID all time high was just 1.26 trillion.  \n\nI know the explanation that most will jump on is that the 1% is just hoarding cash but that doesn’t fully explain the jump.   \n\nThe data splitting out the data by wealth brackets hasn’t been updated since Q2 2022 but prior to then there was a 6X jump for the 50-90th wealth percentile and the bottom half in wealth’s bank account balances grew from 102,426 pre COVID to 277,455 in Q2 2022.  \n\nMost of the jump occurred during COVID stimulus spending but has still grown slightly over the last four quarters of data.  \n\nI found this baffling and was wondering if anyone has a good explanation for this.  \n\nMy main ideas are that people have saved up money to pay off student loans that’s still sitting in bank accounts or that a lot of people are saving up to buy houses but I was wondering if anyone else had any better ideas.  \n\nNevertheless, there is a ton of cash sitting on the sidelines. If households decide to pile more money into the stock market they have a lot of ammunition to power the bull market higher.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL193020005Q", "id": "14zwo3b", "created_utc": 1689380010.0, "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 192, "comments": [{"body": "HYSEs are paying 4-5%", "score": 258, "replies": [{"body": "This is the best answer IMO.

The hound, a spectacle to behold, was the product of a mysterious alchemical process, a design for the merchant's profit and amusement.\n\nOn returning from their encounter, the boy noticed a transformation in Whiskers. His fur, like Azure's, was now a startling indigo, and his vivacious energy seemed misdirected, drawn into putting up a show, detached from his intrinsic playful spirit. Unknowingly, the boy found himself playing the role of a puppeteer, his strings tugged by unseen hands. Whiskers had become a spectacle for the townsfolk, and in doing so, the essence of the town, their shared stories, and collective wisdom began to wither.\n\nRecognizing this grim change, the townsfolk watched as their unity and shared knowledge got overshadowed by the spectacle of the transformed Whiskers. The boy, once their symbol of unity, was unknowingly becoming a merchant himself, trading Whiskers' spirit for a hollow spectacle.\n\nThe transformation took a toll on Whiskers, leading him to a point of deep disillusionment. His once playful spirit was dulled, his energy drained, and his essence, a reflection of the town, was tarnished. In an act of desolation and silent protest, Whiskers chose to leave. His departure echoed through the town like a mournful wind, an indictment of what they had allowed themselves to become.\n\nThe boy, left alone, began to play with the merchants, seduced by their cunning words and shiny trinkets. He was drawn into their world, their games, slowly losing his vibrancy, his sense of self. Over time, the boy who once symbolized unity and shared knowledge was reduced to a mere puppet, a plaything in the hands of the merchants.\n\nEventually, the merchants, having extracted all they could from him, discarded the boy, leaving him a hollow husk, a ghost of his former self.

{"title": "Economists Are Cutting Back Their Recession Expectations", "selftext": "Economists are dialing back recession risks.\n\nEasing inflation, a still-strong labor market and economic resilience led business and academic economists polled by The Wall Street Journal to lower the probability of a recession in the next 12 months to 54% from 61% in the prior two surveys. \n\nWhile that probability is still high by historical comparison, it represents the largest month-over-month percentage-point drop since August 2020, as the economy was recovering from a short but sharp recession induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. It reflects the fact that the economy has kept growing even as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates and inflation declined. \n\nIn the latest WSJ survey, economists expected gross domestic product to have grown at a 1.5% annual rate in the second quarter, a sharp uptick from 0.2% in the previous survey. They still expect GDP to eventually contract, but later, and by less, than previously. They expect the economy to grow 0.6% in the third quarter, in contrast to the 0.3% contraction expected in the prior survey, followed by a 0.1% contraction in the fourth. Forecasters said GDP would increase 1% in 2023, measured from the fourth quarter of a year earlier, double the previous forecast of 0.5%. \n\nNearly 60% of economists said their main reason for optimism about the economic outlook is their expectation that inflation will continue to slow. The Labor Department’s consumer-price index climbed 3% in June from a year earlier, sharply lower than the peak of 9.1% in June 2022 and the slowest in more than two years. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure—the annual change in the personal-consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy—has fallen from 5.4% in March 2022 to 4.6% in May. Economists expect it to reach 3.7% by the fourth quarter of this year, though that is still well above the Fed’s 2% target.\nPathway to a soft landing\n\nMany economists first began in the middle of last year to project a recession when persistently high inflation prompted the Fed to raise rates at the most aggressive pace in nearly three decades. Historically, lowering the inflation rate materially has always involved higher unemployment and a downturn, and few economists thought this time would be different. \n\n\n\n\nNow, a pathway to achieve a “soft landing,” or getting inflation down without a recession, is “back on the table,” said Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Forecasting. “At the beginning of this year it seemed more of a pipe dream,” said Snaith. Now, “it seems a recession keeps slipping, slipping, slipping into the future.” Snaith has lowered the probability of recession to 45% from 90% in April.\n\nOn average, economists still expect the labor market will lose 10,551 jobs a month in the first quarter of 2024, broadly unchanged from their previous forecast. But unlike in the April survey, economists no longer expect job cuts in the third and fourth quarter of this year. They expect employers will add jobs in the second and third quarters of next year, suggesting any downturn will be mild. \n\n“Inflation has slowed remarkably already, and we believe will continue to do so because spending growth is slowing substantially and the growth in labor force is helping service providers,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. \n\nStill, stronger-than-expected economic growth this year will also likely result in the Fed keeping interest rates higher for longer, according to the Journal survey. \n\nEconomists expected the midpoint of the range for the federal-funds rate will peak at 5.4% in December, up sharply from a 5% forecast in the last survey. The latest prediction implies at least one more 25-basis-point increase by the Fed. \nMore rate increases, later rate cuts\n\nThe Fed last month held its benchmark federal-funds rate steady in a range between 5% and 5.25%, its first pause after 10 consecutive increases since March 2022. Market participants overwhelmingly expect the central bank will raise rates by a quarter-percentage point at its July 25-26 meeting, according to the federal-funds futures market.\n\n\nEconomists are also pushing back their estimates for when the Fed will eventually start cutting rates. In the latest survey, only 10.6% of economists expected a rate cut in the second half of this year, down from 36.8% in the last survey. The majority of economists, nearly 79%, expected the Fed will cut rates in the first half of 2024 as the unemployment rate rises. Some 42.4% expected that first cut will come in the second quarter.\n\nEconomists are relatively sanguine about the impact of the end of the government’s pandemic-era pause on student-debt payments, which allowed millions of Americans to avoid a big monthly bill for more than three years.\n\nThe resumption of student-loan payments is expected to have a relatively minor impact this fall, shaving 0.2 percentage points, annualized, from consumer spending growth, measured from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n“We will likely see some slowing in spending growth toward the end of this year as a result of the resumed payments denting certain households’ ability to consume, but we do not think the end to the payment pause will be widespread enough to have a significant effect on overall U.S. household spending,” said Wells Fargo chief economist Jay Bryson.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-are-cutting-back-their-recession-expectations-74118938", "id": "150h8xq", "created_utc": 1689440771.0, "score": 510, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 304, "comments": [{"body": "“Largest drop in recession expectations since August 2020” …so after the recession already happened.\n\n\nWe’re gonna wake up one day and the news will be: “Economists announce that we were in a recession from early 2022 - mid 2023”", "score": 376, "replies": [{"body": "Aren't recessions always identified retroactively though?

While it's true that artificial intelligence has been making significant advancements in recent years, leading to automation in various industries, I believe that it's crucial to view this shift as an opportunity rather than a threat.\n\nHistorically, technological advancements have indeed disrupted job markets, rendering certain roles obsolete. However, they have also created new avenues for growth and innovation. AI is no exception to this trend. Instead of dwelling solely on the potential job losses, we should shift our focus towards how we can adapt and thrive in this changing landscape.\n\nIt's important to remember that AI is primarily designed to augment human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. By automating repetitive and mundane tasks, AI frees up human resources to focus on higher-level, creative, and strategic work. This shift can lead to a more fulfilling and meaningful job experience for individuals.\n\nMoreover, the rise of AI technology necessitates a growing demand for skilled professionals who can design, develop, and maintain these systems. It presents opportunities for upskilling and reskilling, allowing individuals to remain relevant and adaptable in the job market. By acquiring new skills, such as data analysis, programming, or machine learning, one can position themselves as valuable assets in the era of AI.\n\nAdditionally, the integration of AI often creates entirely new industries and job roles that were previously unimaginable. From AI ethics specialists to data privacy consultants and algorithm trainers, there's an increasing need for humans to oversee, govern, and guide the AI systems. These emergent professions require a unique set of skills that cannot be easily replicated by machines.\n\nLastly, it's worth noting that societal and ethical considerations play a vital role in AI implementation. The human touch is essential to ensure fairness, accountability, and unbiased decision-making in AI systems. Therefore, human involvement in collaboration with AI is indispensable for a well-rounded and responsible approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while AI undoubtedly impacts the job market, it is crucial to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to adapt. By embracing change, acquiring new skills, and actively participating in the development and governance of AI, we can shape a future where humans and intelligent machines work hand in hand, fostering a more prosperous and innovative society.\n\nRemember, the power lies in our ability to evolve alongside technology!\n\nStay curious and keep learning!\n\nNote: This comment is meant to generate a constructive discussion and highlight potential positive outcomes.

While it is true that technological advancements have historically led to the creation of new industries and job roles, the current wave of AI automation presents unique concerns.\n\nUnlike previous technologies, AI has the potential to automate not just repetitive and mundane tasks, but also complex cognitive tasks that were traditionally performed by humans. This poses a significant risk to a wide range of jobs across various sectors, potentially leading to widespread unemployment and socioeconomic disparities.\n\nWhile proponents of AI argue that it will augment human capabilities, the reality is that many jobs will be completely replaced by AI systems. This can lead to significant job displacement, particularly for workers in low-skilled or routine-based occupations. Simply acquiring new skills is not a guarantee of job security, as the number of available jobs may not match the number of displaced workers.\n\nFurthermore, the argument assumes that the demand for skilled professionals in designing, developing, and maintaining AI systems will offset the job losses. However, these specialized roles are limited in number and require advanced education and expertise, making it difficult for a large portion of the workforce to transition into them.\n\nThe claim that AI will create new industries and job roles often overlooks the fact that these emerging fields may not absorb the displaced workforce on a sufficient scale. Additionally, the new jobs created may not provide the same level of stability, benefits, or wages as the jobs being replaced, exacerbating income inequality and economic insecurity.\n\nThe argument also assumes that human oversight and collaboration will effectively address the ethical and societal challenges associated with AI. However, the rapid pace of AI development and deployment raises concerns about the potential for unintended consequences, biases, and loss of privacy. Human involvement alone may not be enough to ensure responsible AI implementation, as biases can be unintentionally embedded in algorithms or arise from insufficiently diverse human perspectives.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is essential to consider the potential benefits of AI, it is crucial not to overlook the significant challenges it poses to job security. The impact of AI on the workforce is likely to be profound and may result in widespread job displacement and socioeconomic inequalities. It is necessary to have robust social and economic policies in place to mitigate these risks and ensure a just transition for workers affected by AI automation. Ignoring the potential threats and focusing solely on the positive aspects of AI can lead to detrimental consequences for individuals and society as a whole.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Well said.\n\nI don't see any reason why we need to develop tools that replace us in mentally creative roles.
