{"title": "Is $META going to benefit from Threads?", "selftext": "One of the questions that many META shareholders have is, what is the impact of Threads on the company‚Äôs value?\n\nThe answer isn‚Äôt simple, and I‚Äôll try to break down the components and share my thoughts.\n\nMark Zuckerberg shared that monetization options would be explored once Threads hits one billion users (As am I writing this, there are over 83 million users. For comparison, Twitter has close to 400 million).\r  \n\r  \nFrom Meta‚Äôs point of view, the so-called family of Apps includes two social media platforms - Facebook and Instagram. Both of these platforms are in mature monetization stages, where both the revenue per user and the margins are incredibly high.\r  \n\r  \nIf we take a look at the big picture, all social media companies make money by selling advertisements. The formula behind that is simple:\n\n**Number of users** X **Time spent on the platform** X **Advertisement revenue**\n\nThe time that is being spent is limited, every one of us has 24 hours in a day and decides how to use (or waste) it.\r  \n\r  \nPart of the Facebook/Instagram users will use part of their time using Threads and the impact is obvious. If we take a look at the formula above, it is quite clear that the time spent on Facebook/Instagram will be lower, hence, the revenue generated there is expected to decrease. In addition, as Threads is not monetized, it will only bring additional expenses for keeping the platform up and running. In the short run, there shouldn‚Äôt be high expectations for Meta when it comes to the financials.\n\nWhether Threads will generate value, in the long run, depends on a few factors:\n\n\\- The # of users that join Threads, from Twitter.\n\n\\- The monetization per user of Threads, and how far it will be compared to Facebook/Instagram (So far, Twitter didn‚Äôt use its potential)\n\n\\- The outcome of the cease-and-desist letter sent to Meta by Spiro (Elon‚Äôs lawyer) for creating a ‚Äúcopycat‚Äù app.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeta's value will increase, only if:\r  \n\r  \n\\- The total number of users (Facebook/Instagram/Threads) increases at the expense of Twitter, and;\n\n\\- The revenue generated is higher and can cover the additional expenses for running Threads.\r  \n\r  \nI personally, do not think the new platform is creating a lot of value for Meta.", "id": "14ua1ys", "created_utc": 1688837192.0, "score": 249, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 236, "comments": [{"body": "the question is not about monetization\n\nthey just showed you they can launch a new cool app and scale it to millions instantly within 2 days. any new social media idea? now they have a playbook of what to do to just crush the competition.\n\nall the concerns of Meta cannot build anything new, cannot acquire anymore, no longer cool - just vaporized instantly", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "They do have all the infrastructure, internal tools to run large scale websites etc. Hardly suprising that running yet another large service isn't that difficult to figure out for them.

It just gave me some vocab.\n\nI dont agree with the idea of holding kids back. There is no point. k-12 is really just nonsense. Its baby sitting.
