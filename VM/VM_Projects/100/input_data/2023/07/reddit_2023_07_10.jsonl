{"title": "Tesla is going to 100$ before November", "selftext": "  \n\n\n        Foreword- It’s literally marked as a discussion. Banning me forever on a minor technicality, on my first post, from my fave sub while admitting the post sparked good convo so you're going to leave it up feels low. I either added value to your community or I deserve to be banned, don’t see how it could possibly be both. I’d humbly ask the mods for a reconsideration and I apologize to the whole of the community for the mis flair. \n\n       Now sit down, shut the fuck up, grab half a sticky note and a pencil and let’s begin. I know there’s no way I explain this as elegantly as Margot Robbie in a bathtub so I’m betting on you degenerates rolling your eyes and carrying on, but I want to be able to say I called it in the future. Here goes nothing on my first and ig my only Wall Street bets post ever (thanks mods). Let’s make it a prophecy of biblical fucking proportions. \n\n        I believe a combination of fomo, unattainable  promises/deadlines , shit debit deals, unannounced shrinking margins, elons declining brand image, increasing competition, and overhyped delivery beats have sent Tesla to unrealistic and unsustainable heights. Im convinced that what’s toted as their greatest strengths could be their greatest weaknesses. Let’s start with the big one, fsd. Day after day Full FSD starts to look less likely in the near future, and when it does come I imagine it will be more of a legal and regulatory liability than a future asset. I can already smell the class actions from here in the past. (That’s more long term though). Short term for the 5th quarter in a row they’ve made more cars then sold. That’s not a growth company. The Tesla truck (most hyped release of this year) is already 4 year old news and they have yet to start moving them. The WOW factor is no longer  there in consumers minds. You can only hype something up, miss all deadlines, and then underdeliver so often till people get wise. Competition from the F-150 lightning, rivian, lucid,  and others is not just catching up… it’s here in teslas preverbal review mirrors. \n\n      Sure they sold an extra 5% cars, easy to do if you discount 35%. For market comparison ford cut 1%, GMs prices are UP 1%, and average car is down 4%. Many like to compare Teslas brand image to that of Apple. Apple never discounts their iPhones as that ruins the “premium feel” and buying experience of the product. It also leaves a bad taste in the mouths of everyone who bought at full price hurting future sales. \n\n      Let's not even start talking about the companies valuation compared to Toyota (enough has been said on that). It’s lunacy, fuelled by nothing but greed and pie in the sky goals for 2030. The amount of mental gymnastics Elon fanboys have to do to try and justify it is laughable. The fact that the man they're defending has even said the valuation is too high without full fsd and even then…. 800 billion. Jesus. Fucking. Christ. But I digress on that point as it’s been beat into the ground by others. \n\n       To add further uncertainty, a large amount of shares are also still being used as leverage for twitter funding. Twitter is going to hades and threads is the nail in the coffin. (Most downloads of an app in one day EVER). Musk responded by calling him a cuck. Real reassuring from your ceo that he has logical plan to beat this threat to his business and your investment. How long till he has to sell those shares to pay the creditors and service his debts thus tanking the price? I suspect his investors in the Middle East are getting antsy right about now. I belive his bad decisions that he tried to back out of are about to come out of your pocket Tesla bag holders. \n\n      The big catalyst? A very disappointing earnings report this month followed by a months long slide that ends around 120 in November. A big miss, a big one day drop, underwhelming trucks deliveries, twitter investors start demand shares, US rate hikes and Elons tweets will do the rest. Think internet crash of 1990, 2000 but with ai. The golden boy himself (musky the elk) already put out a warning against using margin on Tesla stock before earnings. (Got deleted very quickly, likely lawyers told him that was iffy to say). I wonder why he said it in the first place… Maybe those discounts hurt profit margins a little more than the markets are currently betting on? Maybe a lot more…? \n\n     Many smarter and richer have tried to predict teslas downfalll and failed fantastically so read this with an enormous grain of salt. This is the complete OPPOSITE of investment advice, pls talk with your financial advisor to find out what’s best for your portfolio and goals. ( I’ll save you some time, they’ll advise against this). If at any point in reading this you considered taking up a put position with me  - pls stop, hit yourself in the head with a brick, and call this number - 1 800 GAMBLER \n\n      Time is money so thanks for letting me waste some of yours reading this and pls leave your insults /  criticism below for me to ignore! \n\nEdit - spelling, much requested formatting \n\n[position](https://i.imgur.com/em5Ur60.jpg) \n\nAll on puts on margin backed by my tfsa.
