In addition, I don’t want to even touch the unlimited risk that comes with selling naked calls nor do I want to trade incurring margin interest (which is around 8.5-9% currently).\n\nWith 4 puts at a $220 strike, I could be on the hook for $88k. This I’m fine with. However, another post mentioned that I could get margin called if the stock drops, even before the put becomes ITM. Do you have any resources that can teach me how to calculate how much of a buffer I should have to prevent a margin call?

{"title": "Brace Yourselves: The S&P 500 Is About to Experience a Crushing Blow Comparable to the 1929 Crash", "selftext": "\nHey, fellow Redditors,\n\nI'm here to share some unsettling news that's been keeping me up at night. As I dove deep into the financial world, I stumbled upon a harrowing revelation that sent shivers down my spine. Brace yourselves, because the S&P 500 is on the verge of an imminent and cataclysmic crash. And when I say crash, I mean a crash reminiscent of the devastating events of 1929.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"Not again! Haven't we learned from history?\" But here's the thing — history has an uncanny way of repeating itself, especially when we least expect it. The eerie parallels between our current economic landscape and the dark days of 1929 are too stark to ignore. Allow me to break it down for you.\n\n1. **Overinflated Bubble**: Back in 1929, the stock market experienced an unprecedented bubble. Prices skyrocketed, driven by irrational exuberance and reckless speculation. Doesn't this sound familiar? Today, we find ourselves in a similar situation, where stock prices have soared to unsustainable levels, detached from the underlying economic reality.\n\n2. **Excessive Leverage**: In the years leading up to the 1929 crash, investors were piling on massive amounts of debt to finance their stock purchases. Fast forward to the present day, and we see a similar pattern emerging. Margin debt has reached record highs, indicating a dangerous level of leverage that could spell disaster when the tide turns.\n\n3. **Fragile Economic Foundations**: Just like in 1929, our economy is built on shaky foundations. Despite the illusion of growth and prosperity, underlying issues such as income inequality, rising debt burdens, and geopolitical tensions threaten to bring it all crashing down. The warning signs are everywhere, but we choose to look away.\n\nNow, you might be wondering when this impending doom will strike. Well, my fellow Redditors, I believe we have only a few days left before the S&P 500 plunges into chaos. The catalyst could be any number of factors: an unexpected geopolitical event, a sudden shift in monetary policy, or the bursting of a major market bubble. Whatever it may be, the crash is inevitable, and its impact will be felt far and wide.\n\nI don't share this information to spread fear or panic. Rather, I hope to encourage a dialogue and a greater awareness of the potential risks we face. It's crucial to understand that the stock market is not invincible, and we must remain vigilant in the face of mounting dangers.\n\nWhile I urge you not to make hasty decisions based solely on my words, I do recommend taking precautions. Diversify your investments, ensure a well-balanced portfolio, and consider consulting with a financial advisor who can provide guidance tailored to your specific circumstances.\n\nRemember, the past has a way of teaching us valuable lessons, but only if we're willing to listen. Stay informed, be prepared, and let's navigate these uncertain times together.\n\nTL;DR: The S&P 500 is on the brink of a crushing crash that mirrors the devastating events of 1929. The stock market is rife with unsustainable bubbles, excessive leverage, and fragile economic foundations. Brace yourselves, as this crash could occur in a matter of days. It's time to prepare, diversify, and seek professional advice to weather the storm ahead.\n\nDisclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice.

For example, today we have much better regulation in place to prevent another bubble from forming. Additionally, central banks around the world now have more tools at their disposal to stabilize markets during times of stress. So while a repeat of 1929 is certainly possible, it's not nearly as likely as you seem to think.\n\nOf course, only time will tell how this all plays out in the end.

These measures have created a unique market environment, characterized by abundant liquidity and relatively stable asset prices.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that these policies have been effective in stabilizing the economy and preventing a severe downturn in the past. However, the long-term consequences of such interventions remain uncertain, and there are ongoing debates about the potential risks associated with excessive money printing and artificially propped-up asset prices.\n\nWhile it is true that the current market cycle may differ from past cycles due to the extent of government intervention, it's still valuable to study historical patterns and understand the underlying economic fundamentals.

What used to take a decade to play out play out in a year or two now,", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There's a kernel of truth to that in the concept that technological advancement and transaction timing have increased, but it doesn't have an equal impact on all cycles. But the end result of that is that what you just said is not what's actually happening in the market related to these macro patterns.\n\nMacro patterns in human behavior - which is what this is - are still largely driven by human and biological and physical limitations.\n\nIf you look at human patterns in 1918, it took about 3 years for normal economic activity to come back after the pandemic. When this pandemic began, people were saying \"everything's faster now, it's going to be done in a couple of months.\"\n\nI said \"No, that's not what's going to happen... it's gonna take 2-3 years for a viral evolutionary cycle to happen and all of the effects of that to work out\" People didn't want to hear that.\n\nFast forward and it took a couple of years for everything to get back to normalish.\n\nNow if you have a ready-made vaccine that's proven, that can speed-up resolution of a new virus' resolution in society (See: Hong Kong Flu), but when you're relying on the natural pattern, you're limited and you're going to have a similar effect to human behavior.\n\nAnd that's not just to the virus. Yes, you can schedule a vacation faster now than in 1918, but you can't take 5 catch-up vacations in a single year in most cases... the acceleration factor is limited. The catch-up to the economy is limited in its ability to play out a cycle.\n\nSimilar with regard to geopolitical instabilities, the refreshing of the labor pool, and other factors that affect our economy post-pandemic. Did we learn to spawn more people faster because market transaction time compressed? Obviously not, so that wouldn't impact the labor pool.\n\nSo waving our hands and saying \"everything's faster now\" as a magic solution doesn't really work. And also the hidden reality is that none of these events are ever the same and there are few of them in history, my point is simply to say that you can't wave your hand and say \"Oh, it's going to be Just. Like. That. only faster.\"\n\nBut when we get to macro patterns, we can make some assessments. In my statement above about bears being 6-7 years early, I'm not making that statement on the basis of curve fitting like you are (curve fitting is NEVER a valid method on its own, btw... the curves never do exactly the same things) but rather actual mechanics.\n\nIt's going to take 5+ years for the excess capital in the banking system to drain either back to the Fed or into society... meaning this so-called \"liquidity failure\" that people are predicting is pretty far off. The bank stress test just confirmed the validity of this statement, btw... people have been telling me for 2 years on here that I don't know what I'm talking about and that we'd be drained of excess capital by now and they were all wildly wrong.\n\nDoes that mean we can't have a crash between now and then? Of course not. I can't see the future, and things can be missed, but \"anything could happen and maybe this is 1929\" is a pretty silly bear case.\n\nThough in December 2021 I said the market (S&P 500) would correct in a controlled way down a little over 20% in 2022 (rather than the crash people were calling for) and then V-shape rocket back up (rather than staying low and collapsing into the earth) because of the excess capital, too, and they told me I was wrong then because \"everything takes less time now\" and here we are...\n\nThe bottom line here is that it takes you a certain number of years to refresh the labor pool, spend excess wages and stimulus, and play out new geopolitical alignments and those alignments create a ton of economic activity after they happen.\n\nAnd just because a pattern happens faster doesn't mean it can't have a larger macro pattern with it. The advent of day trading and electronic transactions made more patterns realize at smaller timescales, but they still work on the larger timeframe, too. You can have acceleration in the frequency of patterns and still have longer patterns.\n\nNow I'm not claiming to be able to predict the future. I highlighted above a couple of solid predictions that happened the way they did because I have broad personal knowledge domain over banking risk and viral evolution via my background in corporate risk and having managed a bank risk department and having written 3 prior pandemic response plans. I, like everyone else, have often been wrong.\n\nMy point is that you can't just look at a peak on a chart and say \"Oh, this must be 1929 because it's sharp.\" You don't know that. It could be 1921 on that same chart. The people in 1921 certainly thought it could have been 1929, and they were all wrong.

I am not sure if that would have been a better outcome or not but the stock market certainly looked forward pretty quick and the rebound was pretty dramatic.

In other words, it's both good and bad in reality and a perfectly natural \"invisible hand\" that is perfectly efficient doesn't really exist.\n\nSo the thinking that if we just let everything crash, it all would have just been OK has this kind of faery quality to it to me. It's not really a story being told from reality, it's being told from an idealistic perspective... and the reality of the collapse of economic declines without central management in history is almost universally extraordinary tragedy.\n\nBut yeah, I think that having a lot of excess capital makes it really easy for the market to look through negatives and bounce back, as does the expectation of gain on the other side. \n\nAnd I think that biologically many of us are so wired to look for the negative to avoid risk (the amygdala) that we have a tendency to weight the fear heavily against the positive. If we look for a cliff, we're less likely to run off of one, so we get used to seeing cliffs everywhere. So we fail to see the power of the positive perspective driving flows, and then next thing you know we're still looking for a crash 9 months into the most aggressive bull trend in like 40 years.

And I think you're right that that frequency of events basically smooths out a lot of things. \n\nI use a similar strategy for my core portfolio, only I tend to oscillate it a bit based on where we are relative to some moving averages and how the chart suggests a directional bias to me.... but I finance any bias through assessing how much I'm willing to risk and how much I need to hedge based on available options.\n\nI'm OK with having a smaller index position if it means having a bigger bond ladder during uncertainty, or having a larger capital pool when capital pools bring in 5% interest. Everything has to be looked at in risk-adjusted terms and with regard to a goal rather than being \"right.\" \n\nI give myself around 10% or so of my capital depending on my outlook to bet on being right hehe (not bet all at once, of course) but know full well that I could lose all of it. But I've also made a conscious decision to pay that market tuition.\n\nBut in any case, it really is all about having a plan and portfolio construction, and this randomly oscillating between buying calls and puts depending on \"being right\" about the future thing people do here full port is just a recipe for eventual disaster.

When this number increases, it means currently unemployed people **are staying unemployed** instead of finding jobs and re-entering the workforce.\n\n**Historically, every time continued claims has increased by at least 20% from the previous year, a recession immediately follows. There have been zero cases where it increased 20% YoY without a recession.** Sometimes it is a lagging indicator (occurring in the middle of the recession), sometimes it is a leading indicator (occurring months before the recession), but there has never not been a recession when it crosses this threshold.\n\n**Continued claims also tend to lead the unemployment rate.** About half the time continued claims shoots up just before the unemployment rate does. The other half the time they move together at the same time. This appears to be one of scenarios where continued claims is giving us a warning before the unemployment rate moves.\n\n**Why YoY?** There are many ways to view these data and they all say the same thing. YoY data clearly delineates **change in trend,** which, when it comes to unemployment, is the indicator. The forward looking indicator is NOT the current rate/number, but rather change in trend--from where we were. YoY also removes variation due to season.\n\n**TLDR:** The official recession start date will be during the second half of this year--possibly as soon as the next month or two.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "14ps7jn", "created_utc": 1688412143.0, "score": 161, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|2701|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xpjmk2/updated_spy_valuation_from_the_king_of_valuation/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: the recession has started already and will be official by end of 2020.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "2020?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "2020.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Time to fire up the money printer.", "score": 192, "replies": [{"body": "I think they're going to let this one ride for a little while.
