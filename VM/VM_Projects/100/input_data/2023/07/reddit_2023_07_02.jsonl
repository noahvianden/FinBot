Say you love McDonalds hamburgers and you eat them every week, but you‚Äôve noticed recently that at almost every Mickey D‚Äôs you‚Äôve eaten at the food wasn‚Äôt good, the stores were dirty and the servers inept and rude and the company‚Äôs products have been slipping into inedibility so now you have firsthand knowledge that the company may have a serious problem so maybe you don‚Äôt buy any of their stock. Conversely if you noticed a big improvement in their food quality, menu selections, cleanliness and higher store traffic you might be tempted to buy their stock. I know defense stocks go up in times of war and that EVs are the wave of the future, but I don‚Äôt know anything about what makes tanks, fighter jets or missiles exceptional products and I don‚Äôt know anything about lithium batteries, self driving software or how durable EVs are are to own so while they may be excellent stocks I don‚Äôt buy Lockheed-Martin or Tesla because I don‚Äôt fully understand the products they make. This is key! Do you fully understand how good insurance companies work? I do in general, but not well enough to invest in them. Do you completely understand what makes a biotech company‚Äôs drugs truly great and safe to use? I sure don‚Äôt and even though I‚Äôve made some money in pharma when I had a financial advisor like 30 years ago and he told me to buy Pfizer before they released Viagra and it was pure luck that I did , but it threw me because I really didn‚Äôt understand the sector and I have stayed away from pharma ever since. Do you like Coca-Cola and it‚Äôs products? Financially it‚Äôs a great company so maybe you should buy some stock in it and keep drinking Coke to made sure the product hasn‚Äôt changed or damaged it‚Äôs reputation in other ways. Remember what a flop ‚ÄòNew Coke‚Äô was? Do you enjoy eating the food at the Olive Garden or Ruth‚Äôs Chris Steakhouse then consider buying their owners Darden because you‚Äôll know from personal experience if suddenly the pasta at TOG is sub par or if the steaks at RCS tastes like shoe leather that it‚Äôs time to sell. You get the idea. In my case my career from 1985 to 2010 was in software development and I also ran an internet based computer games website so I understand high tech pretty well. Now that I‚Äôm retired I only own 3 stocks: AAPL, AMZN and GOOGL and I‚Äôve been accumulating them for over 20+ years, except when Alphabet split into both GOOG and GOOGL a few years ago and I sold my GOOG to buy more GOOGL because I wanted the voting shares, and so with stock splits and buying the dips I‚Äôve got a very fat portfolio with just those 3 stocks. Also it‚Äôs way easier to keep track of a few very good stocks than a lot of different stocks in lots of different sectors. Anyway that‚Äôs the way I‚Äôve invested. So to summarize my personal investment strategy: I only invest in companies with sound financials that make products I know and use on a regular basis so that I can personally keep track of their products quality and I‚Äôve reduced my portfolio to the least number of blue chip stocks that I can in order to reduce the amount of time it takes me to research any changes the companies might make like changing their accounting methods, etc. Anyway, it‚Äôs worked fantastically for me.\nBTW, a stock like Alphabet with lots of revenue streams is probably worth more if it‚Äôs broken up into it‚Äôs constituent parts so I‚Äôm not afraid of any anti-trust actions that it may face because I remember back in the 80‚Äôs when the government broke up Bell Telephone into the 7 ‚Äòbaby Bell‚Äô companies and it was a windfall for Bell shareholders. Actually I‚Äôd sort of like the government to break up Alphabet because I think it would increase the value of my portfolio.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.

The margin on energy costs and the net revenue that Tesla earns on those is not nearly as large as you think it is.

However, the preceding quarters experienced more varied results, including modest growth, a decline, and a significant drop in sales.\n\nThese fluctuations in sales growth suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs revenue stream may not be consistently expanding. Such volatility can impact the company‚Äôs overall valuation, especially when combined with the high P/E ratio of 219.84 mentioned earlier. Investors should be cautious when evaluating the stock‚Äôs current valuation, considering the mixed performance shown in the income statement.\n\n\t1.\tMarket Capitalization: NVIDIA‚Äôs market cap stands at a staggering $1.04 trillion, highlighting its prominence in the market. However, a high market cap alone does not guarantee that a stock is fairly valued.\n\t2.\tEarnings Per Share (EPS): NVIDIA‚Äôs EPS for the most recent fiscal year was reported at $1.92. While this figure appears solid, a deeper analysis is necessary to assess its significance in relation to the stock‚Äôs valuation.\n\t3.\tPrice-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio for NVIDIA is an eye-opening 219.84, indicating a substantial premium investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation if not adequately supported by other factors.\n\nTo assess NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation further, it is prudent to compare the company‚Äôs financial indicators to those of its competitors within the semiconductor sector, namely AMD, Micron, and AVGO.\n\nAMD, with an EPS of 0.24 and a market capitalization of $183.44 billion, exhibits a notably lower valuation compared to NVIDIA. However, the semiconductor industry‚Äôs current fame and widespread recognition may contribute to inflated valuations across the sector.\n\nMicron‚Äôs negative EPS of -2.68 and market capitalization of $69.12 billion indicate weaker financial performance when compared to NVIDIA and AMD. As a result, Micron may not serve as an accurate benchmark for evaluating NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation.\n\nAVGO, another prominent player in the semiconductor sector, boasts a healthy EPS of 31.64 and a P/E ratio of 27.41. With a market capitalization of $357.98 billion, AVGO appears to be favorably valued relative to its earnings, further highlighting the need for careful evaluation within the semiconductor sector.\n\nComparing AVGO‚Äôs Annual Income Statement with NVDA‚Äôs provides valuable insights into the financial performance of both companies:\n\nAVGO Annual Income Statement:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\t2022 Sales/Revenue: $33,203 million\n\t‚Ä¢\t2022 Net Income: $11,495 million\n\nNVDA Annual Income Statement:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\t2023 Sales/Revenue: $26,974 million\n\t‚Ä¢\t2023 Net Income: $4,368 million\n\nLooking at the revenue figures, AVGO has consistently shown higher sales/revenue over the past five years. In 2022, AVGO reported sales of $33,203 million, while NVDA reported sales of $26,974 million.\n\nIn terms of net income, AVGO has also demonstrated strong performance. In 2022, AVGO reported a net income of $11,495 million, indicating robust profitability. On the other hand, NVDA reported a net income of $4,368 million in 2023, which is notably lower than AVGO‚Äôs net income.\n\nThese figures suggest that AVGO has consistently outperformed NVDA in terms of both revenue and net income. The higher revenue and stronger profitability of AVGO further reinforce the argument that NVIDIA may be overvalued when compared to AVGO.\n\nTaking into account the prevailing economic challenges and the potential impact on the semiconductor sector, there are indications that NVIDIA‚Äôs current valuation may be inflated. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, has gained significant attention due to its critical role in emerging technologies and the ongoing digital revolution. However, widespread recognition and market enthusiasm can contribute to elevated valuations.\n\nGiven the factors discussed above, including the mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers, there is a compelling case to suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may experience a sharp price decline in the near future. The current economic environment, with signs of a slowdown in overall economic activity and uncertainties surrounding inflation and interest rates, adds further weight to this analysis.\n\nWhile the company‚Äôs prominence in the semiconductor industry is undeniable, the potential for overvaluation cannot be overlooked. The market cap of $1.04 trillion alone does not guarantee fair valuation, and the EPS and P/E ratio indicate a premium investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.\n\nWhile the stock has enjoyed significant attention and growth, there are indications that it is overvalued. In conclusion, it is crucial for investors to assess NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation critically, taking into account the economic landscape, company fundamentals, and industry trends.", "id": "14orfd1", "created_utc": 1688312639.0, "score": 310, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 303, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|53|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 week|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: There are several indications that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may be overvalued, including the company‚Äôs mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers.
