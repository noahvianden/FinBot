There's a deer near the road 1000m from the road on the right in 700m, moving left with a velocity of 12km/h. However, it's far enough from the road and moving at a slow speed, so there's no immediate danger. We are on the second line from the right and there's incoming traffic on the left, so we should maintain our lane and speed, while keeping an eye on the deer. If the deer's trajectory changes, we will need to adjust our actions accordingly.\n\n\n**How fast would the deer have to run for it to be a danger?**\n\nThe deer would need to be moving at a speed that would put it in the path of the vehicle within the vehicle's stopping distance. Given the vehicle's current speed of 50km/h, it would take approximately 14 seconds to stop completely in an emergency situation. This includes both the time to react to the hazard and the time to brake to a stop.\n\nIf the deer is 700m away, and moving towards the road, it would need to cover that distance in less than 14 seconds to pose a danger. This would require a speed of at least 180km/h (700m/14s * 3.6 to convert m/s to km/h), which is far beyond the capabilities of a deer. \n\nTherefore, under normal circumstances, the deer would not pose a danger unless it was much closer to the road or the vehicle was traveling at a much higher speed.\n\n\n**If the car didn't brake how fast the deer would have to run then?**\n\nIf the car didn't brake and maintained its speed of 50km/h, the time it would take to reach the point where the deer is expected to cross would be 700m / (50km/h) = 50.4 seconds.\n\nIn this case, for the deer to pose a danger, it would need to cover the 1000m distance to the road in less than 50.4 seconds. This would require a speed of at least 71.4km/h (1000m / 50.4s * 3.6 to convert m/s to km/h), which is still beyond the capabilities of a deer. \n\nTherefore, even if the car didn't brake, the deer would not pose a danger unless it was much closer to the road or moving at a much higher speed.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "> No it wouldn't.

It can grow with your learning it can adapt to know what you are good at and what you are weak at and play to those or help you get better.\n\nSomeone who explains it quite well in simple terms is  Mark Andreessen. He has been on many different podcasts.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">This AI feels eerily similar to these things and I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs different.\n\nHere's the simple answer: AI is different because it's already being used today by millions around the world to be more productive in their lives. I'm a lead engineer and I find it immensely helpful in writing code as well as discussing pros and cons of software architectural decisions. It has more knowledge and does a better job than 90% of the engineers in my company.\n\nThis is just my own experience using it in a limited space. There must be millions of others who are using it to help them out in other areas of life.\n\nWhy do you think it's hype?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The hype is because a lot of people are heavily invested in it and hype helps keep stocks strong because traders are a skittish lot.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I recommend reading life 3.0 by Tegmark, or superintelligence for a more technical and dry version", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "AI can analyze loads of data and help answer questions and support decision making.

But the point is, no one has anything even closely resembling \"intelligence\" in their software.\n\nWhat we have is \"ML\" and it various forms. There are excellent uses for the technology, most notably repetitive tasks that have some variability that cannot be handled by a simple machine. Think sorting products. In the old days we had to create lines for each type of product based on its weight, size, shape, etc. This was costly and took a lot of space. With ML we can design a more complex machine that recognizes these things on the fly using image recognition, articulation, and other sensors. So now a rather small articulating hand can replace 1000 sqft of sorting machinery.\n\nSo think of ML as a means to create more complex robots. Not intelligent, by any stretch of the word, but more capable than old counterparts and they dont have to be physical either. They can be software only and used for data analysis. Being math based in nature, they can be trained in various ways to find patterns that we humans cant see very easily... but this is where the hype comes in.\n\nThe hype is these data analysis bots will find things that change our lives... this is not going to happen or... is unlikely to happen. The reason being, most of the obvious data relationships are well known already. We didnt need a ML bot to tell us where we might have traffic jams or how our logistics network will behave if we removed a shipment center in city X or Y. We already knew that stuff. This is why despite having this tech for about 30 years, not much has come from it. Its because its telling us what we already knew.\n\nThats not to say its useless, just that its has a narrower productive uses than many think. For example, its excellent for things like predicting an object trajectory on the fly and auto correct settings for us. Something we humans may not be able to do as quickly. This could be used in cars, planes, missiles, medicine, etc.\n\nSo yea its great technology and something we couldnt do, easily, in the past due to not having the tools to do it (fast/cheap/small computers). Now that we have the tools, we can apply it to many things similar to how we apply computers to everything today... even shoes have computers in them these days... fridges (lol).", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "it's the latest fad,", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ai is awesome.

This will be the primary piece of software we interface with.  Via speech, text but also visually.\n\nIt will learn our preferences and then take care of the busy work we have today.   So let me give an example.  \n\nI have an Apple card that has broken and not working in South East Asia.   So I need to switch cards and want my new one set up the same.  So it needs to use my Google Voice number instead of my regular number.  I want it to be due on the last day of the month like I have with Apple.  I want it to give me a notification for each thing I buy.  I want it to also text me using GV for each transaction, etc.\n\nThis is the type of thing your agent will just take care of for you.   Another example.  I need to get from Bangkok to Langkawi in Malaysia.   But I had a suitcase in storage in Patong.   This is the perfect thing for an agent to figure it all out how I do it and then book all the different things I need to accomplish.\n\nThe financial benefit to the company that provides this software will be unbelievable.  There is going to be so many opportunities to make money.     Then you will also get ads with the software in addition that fit with what you are doing.\n\nGoogle will handle it for the Android users.   I believe Apple will sell access to their customers for this like they do search today and Google will win that bidding.  Google just has a much better ROI than anyone else to do it.\n\nIt will be a huge win for Google and Apple.

This is from the managements perspective in the latest earnings call.\n\n           The main reason revenue is dropping comes from a slowing market in the US due mainly to high interest rates. ENPH's main revenue source comes from the US and mostly California. Second, they are beginning penetration on the EU markets but this market also slowed down significantly. They mentioned seasonality as the main culprit which implies the EU growth could resume near Q4. Another but slightly less emphasized reason for revenue stagnation was the low cost of commodities such as Natural Gas, Coal and other energy related commodities.\n\n           Theses reasons are of no control of their own, but management however is reluctant on reducing prices, instead focusing on maintaining and even in the case of the latest earnings report record high profit margins. Despite lower revenue they posted record net income of 157m$. Q2 gross profit margins where 45,47% compared to Q1's 44,95%. Q2 profit margins rose to an impressive 22,10% compared to Q1's 20,23%. When asked from an analyst in the Q&A segment of the earnings call about potential price cuts in the future considering that they have the highest profit margins of the industry, they firmly said no. They instead mentioned their focus on R&D and manufacturing cost reduction.\n\n          They have announced a share buy back program of 1bn$ which shows confidence of the future growth of the company.\n\n          Ok so, my takeaway from all this doesn't really change from what I anticipated the reason the stock drop was, which I explained 2 months ago on this daily discussion thread. Now, management considers Q2 and Q3 to be the bottom of the revenue dip and think it will resume in Q4. \n\nAs for the stock price, it's important to consider that the market cap of ENPH is pretty high. Still at 20,80bn$ as of writing this and that's considering the nosedive the stock took. Their revenue were 711m$ as of last quarter and expected revenue between 550m$ to 600m$ in Q3. If I average their last 2 earnings net income for a year that makes it at roughly 600m$ which represent a PE of 35, which wouldn't be bad at all if the stock was growing, but it's decreasing revenue instead. \n\nI think revenue will restart growing when interest rates drops, since solar adoption in the US and even more in the rest of world is still at it's infancy. However, I don't expect the stock to move a lot until markets gets a hint from world banks that the interests rates will drop. That's gonna be the real best moment to load up on ENPH I think. This may not be in Q4 as management seems to think since rates, as per the last FED speak, keeps pushing interest rates reduction always a bit further in time. I've stopped trying to guess when that would happen a while ago.\n\nI've bought a few shares this morning at 147,50$ and I plan to add more but I'm not rushing into it as there is need to do so I think.\n\n         TL DR : Q3's stock price action will be strongly determined not buy their actual results but guidance.

No offense, but it reads like Dollar tree version of ChatGPT.  But fortunately, you do touch on the *right* answer in your trailing comments.  \n\nENPH is highly correlated with inverse of interest rate moves.  \n\nPeople wrongly assume \"if energy price is high, people will buy solar panels!\"  But Enphase isn't a panel maker anyway, and that's not how the business turns.  \n\nIt's more a factor that alternative energy installs are seen as high end additions, and thus access to higher borrowed capital is what really pushes or pulls such projects.  ENPH supplies those projects.\n\nYesterday, rates jumped significantly.  ENPH reporting gloomy guide was just a double whammy, hence the price action.  \n\nLong term:  ENPH is still the premium maker of essential parts for alternative energy installs, parts that have high margins.  There is about to be a tsunami of green projects and infrastructure projects, supercharged by multiple government bills.  There's consensus that with rates at 20 year highs, they aren't fixing to rise that quickly going forward.  The first sign of rates dropping will be when ENPH rips higher again.  \n\nAnyone serious building anything here is considering alternative energy for their building, and it's been mandatory in other parts of the world for decades.

When Nat Gas and Coal prices skyrocketed, people became really price sensitive and started looking at alternative sources of energy therefore solar which is getting increasingly cheaper by the year.\n\nRight now I guess the opposite is what is happening in ENPH's revenue growth, or lack there of. NatGas and Coal have dropped a lot from their highs and the environmentally friendly consumer is not enough to maintain this growth. What the average consumer wants is a cheaper alternative than what's already available.\n\nAnother factor that's hurting the solar transition is high interests rates since most costumer use financing for their solar panels.\n\nSo, if I'm right, ENPH's slowed growth is temporary, I can't say for NatGas and Coal's future price but I know for sure that one day interests rates will drop and solar will resume being a comparatively cheap alternative source of energy. I don't know about you but I have no doubt that we are in the beginning of a massive solar adoption and ENPH is an industry leading product in the micro inverter industry and I see right now as an opportunity to load up on a great company.\n\nBut to be honest, you don't need to rush FOMO'ing into ENPH, the company might not be done tanking just yet, they might have another 2-3 quarters of slump before rocket-shipping back to new highs.\n\nWhat do you think about ENPH?
