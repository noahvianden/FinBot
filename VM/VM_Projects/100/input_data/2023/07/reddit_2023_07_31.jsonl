You are going to automatically sell at 10% to 20% profit, because you don't want to take that unnecessary risk of continuing to gamble your capital (food).\n\nYou are limiting your gains because human DNA is hardwired to preserve what resources they have.\n\nOkay now let's look at the opposite situation.  Because of the anxiety and depressive symptoms I mentioned above, it's going to lead to extreme decisions.
