Other banks are retreating, and HIFS is trying to take their business. They talked a little about this on their earnings the other day. I like that. I've heard the larger banks would like to be aggressive, but are afraid of a shareholder revolt (cough... PNC). So it's nice to have a team with the trust of shareholders that can set up for the next cycle. \n\nIf smaller banks go away, I don't mind being a shareholder. I don't see a lot of small banks failing, but I could see consolidation happening. If it does, I'm happy buying a bank at or around book value. That way if they get bought, I'm likely to still get a small premium. Especially a bank with high quality assets like HIFS has. I am monitoring things like deposit flight to make sure the bank is still healthy. I'd probably pull the plug if that started to fall. It helps that all their deposits are insured by the state of Massachusetts. \n\nWhy HIFS instead of JPM? I don't really understand JPM. It's a massive bank that does a lot of things.

But most of the margin yield and loan composition will be from business written over the last several years.  It will take time to cycle through their books and benefit from higher long yields.\n\nCompression seems to be coming from rising overnight liabilities and expensive funding from sources like FHLB.  If their EPS is more like $1.45 going forward maybe the stock is a little expensive?\n\nThe good news is that like you said, they seem to be very conservative and have extremely low rates of delinquency and you can probably count on them to not blow themselves up.  They seem extremely shareholder focused, disciplined and long-term oriented which I love.  It's unfortunately criminal that they have to compete with banks like JPM that can hold onto deposits for free because they are TBTF.\n\nAnyways just sharing in case you find it useful, I need to do some more reading on them I might be missing important stuff.

HIFS does have the great deposit protection from Massachusetts, so all their deposits, at any value, are guaranteed. That lets them have a slight discount on the interest they need to offer. They don't get why JPM gets, but it's something. In the end, I think personal relationships are key. HIFS is so good at actuarial management that they can at least be competitive. \n\nAs far as EPS goes, I'm not as worried. HIFS has always traded at a high P/E. Management is more focused on TBV as a metric. Historically a bank that can grow TBV at a mid teens rate will see their share price go up in tandem. So buying a bank at TBV should be a decent floor.

I doubt their ability to meaningfully grow the business as a whole. \n\nAs far as cable...their business is actually slowing. \n\nhttps://thedesk.net/2023/05/disney-tv-linear-revenue-q2-2023-loss/\n\nTheir cable revenue was down 7% last year. Now there's rumors of spinning off the unit. \n\nFor their IP, they definitely have a lot of properties. Can they grow the revenues from those properties? Maybe. I feel like that's hard to do without creating new IP occasionally. \n\nThe parks are popular, though anecdotally I know a lot of people who have gone in the last two years and had very negative experiences. There will always be Disney park for hards, but again, how much growth is there? \n\nAnd then, what's the upside to all this? Can Disney ever grow at more than single digits? Will they start a dividend again? To me even if the turn around works perfectly, there's not a ton of upside at this valuation. Maybe it becomes a 6-7% grower, but that seems uninspiring, especially with a 5% risk free rate. \n\nThat's my big why Disney question. Of all the stocks out there, it seems very high risk, low reward.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yep, cable and radio are slowing by (checks notes) ooooh single digit percentages.  Now they're only incredibly massively dominant and profitable instead of *super*-incredibly massively dominant and profitable.  \n\nThis proves my point.

I'll get back to you after we get back from the store buying kids Belle and Jasmine clothes, Minnie and Donald back to school supplies, Toy Story and Monsters Inc birthday presents and Star Wars pyjamas.

Iger is talking about spinning it off. That is an impediment going forward and shows they don't have great faith in the medium. Maybe unloading the division will free up capital for other projects. I'm not sure. \n\nI also never said that they can't sell merchandise. I don't see how they'll get meaningful growth out of that division without creating new IP. \n\nYes, people still go to their movies, but will more people go to their movies than used to? Again, I want to see growth. The last plan I saw from Disney was that they were pushing back a lot of their big releases, which will decrease the amount they bring in each year (it might help each film be more profitable, but we'll have to see if they cancel out).\n\nI don't want to own a company that is stagnant.

{"title": "JPM Net Income Surge 67% YoY to $14.5 Billion", "selftext": "JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings Friday that topped analysts’ expectations as the company benefited from higher interest rates and growing interest income.\n\n* Earnings: $4.37 per share adjusted vs. $4 per share Refinitiv estimate\n* Revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $38.96 billion estimate\n\nNet income surged 67% to $14.5 billion, or $4.75 per share. When excluding the impact of its First Republic acquisition in early May — a $2.7 billion “bargain purchase gain” from the government-brokered takeover, as well as loan reserve builds and securities losses tied to the purchase — earnings were $4.37 per share.\n\nRevenue rose 34% to $42.4 billion as JPMorgan took advantage of higher rates and solid loan growth. Revenue gains were fueled by a 44% jump in net interest income to $21.9 billion, which topped the StreetAccount estimate by roughly $700 million. Average loans climbed 13%, while deposits fell 6%.\n\nShares of the bank climbed more than 2% in premarket trading.\n\nJPMorgan has been a standout recently on several fronts. Whether it’s about deposits, funding costs or net interest income — all hot-button topics since the regional banking crisis began in March — the bank has outperformed smaller peers.\n\nThat’s helped shares of the bank climb 11% so far this year, compared with the 16% decline of the KBW Bank Index. When JPMorgan last reported results in April, its shares had their biggest earnings-day increase in two decades.\n\nThis time around, JPMorgan will have the benefit of owning First Republic after its U.S.-brokered takeover in early May.\n\nThe acquisition, which added roughly $203 billion in loans and securities and $92 billion in deposits, may help cushion JPMorgan against some of the headwinds faced by the industry. Banks are losing low-cost deposits as customers find higher-yielding places to park their cash, causing the industry’s funding costs to rise.\n\nThat’s pressuring the industry’s profit margins. Last month, several regional banks disclosed lower-than-expected interest revenue, and analysts expect more banks to do the same in coming weeks. On top of that, banks are expected to disclose a slowdown in loan growth and rising costs related to commercial real estate debt, all of which squeeze banks’ bottom lines.\n\nLenders have begun setting aside more loan-loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy this year. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.72 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.\n\nThe bank won’t be able to sidestep downturns faced in other areas, namely, the slowdown in trading and investment banking activity. In May, JPMorgan said revenue from those Wall Street activities was headed for a 15% decline from a year earlier.\n\nFinally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the health of the economy and his expectations for banking regulation and consolidation.\n\nWells Fargo\nalso reported earnings Friday, and Citigroup results are on deck. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report Tuesday. Goldman Sachs discloses results Wednesday.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/jpmorgan-chase-jpm-earnings-2q-2023.html", "id": "14ze43n", "created_utc": 1689334766.0, "score": 396, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "Easy to make money on higher interest rates, while still paying out sub 1% to customer savings accounts.", "score": 363, "replies": [{"body": "Chase savings pays 0.01% interest rate.

The Writers' Strike: Although the current writers' strike may not involve a significant number of workers, I believe that if it persists, it has the potential to create a domino effect, impacting other workers and businesses associated with the entertainment industry. This could disrupt production schedules, decrease revenues for media companies, and have wider implications throughout the economy.\n\n2. Potential UPS Strike: I have come across information indicating a potential strike within UPS, which raises concerns about potential backlogs and subsequent economic issues. If a strike were to occur, it could disrupt supply chains, cause delays in deliveries, and result in increased costs for businesses relying on shipping services. These disruptions could have implications for various sectors of the economy, affecting both consumer spending and business operations.\n\n3. The Russian Issue: Based on my personal research, it seems that Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing mounting pressure and geopolitical challenges. While it is important to acknowledge these concerns, accurately predicting their impact on the global economy is challenging. Geopolitical tensions often lead to market volatility and uncertainties, which can influence investor sentiment and potentially impact economic growth in specific regions.\n\nGiven these factors, I am apprehensive about the state of the economy and hold a pessimistic outlook. It is crucial for investors and traders to remain vigilant, carefully assessing the potential risks associated with these events. Understanding the likelihood and magnitude of their impact on specific industries or sectors can help inform investment decisions. Diversification and risk mitigation strategies should be considered in light of the uncertainties prevailing in the current economic landscape.\n\nPlease note that these are my personal opinions and observations and should not be construed as financial advice.

{"title": "Americans Haven't Felt This Good About the Economy in Almost Two Years", "selftext": "A commonly followed measure of consumer confidence in the US economy just increased to the highest level since September 2021.\n\nThe first July reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed a reading of 72.6 on Friday. The print came in significantly higher than the 65.5 economists had expected and reflected a 13% increase from the month prior. That marks the fastest pace since December 2005, when the economy was recovering from Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\"The sharp rise in sentiment was largely attributable to the continued slowdown in inflation along with stability in labor markets,\" Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu said in the release.\n\nConsumers have had plenty to be bullish about recently, including: A month of largely strong economic data, upbeat reports to kick-off second quarter earnings and waning fears of a second Federal Reserve rate hike in the back half of the year propelling the 2023 stock market rally higher.\n\nA 19% surge in long-term business conditions and a 16% increase in short-run business conditions were the primary drivers behind Friday's surprise print, according to the University of Michigan. The report did, however, include a slight uptick in consumers inflation expectations.\n\nThe expectations for inflation over the next year are now at 3.4%, up from 3.3% in June but down from the highs of 5.4% in April 2022. Analysts had anticipated one-year inflation expectations to tick down to 3.1%\n\n\"Easing concerns about a recession, which had been garnering a ton of headlines in the media for most of the year, may have helped push sentiment and expectation higher,\" Oxford Economics chief US economist Ryan Sweet wrote on Friday.\n\nThe Friday release follows a week of upbeat economic data. On Wednesday, the Consumers Prices Index for June came in cooler than projected, rising at its slowest pace since March 2021. On Thursday, the Producer Prices Index painted a similar picture. The labor market meanwhile, continued to show resilience with weekly jobless claims of 237,000 coming in lower than expectations for 250,000 claims and below the week prior's 249,000 claims.\n\nLast week's June jobs report showed the labor market is cooling with nonfarm payroll additions coming in short of expectations for the first time in 15 months. But economists were quick to note that the economy still added 209,000 jobs, the unemployment ticked lower to 3.6% and average hourly earnings grew 4.4% from the year prior.\n\nAt scale, that data paints a picture of a tight labor market where Americans have jobs while prices for goods continue to decrease.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/americans-havent-felt-this-good-about-the-economy-in-almost-two-years-151453360.html", "id": "14zjoys", "created_utc": 1689349070.0, "score": 281, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 301, "comments": [{"body": "Housing market is laughably high", "score": 318, "replies": [{"body": "Right…and homeowners are loving it.", "score": 93, "replies": [{"body": "Homeowner here, im not loving it.

A big video game was an event. You could expect big bosses, big epic stories, big worlds limited only by your imagination, and playing video games could give you an immense sense of scale that was only possible in an interactive medium.\n\nFinal Fantasy XVI is BIG. Everything is big. The boss fights are big. The epic story is big. The cast of characters is big. The main character literally becomes big when he transforms, and even in his big form, the bosses are still huge compared to him. FFXVI harkens back to a time when big video games were big.\n\nFinal Fantasy as a franchise is very long running, and has had ups and downs. The last 20 years or so of FF haven't been the best decades, while FFXII was pretty darn good back in 2006, FFXIII wasn't that great and FFXV was just bad. There were also 2 MMO entries, FFXI and FFXIV, and while FFXIV is critically acclaimed, it's also an MMO.\n\nXVI is in my mind the best single player FF title since X back in 2001/2002 and that's a really long time. It's also not damning with faint praise. I would argue it's the first FF title to live up to what people used to imagine FF supposedly is since X, and by that I mean games which are real events. In a world where Western games are mostly generic open worlds which feel boring and lifeless, XVI is proof that video games can still give you that sense of sheer scale that you remember from your childhood.\n\nCurrently it's at the front of my shortlist for GOTY and I'm not seeing a lot else coming this year that is likely to top it.\n\nFinal Rating: XVI/10", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "WOW thank you.\n\nI’m super tired of D4 and will definitely play this 🫡", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "How many hours in D4?
