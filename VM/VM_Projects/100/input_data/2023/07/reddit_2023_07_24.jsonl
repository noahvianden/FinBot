In terms of ease of use and superiority of product, nobody else comes close, so market share growth is expected.  \n\nThey have a 20% market share with major metropolitan cities such as New York. But here's the biggest thing, the 30% rule. They're looking to increase their revenue by 30% year-over-year for the next three years. And if anyone that is familiar with the platform, they're leaps and bounds other payment processors within the restaurant space.\n\nAnd if anything we learn from the pandemic is people like to socialize. They like to go out to eat, especially millennials. They prefer experiences over material things. \n\nForward earnings looks strong.

It’s one of those products that, unless you have friends who are restaurant owners, you don’t really get exposed to how much more superior their product is to the competition. \n\nThe server takes your order, & kitchen knows your order before your server leaves. All communication is done via software. Commissions on sales, if applicable, are easily done. Things like switching tables, orders, and servers are less inconvenient. The GUI is easily navigable. The handheld ordering device is well designed, to the point that servers can just regularly show the screen to the customers for clarification, which would previously be a bad idea as it would cause more confusion, while now or provides clarity in customer communication.\n\nThe stock price has gotten cheaper since IPO, from an over-depreciation that, IMO, is due for a correction. \n\nThe company is executing their growth strategy well, and revenue growth is still expected while eliminating transaction fees that makes things easier for the restaurants transfer over. \n\nI expect consolidation on the stock to happen for a bit, but for a product that has no equal at this time, I expect it to continue marching upwards. \n\nHaving a superior product is great, but the company needs to execute growth, which they are doing. \n\nNo other restaurant payment programs even come close. \n\n\nDisclaimer, I didn’t own the stock until the open of today’s pre-market.

As I mentioned earlier, they qualitative aspects are more difficult to quantify, which covers your concerns, but I’ll continue to try my best. \n\nNobody here is new to the wonders of computer programming. It’s better to go with that knowledge before going into any assumptions about what business owners have available to them.\n\nNone of what you described is new, and was in fact the old way of doing things. For any and all devices, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a common, very versatile business model. It’s versatile, but not optimized. It’s not that the apps don’t exist. Toast is literally the progression of the needs of those apps. You can indeed just download app versions that are so-proposed that have more limited features, or use any program along a number of devices. \n\nThis whole system was, indeed, needed 10 years ago or more, and everything that you were concerned about is specifically addressed in the developments that have happened since long before then.\n\nWhen it comes to ergonomics, which does actually matter a lot for the people who use it all day, it’s much better than a smart phone or a flat tablet. \n\nRuggedization isn’t new. We have used ruggedized laptops in the military for decades, along with tablets and phones, used in tactical environments in both mountainous and maritime environments, such as Panasonic Toughbooks and others adjacent. It’s nowhere near cheap.\n\nIs there a way to use cheaper specialized devices with superior performance? Yes, but tablets and smart phones aren’t the answer, which are the opposite of being specialized. Putting an Otterbox hardcase on cheap old tablets? With cases and other modifications, using the cheapest tablets and smart phones, was still both more expensive and much worse to use. Old processors are slow, screens are shitty, and overall much more expensive. The touchscreens are old and more unreliable. \n\nThe handheld Toast devices are less like hard-cased tablets & more like a cross between a Garmin maritime compass and an Iridium satellite phone. They do not feel cheap, neither in software nor in hardware. For many reasons in its design, they are much more rarely lost or broken, further lessening the cost of doing business.\n\nWhile admitting such limited knowledge, I’m perplexed why you would jump so far ahead of yourself so as to assume that the company takes advantage of people via proprietary hardware. That’s quite an assumption to make from such a perspective of ignorance. \n\nOld phones and tablets were used, and let me tell you, $100 bucks a per replacement, as you mentioned, is still way too much per replacement for scaled up businesses. Nobody is stopping you from having extra Android tablets for 100 bucks a pop… it just makes you both a shitty boss (for not caring about the experience of your employees) and a shittier businessman (choosing higher expenses) instead of having less expenses with a superior experience both managing and operating the business. \n\nPeople use services such as Toast because, believe it or not, because in many cases it costs much less, saves more time, and even relieves stress to subscribe to the service. Not many programs or systems can optimize operations to the point of lessening the need to use MSFT Excel spreadsheets, which is quite an engineering feat for any program to achieve, and even better for the more efficient management of a business. If finance nerds approve of it, it’s probably good.\n\n\nAs a side note, this is also why we always recommend to only INVEST IN WHAT YOU KNOW. Stick to your edge. In your case, I don’t recommend you investing in stocks such as Toast, unless you yourself are convinced by your own due diligence after adequate research. \n\nJust know that if something is obvious to you regarding a field you are unfamiliar with, unless you have a habit of surrounding yourself with idiots, it’s better to assume that it’s also obvious to those who are familiar with the field.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I view it as a convenience thing for the business.\n\nAssuming a small business owner isn't the most tech savvy or at least doesn't want to be responsible for troubleshooting devices, having equipment available through a vendor makes things easier.\n\nInstead of having to worry about buying new tablets or smartphones when they break, have a shattered screen, you have a vendor to go to.\n\nOr if a certain model that you purchased is no longer sold, you have to purchase a new one which might be slightly different. Then you have staff using different types of devices (which admittedly might not be a big issue).\n\nOr if one of the devices starts having a failing display, or expanding battery, etc. Instead of contacting your vendor, you have to set up a Genius Bar appointment or take it to a repair store.

Crypto is based on pure imagination and has erratic volatility that provides far too little predictability to even suppose it'll skyrocket again, especially due to the lack of enthusiasm as the world gets clued in on its pointlessness and the big brands in the space fall like Dominos. META on the other hand has tripled since November because of earnings reports showing the company actually produces something valuable.\n\n>Even today bitcoin is over a half trillion market cap.\n\nAnd is no closer to doing anything than ever, much less recuperating its losses, which you can't say . \n\n>You’ve proven nothing.\n\nEverything we've talked about underscores the reality that patterns don't just hold, predicting the future has to do with the current realities and their implications. Your whole argument is \"crypto does really well when you arbitrarily select your timeframe\", which offers no insight as far as investing goes, while contending, either ignorantly or in bad faith, that a few overvalued stocks have the same implication when even the smallest bit of knowledge would show why that's inappropriate. I've proven there's a stark difference between crypto and companies you're making bad faith comparisons with, you just choose not to accept that.\n\n>Until bitcoin collapses you look like a fool claiming nonsense while bitcoin goes higher over time\n\nHigher than the $65K it was at? Don't think so. You don't just look like a fool carrying these bags around thinking you'll ever see that gangbusters success for digital dogshit, you are certifiably one.\n\n\"Until it collapses\" is why your argument is so dishonest.
