Doubt it will return another 300x, but I could see a 10x from here. \n\nPool Corp is a great company and business model. Highly recommend looking into them. They’ve compounded around 20% for almost 20 years or so. \n\nCopart is dominant and just knocked out basically its only competitor. I see continued dominance. \n\nAMD will continue to dominate. Watch out once it nudged into the AI space. I also really really like Applied Materials. The picks and shovels of the chip game. \n\nClover Health takes a lot of shit from being a meme stock but its dirt cheap right now and matching steadily to profitability. Their margins will not need to expand all that much for them to rocket, but I think their CEO (Andrew Toy) can make that happen. \n\nSpeaking of companies that take shit, Palantir is as polarized as it gets but if you look into them it’s a compelling case. Great growth, incredible—as in mind bendingly incredible product. Their confidence is misconstrued as arrogance I think. \n\nGoogle is a good bet. I don’t see them going away anytime soon. \n\nTarget has gotten crushed but they still have a great business. Every girl between 20-50 shops at Target. \n\nBrookfield—both the alternative investment arm ($BN) and the asset management arm ($BAM) are fantastic bets. I’m heavier in the latter because you are guaranteed to get the fees off the management business, but I have shares of both. \n\nDollar General just got crushed and I scooped up shares. A great business that always provides a high chance of 15% compounded returns. \n\nConstellation Software is not going to deliver the same returns moving forward—but then again people have been saying that for over a decade now. Their business model is brilliant but the execution is what sets them apart. \n\nOverstock just bought the rights to BBBY for pennies on the dollar. They were already an interesting pick with their dropship model and SEC-approved crypto exchange assets, but this changes the whole ballgame. \n\nHDFC is a bank in India that has compounded massively and still has a huge growth runway as more and more Indians join the upper class. They have a dominant market position. Really like this one. \n\nBoth Rio Tinto and Valle offer great exposure to mining materials integral to electric vehicles. For that matter I’d also look into Albermarle. I haven’t bought them yet but I’m considering. \n\nSome of my riskier picks with bigger upside:\n\nUpstart—in a really crowded market but if you read between the lines their management has handled a truly difficult situation that would’ve sunk other companies. They’re also like 95% down from highs. \n\nCineverse—tread lightly with this one. Management is really good but they have NOT been shareholder friendly. I think they have a special opportunity with their proprietary streaming platform, develop niche channels, strategy to eat up dropped content, and produce hits like Terrifier II—but they just diluted like 20% of the company for “growth.” Probably wouldn’t have invested if I’d known they’d do something like this but I’m sticking it out because it’s still just so cheap and with so much upside. \n\nNetlist—this is a real deep cut. They’re overvalued on paper but have patent litigation with real opportunities against huge companies like Google and Micron. They’ve won cases already—against Samsung and Hynix—setting the precedent for much bigger wins. \n\nPacWest preferred shares—I bought them at a much lower price when they were paying like 16% but still a good deal considering that par value still offers another 60% upside. It’s not my typical kind of play because it’s not a long term compounder but it offers that kind of growth for a few years so why not take it. \n\nAmyris—synthetic molecules company with a trash balance sheet at the moment but revolutionary tech that’s way ahead of its time. The world will eventually use synthetic molecules at hyper growth. Super risky position but I only have about 0.5% invested. \n\nInmode—medical device business with basically the perfect balance sheet and cash flow statement. Still a risky play considering how fast the industry turns over but a little safer than the above.\n\nStoneCo—this one is only risky because it’s in a volatile Brazilian market. The perceived risk has already basically passed as they made bad bets on their consumer loan portfolio. They are growing like a weed and Brazil is an up and coming economy. As more people get online and start banking these micro lenders and bankers will become more and more popular. There are some other options in this space but I like this one most. \n\nDutch Bros—Haven’t bought these guys yet, and still think they’re a little expensive, but they’re only spending money to fund growth. They’re at about 80x price to FCF and 6x P/S but you gotta pay up for the growers.

Inflation is now 4%, and the Fed took a breather on rate hikes. A debt ceiling deal got done, and the U.S. economy is a lot stronger than many expected. Corporate profits were fine.\n\n* Even the worst banking panic since the financial crisis, which broke out in March with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, didn't weigh on the market for long.\n\n**Be smart:** There's an old aphorism on Wall Street that stocks like to climb a \"wall of worry.\"\n\n* Translation: Stocks tend to rise when investors start out as pessimists but grow gradually more confident when ugly scenarios they worried about don't come to pass.\n* This is basically what's been happening in 2023\n\n**What they're saying:** \"The 2023 trend is like other \"wall of worry\" bullish turns in 2020 (COVID-19), 2019 (US trade war with China), 2016 (Brexit vote and Trump elected President), and 2013 (Eurozone debt crisis),\" wrote analysts of BofA Global Research this month.\n\n**What's next:** Some think the continued rally hinges on whether the remaining bears can be gradually transformed into bulls\n\n* For their part, Goldman Sachs analysts say that the economic news — Thursday's better-than-expected GDP revision, for example — looks likely to keep coming in rosy.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "14nskd9", "created_utc": 1688210217.0, "score": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "No one knows what will happen but over a long enough period stocks go up.

{"title": "Covered calls and cash secure puts are not a conservative strategy", "selftext": "Summary:\n\nCCs using an underlying are not a more conservative strategy than B&H. You are taking ALL the idiosyncratic risk on the specific stock, which you might believe as safe, but history is against this narrative.\n\nRant:\n\nSince I'm still in holidays and I still have positive karma, I'll figure I'll make another post so all the wheelers can down-vote it to oblivion. This time I'm going to discuss the mantra that I see people on this sub and discussions. That is the notion that CC and CSP are somehow a \"conservative strategy\".\n\nSo first let's define what a *conservative strategy* is. Without getting too technical on Sharpe ratios and whatever technical definitions (I'm too stupid to understand any of that), most people would agree that being conservative means to sacrifice return in order to decrease variability. For the sake of simplicity, let's say that variability is the % difference of peak to trough of your investment. So a conservative strategy might get (potentially) lower returns, but in exchange you don't get big drawdowns.\n\nIf the standard strategy is Buy and Hold SPY, then a more conservative strategy is to sell SPY CSPs at a given delta consistently (let's say at a delta that would match the B&H contributions you were aiming for).  What will happen here is that your peaks will be (much, like really much) lower and your trough will be higher because you have been collecting all that premium. So this strategy will lower your return but decrease variability.\n\nSo WTF am I talking about then? Ah you see, most people  are not selling SPY CSPs, likely because is really hard to argue that is better than B&H. Instead, people buy CSP on specific stocks that \"they wouldn't mind owning\" either thinking that this would lead to outperforming the market or if it doesn't it's because it's a MoRe CoNsErVaTiVe strategy. And on a superficial level this strategy also appears to do better than B&H.\n\nBut let me tell you why it isn't more conservative. The magic of the S&P-500 or any sensible index is that it diversifies away the risk of any specific stock, only leaving you with systemic risk. In essence the S&P-500 never commits to any one single horse on the race, instead it places (weighted) bets on all the horses that are ahead, using that weighting to make sure that it wins the race. In essence SPY doesn't look for a needle in the stack, but gets all the stack and makes sure that some needles are in it.\n\nAnd that's were the underlying problem is. People arguing that they don't invest in meme stocks, only on \"safe stocks\" that they wouldn't mind owning are using mental gymnastics to justify a flawed strategy. Here are some cold hard facts for you:\n\n* Currently there are \\~6K companies that you can invest in the US. The number of companies that have ever existed to trade is roughly 10x that. Most of the tickers that don't exist to date went bust. So the odds to pick the winners are massively stacked against you\n* The darlings of today are very likely the ugly ducks of tomorrow. Think that in the 90s you probably would be saying that you wouldn't invest in meme stocks like wolrdcom, but instead of safe companies like Kodak, IBM, Intel, Enron. The winners of yesterday are the mediocre performers of today.  Even if we looks at the darlings of today Amazon, Apple and MSFT had all periods of 5,10 and 15 years (out the top of my head) were you would have been a bag holder after the dot com bubble, call me crazy, but  15 years of losses is not what sound investment looks like.\n* And speaking of bubbles, even if you don't believe that the everything bubble exist, if you give it ANY possibility of existing, then you are conceding there is a chance that your safe stock will lose 90% of its value in a crash when you are selling CSP on it. Remember that loses are logarithmic, you would need to 10x your return just to get back to even in that case.\n\nSo that concludes my rant. I'm not saying to go hide in a hole like I am, but at the very least don't delude yourself. Picking individual stocks to hold for long term is NOT a conservative strategy. It is even worse if you are not picking them like Benjamin Graham would, but instead looking at those yummy volatility premiums, as I see most of you do.\n\nI'm also not saying that the wheel strategy can't outperform the market (though something so dumb cannot be in the optimal part of the investment curve); but if it does it is doing it by increasing that peak-trough ratio substantially. You are not only eating the systemic economic risk, you are also eating all the stock specific risk too. If you are wheeling you should know that it is possible that the stock losses 90% of its value, and if you just plan to \"roll it over\" better prepare to do it for the foreseeable decade if the tides turns against you...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: a word\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "14nu2wj", "created_utc": 1688214984.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "Your first sentence is definitely false.

The peak to trough assumption I made here is just a simplification that would mostly work except for some edge cases (out of scope) \n\nThere should be no argument that CC and CSP on SPY **IS** a more conservative strategy than just holding SPY.\n\nLikewise, there should be no argument that CC and CSP on a specific stock **IS NOT** (on expectation) a less conservative strategy. The essence of the argument here is that in modern portfolio theory the first step to picking the stock composition is to get rid of all idiosyncratic risk of stocks by diversification and then choose between risk free and risky assets. Picking a few stocks to wheel off destroys the diversification so you are left with idiosyncratic risk, which means the variance is higher. full stop.\n\nAlas risk should not be subjective.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "And what should be doesn't always happen. While everything you say is true, most people aren't thinking of that when they say they are being more or less conservative or more or less risky. That doesn't mean they are wrong for saying that, they just mean something other than how you are using it. There are different types of risk, there is even a risk of over diversification. Yes you may have eliminated idiosyncratic risk by buying SPY, but now you are \"at risk\" of missing out on major gains of the companies that make up SPY. That use of the term risk has nothing to do with the Sharpe ratio or any of your technical definitions.

Because people overextended their possibilities with credit. When interest rates are low, they can keep going, but when they are high they can't pay the bills anymore.\n\nThere's absolutely no way the pre-china commercial war/covid situation can be sustained. That's over. No more cheap shit that allows Central Banks to print money and keep inflation under control. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's just a matter of time before defaults start. I don't know where they will begin, but I have a few candidates:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCommercial real estate: you can see corporations pushing people to go back to the office, and of course they are. They don't want to pay rent or the mortgage for an empty building. Whoever owns that debt is fucked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHousehold debt: people are indebted to the tits with mortgages, car loans, credit card debt and recently student loans. And we all know how people behave, will keep spending and living a life they can't afford to impress the Joneses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZombie companies: all those that don't sell shit and existed in the era of free money. i think the lagging of the SP495 is a reflection of this. Gamblers, I mean investors, are hedging by betting on corporations with monster capital that will survive the crash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe so called soft landing by JPow is an euphemism for stagflation. In the remote case they achieve the control of inflation to 2% without a recession, it will take a long time, since core inflation is still high and reducing the peak of inflation is easier than the underlying part. By then, people will be out of money and striking (like teamsters threatened) or rioting (France).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still believe JPow is telling the truth about speed of interest rate hikes, and also the magnitude of them. The lag between rate hikes and economic consequences is there. After the crisis begins, he will indeed cut rates, the yield curve will uninvert, mostly because bonds are considered safe, and not only that, they will also pay big, since lowering yields mean higher prices.

So this doesn't really explain yield curve inversion.\n\nMost people on this sub don't understand what's happening with the yield curve. The explanation tends to revolve around \"short term/long term sentiment regarding debt and the economy\" because that's what the original yield curve research that the indicator was based on justified it as... in the late 1990s.\n\nThe person who did that research says that only worked because people weren't aware of the curve... now that they are, they play it and it has self-fulfilling structure. In other words, it's no longer a reliable sentiment indicator.\n\nBut putting all of the baggage of that argument aside for a second, there's a much easier to understand reason why the yield curve is where it is:\n\nBecause when the Fed began QT, they changed the pattern of buying bonds on the market. During QE, they were taking bonds off the market, which was driving down yield across the board.\n\nWhen they stopped that, not only did many of the short term bonds they were buying increase in volume, but they also increased the Fed Funds rate, which increased the overnight repo open to institutions.\n\nSince the overnight rate went up, banks have an alternative to just holding bonds, and that drives bond yields up in competition in the nearterm. \n\nSo the yield spread between different bond durations really reflects expectations regarding the duration of rate increases, which is why Fed watchers look at different yields to predict Fed rate movements.\n\nSo what the current spread curve is saying, is that Fed rates will remain higher over 2 years and then come down, which fundamentally reduces the rate at which the long bond is profitable relative to other asset parking methodologies. \n\nIn other words, it's entirely mechanical based on competing yield for banks and other institutions that have access to higher yield instruments in the nearterm during QT conditions.\n\nWith the debt ceiling deal, it's definitely not high right now because institutions don't think the government will pay its debt, so we can dispense with that notion. It's high because this is a mechanical situation, not the sentiment situation that the yield curve indicator was based on. That, by the way, completely eliminates the yield curve's predictive nature relating to recessions, since it has little to do with liquidity like it used to and no longer reflects sentiment.

The inverted yield curve is really just one of a number of [early recession indicators](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/dashboard/8084) which are warning of a slowdown ahead right now. I think it's a simple matter of, when the central bank hikes rates this aggressively, it nearly always causes recession.

In a normal flat capital time, a contraction of activity and value reduces the value of the market.\n\nThat's why they do QE now, because adding capital into the market kick-starts the economy, so it absolutely makes sense that if you were to go the other direction and tighten conditions from flat, that it would cause a recession.\n\nI can look at the mechanics of that argument and come to a conclusion based on that which has nothing to do with the yield curve.\n\n...but...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I suppose it's possible they could manage to slow things just enough this time, and avoid an actual recession, but tightening bank lending like this is sure to have *some* impact.\n\nI agree, it has to do something.  In fact it did something, it basically killed SVB through bond portfolio devaluation during a run.\n\nSo it's totally possible to see corner cases happen. The question was whether this was a canary in the coalmine, and while every coalmine collapse has likely had a canary freaking out about it, every freaking out canary is not a prelude to collapse.\n\nWe can look at SVB and see how many factors were different between that case and the rest of the banking system, and the answer is \"a lot.\"\n\nBut that doesn't mean we should ignore it... and the Fed and financial institutions and regulators aren't either. That's part of the reason you're hearing about expansion in the Basel Capitalization requirement for banks... the intent there is to keep the banks hydrated with capital to ride out toxic asset cycles.\n\nBut how can they do that?\n\nBecause of this chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xiv8j2on9z9b1.png?width=1815&format=png&auto=webp&s=79e5d660ca4a1002dd3dee3fef4382203cb15ea3\n\nThat top line's the Fed balance sheet. The chart compares how much the balance sheet expanded compared to the play on the S&P 500.\n\nRemember how I said the research everyone's using to predict the crash effects of tightening are old? Yeah, that matters because in the 20th century capitalization levels were more or less flat.\n\nThe theory right now is that the Fed won't step in and will let this return to 2019 levels, and therefore QT will collapse the market.\n\nThe Fed has never said this was going to happen. There's literally no basis for this assumption other than pure \"return to linear mean\" bias. It certainly doesn't come from the implications of the dot plot, nor the actual reduction in the balance sheet which is meager.\n\nAnd the idea that the Fed wouldn't step in and capitalize the banks because \"inflation?\" Yeah, SVB and First Republic completely obliterated that expectation.\n\nBasically, QT causing the effect makes sense during flat capital times, and if you're only looking at that chart at the end of 2021, you could be mistaken for thinking it's flat capital times, but it isn't and the banks are sitting on a ton of reserve capital that will flood the market if the Fed doesn't restrain it.\n\n2020/2021 were the trickle off a capital iceberg.\n\nThe Fed will pull some (maybe 50% of the expansion? MAYBE) and the rest will be staged out over the next several years via bank capitalization requirements.\n\nBasically, what makes this mechanically different? Why have people predicting a QT-inspired crash been wrong for at least 9 months if we give them the benefit of the doubt and call a bear market a crash (it isn't)?\n\nBecause they don't understand the implication of this chart comparison and that we have pre-charged QE, which is why we're rocketing back up in the absence of the worst predictions coming true.\n\nSo yes it's possible something was missed, but we already have the medicine for that in the system... so the question is \"where do these meet?\"\n\nThat's a variable reality that is not visible on the graph. Tightening lending requirements and higher capitalization requirements do reduce economic activity, but is it enough to counterbalance the higher wages, natural demand patterns, crazy high margins, and excess capital (which is the total theme for this stress test cycle) in banks?\n\nThat's the answer no one has... but I can reasonably say the center of gravity for the market on this chart is \"up\" by de facto in the absence of a very concise fear narrative and structural block.  And with the Fed being mostly done with rate hikes, the cost of capital and the risk-free rate of return are now known and manageable quantities and not balance sheet infinite for all intents and purposes, and that last part is why we corrected last year and stopped correcting once inflation started to settle and we came close to the end of the hike cycle.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

So we're only talking ~$1.25 at a maturity of a year or less. \n\nMore importantly, the Fed believes that in its [ample reserves regime](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/implementing-monetary-policy-in-an-ample-reserves-regime-the-basics-note-1-of-3-20200701.html), changes in the size of its balance sheet (or in reserve supply) will have minimal economic impact. They are implementing their policy almost entirely through short term rates, mainly the FFR and IORB (and also the reverse repo rate). They don't even do regular open market operations anymore, since they moved to paying interest on reserves. \n\nAs part of this, reserve requirements for banks have also been eliminated. There are always enough reserves in the system, and banks will always have access to the needed reserves. \n\nBut what needs to be carefully monitored then, are bank capital requirements. Poorly managed banks which make bad loans and take losses still need to be shut down before they cause bigger problems. Banks that do get into trouble here, like SVB, will be mainly those who were poorly prepared for the rapid increase in short term rates. \n\nSo for equities markets, I think the biggest concern here ought to be simply those rate hikes. Even if the Fed is near to a pause here, such hikes have a long and variable impact, it can take up to 18 months for their effects to fully be felt. And already now we are seeing all those indicators I linked above, falling corporate profits, falling residential investment, a drop in bank credit growth, falling M2 money supply (also likely reflecting a decline in lending), a decline in real imports, and labor markets maybe beginning to weaken too.  \n\nPlus, with the recent surge also in real estate prices (home values back to within 1% of their peak a year ago), the Fed may be slow to declare their battle with inflation over, even if it appears easing might actually be required to prevent a recession.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Mostly agreed. I have a few points to respond to or so:\n\n1. Regarding bond market patterns and QE/QT: My point is really that the combination of volume change and rate result in the dynamic we saw of treasury rate increases. Yes, they put more long term treasuries on the market, but they're also selling them back to the banks that tend to use them to hedge to cover treasuries those banks bought at a lower rate.  So the pattern introduced by the change in rate and volume really results in the exact curve we're seeing. I think the composition of the bonds matters less than the pattern of buying relating to the change in conditions as far as shape of the curve is concerned.\n2. I agree when it comes to assumptions about their ample reserve regime, but for it to be neutral it would have to be efficient, and the problem with that hypothesis is that banks themselves represent an inefficient release mechanism. During COVID, they're going to hold reserves up because of toxic asset risk and Fed claw-back potential, and they're doing the same now, but what happens when the risks fall off? Then the banks have excess capital, a Fed that isn't asking for it all back at once, a risk-free rate and cost of capital that is reasonably predictable, and investors who are demanding returns. That's a recipe for capital release into the market.\n3. While I agree that the rate is dominant because of the above dynamic, I don't think we can write off the effect of excess capital. First, cost to borrow doesn't matter when you have actual excess capital. Second, inefficiencies in the ample reserve curve - such as what may happen trailing massive capital infusion during a high risk period that doesn't see all of that capital removed - mean that there's a gap-up until you reach equilibrium. In other words, the assumption of economic neutrality only works on a longer timeline.\n4. As a result, poorly managed bank capitalization may not just result in bad lending, but also reduced lending compared to capital availability, which means that volatility in bank activity has the same consequences as volatility in stock movement: It's directionally ambivalent. You can just as easily argue that bank fund management patterns can crash the market as you can make it fly in the case of known reserve excess.\n5. The question in my mind is not whether we will have a recession, I'm sure that the tightening regime will impact credit availability and unemployment, etc... the question is... will anyone care? Will it make an impact that isn't absorbed by the excess capital? Will a .50 bps hike over two more sessions actually matter to institutions? Does it matter if unemployment shifts from 3.5% to 4.5% if people still have the roughly same amount of money to spend at the end of the day?\n\nWhile I agree that everything you listed off is a risk, and I agree that saying \"maybe it'll just all work out\" feels fantastical, and I'm definitely not recommending that people trade just thinking that there are no risks... there are always risks, and this is a risky period.\n\nBut that's also true for every reversal trend period. People lag on getting into bull trends expressly because bear trends train us to doubt runs. That gets us viewing only negative outcomes, and that gets us buying in short on the most aggressive bull run in like 40 years over 9 months.\n\nSo I think the key here is to keep an eye on the risks, have a plan, have a position that you can change to react to that plan, and utilize positive hedges (like cash and treasuries now) to mitigate risk while maintaining a position bias which reflects the trend... because the realities here represent completely new situations that don't have good historical corollaries.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "1. Point is, selling bonds back to banks doesn't create it's own demand. It increases supply, so it increases rates. \n\n2. Don't confuse reserves with capital. Capital, in the sense that is meant by \"capital requirements\", is just equity, the excess of assets over liabilities. If banks had \"excess capital\" they would simply pay dividends to their shareholders. As for reserves, if an individual bank has excess reserves, they can either leave them on deposit with the Fed and get paid interest, or they can transfer them to another bank. But the aggregate of excess reserves in the system doesn't change, then. That is *entirely* controlled by the central bank. The only thing that would reduce overall bank reserves is the Fed selling off some of it's balance sheet. Finally, it is unclear to me what you then mean by \"capital release into the market\". Do you just mean banks would increase lending? I would say that an increase in sentiment with regard to the ability of businesses to make profits and repay their loans might cause banks to increase lending.\n\n3. I think excess capital really isn't a concern, here. Banks will continue to take deposits because costs of deposits are lower than cost of capital, and they can always return excess capital through dividends. And I don't see any 'inefficiencies in the ample reserve curve\". The FFR now consistently sits between the IORB and ON RRP, without any further intervention by the Fed. And the Fed will certainly not reduce it's balance sheet anytime soon by enough to change that. \n\n4. A bank that is too conservative in it's lending will just produce lower returns for it's investors. This doesn't generally cause banks to fail, and so isn't much of a concern for regulators. Such banks will simply attract less capital, and capital requirements will then limit their growth in favor of better performing banks.\n\n5. Well if the unemployment rate increases by a point, I assume the 1.5M people who lose jobs will care. But I guess you are asking whether it will really matter to the stock market? It doesn't always. The stock market isn't the economy. For some businesses, a weaker labor market might even mean higher profits. And here, when you say \"excess capital\", this time I think you maybe mean the strong balance sheets throughout the economy generally; there are still relatively high levels of cash and liquid deposits being held by both [corporations](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=16McV) and [households](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=16McX) right now. \n\nI'll add another point: ongoing government fiscal stimulus may be another factor to consider. If the Federal government is running a $1.5T deficit this year, then the private sector must be running a $1.5T surplus. Ever increasing government debt levels in effect also cause artificially inflated private sector balance sheets. This could plausibly have some influence on continued demand for riskier assets like stocks.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. We're saying the same thing here. My point about QT was that it was responsible for the rise in rates, the only demand aspect I'm adding is that demand increases after rates rise, which it did.\n2. We have a terminology mismatch. You're talking \"Bank Capital\" and I'm considering \"Capitalization requirement.\" What you're talking about is excess valuation that can be leveraged against risk holdings. What I'm talking about is the excess capital the FDIC and bank risk sheet require to offset riskier positions as liquid along with any excess non-ideally positioned assets that can be made liquid in the event of lower risk (like short term treasuries). Source: I was a bank risk manager who worked with the FDIC in the post-2008 collapse timeframe. Banks keep cash on hand to cover risk assets, like mortgages, and the coverage for the two items is risk-adjusted. No bank is going to back mortgages with other mortgages on their own. I'm not guessing here. Yes, reserves can include \"safe assets\" like treasuries, but the point is that there's a big portion of this which is more liquid than usual.\n3. The problem is that you're assuming that banks distribute money efficiently, they don't. They hold back. They shift classes of holdings depending on the risk profile. We're talking past each other as a result, unfortunately. There's excess capital in the system, and that capital will seek a riskier home in better times. \n4. Yes, but that's exactly how banks operate during high risk periods, like 2020 to now. After those periods, lending loosens up and riskier positions go into play. \n5. Yes, I'm referring to the market. Obviously the individuals who get laid off will care and I care about them, but it really is about the amount of cash in the system and the interplay with regard to what we're talking about. The point is that we can sustain some movement here without a systemic breakdown of the capital cycle.\n\nRegarding the deficit, there's an interesting point there, but keep in mind that the support for that deficit is the bond market and it will grow as needed as money is fed into the banking system. The debt ceiling deal froze that number, but it will remain elevated and they can easily raise capital to cover it. In an inflation-adjusted manner, it may come down relative to buying power, but if inflation comes down that's a minor force. \n\nI think that's another case of people amplifying the impact of an event. Government spending will remain a tailwind even if its expansion is slowed.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. Yes, QT contributed to the rise in longer term rates, so actually causes slightly *less* inversion. And they wouldn't have done QE/QT in the first place if these rate changes didn't have economic impact. But I do think short term rate hikes are having much more an impact right now. \n\n2. So you really mean liquidity and liquidity requirements, here. Bank \"capitalization requirements\" are also really about excess valuation; they require a certain amount of capital in the form of common stock contributions, retained earnings, etc., but the level of capitalization required does depend on the risk levels of assets held, so liquidity can impact those requirements. And there can be separate liquidity requirements, as well. But the word \"capital\" gets used in so many ways generally that it can be hard to know what people mean by it. \n\n3. This makes a little more sense to me understanding that by \"excess capital\" you mean excess liquidity.  But most of that excess liquidity for banks right now is sitting in reserves earning 5.15%. I think much of it isn't going to find a better home easily until the Fed does finally start to lower rates again. But I certainly do expect that, while lending growth has slowed, banks will start to increase lending again at some point. But maybe we are still talking past each other. You did agree above that \"the rate is dominant\", and I do agree that the Fed's balance sheet still matters. I'm not sure what you mean by assuming banks distribute money efficiently, though. I assume some are good at it and others bad. I just don't see how this matters for a macro analysis unless there is something that will cause them on the whole to be more or less good or bad at it than usual in the given risk environment. Are you suggesting something much different from a usual credit cycle here?\n\n4. Lending will loosen up again, but for now I think it's tightening. I expect that won't be for too long though, and this cycle will be relatively mild. \n\n5. I agree there isn't likely to be any systemic breakdown or crash. Even if there's a recession, Fed induced recessions historically tend to be mild. And here, I think the Fed isn't far off even from a \"soft landing\" scenario. I think stocks will probably even outperform bonds still over the next 3 years, but relative to risks, returns of 5% short term and ~4% long term still make cash and bonds look pretty good at the moment.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Yes, QT contributed to the rise in longer term rates, so actually causes slightly less inversion.\n\nOnly for the release of the bonds, not as the auction cycle continues. Will get to that a little later, but I think the end result is that QT still ultimately shaped the inversion more than natural buying patterns, but I also think that has more to do with the rate pattern and less to do with bond release, but you can track the inversion pretty closely to the start of Fed tightening. As with anything in the auction cycle, there are conflicting forces.\n\nI will elaborate a little more when I talk about how banks might be inefficient deploying big capital injections.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>So you really mean liquidity and liquidity requirements, here.\n\nNot the terms we used at the bank I worked at, but you're right that people throw around the term capital and that there can be a mismatch of understanding. The bottom line is that I think you're seeing my point more now which is that it's about the amount of capital not addressable to the larger economy and instead offsetting risk on the bank sheet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But most of that excess liquidity for banks right now is sitting in reserves earning 5.15%. I think much of it isn't going to find a better home easily until the Fed does finally start to lower rates again.\n\nI agree.

I just don't see how this matters for a macro analysis unless there is something that will cause them on the whole to be more or less good or bad at it than usual in the given risk environment. Are you suggesting something much different from a usual credit cycle here?\n\nYes, I think it will be an unusual credit cycle.\n\nStep back and think about it like you're a bank and it's the start/middle of a pandemic:\n\n* The Fed comes in, slashes rates, and offers up a ton of capital in exchange for buying treasuries and mortgages.\n* Unemployment shoots up to 16-20%. Mortgages aren't being paid at high levels, and the degree of coverage for foreclosure deferral from the government is an unknown.\n* The duration and impact of the pandemic are unknowns, and the supply chain is being impacted.\n* You know the Fed is coming back for the capital once it's all over.\n\nDo you:\n\nA. Deploy capital across a normal distribution.B. Deploy it in the riskiest possible way.C. Use the safest means of deployment possible to reduce exposure to toxic assets, in keeping with FDIC and Fed expectations.\n\nThe answer, for most banks, is going to be C.\n\nConsumer lending in this case is the most risky, and that conforms with consumer debt generation patterns which did not gap up significantly during the pandemic.\n\nHousing, particularly highly underwritten housing which has been more and more a core of the housing market since 2008 changed underwriting expectations and vastly concentrated capital, is relatively safe. This helps explain some of the increased lending in this space, and since the Fed bought up MBS assets, and these new loans are low rate, the risk from them is relatively low. The pandemic was an ideal time to deploy capital to the housing market as a result, even if it gives less overall return.\n\nSimilarly, providing funds to institutions at low rates is relatively safe due to haircut rules.\n\nRepo wasn't paying at the time, and bond rates were low.\n\nSo do you keep cash, or put it in treasuries?\n\nWell, the banks that put more into low rate treasuries ended up in a bad place (see: SVB) and most banks don't do that. They maintain ladders and layer in purchases to handle valuation risk with offsets through buying as rates go up.\n\nThis is the next stage of the auction pattern.\n\n1. The Fed buys long duration and short duration bonds from banks to provide liquidity during the pandemic. Banks mostly hedge with long duration, so it makes sense that this highly weighted long duration bonds.\n2. QT starts, the Fed raises rates and releases bonds - again more on the long duration, this has a greater impact on rate increases against the longer bond durations.\n3. This starts reducing value on bonds layered in during the pandemic to deploy capital, but banks aren't stupid, this was well telegraphed and the Fed told them they were coming for the capital. So banks kept relatively high cash reserves. Through 2022 and 2023, they've used these reserves to layer in higher duration hedges to cover lower rate long duration bonds, while strategically using short duration to play the spread as rates competed against the repo rate. This has the result of driving short duration bonds up, while driving purchasing of long duration up to cover the portfolio, resulting in reduction of the relative long yield spread. This created a deepening inversion because of bank cover patterns. This is how you go from \"long duration bonds increase long duration rates more\" to \"the activity patterns reduced long duration tails, while still driving up the total line on bond yields across the board.\"\n4. The Fed increases the repo rate, which as you said drives up use of the repo. You can see this in the repo usage chart as the Fed starts to lean into QT messaging.\n\nThis all requires the withholding of significant quantities of cash to make work, which is why you saw in this last stress test the narrative was all about \"returning excess capital.\"\n\nThis was a key stress test for that, because we're entering the period where the FDIC and Fed can safely say they're starting to see the effect of the first rate increases. As these tests go on, more and more excess cash is going to be freed up and released. Not all at once... a little at a time, but more than usual.\n\nYou said in this circumstance you'd expect banks to increase return of capital to investors, and that's exactly what they did, but they're also going to take some of it and invest with it in riskier plays as risk in the economy reduces.\n\nBasically, this is going to provide an uplift to credit provision WHILE credit standards tighten, resulting in an uneven curve of capital deployment to the people at the beginning, but also increasing capital availability to better financed/better rated credit... that will confound macro expectations on the impact to corporate balance sheets and access to capital, as well as spending expectations.\n\nAnd eventually, it'll increase across the entire curve as that realizes.\n\nSo I do see a continuation of tightening, I just don't think it means exactly what people think it means in normal situations where the Fed didn't pre-charge the capital line.\n\nWhile I fully agree that good yields on treasuries, cash, and repos will provide competition to risk lending, in this situation risk lending can increase exactly when people think it won't.\n\nOf course, there's always a possibility we miss something and major liquidity event happens, but these bank asset compositions showing in the stress tests suggest that you need a black swan to get there, not a normal tightening regime... and that supports a \"soft landing\" style thesis as a baseline, or a mild recession that isn't lasting because it's engineered and the Fed will step in to stop it from getting worse.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Fed funds rates are correlated with bond yields and shorter duration with a higher degree.

To them, someone who has worked there for 20 years and not improved anything is more worthy of praise than someone who comes in and achieves more than the 20-year person in 6 months.

{"title": "Bear Porn", "selftext": "I read the following on Fundrise. I thought bears may be interested in reading it.\n\n*“There is an enormous pressure in the investment business to deliver good news. Trust me. Good news sells better, stockbrokers thrive on it. Investment houses thrive on it. To go out there in a bubble and talk about badly overpriced markets and downside risks is an invitation to get fired. They simply don't want to hear it…”*\n\n\\- Jeremy Grantham on Charlie Rose, March 11, 2013. Grantham is a renowned value investor who famously lost half of his investor base after refusing to buy into the tech bubble of the late ‘90s but was ultimately proven correct when NASDAQ fell by nearly 80%.\n\nToday, once again, there are two prevailing theories for what is happening in the economy. The first, and more common, goes something like this:\n\n*While rising interest rates have slowed things a bit, the economy is generally healthy and more resilient than many expected, and ultimately inflation is coming down, so eventually the Fed will begin lowering rates, and we will see either a soft landing or potentially a mild slowdown… but actually things are overall pretty good.*\n\nThe second theory — *our* stated opinion — goes more like this:\n\n*The effects of rising rates have yet to really start impacting things. It’s not that the economy is strong so much as it just takes a long time for these things to play out. The current period of seemingly little impact has created a false sense of confidence, and, like a dam that is structurally flawed, the pressure is building slowly, but most will not realize anything is wrong until that final tipping point when the pressure ultimately becomes too great, and the dam breaks.*\n\nAs usual, our belief here stems not from any ability to see into the future, but simply from fundamental analysis of how similar patterns have repeated and played out in the past.\n\nTo highlight this fact, we’ve put together a series of graphs to demonstrate visually the interplay between rising rates and economic downturns over the past 70+ years.\n\nTo begin, let's look back at the last major recession, the 2008 Great Financial Crisis. Even for those who experienced the run up of the early 2000s that ultimately ended with the collapse of the financial system, the events of that time period appear compressed. The truth of course is that they were not.\n\nThen, as now, there was **a long lag between the cause and effect**. And that delay misled markets. As far back as 2004, the Fed began raising interest rates from a low of 1% to the peak of 5.25%, which occurred in the summer of 2006. From that point of peak interest rates, it took roughly another 18 months before the official start of the recession in January 2008.\n\nOf course, few, if any, knew that we were actually in a recession, even at that point. In fact, the stock market was still near its historic highs, and it took roughly another 12 months before the stock market reached its bottom in February 2009 — down more than 50% — *a full 2.5 years after* interest rates had peaked.\n\n[Fed Funds rate and recession dates sourced from Federal Reserve Economic Data \\(FRED\\). S&P 500 real \\(inflation adjusted\\) historical values sourced from MacroTrends.](https://preview.redd.it/qpmapyh16d9b1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c6c2ebf16938bfbb573c55767f5ecb62c4a1972)\n\nOf course, one data point does not a trend make, so let’s look at the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, the last time we experienced runaway inflation and arguably the period closest in kind to our current circumstances.\n\nThen, in an effort to combat resurfacing inflation, Fed Chairman Paul Volcker famously raised rates from 10% in mid-1980 to a peak of 19% by early 1981. However, it took roughly another 9 months before the recession began in summer 1981, and another full year after that point before the stock market reached its bottom in the summer of 1982, having once again fallen more than 30%.\n\n[Fed Funds rate and recession dates sourced from Federal Reserve Economic Data \\(FRED\\). S&P 500 real \\(inflation adjusted\\) historical values sourced from MacroTrends.](https://preview.redd.it/gg08w7046d9b1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b2986d810e1c9760733fed688d95f111a07d8f6)\n\nIn fact, in going through the data, we see that this phenomenon of a long lag between interest rate hikes and the start of a recession has occurred in ***every recession*** going all the way back to 1954, the start of [Federal Reserve data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS). And importantly there’s been a similar lag in each period between reaching the peak interest rate, the start of the recession, and the bottom of the stock market.\n\nIn other words, despite the oft-repeated refrain from many pundits, the stock market is in fact a lagging — *NOT* a leading — indicator of recessions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbuteif76d9b1.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=2821bc9e667f1590a5e5ad2a02d3b470918ff35a\n\nSo what does this mean for investors today?\n\nFed Chairman Powell has recently made clear to the market that he intends to continue with at least one, if not several, additional rate hikes this year (the most recent Q1 GDP data likely only furthers his resolve on this point).\n\nIf we take the Fed's own forecast, rates will peak in December of this year. Assuming the average lag times from previous recessions, this would mean the recession would not actually begin until October of 2024, while the stock market would not reach its bottom until the Fall of 2025, with a roughly 30-40% decline from where it stands today. Although it could happen sooner, the point is that the lag is much longer than most people recognize.\n\nBetween now and then, history suggests we may experience what we might call a **FOMO trap** as the stock market delivers a series of rallies and subsequent dips (much as we’ve seen recently) as it stair steps its way down to an eventual floor, like it has in every recession going back to the 1950s.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/keiw6oea6d9b1.png?width=1524&format=png&auto=webp&s=12b40659fd89386feb1000b04b100ae47bc5701d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite what some may now believe after the past 15 years, markets don’t always go up. And as sure as night follows day, economic downturns have followed every major period of monetary tightening since WWII. And we cannot today see how this time is poised to be any different.\n\nIn fact, the aforementioned Jeremy Grantham also noted that “Of the 33 \\[bubbles\\] that have ended, every one broke all the way back — not halfway back — to the trend before the bubble started.”\n\nBut analysis, of course, is not actually the difficult part. While the data exists for all of us to see, it’s human nature that makes following through on this insight so challenging; the ability to maintain the long view in the face of all the headlines and social media touting a rising stock market. In truth it is FOMO, or the lack thereof, that separates the great investors from the herd over the long run.", "id": "14nwjza", "created_utc": 1688221886.0, "score": 264, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|4 years ago\n**Total Comments**|16691|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/Zachincool, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: There is a long lag between interest rate hikes and the start of a recession.
