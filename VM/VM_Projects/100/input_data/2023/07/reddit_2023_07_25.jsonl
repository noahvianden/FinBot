I'm not a veteran in the stock market. But with nearly 7 years investing I have made lots of mistakes and learned from them. So I'd gladly help you out.\n\nTo answer your question it really depends on what you feel comfortable with. Now the overall answer is to buy good companies at a reasonable price and hold them as long as you feel comfortable with valuation wise.\n\nFor example I bought Microsoft in January this year. It was trading at 30 times the free cash flow. (The free cash flow is the first thing I look at within a company). The overall rule is that you want to make 10% of your investment annually. So you would like to see a company at 10 times the price to free cash flow. Now finding a great company, that is growing, that is priced at 10 times free cash flow is hard. You will not find many. So it's good to understand what is the median price to free cash flow of the company you are interested in.  I like to use the site gurufocus. If you type in google price to free cash flow Microsoft gurufocus. You will have an overview of the price to free cash flow of Microsoft and how it compares to the industry. You will see that the current price to free cash flow is 42. The median is 20. And the price to free cash flow of Microsoft is ranked worse than 70% of all Software companies. Now this may seem bad. But how many software companies have the resources, the diversification of income and the name Microsoft has. So always keep that in mind. Secondly we see the Median price at 20.  It is now 42. It seems the price should go down by half. But if we scroll down a bit within the site until we see the first 'Microsoft annual data' we see that the price to free cash flow was 27 in 2019, 35 in 2020, 37 in 2021, and 30 in 2022 (during the stock market drop). What does this tell us? It tells us Microsoft will most likely not see a 20 times price to free cash flow unless something really bad happens within the company. It's more likely to hang around 35. But this is IF, Microsoft keeps going and innovating as it does.\n\nNow what am I trying to say with this story here? Some investors will tell you Microsoft is a buy and hold type of stock. And I would agree with them. I'm comfortable holding Microsoft. Even at a bit elevated prices. BUT. I still sold Microsoft in June. As it was hitting the 40 times price to free cash flow. You have to ask yourself. How much growth do we see in Microsoft from here. Because if there is not much room for the multiple to grow. All the stock growth will come from increased amount of free cash flow Microsoft is able to generate.\n\nIf we take DHL for example. They have a median price to free cash flow of 20. They are currently trading at a price to free cash flow of 8. Now we have to ask ourselves why is this. So the second thing I look at within a company, is how much net debt are they holding.  So I look at their total debt and their total cash on hand. If  the company can pay off their debt within a reasonable amount of years based on the amount of cash flow they generate annually I'm happy. Then I look at if they are buying back their own stock (this is not a must, just a huge plus in my eyes). A company that buys back their own stock is great because the stock price goes up. But it's also great because these stocks will not be publicly traded anymore. They're just held by the company and that will most likely stay like that if you are investing in strong companies. Meaning stocks are more scarce and also meaning they generate more cash flow per share as the amount of shares have decreased. So back to the example of DHL. DHL is currently trading at 8 times price to free cash flow while the median is 20. Now this seems like the deal of your life. But it doesn't always have to be the case. Usually there is a reason for it. And the reasons are Germany being in a recession and lowered revenue guidance by DHL. Now let's say DHL doesn't grow 10% like previous years but they grow 5%. You can expect a stock growth percentage of 5%. But lets say the fears of  lower revenue for DHL start to dwindle. And the price to free cash flow goes back to 12 from 8 for DHL. This is an increase of 50%. Your stock is now up an extra 50%. I like to keep a safety margin within the price to free cash flow of companies I understand. So for Microsoft I bought at 30 price to free cash flow. And I found 40 price to free cash flow too expensive. So I sold. I like DHL as a company and see them gaining in stock price. But I won't hold indefinitely. They have about a price to free cash flow of 12 in the past four years. So I will look to sell if DHL hits a price to free cash flow of 10.\n\nOther investors believe in the buy and hold forever theory. Which I'm sure works fine too. Because taking Microsoft again as an example it could very well be the case Microsoft trades at 40 times price to free cash flow from now on and just keeps growing in stock price by 15% each year due to growth in revenue. If you wait for Apple and Microsoft to become cheap you will most likely only be able to invest once every 10 years (during big recession or scary events). Because there is a big chance these companies just keep growing.\n\nSo all in all. It really depends on what type of companies you are holding, and what you feel comfortable with. I would not hold a midcap company forever with only one income stream when it's trading many times its median free cash flow. But do know that trading a lot and very often also makes it very easy to make mistakes. Try not to overtrade. Look for good companies priced reasonably. And think of why you are holding this company. Is it because you love their services? Is it because they have a good growth story? Or is it just an undervalued cash machine? I like to set a price range when I would sell my holdings.  But that's a personal thing. Also when selling positions. Stop to think. Why am I selling, what has changed from the moment that I bought the buy button and now?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is the most in depth answer to a question I've ever had in the entire time I've used Reddit.

Not saying anyone can predict what a stock is going to do or not, but they will better protect you and your investments. Once you graduate, you’ll get an offer in which you should have some sort of 401k option. From there, I would continue to put money into the Schwab account while your 401k gets automatically deducted from your check. Now you have a “long term” investment account that protects you in case of a crash or something of that nature, while also having an account where you can take on more risk. The first thing they should do is diversify your current portfolio and hedge some of the risk. On top of that, when you have someone else like Schwab managing it, they can also invest it using different benchmarks. Your standard is obviously the S&P 500, but there’s so many more that the standard investor may not know about. The Nasdaq100 for example is up around 30% or something extremely well. There’s a lot of strategies you do not know about that “experts” do know and could save you headaches in the future assuming something does happen. \n\nAs far as strategy once you graduate here’s what i would do:\n\nAssuming you take home $4000/mo\n\n- 401k is deducted (match this w the employer match) \n- you’re 22/23 so you shouldn’t have to pay for benefits like health, dental, etc yet = more money in your pocket \n- $500-$1000 to that Schwab/company managed account a month \n- live off the remaining amount. \n\n\nIf you do happen to pull capital out of this account, i would only do so for a down payment for a house or for an emergency. I say this bc a house is another asset where you can make equity so you’re not “losing” money. Now after a few years, you turned (let’s say 20k down payment for a house) into 100k worth of equity. You can then utilize a heloc or sell and now have 100k to invest. \n\nThe faster you get that baseline number of your portfolio up, the better off you will be.

That may not compare with the $55.47 billion expected by Refinitiv.\n\nBased on analysts’ projections, Microsoft will close fiscal 2023 with revenue growth below 10% for the first time since 2017. Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won’t lift salaries this year.\n\nAnalysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn’t report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google’s cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.\n\nDuring the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup’s ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers’ data, and it told developers they’ll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine’s chatbot, and other tools.\n\nInvestors are eager for resolution in Microsoft’s arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022.

{"title": "FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon", "selftext": "The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.\n\nThe FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration’s rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon’s business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.\n\nKhan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors.\nThe exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon’s business practices, said some of the people.\n\nThe complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon’s logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.\n\nThe agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.\n\nIn its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.\n\nRead more: \n\nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/25/ftc-lawsuit-break-up-amazon-00108130", "id": "159o8pp", "created_utc": 1690326273.0, "score": 792, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 270, "comments": [{"body": "No way in hell AMZN gets broken up.", "score": 716, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 541, "replies": [{"body": "The lady running the FTC is throwing all of its credibility out the window with its losses 😂", "score": 199, "replies": [{"body": "Watching and reading the FTCs flailing in the Microsoft case was the best form of entertainment I’ve gotten in years\n\nIt was also the most depressing entertainment because it’s just screaming “We’re doing this for all the wrong reasons, and in all the wrong ways”", "score": 139, "replies": [{"body": "With Microsoft they didn’t understand what they were trying to regulate.", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Seems likely they may be on a similar path with AMZN", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Oh they are", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "All they know is they dont want to allow tech companies to basically do any M&A and I would bet they soon start trying to force disinvestment by them in smaller companies.

The first season is therefore 12 episodes and is finally complete.\n\nThis show is a relatively straightforward adaptation of the first playthrough of NieR Automata up to Ending \\[A\\]. A few changes are thrown in and some events are pulled forward in the story to clarify plot points but otherwise it's very, very much hitting the main story of the game. People who played NieR Replicant will enjoy a couple of small cameos from that game, including an earlier appearance for Emil than in the game, but otherwise it does generally follow the game where the events of Replicant are so distant in the past they are almost forgotten. Some things particular to the Ending \\[B\\] path are pulled in here as well, which is nice since the first 2 playthroughs of the game are almost identical except for H A C K I N G and there's no reason to belabor that point in a TV show.\n\nIf you liked NieR Automata, you'll like this show. A few characters get extra development over the game simply because of the transition from playing a video game to watching a show. Because the entire game is constantly about fighting, they made a pretty conscious decision to not have too much fighting. If you wanted to see a lot of fighting, go play the game and fight. But making the show more talky served to help flesh out the story of the game in sometimes unexpected ways. You can tell Yoko Taro really liked Pascal though, as he appears quite a bit more in the show than he did in the game.\n\nIn terms of shows made by A-1 Pictures, the animation is fine and competent, and the CG is kinda bad. They literally were just given the exact 3D models for stuff made for the game and took those to do the CG work. It meshes badly with the 2D art and animation, to say the least. The sound mix is quite good, and since I played NieR Automata with the JP voice work, the immediate familiarity with the voices was nice for me.\n\nAt the end of episode 12, a preview of the next season is shown. I'm pretty happy to see this show continue so we can see Endings \\[C\\], \\[D\\], and \\[E\\].\n\nFinal Rating: Flowers for NieR F\\[A\\]ns/10", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Tesla should do a deal with Disney to revamp the Tomorrowland speedway in magic kingdom.
