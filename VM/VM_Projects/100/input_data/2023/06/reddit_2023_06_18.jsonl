In fact, the only indicator I've found that has any positive correlation early in the reversal period is On Balance Volume, which typically won't climb up levels while the market is experiencing bear market rallies, at least not multiple levels up. There are some cases of smaller level climbs, such as the mid-period between 2007 and 2008's bear market cycles.\n\nPeople point to that and say that we can't trust reversals, which there's definitely reason to note it, but the rule historically is more on the side of bear market reversals into bullish momentum trends, and those changes to composition and volume don't come until the rally has proven itself and we're starting to see positive price/volume correlation like you get during bullish transitions. \n\nI mean, it's pretty obvious why people would continue holding bonds and other alternative products right now at this stage, even as the market is climbing, right?
