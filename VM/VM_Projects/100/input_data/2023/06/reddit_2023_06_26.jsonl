For the puts, IV crush hurts long contracts but helps short contracts. Your \"sold puts\" are short contracts, so IV crush is helping you. IV crush is particularly bad for meme stocks like AMC.\n\nHere's an exaggerated example that might help explain. Suppose the $5 AMC puts were being sold for $69. Even if AMC went to zero, that $5 gain on the puts isn't large enough to recoup the $69 cost of the put, so the long put holder loses money. The short put holder laughs all the way to the bank, because they essentially have a guaranteed $64 profit, even if AMC goes down the chute.\n\nThe analysis below is for long contracts, but if you just inverse everything this says, it's the same explanation for short contracts.\n\n**FAQ: Why did my options lose value when the stock price moved favorably?**\n\n* [Options extrinsic and intrinsic value, an introduction (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Okay thank you a lot.

{"title": "Super-rich Americans are giving up on the stock market, hold record levels of cash — here's why and what they're plowing their wealth into", "selftext": "Across the country, America’s super-rich have reduced their exposure to the stock market by the most dramatic margin in years, according to recent data from the Capgemini Research Institute.\r  \n\r  \nHigh net worth individuals — defined by Capgemini as those with $1 million or more in investable assets — held over 34% of their portfolios in cash as of January 2023. That’s the highest level since at least 2002. It’s also significantly higher than the 24% cash exposure these investors had last year.\r  \n\r  \nUltra-high net-worth individuals and billionaires seem to be following a similar pattern. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, for instance, added $2 billion to its cash reserve in the most recent quarter, bringing its cash balance to $130 billion.\r  \n\r  \nBy comparison, wealthy investors had just 23% of their net assets in publicly traded stocks. That’s the lowest level of stock exposure in 21 years, according to the report. Rich Americans seem to have given up on the stock market, even as some stocks rebound.\r  \n\r  \nThe retreat of the ultra-wealthy from the stock market could offer some early warning for retail investors.\n\n# Super-rich are in ‘wealth preservation’ mode\n\n“Wealthy investors are still in wealth preservation mode,” said CNBC Wealth editor Robert Frank in a recent interview dissecting Capgemini’s report. More than two-thirds of investors surveyed said preserving their capital was a top priority right now.\r  \n\r  \nRampant inflation and rising interest rates have made stocks less attractive. Meanwhile, cash and cash equivalents can generate better-than-anticipated returns. A two-year U.S. government treasury bond offers a yield of 4.59%. That’s the highest interest rate have been on risk-free investments since 2007.\r  \n\r  \nBy comparison, the S&P 500 currently offers an earnings yield (inverted price-to-earnings ratio) of 4%.\r  \n\r  \nGiven their higher level of volatility and risk, stocks are only an attractive investment if they offer a significantly better return than safer options like U.S. government bonds.\r  \n\r  \nWith returns on very low-risk investments so elevated, wealthy investors are probably seeing better alternatives elsewhere.\n\n# Better alternatives\n\nThe UBS Global Family Office report, which surveys families with over $100 million in investable assets, also tells the story of investors looking at alternative assets and fixed-income securities.\r  \n\r  \nPeople in this group of the ultra-rich are planning to increase their exposure to these types of safer, more predictable fixed-income securities from 12% to 15% this year, the report says.\r  \n\r  \nPrivate equity and private credit were also on these families’ radars.\r  \n\r  \nReturns on private-credit deals could be in the 12-to-15% range, which is significantly attractive, CNBC’s Frank said in his interview.\n\n# Opportunities for retail investors\n\nUnfortunately, with the barrier to entry on private equity or private credit so high, retail investors don’t typically enjoy the same access to alternative investments as the wildly wealthy. The barrier to entry for private equity or private credit is simply too high. However, there are some attractive opportunities on the horizon for average investors.\r  \n\r  \nThe SPDR Portfolio High Yield Bond ETF, for example, offers a yield-to-maturity of 8.81%. This fund invests in corporate bonds that are below investment-grade, and therefore carry more risk. Meanwhile, investment-grade corporate bonds with a AAA credit rate currently offer an average yield of 4.74%.\r  \n\r  \nWith fixed-income yields growing, retail investors might consider parking some cash in these instruments.

{"title": "Netflix is up 137% in the last year. Is this a breakout or a fakeout?", "selftext": "# Shares of the streaming stock are on fire. Will the boom last?\n\n\rThe stock market has been full of surprises this year, including the emergence of artificial intelligence as a key narrative, the resilience of the U.S. economy, and the boom in big tech stocks.\r  \n\r  \nAmong the most unexpected winners, this year is Netflix (NFLX 0.36%), the leading streamer, whose shares dove most of last year as growth slowed and it faced a new wave of competition from legacy media companies.\r  \n\r  \nAfter losing more than two-thirds of its value over a six-month span in 2021 and 2022, Netflix has managed to flip the narrative -- the streaming stock is now up 44% year to date and 137% over the past year. Those gains have come for two primary reasons: the introduction of password-sharing fees and the launch of its ad-supported subscription tier. \r  \n\r  \nBoth of those moves reflect changes the company has made to its longtime strategy. Let's take a look at the implications of each one to see if the stock can sustain its recent gains.  \n\n# Paid sharing\n\nPaid sharing is likely the most controversial move Netflix has made in a long time. The streaming service had long turned a blind eye toward password sharing as the company believed that it was a way of promoting its service. Management also seemed to think that password borrowers would subscribe directly to the service when they were ready.\n\nHowever, Netflix's maturing user base seemed to convince the company to crack down on password sharing. Instead of essentially allowing unlimited sharing, Netflix has sent notices to its members telling them that their account is only for them and the people in their homes. They can pay an additional $7.99 per month to share their account with someone who does not live with them.\r  \n\r  \nNetflix implemented paid sharing in May, and the stock has jumped since the rollout, up nearly 20% since May 23, when it announced the new policy in the U.S. According to media reports, the move drove a spike in new subscriptions, and over the four-day period from May 25 to May 28, its new customer additions were higher than in any period since at least 2019.\r  \n\r  \nAnalysts have roundly cheered the move as well, seeing it as essentially 100% incremental profit as there are basically no costs associated with it. Netflix has yet to report earnings since it rolled out paid sharing, but we should get a sense of the impact when Netflix announces second-quarter results next month.\n\n# The new ad tier\n\nWhile the password-sharing crackdown should give its bottom line a boost, the ad tier rollout is likely to give a longer-term lift to the business as it allows the company to tap into a new revenue stream and supplement payments from subscribers. \n\nReed Hastings, who recently stepped down as co-CEO of Netflix, recognized this opportunity after long resisting advertising, as he noticed that advertiser demand was following TV audiences from linear TV to streaming outlets.\r  \n\r  \nThe vast majority of subscribers are expected to remain in the ad-free tier, but Netflix is using the ad-based tier to attract new subscribers. And it appears to be working. As of May, the company had added nearly 5 million subscribers to the ad-supported tier, just six months after the launch, and more than 25% of new subscribers are choosing the ad tier in markets where it's available.\n\n# Is the comeback for real?\n\nNetflix's stock is still down significantly from its peak in late 2021, which came after the subscription boom early in the pandemic, so the recent resurgence should be viewed in that context.\r  \n\r  \nThe streamer now faces significantly more competition than it did just a few years ago, but many of its legacy competitors are focused on cutting costs in order to drive profits at their streaming businesses, which gives Netflix an advantage as it not only has a large audience to monetize its content spending, but it also has proven its profitability.\n\nAfter the rally, Netflix stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 40 based on this year's estimates, which seems fair given its ability to gain operating leverage as it grows revenue. \n\nWhile I wouldn't expect another doubling of the stock, it should be able to hold its gains this time around. After the rally, Netflix stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 40 based on this year's estimates, which seems fair given its ability to gain operating leverage as it grows revenue.

{"title": "$DIS is looking good for a long call", "selftext": "Let me explain from a technical and fundamental analysis standpoint why I think Disney stock is ready for a long call, preferably at the $100 strike, Jan 2025, but first look at my crayons before I explain...\n\n[My crayons on $DIS chart](https://preview.redd.it/yhkdkp5bod8b1.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef891ee8ca7bab96ed7876aa282f5a3cec480e74)\n\nNow basically disney stock has been getting beaten down hard while the rest of the market parties, now you might think yeah it's gonna go lower, get fucked. But this is disney were talking about, they are simply to big to get fucked. Now you might be saying OO they've been losing money and they are going to keep losing money. And you know you'd be right, but you have to buy stocks when everyone else doesn't want them, I mean no one wanted Meta when Zuck was fucking up with VR shit and losing BILLIONS, or Tesla when Elon was buying Twitter and cutting prices, or even banks like Western Allegiance or Pacwest when bank stocks were getting fucked hard, but if you bought then when it seemed like an obvious throw of money, well you'd of bought at the bottom.\n\nSo now I saw this, doesn't this look similar, doesn't everyone think Disney is fucked, yes obviously, would you seem like a regard for going long on it, yes of course, but fundamentally Disney has been around for about a hundred years and it's not going anywhere, so for a well known company like that I think this price is very fair, now could it go lower, maybe in the mid 80's. But this is absolutely a turning point, it's struggling to even go any lower and from a technical standpoint it's very difficult for disney to fall lower from this level. Why, because at some point investors realize a price is so low they know it's a discount and they are gonna keep buying. and besides my crayons saying that this is a good buying point, I think that disney understands better now what works and doesn't for their films and over time this lesson will translate to billions of dollars in profit.\n\nNow as for the trade, well as you know disney is very oversold and at a strong demand zone that keeps it from falling lower, with the market already having fallen so much I think it's fair to say that if you are a bull and believe the market will go up then it's fair to say that disney will get some of that upside, and even if you are a bear in the market you must acknowledge disney's ability to not go lower in price, indicating that this is a strong bottom, so even if you are bearish or bullish on the market it doesn't fucking matter because disney is for sure going to do one thing, and that is GO UP.\n\nI think the safest and best way to go about this trade would be as said previously to buy some Jan 2025 exp $100 strike call options, because even if you aren't certain disney will go up in the near term or do well as a company, you can at least be certain that some point in 1 and a half years it will have a technical bounce and those calls will print at least a 20% gain\n\nTLDR: Get disney Jan 2025 exp $100 strike call options because it's technicals are very bullish and it's likely to bounce as well as fundamentally the fact that when companies are doing shit they are a great buy with low downside risk, especially when they have clearly bottomed out like disney", "id": "14jk8w1", "created_utc": 1687793015.0, "score": 196, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 228, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|858|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/FATPEPPAPIGGAMER420, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: Buy disney Jan 2025 exp $100 strike call options because it's technicals are very bullish and it's likely to bounce as well as fundamentally the fact that when companies are doing shit they are a great buy with low downside risk, especially when they have clearly bottomed out like disney", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/51j0ntlsrd8b1.png?width=1638&format=png&auto=webp&s=62d3c7bb88d11b3679a68f46347f8bf8b33a8732", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Entry is looking a lot better now than when I got in ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 255, "replies": [{"body": "dont worry about it bro, bullish", "score": 231, "replies": [{"body": "Classic double Stegosaurus pattern…\n\nYour calls gonna go extinct…", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Yea puts more likely till end of year", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)", "score": 34, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm worried", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wen moon!?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "No one has Money to go to Disney", "score": -8, "replies": [{"body": "People would eat packs of ramen before they’d deprive their children of the mouse", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Truth.

Creative drought. Marvel, while not dead, is not the creative powerhouse and money printer it was, that ended with Thanos. It’s still good, but it will take time to achieve that again. Star Wars damaged its brand heavily with the sequel trilogy. And a lot of their current releases have just been live action remakes of their classic works. They have had some new IP’s but it’s nothing compared to their past. Disney+ is good, but when movies are grossing $500m or more…that’s hard to replace (especially post Covid)\n2. The price of the parks and the experience has soured a lot of people. I had a coworker go there in January and complain about long wait times, needing a fast pass for everything, and how expensive it all was. The parks are slowly growing into something only the top 20, 15, 10% can afford. Long run, could this hurt the brand? \n3. Leadership. Iger grew Disney from a powerhouse into a World Power (that owns like, 75% of my childhood). Then it went to Chapek, and now Iger is back. LucasFilm seems to have its own issues too. It’s Disney so I’m sure it will be figured out. But the question is when and how long. \n\nDisney definitely isn’t going anywhere. It’s too massive. So I agree with the play. \n\nThe question is timing. Are they still sliding or will it slide further? \n\nAnd how long for the turn around? What causes it? Say the movie division gets out some classics again. Well, the movie industry has changed so will that be enough to move it? Or say new leadership.
