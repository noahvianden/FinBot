If I could enter 4385c & 4360/-4340c for -300 credit, why shouldn't I?

The 4385c would love this, even at 4380 it would probably be profitable. \n\n2.

No amount of creative stop loss (closing short leg closing long leg etc) would save this because of the \"wide-ish\" bear put spread.

Don't care, I like miners and I want to own them over the next expansion phase. Cool, I got paid to own a stock I wanted to at what I see as a great price.\n\nThat trade lists a margin requirement of $2100, and what I'm wondering is - if that happens to be the only cash in my account, and the RIO position was the only one open (unrealistic, but assume that is the case), will I still be assigned, and then be margin called whatever the new maintenance margin is (50% of the price to enter the position IIRC)?

Hoping that's correct here, if you need to post margin before assignment, that makes short options a little scarier. I understand it's still a loss either way, it's just a little more skitz in my eyes to not be able to close the long stock you've been assigned before throwing more margin in.\n\nEDIT: Of course that's assuming that the \"margin requirement\" listed on the ticket isn't actually the margin you need to buy the stock. I keep reading they'll only loan 50%, but I'm also reading other sources suggesting that IBKR will assign as long as you have that \"margin requirement\" listed on the initial order ticket.\n\nSo in other words, IBKR will lend me the remaining $4150 on top the of the $2100 in margin and assign me a long position, that I could either liquidate at the current price, realising a loss, or hold on margin. No new margin required. This sound right?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You are not likely to be assigned early, though it occurs.  \n\nSince you will pay 62.50 * 100 for 6,250 dollars total, you have insufficient funds to own the shares and will get a margin call to immediately fund the share purchase, or dispose of the shares immediately.  \n\nSelling a put credit spread limits losses of the kind you describe at the cost of lower net premium up front.  \n\nIf you have 7,000 dollars in the account, you can afford to keep the shares.  \n\nClosing the short option for a loss prevents further losses.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">dispose of the shares immediately.\n\nYeah perfect, this is mainly what I was wondering if I could do. If I didn't have the funds to keep the shares, knowing I could liquidate them (for a loss, of course) should I be assigned early is comforting, so I wouldn't be forced into a full long stock position. Will always look to close before that happens, but I'm trading US securities from Australia, so I can't be glued to the screen from 11.30pm-6am here. \n\nSo essentially the maintenance margin covers assignment, but the brokers won't let you into the position unless you fully cover it with cash? Might need to ask my broker this, but out of curiosity does this change on a margin account?

It is a purchase.  Microsoft acquiring Activision would ONLY have a negative impact on consumers.  This has already been determined.  Additionally, Microsoft could not agree that they would not increase the price of gamepass immediately if the deal successfully competed.  Video games have always been dominated by foreign competitors.  To challenge them, Microsoft has bought up studios, developers and IPs left and right, over the years…only to put out less games than they had previously.  From the appearance, Microsoft does not want to have to compete.  They want to buy up the market, hide away/shelve IPs and essentially shrink the market itself while maintaining their same share.

That CORE YoY and MoM hasn’t budged off 5.5% and 0.4% for quite a long time. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kphobxtmcn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=02614bba2e569fc64f609c9018fbb58b9e6572b7\n\nI am going to keep this brief as CPI will move us and FOMC… we will see where the dust settles…\n\nBut today actually is incredibly bullish on the daily… why? Because we actually turned the 429.68 supply from the August 16th top into a demand (support) today… that means now 430 is actually considered supported and “justified.”\n\nTo keep it simple upside target is 437.87 demand and downside target would be new 429.86 demand. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4jadpbncn5b1.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f2b6f724be118010c3b93fc9aed6acd5f15902\n\nWe remain in this black bull channel which gives us an upside target of 438.1 tomorrow (support from April 21 2022) and then in the case of a drop 429.8 is not considered strong support. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 429.13 -> 445.34  \n Demand- 429.86 -> 437.87  \n Support- 430.9 -> 429.8 -> 429.2  \n Resistance- 433.91 -> 435.7 -> 438\n\n**FUTURES**\n\nNote- TOS rolled its contract over the weekend so I will be holding off on charting any levels or sharing that here until that is done… by Friday we should have a more normalized chart on futes to update and share.\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l984ugvncn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b8315b8545c283c7b97333741e2a20bbea0c14c\n\nWell after QQQ put that demand in at 349.06 we now are pushing through that 354.95 supply and resistance area that was incredible resistance all of last week. \n\nWith a break through that and 357.09 the upside target is 361.7 demand…. From there we have a bigger upside target of 369.32 and 371.41. \n\nIn the chance that we retrace tomorrow on QQQ the support would be 357.09 and major support at 354.95… \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 354.95 -> 357.09 -> 369.32  \n Demand- 349.06 -> 361.7\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bk51mrbocn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aa2db80ed460d8a680bd4ab2b4dcfb75a23fbb6\n\nSo what do we have here… well of the last 5 CPIs this is the highest level the VIX has closed the day before CPI is released… Actually this is the highest the VIX has closed up (percent wise) since December CPI.\n\nNow what happened on those days? Well on March 14th SPY opened 1.33% green and on December 13th CPI SPY opened 2.8% green… what does that potentially mean? Well potentially we could get one of our biggest SPY opens in a very long time… I personally still do not think the risk to reward of swinging anything is worth it though…\n\nI think for myself that in order for SPY to see a bigger green day and open tomorrow we need to see CORE YoY below 5.5% (it has been stuck between 5.5 and 5.6% for the last 4 readings) and we realistically need a surprise print in the 3s… if we get both of those I do confidently feel that we could see a 1% green open and potentially push for a 2% green day… that would give us about a 438.14 open and a close near 442.5…\n\nHowever, if CORE remains high and if we some how get a miss on CPI YoY (higher than 4.1%) than I actually especially with CORE missing) would not be surprised to see a flat to red open. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tthd3uocn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=06a931672a110d2959debabecbf1d080c30ad04f\n\nThe only thing I got right about today was a big VIX move up… I never would have imagined that SPY would put almost a 1% green day in while the VIX puts it biggest day in since May 4th… (for instance on May 4th spy closed -0.71%). \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fl0oc59pcn5b1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d87b46ebba2b3d60c7f680d4c4ff0b0b5141bdf\n\nToday was definitely not it for me… I continued to get slammed today and honestly today felt a lot like Thursday of last week for most of the day… \n\nAs a technical trader I have said multiple times that I look for SPY, VOLD and VIX to all be in congruence before I take a trade… today was yet again another time where we found that we were not in congruence… the biggest issue was definitely the VIX… watching the VIX pump with SPY is incredibly mind boggling. \n\nOverall small red day and not a big deal as I feel confident I can recover tomorrow as long as technicals move well again… \n\nIn the end remember not every day will be green… the days that play well to your strategy is where you should capitalize… however, days like today that your strategy struggles remember risk management is the key to success. IF you cant manage losers and red days well the green will never outweigh the red.
