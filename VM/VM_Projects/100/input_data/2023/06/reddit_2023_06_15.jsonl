Customers looking to shell such amounts of money on hardware are more than capable to compile and optimize their own software, at the end of the day it's a business and it operates on money to make money.\n\nYet people are acting as Nvidia is going to make such absurd amount of moneys for that long which is obviously not going to happen.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Your general argument makes sense, but it seems to me that you're assuming the engineering required to do this is trivial and falls under standard optimization work.

This is like saying all you need is a ferrari engine, and have a prius transmission. The efficiency how you deliver the power here absolutely matters that which is the software layer, and AMD as of now literally has none and will most likely take 5 years for development to catch up on its platform assuming NVDA doesn't improve upon its own offerings.

{"title": "Mediterranean restaurant chain Cava stock soars as much as 112% in market debut", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/15/cava-group-ipo-cava-starts-trading-on-the-new-york-stock-exchange.html\n\nShares of Mediterranean restaurant chain Cava soared as much as 112% in its market debut Thursday morning before giving up some of those gains. The stock opened at $42 per share, giving the company a market value of $4.68 billion. After spiking even higher, shares in afternoon trading were hovering above its opening trade price, still more than 90% higher than its initial public offering price. Cava Group priced its IPO at $22 per share on Wednesday, above the expected range of $19 to $20. The company sold 14.4 million shares, raising nearly $318 million and initially valuing the restaurant chain at roughly $2.45 billion. The stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CAVA.”\n\nAlthough it was founded in 2006, Cava opened its first fast-casual location in 2011, modeling its build-your-own Mediterranean meals after the formula made popular by Chipotle Mexican Grill. The chain built a customer base by introducing some eaters to ingredients like harissa and tahini and positioning itself as a healthy and convenient option. The company also sells its dips, spreads and salad dressings in grocery stores. Cava acquired Zoes Kitchen in 2018, taking the rival Mediterranean chain private for $300 million. It’s spent the last five years converting Zoes Kitchen locations into Cava restaurants, contributing to its footprint of 263 locations as of April 16.\n\nLast year, Cava’s net sales climbed to $564.1 million, 12.8% higher than the year earlier. “You’re seeing the inflection point in the business, and all of that robust structure we’ve invested in, the restaurant growth, starting to take hold and drive tailwinds to the business,” CEO Brett Schulman said on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” But its losses also widened from $37.4 million in 2021 to $59 million in 2022.Still, industry experts say that the chain has demonstrated a clear path to profitability, making it more attractive for investors looking for growth stocks. In the first quarter, it reported a net loss of $2.1 million, narrower than its $20 million net loss in the year-ago period.\n\nThe restaurant company plans to use the proceeds from its IPO for new location openings and general corporate purposes. Cava’s debut could inspire other restaurant chains to follow its lead, helping to snap the IPO market’s drought. Brazilian steakhouse Fogo De Chao and Korean barbecue chain Gen Restaurant Group have both filed regulatory paperwork confidentially, while both Panera Bread and Fat Brands’ Twin Peaks have shared an intent to issue an initial public offering in the near future.", "id": "14a8kz1", "created_utc": 1686850917.0, "score": 469, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 235, "comments": [{"body": "After a year and a half, we back in the crazy greedy IPO bull run", "score": 599, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 156, "replies": [{"body": "i’m pretty sure these nutty nutty insane gains are relatively new", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Define relative because the dotcom bubble was over 20 years ago and IPOs were insane", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "i feel like you’re answering your own question. mania happens in bubbles. like recently and in the dot-com bubble. but most of the time IPOs do not just fly up 100% every single time.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe they are still doing that to this day.

Chick-fil-A: How Much Are Their Stores — Vs. Other Quick-Service Restaurants — Worth?\nBenzinga 2023-06-15T17:02:00-04:00\nCava Group (NYSE:CAVA), a D.C.-based fast-casual Mediterranean chain, made its mark on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday.\n\nShares soared from a pre-IPO price of $22 to $44.50 at the time of writing — a gain of 102.27%.\n\nGiven Cava’s float of 111.39 million shares, multiplied by its share price, the company has a $4.95 billion market cap. Considering it has 263 locations at a nearly $5 billion market cap, this puts the valuation of each location at an impressive $18.84 million.\n\nHow does the figure compare to the store values of other quick-service restaurants?\n\nLet’s consider Chick-fil-A, a brand that’s made its mark on the fast-food landscape. Although Chick-fil-A isn’t publicly traded, we can make an educated guess at its valuation by looking at a similar fast food brand, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG).\n\nTo estimate Chick-fil-A’s valuation, we applied Chipotle’s price-to-sales multiple to Chick-fil-A's 2022 revenue figure, which was reported at $6.4 billion.\n\nGiven that the two companies are in the same industry, the assumption is that Chick-fil-A’s stock would trade at a similar price-to-revenue multiple as Chipotle, if it was publicly traded.\n\nWith Chipotle’s most recent price-to-sales multiple at 6.33, we arrive at an estimated valuation of $40.51 billion for Chick-fil-A.\n\nWith 2,928 locations, the $40.51 billion valuation indicates each Chick-fil-A store to be worth approximately $13.83 million.\n\nChipotle, based in Newport Beach, California, operates 3,187 stores and has a market cap of $56.84 billion. Applying the same math, each Chipotle store would be worth about $17.83 million.\n\nOak Brook, Illinois-based Portillo’s Inc (NASDAQ:PTLO), an Italian beef restaurant chain with just 76 locations, has a market cap of $1.56 billion, suggesting each store is worth $20.65 million.\n\nMcDonald’s Corp (NYSE:MCD), the global fast-food giant, with 13,509 stores and a market cap of $213.42 billion, is valued at roughly $15.78 million per store.\n\nLastly, Wingstop Inc (NASDAQ:WING), with 900 stores and a $5.63 billion market cap, each store is valued at about $6.25 million.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Didn’t they do some scratchy shit like move the IPO from 19 to 22 really late just for company evaluation?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I dunno about the evaluation but they make really good food.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "When I begin seeing the word IPO again so soon, I start getting scared.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Crazy.

Some of the best hypercars ever produced include the Ferrari LaFerrari, Bugatti Chiron, Porsche 918 Spyder, Pagani Huayra, the Koenigsegg One, McLaren P1, and the Lotus Evija.\r  \nHowever, cutting-edge EV competitors such as the BMW i7 and Lucid Air have already surpassed Tesla when it comes to luxury EVs. The high-end Model S Plaid also has a six-figure price tag that just doesn't jibe with its surprisingly non-luxe interior, especially compared with the Lucid and BMW's deluxe cabins. We also think the Tesla's gimmicky yoke-style steering wheel compromises the driving experience too. But at least they listened to their customers’ complaints, and a regular wheel is once again available. Still, the 2023 Model S remains the brand's flagship, offering access to its most up-to-date software and Tesla's advanced—albeit rather dubious—AutoPilot hands-free driving mode.\r  \n**Fuel Economy and Real-World MPGe**\r  \nIn our 75-mph highway fuel-economy test, a 2020 Model S posted a 222-mile result, which is still considerably shorter than its 326-mile EPA range rating at the time. The Plaid managed 280 miles of its claimed 390 miles of range.\r  \n**Interior, and Comfort**\r  \nWith Model S prices starting around $100,000, it's reasonable for buyers to expect a certain amount of luxury inside the car. The cabin's interior atmosphere is nice, but it's not nearly as plush as those of our favorites such as Mercedes-Benz E-class and Volvo S90—both of which cost significantly less. Tesla's interior aesthetic doesn't come close to the traditional definition of a \"luxury\" car brand.\r  \n**Warranty and Maintenance Coverage**\r  \nTesla offers a comprehensive warranty package to protect the Model S's powertrain and hybrid components, but lacks the lengthy bumper-to-bumper coverage and complimentary scheduled maintenance packages of the Jaguar I-Pace.\r  \n•\tLimited warranty covers four years or 50,000 miles\r  \n•\tPowertrain warranty covers eight years and unlimited miles\r  \n•\tNo complimentary scheduled maintenance", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Can you post the article since it's paywalled, I assume it's not paywalled for you", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "Here is the German original:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBerlin, Düsseldorf Der Elektroautobauer Tesla hat im Streit um die Tauglichkeit seiner Fahrassistenzsysteme eine erneute Niederlage erlitten. Das Antwerpener Berufungsgericht ordnete am Montag an, Tesla müsse einem belgischen Kunden den Kaufpreis von 158.600 Euro für dessen Model S erstatten. Grund seien „schwerwiegende Mängel bei Fahrkomfort und Sicherheit“, darunter ungewollte Bremsungen.  \nSoweit bekannt, gibt es in Europa bis heute kein höherinstanzliches Urteil gegen Tesla in einem Kundendisput. Die Entscheidung vom 12. Juni hat 14 Seiten und liest sich wie eine Abrechnung mit den Aussagen, die Tesla-Chef Elon Musk seit Jahren über die Qualität seiner Fahrassistenzsysteme trifft, oft unter dem Begriff „Autopilot“.  \n„Dass der Käufer ab dem Zeitpunkt der Lieferung ständig mit einer Häufung kleinerer, mittlerer und schwerwiegender Mängel konfrontiert war, beweist hinreichend, dass sich das Fahrzeug nicht für den normalen Gebrauch eignet, für den es bestimmt war“, stellten die Richter fest. Ihr Urteil zeigt aber nicht nur grobe technische Fehler – sondern auch den Versuch von Tesla, deren Aufklärung zu behindern. Tesla ließ Fragen dazu unbeantwortet.  \nDas Handelsblatt berichtete Ende Mai vom Verdacht auf Tausende ähnliche Fälle. Sie stammen aus den sogenannten Tesla-Files. Informanten hatten der Redaktion ein 100 Gigabyte großes Datenpaket zugespielt, darunter Kundenbeschwerden über dramatische Erlebnisse mit ihrem Autopiloten. Ihre Fahrzeuge hätten ohne Grund von selbst beschleunigt oder stark gebremst. Das zweite Phänomen ist bei Tesla als „Phantombremsung“ bekannt.\n\nKläger in Belgien waren ein IT-Berater und sein Leasingpartner von der ING-Bank. Der Mann bezog Mitte 2018 ein Model S. Tesla lieferte den Wagen im September. Laut Urteil beschwerte sich der Fahrer unmittelbar danach über Mängel und erfolglose Werkstattbesuche. Einige Probleme seien „auch nach sieben Reparaturen durch die Beklagte noch nicht behoben“. Im März 2019 bot Tesla an, den Wagen gegen die Erstattung des Kaufpreises zurückzunehmen.  \nWeil das Unternehmen dann aber nicht zahlte, zog der Fahrer vor Gericht. Die erste Instanz ordnete die Bestellung eines Sachverständigen an. Und obwohl Tesla gesetzlich zur Hilfe bei der Aufklärung verpflichtet war, verhielt sich das Unternehmen von Elon Musk ganz anders.  \nDer Gutachter habe klar dargelegt, welche Daten er einholen wollte und „warum diese zur Erfüllung seines Auftrags notwendig waren“. Tesla habe ihn „zunächst lange darüber im Unklaren“ gelassen, wo die Logdaten des Fahrzeugs gespeichert waren und ob es möglich war, sie auszulesen. Dann habe das Unternehmen sich geweigert, die „angeforderten Informationen und Protokolldaten herauszugeben“.  \n   \nIm Urteil rügen die Richter die „mangelnde Kooperationsbereitschaft“ Teslas und einen „Verstoß gegen die Mitwirkungspflicht bei der Beweisaufnahme“. Wenn Teslas Anwälte behaupteten, bei der Untersuchung „umfassend mitgewirkt“ zu haben, stehe dies im Widerspruch „zum Inhalt des Gutachtens“. Tesla habe die nötigen Daten erst nach „langem Drängen und heftigen Diskussionen“ vorgelegt – und auch dann nur „sehr begrenzte, unvollständige und selbst gefilterte Protokolldaten“.  \n„Tatsächlich schwere Mängel“  \nDie reichten trotzdem aus, die Argumente des klagenden Kunden zu stützen. Laut Urteil stellte der Sachverständige zahlreiche Probleme am Fahrzeug fest – unter anderem eine „stockende Einparkautomatik“, „defekte Sensoren“ und „Probleme mit der Heckklappenverriegelung“.  \nDarüber hinaus habe er das Problem „der Phantombremsung“ bestätigt. Auch wenn das Phänomen bei Testfahrten nicht aufgetreten sei, hatte das Gericht „aufgrund der ihm vorliegenden Unterlagen“ und „fehlenden vollständigen Offenlegung“ Teslas keine Zweifel daran, dass das Fahrzeug in der Vergangenheit unbeabsichtigt gebremst habe.  \nDie Richter in Belgien waren überzeugt, dass der Tesla damit „tatsächlich schwere Mängel“ aufwies. Das Gericht verpflichtete Tesla, die Kosten für die erste und zweite Gerichtsinstanz sowie für den Gutachter zu übernehmen, rund 25.000 Euro. Das Unternehmen kann dagegen Beschwerde beim obersten belgischen Gericht einlegen.  \nHiesige Rechtsanwälte glauben an eine Signalwirkung des belgischen Falls. „Dieses Urteil könnte so auch in Deutschland ergehen“, sagt Thorsten Krause von der Münchener Kanzlei KAP. Festgestellte Mängel und mehrfach erfolgslose Reparaturversuche würden es auch hier Tesla-Kunden erlauben, vom Kauf des Autos zurückzutreten.  \nJe nach Schwere der Mängel seien auch Schadenersatzansprüche denkbar: „Das gilt etwa, wenn das sichere Fahren auf öffentlichen Straßen – etwa durch Phantombremsungen – nicht möglich ist.“  \nDie Tesla-Files zeigen mehr als 1500 Probleme mit Bremsfunktionen auf, darunter 139 Fälle von ungewollten Notbremsungen und 383 gemeldete Phantombremsungen infolge falscher Kollisionswarnungen. Außerdem gab es mehr als 2400 Beschwerden über unbeabsichtigte Selbstbeschleunigungen.  \nTesla hat die Informationen in den Tesla-Files nicht bestritten. Der Konzern beschuldigt einen Ex-Mitarbeiter, Daten gestohlen zu haben, und forderte das Handelsblatt auf, sie zu löschen. Fragen zu den zahlreichen Beschwerden beantwortete Tesla nicht.  \n„Eine erhebliche Gefährdung“  \nNach der Berichterstattung über die Tesla Files haben sich zahlreiche Kunden in der Redaktion gemeldet. Sie sehen sich von Tesla getäuscht, manche wollen klagen. Andere deutsche Kunden hatten damit schon Erfolg, zumindest in der ersten Instanz.  \nSo verurteilte das Landgericht Darmstadt Tesla im Frühjahr 2022, ein Model S gegen Erstattung des Kaufpreises in Höhe von 68.730 Euro zurückzunehmen. Die „streitgegenständliche Software ,Volles Potenzial für autonomes Fahren‘“ sei mangelhaft, heißt es in der Urteilsbegründung. So sei die Funktion „Ampel-/Stoppschilder-Erkennung mit Anhalte- und Anfahrautomatik“ nicht mit dem Bordcomputer kompatibel und könne „unstreitig nicht verwendet werden“.  \nIn einem weiteren Urteil verpflichtet das Landgericht München das US-Unternehmen im Sommer 2022, einer Kundin den Großteil ihres Kaufpreises von 112.000 Euro zurückzuzahlen, den sie für ihr Model X gezahlt hatte. Sie hatte sich genauso wie der Kläger aus Belgien über Phantombremsungen beschwert.  \nDie Kundin argumentierte, dass das Assistenzsystem Hindernisse nicht zuverlässig erkenne und immer wieder unnötig abbremse. Tesla hatte dem entgegengehalten, dass der Autopilot nicht für den Stadtverkehr vorgesehen sei.  \n   \nDiese Argumentation ließen die deutschen Richter nicht gelten. Sie stellten im Urteil fest, dass es einem durchschnittlichen Kunden nicht zuzumuten sei, den Autopiloten oder einzelne Fahrassistenzfunktionen zwischen Autobahn, Außerortsverkehr und Stadtverkehr händisch über das Zentraldisplay an- und auszuschalten. Bliebe der Autopilot hingegen durchgängig aktiviert, stelle das „eine erhebliche Gefährdung insbesondere im innerstädtischen Verkehr für den Fahrer und den nachfolgenden Verkehr dar“.  \nErstritten hat das Urteil der Münchener Anwalt Christoph Lindner. Er sieht seine Argumente durch die Entscheidung des Antwerpener Gerichts bestätigt: Das Urteil zeige, dass es Tesla-Fahrzeuge mit erheblichen Mängeln gebe, die auch die Sicherheit beeinträchtigen könnten, insbesondere Fehler des Autopiloten.  \nZum anderen zeige die Entscheidung, „dass von Tesla alle Winkelzüge genutzt werden, um die Aufdeckung von eigenem Fehlverhalten zu verhindern. Diese Strategie ist uns auch aus unseren Fällen hierzulande bekannt.“ Das Münchener Urteil ist noch nicht rechtskräftig. Tesla hat Berufung eingelegt.  \nDerzeit liegt der Fall beim Oberlandesgericht. Wann genau es dort weitergeht, steht noch nicht fest. Die Klägerin muss derweil ein Auto weiterfahren, das sie am liebsten so schnell wie möglich loswürde. Auch sie hat Berufung eingelegt und will den gesamten Kauf rückabwickeln.  \n   \nDie Autoren: René Bender, Sönke Iwersen, Martin Murphy, Lars-Marten Nagel, Michael Verfürden und Volker Votsmeier", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry, I am a bit busy right now, but here is a translation I did thru DeepL. Haven't had time to double check the accuracy:\n\nBerlin, Düsseldorf Electric carmaker Tesla has suffered another defeat in the dispute over the suitability of its driver assistance systems. The Antwerp Court of Appeal on Monday ordered Tesla to refund a Belgian customer the purchase price of 158,600 euros for his Model S. The court also ruled that Tesla had to pay for the car. The reason was \"serious deficiencies in driving comfort and safety,\" including unintended braking.  \nAs far as is known, there has been no higher court ruling against Tesla in a customer dispute in Europe to date. The June 12 decision is 14 pages long and reads like a reckoning with the statements Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been making for years about the quality of its driver assistance systems, often under the term \"Autopilot.\"  \n\"The fact that the buyer was constantly confronted with an accumulation of minor, medium and serious defects from the time of delivery sufficiently proves that the vehicle is not suitable for the normal use for which it was intended,\" the judges noted. However, their ruling not only shows gross technical defects - but also Tesla's attempt to obstruct their elucidation. Tesla left questions about this unanswered.  \nThe Handelsblatt reported at the end of May about the suspicion of thousands of similar cases. They come from the so-called Tesla files. Informants had leaked a 100-gigabyte data package to the editorial team, including customer complaints about dramatic experiences with their Autopilot. Their vehicles would have accelerated or braked hard on their own for no reason. The second phenomenon is known at Tesla as \"phantom braking.\"  \n\n\nThe plaintiffs in Belgium were an IT consultant and his leasing partner from ING Bank. The man took delivery of a Model S in mid-2018. Tesla delivered the car in September. According to the ruling, the driver complained about defects and unsuccessful workshop visits immediately afterward. Some problems were \"still not resolved even after seven repairs by the defendant.\" In March 2019, Tesla offered to take the car back in exchange for a refund of the purchase price.  \n\n\nBut because the company then failed to pay, the driver took the matter to court. The first instance ordered the appointment of an expert. And although Tesla was legally obligated to help clarify the situation, Elon Musk's company behaved quite differently.  \nThe expert had clearly explained which data he wanted to obtain and \"why this was necessary to fulfill his assignment.\" Tesla had \"initially left him in the dark for a long time\" about where the vehicle's log data was stored and whether it was possible to read it out. Then, the company had refused to \"hand over the requested information and log data.\"  \n   \nIn the ruling, the judges criticized Tesla's \"lack of cooperation\" and a \"breach of the duty to cooperate in the taking of evidence.\" When Tesla's lawyers claimed to have \"cooperated extensively\" in the investigation, this contradicted \"the content of the expert opinion.\" Tesla had provided the necessary data only after \"long urging and heated discussions\" - and even then only \"very limited, incomplete and self-filtered protocol data.\"  \n\"Serious deficiencies indeed\"  \nThese were nevertheless sufficient to support the plaintiff customer's arguments. According to the ruling, the expert found numerous problems with the vehicle - including a \"faltering automatic parking system,\" \"defective sensors\" and \"problems with the tailgate locking system.\"  \nIn addition, he had confirmed the problem of \"phantom braking.\" Even though the phenomenon had not occurred during test drives, the court had no doubt \"based on the documents available to it\" and Tesla's \"lack of full disclosure\" that the vehicle had unintentionally braked in the past.  \nThe judges in Belgium were convinced that the Tesla was thus \"indeed seriously defective.\" The court ordered Tesla to pay the costs for the first and second instance and for the expert, around 25,000 euros. The company can appeal against this to the Belgian supreme court.\n\nLocal lawyers believe the Belgian case will have a signal effect. \"This ruling could also apply in Germany,\" says Thorsten Krause of the Munich-based law firm KAP. Detected defects and multiple unsuccessful repair attempts would also allow Tesla customers here to withdraw from the purchase of the car.  \nDepending on the severity of the defects, claims for damages are also conceivable, he says: \"This applies, for example, if safe driving on public roads - for example, due to phantom braking - is not possible.\"  \nThe Tesla files show more than 1500 problems with braking functions, including 139 cases of unintended emergency braking and 383 reported phantom braking resulting from incorrect collision warnings. There were also more than 2400 complaints of unintended self-acceleration.  \nTesla has not disputed the information in the Tesla Files. The company accused an ex-employee of stealing data and asked Handelsblatt to delete it. Tesla did not answer questions about the numerous complaints.\n\n\"A significant threat\"  \nAfter the reporting on the Tesla Files, numerous customers contacted the editorial office. They see themselves as deceived by Tesla, and some want to sue. Other German customers have already been successful, at least in the first instance.  \nIn spring 2022, for example, the Darmstadt Regional Court ordered Tesla to take back a Model S in exchange for a refund of the purchase price of 68,730 euros. The \"disputed software 'Full potential for autonomous driving'\" was defective, according to the ruling. For example, the \"traffic light/stop sign recognition with automatic stopping and starting\" function is not compatible with the on-board computer and \"indisputably cannot be used\".  \nIn another ruling, the Munich Regional Court obligated the U.S. company in the summer of 2022 to repay a customer the majority of her purchase price of 112,000 euros, which she had paid for her Model X. The plaintiff, like the plaintiff, had opted out of the contract. Like the plaintiff from Belgium, she had complained about phantom braking.  \nThe customer argued that the assistance system did not reliably detect obstacles and repeatedly braked unnecessarily. Tesla had countered that Autopilot was not intended for city traffic.  \n   \nThe German judges did not accept this argument. In their ruling, they stated that an average customer could not be expected to switch Autopilot or individual driver assistance functions on and off manually via the central display between the highway, extra-urban traffic and city traffic. If, on the other hand, the autopilot remained activated throughout, this would \"pose a considerable risk to the driver and the traffic following behind, especially in urban traffic\".\n\nThe verdict was won by the Munich lawyer Christoph Lindner. He sees his arguments confirmed by the decision of the Antwerp court: He says the ruling shows that there are Tesla vehicles with significant defects that could also affect safety, especially errors in Autopilot.  \nOn the other hand, the decision shows \"that Tesla is using every trick in the book to prevent the discovery of its own misconduct. We are also familiar with this strategy from our cases in this country.\" The Munich ruling is not yet final. Tesla has filed an appeal.  \nThe case is currently before the Higher Regional Court. Exactly when it will proceed there has not yet been determined. Meanwhile, the plaintiff must continue to drive a car that she would prefer to get rid of as soon as possible. She has also filed an appeal and wants to reverse the entire purchase.  \n   \nThe authors: René Bender, Sönke Iwersen, Martin Murphy, Lars-Marten Nagel, Michael Verfürden and Volker Votsmeier", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "deepL is soo good, for Slovene google translate doesn't do good job, gpt better but can halucinate, but deepL is on top.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "der Held den wir brauchen", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "\"in comfort\" lmao what", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Citizens must be comfortable at all times, by government decree", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Well if they say the car offers comfort and it doesn’t then it’s false advertising, no?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "i'm pretty sure \"car offers comfort\" is subjective af", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Comfort can mean stuff like driver assistance features i would guess.

As their market share dwindles, they will sell less units but alot of their costs will stay the same (factory costs, development and research, etc). As a result, their proft per car will dip. \n\nI hope you can atleast understand that part, Whether you agree or disagree with tesla potentially losing market share, you have to admit that their profit per car will come down if they do lose market share. \n\nas for the charging network, I am not discussing it in financial terms in any sense of the contracr or anything. What I am trying to say with the charging network deal is that Tesla used to have a huge advantage by having the biggest charging network. the difference between their charging network and that of other brands was enough to convince consumers to buy a tesla over another brand's EV. however, it other brands begin having access to Tesla's charging network, then the charging network advantage that tesla will start to dissappear. Charging network will no longer be a factor that boosts tesla sales. \n\nThe customer who wanted a mustang Mach e but brought a tesla model Y due to the charging network will now buy a mustang Mach E given the change in the charging network. \n\nSure, tesla may make a lot of money from their charging network, but they may lose car sales. If this happens, refeer to my first point of lower market share resulting in less profit per car. \n\nI don't love tesla or hate it. I don't really care about how they do and am not invested in them. however, these are concerns that exist for the company, whether people want to admit it or not. \n\nTesla has a lot of advantages over othe brands that are producing EVS. However, they also have a lot of weaknesses such as their QC issues or their cars not being refreshed enough.  \n\nMy concern is that the other brands are edging closer and closer to the advantages that tesla has, but I don't see tesla working on their weaknesses at the same speed.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Careful, this thread is a musk good, article bad vibe.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Been saying this shit for years.

After examining how we develop losing attitudes, this book prepares you for a thorough “mental housecleaning” of deeply rooted thought processes.

The most productive and efficient lines are those made from scratch (like Tesla). \n\nAdditionally their current ICE sales are only going to go down, as global demand for ICE vehicles go down, so their profit from ICE will drop every year (with *maybe* this year being the last year they make more money than previous year), while at the same time they are burning money to produce EVs. \n\nBy the time Toyota even gets to something like 500k EVs, they will be competing against Tesla's next gen low cost $25/$30k model. And the only way they will be able to sell an EV at that price is to lose money. \n\nAdditionally, as ICE becomes less profitable and less valuable - existing ICE factories/tooling becomes less valuable, so the value of existing assets goes down - while at the same time debt is going up. \n\nJapan will have to bail them out. That's for certain. Toyota will have to cut many models, and only produce the most profitable ones. For EVs, they'll have to differentiate somehow, because they won't be able to compete at the low end $25k range. \n\nI fully expect Toyota to see a minimum of a 70% drop in their stock price over the next 5-8 years, that won't recover. They make 8M cars or so now. This will go below 4M. Don't be surprised when they stop making the Camry altogether.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hasn't Tesla been \"bailed out\" to the tune of billions despite being a debt free startup? I don't think the discussion here is whether or not Toyota gets bailed out, or if that's even something bad at this point. They successfully (at least in Japan) transitioned from ICE to much more complex Hybrid power trains. You vastly overestimate the costs especially with the ever increasing advancements in battery technology and building EVs is fairly trivial. Every major university you can find 17 year olds building them. The question is mass manufacturing, I have a hard time believing Toyota would find this difficult having to source 10X less components. I find it hard to believe they'd accrue more debt as legacy auto costs compared to Tesla are directly tied to outsourcing vs vertical integration efficiencies. The only major costs would be retooling and then it's a matter of expanding their relations with Chinese and Korean suppliers in regard to battery supply. Any losses auto makers are seeing on EVs is directly tied to the battery costs. You can say Tesla will always be cheaper but there's more than enough space in the market.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Hasn't Tesla been \"bailed out\" to the tune of billions despite being a debt free startup?\n\nMaybe do some research first. They got a loan at some point, which was fully paid off long ago, and compared to the size of there company that loan was pretty small. \n\n> You vastly overestimate the costs especially with the ever increasing advancements in battery technology and building EVs is fairly trivial\n\nCertifiably false. Just look at how much every single manufacturer is dumping into new production lines for EV. Making hybrids doesn't help. That battery is tiny, and you likely need entirely new lines of production, new battery tech, new supply chains, new software... And in regards to software, you should really go listen to what Ford CEO has said about legacy software. It's a fucking mess. \n\n> Every major university you can find 17 year olds building them. The question is mass manufacturing, I have a hard time believing Toyota would find this difficult having to source 10X less components\n\nThen why is every single manu struggling? Hm maybe Toyota is just a magical company that can scale 4x faster than everyone else? no. \n\n> I find it hard to believe they'd accrue more debt as legacy auto costs compared to Tesla are directly tied to outsourcing vs vertical integration efficiencies\n\nYou're saying they will accumulate *less* debt, because they are *less* vertically integrated? This might be one of the dumbest things I've read in a while. First off, every single manu is going to attempt to model their business after Tesla and have more vertical integration, because otherwise they cannot compete on costs and speed of development and supply chain control. Second, they have to spend WAAAAY more than Tesla does for their new tech and new factories, and their ICE profit is going to drop during this whole process, while they lose money on whatever EVs they make. Just look at VW, they're in the same boat and have to take on a shitload of debt in this transition. Toyota is no different. \n\n> The only major costs would be retooling\n\nNon-trivial, and also not efficient. And again, quite expensive. \n\n> expanding their relations with Chinese and Korean suppliers in regard to battery supply\n\nBecause batter supply is plentiful? \n\n> Any losses auto makers are seeing on EVs is directly tied to the battery costs\n\nFalse. Ford isn't sitting at negative 100% margins just because of batteries. \n\n> You can say Tesla will always be cheaper but there's more than enough space in the market.\n\nYes for the smaller addressable market at a higher price. **smaller addressable market**.

{"title": "Why every single recession guess is completely wrong", "selftext": "You have probably heard \"oh look the vix is so low the market must be ready to just decline!\" or \"The chart is tracking 2008!\" or \"The chart is tracking the great depression!\". \n\nI assure you all of these ideas are rooted in fantasy and common pattern searching you could line up to a number of years that also don't matter. \n\nEverything hinges on the fed. Historically, fed hiking cycles are bullish and the pause cycles are also bullish. Pause cycles also typically last a long time. They do not just pause for 3 months and start cutting rates. If there is any takeaway from this post, its that you cannot go full bear until the fed simply tells you to do so by cutting interest rates for the first time. \n\n RATE HIKE CHARTS\n\nMay 16 of 2000, the Fed reached a peak rate of 6.5% after having raised interest rates for years leading into the tech bubble.\n\nHere is an example of that price action leading into the final rate hike:\n\n[ Weekly chart Jan 1998 to May 16 2000 DURING HIKES ](https://preview.redd.it/at96wzpsz66b1.png?width=1857&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d0c3c960004423075aa7d5c0fef9ee73618fa8a)\n\nAs you can see during the hike cycle of the tech bubble, there was a 22.54% draw down and this only ended up being a great dip to buy as the market only went up as high as 63.44%. For us that would be like going from 348.11 in Oct 2022 to 568.95 by March of 2024. As you can imagine, anything under 500 is actually a discount historically. \n\nHere is the housing crisis during its rate hike cycle: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Housing bubble hike cycle](https://preview.redd.it/k7rv6gvt076b1.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=52d16faa50640ade4f67d236521c64ea4ee3c440)\n\nOur chart for our hike cycle is actually an outlier as you can see it  has been overwhelmingly bearish and just starting to turn bullish: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2022 Hikes began in March. So far ended in May](https://preview.redd.it/fjeblgi4176b1.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3a6ba4a5aa6cd1ca2e99061584687ddc202350a)\n\nNow the pause\n\nFED PAUSE CHARTS: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Daily chart May 16-Jan 3 2001 during FED PAUSE ](https://preview.redd.it/57movywa176b1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae0b2e6cbfaf1620a102deed76aab564a914f606)\n\nFrom the 1st pause during the tech bubble, the market was able to rally 7% from this number. It ended the year down 8%. As you can see, this period of time did not see any troubles until about July. But those troubles were just brushed aside and the dip was bought. Feel familiar? \n\n Now here, the fed paused from June 29 2006 to to Sept 18 2007 which means for 1Y 2 months 2 weeks and 6 days, the going rate was just 5.25%. They laugh at Powell suggesting it will pause for \"years\" but the expectation has to be at least almost a year or more. Here is the price action during this pause:\n\n[Housing crisis Pause. ](https://preview.redd.it/3kns426u176b1.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e61e52655c20e6d769f7dbc5fcb1e974b805b01)\n\nAs you can see here, the fed pause was just bullish. You had a few \"crashes\" on the way up. But the trend was only up and remained that way. This contradicted the pause cycle from the tech bubble but both only saw rallying during its initial phases. \n\nWhat all of you bears have been looking for is a fed CUT. YOU NEED A CUT, ITS OBVIOUS AF\n\nCUT CYCLES\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tech bubble during rate cuts](https://preview.redd.it/psbaua2c276b1.png?width=1847&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8f0efa099b9eb6156040bf9021d71d50840f177)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Housing crisis during rate cuts](https://preview.redd.it/veknx87e276b1.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=a387f461a22aa528bb5c261811e6f4aad7d14a8a)\n\nBelow are the fed decision cycles and I lined all the charts up with all the dates.

The pause cycle is a coin  flip between a flat market that ends down on the year or a multi year uptrend. But the ONE THING that is in common with all crashes is that the fed starts to CUT and that 1st CUT is the most bearish signal you could possibly hope for as it means something is actually wrong and not just speculatorily wrong. \n\nUse this information how you will.

Why do you think Apple deploys neural networks on device? How do you think they accomplish real time inference with far less compute? The requirements for ML products are application specific.

Model compression techniques and more efficient application specific network architectures are being created all the time. There’s also a big movement toward using pre trained foundational models and fine tuning them for specific tasks so that greatly reduces the model training requirements for new application specific models.\n\nAnd a massive chunk of the AI tools deployed in real business applications don’t even use neural networks or require GPUs at all. Neural nets are particularly useful for computer vision, natural language processing and speech/audio. Classic ML models (ie, boosted trees) can outperform neural nets in a lot of other applications especially structured data (tabular data from databases). The last thing I’ll note is there’s been a huge push on data centric AI recently. There are diminishing returns pumping massive quantities of data through neural networks especially in vision. There’s a focus on quality of data over quantity now. Making sure the data is clean and addresses the long tail of the distribution is key. For example training on tons of every day driving video in self driving cars has diminishing returns because 99% of it is uninteresting and repetitive. It’s the near infinite combinations of rare edge cases (long tail of distribution) that improve the performance of the safety critical system.

AMD dominates GPU market by a lot, because their hardware is in every Xbox and PS5. They're a low margin manufacturer and that's fine. Nvidia, which requires high margins, appealed more to rich PC gamers, but their 40X0 series aren't as appealing any more. Add to that drop of crypto-mining business, which was hiding their dropping market share.\n\n> Trying to get a competitors hardware to work is handicapping you as you are rewriting your tools to optimize for cheaper hardware that may not be as competitive in terms of pure processing power.\n\nNo, it's not - most tools people use are highly abstracted. No one writes CUDA kernels on their own these days and libraries like TensorFlow (developed by Google) have support for variety of architectures.\n\n> AI algorithms out there right now, run better on Nvidia hardware because it is better and because it was optimized specifically for those chipsets.\n\nIt's more expensive, that's for sure. https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-v4-mlperf-2-0-results . This is a comparison between 7nm A100 and Cloud TPUv4. Latest Nvidia card H100 is using 4nm and more power, so their results are even 3x better, but they don't own 4nm technology - it's all in the hands of TSMC, ASML, which will allow Google / MS / Amazon, etc to make their own competitive Cloud TPUv5. I wouldn't be surprised if it's already in the works and v5 is available next year or sth. Are you valuing a hardware company, because they've paid more to TSMC to have slightly faster access to a slightly better technology? Overbidding is not a real moat.\n\n> it should be mentioned that Microsoft is looking to expand their Webservers to basically create a public chat AI for search applications. This will dethrone Google as the search engine, but only if they can get the hardware in time.\n\nGoogle's been developing their own TPUs (Machine Learning = A.I.) since 2014. Their TPUs are on par https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/cloud-tpu-v4-mlperf-2-0-results with Nvidia cards, most of the codebase is compatible too (Google has developed Tensor Flow libraries). Amazon has bought Annapurna Labs in 2015 for the very same reason and they're offering those chips to rent via AWS. Microsoft which is funding OpenAI research is also developing their own chip codenamed Athena. You're wrong to assume that serious Big Tech will be chasing Nvidia hardware for long. They will provide it for rent on demand in Azure/GCP/AWS, but most of their services will run on their own hardware, because it will be cheaper. What's more, Nvidia will have to offer those Cloud Providers huge discounts, so large sales won't translate to the same profits, like in case of gaming PCs or small-scale crypto-mining operations.\n\nHigh Margins can only be found in:\n1. Software Services (Google Ads, Apple Store, ChatGPT, Tesla FSD, Adobe Photoshop, video games); or\n2. Consumer Products (iPhone, Macbook, Tesla cars, PC gaming GPU).\n\nEnterprise Hardware (CPUs, TPUs, hard drives, networking equipment, etc) can't achieve those margins, because that technology is too commodified (many \"manufacturers\" compete for TSMC fabs). Nvidia is just another Cisco without growth perspective until they make:\n\n1. proper A.I. Service like better Search with Ads / GitHub Copilot / Photoshop, Personal Assistant, etc; or\n2.

{"title": "This is actually a new bull market", "selftext": "A lot of people here will still insist that this recent rally is a big bear trap in the making. But I think we will actually get new All Time High's on the S and P by early 2024. The bear's main thesis is that we are heading to a recession and that earnings will collapse as a result, meaning current valuations are too high.   \n\n\nI used to be in the bear camp but the economy has proven to be too resilient in spite of oil price shocks last year, banks going to receivership this year, and interests rates being raised the fastest in history. The reason why a recession won't happen this year and probably won't happen next year is because too many people are already anticipating for it. This is the most anticipated recession ever. This means companies and CEO's to some degree have already prepared for it by cutting costs and going leaner. Recessions generally happen when we don't expect for it, which is not what we have right now.   \n\n\nLook at the current risks we are all talking about. We talk about an impending commercial real estate bust. We talk about credit crunch because of banks having to raise capital requirements and senior loan officer surveys. Mike Wilson likes to talk about earnings recessions. The reality is we have a lot of cash sidelined because of these worries. So yes I hate saying this but these risks are partially priced in because you have cash sidelined for these worries.  \n\n\nI expect a small pullback soon because things seem exuberant at the moment, but buying on the dip makes the most sense. There is too much cash on the sidelines that can push this market to all time high's. Earlier this year a lot of people went to bonds and money market funds because of these recessionary fears. This will later serve as a catalyst to move stocks higher as that cash will chase performance. In addition, hedge funds are too underweight on stocks and this will also be cash to fuel more upswings.  \n\n\nFinal thoughts... the market likes to do things that people don't expect at all. How about going to all time high's in the face of QT and shrinking M2 supply?  \n\n\nTLDR: Yes you missed the bottom again and you better hop on", "id": "14ahk0c", "created_utc": 1686873418.0, "score": 292, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 244, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|91|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The market is heading to new all-time highs by early 2024.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Based on how many bears say tomorrow is gonna be red, it’s probably gonna be ATH for everything tomorrow", "score": 179, "replies": [{"body": "Bears can't afford to charge their phones anymore idk where they keep getting money from.", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "Bears eat beats", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Battlestar Galactica", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "MICHAEL!!", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "You mean this has all happened before and will happen again?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Lol nah.
