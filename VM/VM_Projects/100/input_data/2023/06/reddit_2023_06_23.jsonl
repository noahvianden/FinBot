At the time, I respected that the market could move strongly up or down. I like the company but do not like the level of share dilution. I wasn‚Äôt convinced of shareholder return over the next 2-3 years from that moment, so I put on the CCs to lock in 10.5% in premium vs my cost basis, immediately invested the premium in VTI.

Investors exited with the Nasdaq 100 Index poised for its best half since the last six months of 1999.\n\nThe rally in US stocks stalled this week as investors digested Jerome Powell‚Äôs outlook on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve chair said more interest-rate increases may be needed this year, at a time equities have been climbing on hopes that rate hikes would end soon.\n\nHartnett said that although crowded positioning and strong investor sentiment aren‚Äôt an impediment to the fresh upside, there‚Äôs a bigger chance of a downside than the upside this summer. His team sees a maximum upside of 100-150 points versus a downside of 300 points for the S&P 500 before Labor Day in September.\r  \n\r  \nHartnett correctly predicted the selloff in stocks in 2022 but has been caught on the wrong side this year with his bearish calls.\r  \n\r  \nAlso this week, Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, said the market now resembles the tech boom of 1999 and 2000, which didn‚Äôt end until tighter monetary policy had roiled stocks.

{"title": "Why I sold my Disney stocks", "selftext": "Wrote this as a comment in response to another disney post, but I thought it'd be good as it's own post.\n\nI sold my disney stock because I feel the brand has not only grown fat and lazy, no longer trying anything new or bold, but in doing so they're going to lose their audiences. \n\nLet me explain\n\nMarvel put a lot of overpriced projects into production, thinking they'd maintain their current box office status, but audiences have wised up, and we're seeing ip alone can't sell a movie anymore, and WOM matters again, see guardians and antman 3. I feel as if they got a lot of freebies, but unless there's good word of mouth for their projects, they won't perform amazingly at the box office, and their budgets are insane so they sort of have to if they want to be profitable. Marvel has a lot of shows already planned out, and many movies still in production at varying stages, with the writers strike I really feel like they can't fix the poorly written ones before release with reshoots.\n\nStar wars Is an insane ip, but what are they doing with it? Only mandalorian has been massively successful, and the new trilogy soured public perception, and all the movies they've announced have been getting canceled or delayed indefinitely. Imo star wars could have a movie every 2 years but it's embarrassing they've repeatedly canceled stuff they're already announced, from TV, to movies.\n\nAlso willow was apparently so bad it was removed from d+ and Indiana jones 5 was rotten? Lucasfilms needs new management at least.\n\nThe live action remakes seemed to just be easy money printing, but the little mermaid showed that not only is it not the same anymore, not even a disney princess as iconic as Ariel is a draw. \n\nElementals isn't doing well apparently and carries a hefty budget.\n\nAs far as animation, they've cheapened their brands with streaming, the budgets are too high, quality mixed, and DreamWorks, illumination, sony, and even Netflix are running circles around them with animation, with cheaper budgets. Puss in boots having fantastic legs and doing better than lightyear is hilarious. Not to mention Mario's success clearly shows there still is a market for animation in theaters, just not Disney's.\n\nFinally, parks, imo, having grown up in Florida, Disney parks have declined in quality. Fast pass costs money, lines are absolutely horrendous, and every extra experience costs money. I feel like whenever I go I have to rigorously plan my day, and still it's mostly spent in line. Also I feel like there's very little new rides or attractions. Also the prices for rides are crazy. I've been to Disney sea in Japan, the only park not owned by Disney and it was phenomenal, Shanghai left a lot to be desired and Disney owns it. Also ticket prices are increasingly constantly with Less value imo.\n\nCompare that to universal orlando that's been trying to have a new attraction every year, put out some bangers in the recent years with bourne, velocicoaster, and Hagrids, the tickets are cheaper, but most importantly the lines are manageable and I can just pop in on non peak days and do everything I'd like with no planning or preparation, which would be an impossibility with Disney. \nHarry Potter showed that universal can be competition, and with the new park I think they finally might be a true challenger for orlando.\n\nNot to mention Mario as we've seen is wildly popular, but if universal ever has Pok√©mon in their parks? Game over Disney.\n\nAlso DeSantis is literally threatening Disney constantly, doesn't seem safe.\n\nUnless Disney seriously overhauls some things, I don't see them getting better, I just see everyone else filling the vacuum and Disney becoming less of a powerhouse.\n\n\nAlso I've got no actual professional experience, im just a florida local, and like following entertainment, you probably shouldn't give too much thought to any of this, because I could be wrong about stuff or just misunderstanding. I don't think I am, but hey, fair warning.\n\nEdit: I wanna say I sold before the recent low, just made this in response to another post about Disney. And Yeah, with my luck it'll probably go up a lot after I sold, so you're welcome for that. I was just sharing my thoughts about the position of the company.

I am a little biased because I'm a Florida resident with a season pass. I have the exact opposite experience. We only go on weekdays and we rarely ever have to wait in a line more than 15 minutes except for some of the really big name rides which we'll just skip that day and do it the next time we go. But we've also had the experience where we ride Toy Story Mania 5 times in a row with 0 wait. I would never go on a weekend or holiday, so yeah tourists who have to go on those dates and weeks have that experience, but we've had great success all other times of year. I also agree that the parks don't have a ton of new things, I do think COVID was partially to blame delaying progress. Guardians of the Galaxy recently opened, Tron, the new Moana area should open. They at least have new whole portions of parks in the planning phase as well. Those are probably several years off, but once they do open it unleash a whole new wave of people who think it's worth going again.\n\n\nThe movie landscape is just very different than before COVID. Mario knocked it out of the park but that's a huge draw for both adults with nostalgia and kids. Marvel has the benefit of a big name, but with that comes big actor contract prices. They're a victim of their own success at this point trying to shift to a different phase that hasn't been well received so far. Star Wars has been wildly successful. Purchased for 4B and the movies made well more than that. A huge draw in the park (don't forget that aspect), merchandise is huge, and the various series are supporting Disney+. Andor was very well received, not just the Mandalorian.\n\n\nThe other thing to remember is for every DeSantis, there's also three other families that have a family member or a kid that might be transgender or gay, a minority, or some demographic group that doesn't fit the Florida conservative narrative. Ariel partially wasn't as well received because she wasn't a white girl with red hair. Strange World was actually pretty good. Light year had so much controversy because of a gay couple. Encanto is wildly successful. Disney understands the younger demographic better than the Florida legislature.

There are a few big contributors to the problem such as the aviation industry, construction industry, and most importantly the agricultural industry.\n\nSince we have a housing crisis the government wants to impose the least sanctions on the housing industry, and I think this is also fair to the majority of dutch citizens who are tired of expensive property prices and high rent.\n\nFarmers benefited and still benefit massively from exorbitant EU subsidies, and this large industry has mostly established itself because of the even-more exorbitant market distorting price-guarentees that were finally abolished in 1992 under the MacSharry reforms and that have gradually been reduced. Yet farmers still receive large subsidies from the EU to this day, even after multiple reforms up until 2013. The agricultural lobby is extremely large in the EU, very prominently in the Netherlands as well.\n\nThere is a foundation in the Netherlands called \"Agrifacts\", which is basically an organization dedicated to spread misinformation about the dutch agricultural industry and lobby against further government regulation. It has been proven that they gained massive financial support from large agricultural companies, and they have been fundamental to getting a \"farmers party\" to become the largest in the senate. They have sponsored their party leader and there are all kinds of shady connections there.\n\nTo be fair to smaller-scale farmers they have also been duped, since banks like Rabobank advised and encouraged them to increase scale in return for cheap loans, and now they are being asked to close farms in return for generous compensation. The main problem is that EU-regulation against nitrogen oxide emissions were fairly introduced, but nobody paid attention to the consequences until it was too late, if the government had rung the bell earlier the problems would have been much smaller.

Thimerosal was eliminated in most vaccine products since 2000 as a **precautionary measure.** The variable is likely to reflect the effect of removing thimerosal on vaccine production cost and then vaccine prices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo sum up, he doesn't use science or data. He uses pseudoscience and spooky language to scare the ever-loving shit out of people with fears of autism and any number of other issues. This fear influences people who **should** get vaccines to choose not to - and that kills people. See: Samoa. See: COVID.\n\nThimerosal does not cause autism. It's been debunked 7 ways from Sunday. With science. And math. And data. But still the lie persists, and then along with the lie comes the fear. But taking Thimerosal out of vaccines, even as an over-abundance of precaution, that limited the availability of multi-dose vaccines into single dose, which makes everything more expensive and less available. So I guess, he's the Pharma-profit-pumper much more so than someone like Hotez who works on patent free vaccines at the lowest possible prices.\n\nAnd lastly, I'll say this about COVID vaccines. They didn't live up to the promise of 'if you get the shot, you won't get COVID'. But they do save lives. They make the symptoms less severe and they lower the chance of major complications and death. How do I know? Because once vaccines were available I would track states reported data on death and see, 'of who is dying, what % were vaxed?'\n\nDid some people who got the vaccine die from COVID? Yes. Once available, were most COVID deaths among the unvaccinated population? HELL TO THE YES.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Let him keep filing lawsuits to clean up rivers. He's good at that.

Everything else is speculation, even if it is statements from Ross himself or Dan who was in the car. Here are the facts (as can be seen in the video) and speculations (mine) listed separately.\n\nSource video: https://twitter.com/TaylorOgan/status/1672342043794763779\n\nFacts:\n\n1. Ross's foot is shown to be on the accelerator (\"gas\") pedal from the start of the video until the moment he presses the brake and disengages FSD. We can't be sure if his foot was merely hovering on the pedal or if he was actively pressing it.\n\n2. The car was accelerating from the start of the video and continues to accelerate even after encountering the stop sign ahead warning sign. We can't be sure if it was FSD that continued to accelerate or if it was Ross doing so.\n\n3. Ross uses the scroll wheel to reduce the speed, at which point it shows 38 mph. This is a second or so before the Stop sign becomes visible. \n\n4. When the stop sign becomes visible and Ross takes his hand off the scroll wheel, the car starts to slow down. It started to slow down even before Ross braked and disengaged FSD. It started to slow down even before it passed the Stop sign.\n\n5. Ross moves his foot to the brake and disengages FSD at about the same moment the car passes the Stop sign.\n\nAll these are facts that can be clearly seen in the video. There is no speculation here.\n\nHere's the speculation part:\n\n1. Ross was actively accelerating until the car reached 38 mph. He continued to do so even after passing the Stop sign ahead warning sign. If FSD was totally in control, it would have started slowing down when passing the Stop sign ahead warning sign. Not continuing to accelerate.\n\n2. Just after passing the warning sign and a few feet before the stop sign, he stops accelerating and uses the scroll wheel to reduce the speed. This is when the actual Stop sign becomes visible.\n\n3. I suspect it was FSD which tries to slow down at this point, but it was going too fast and there was not enough time / distance for it to come to a stop. It started slowing down even before Ross's foot moved from the accelerator pedal, but by this time he had stopped pressing the accelerator pedal. He was just hovering.\n\n4. If Ross had not actively braked, the car would have overshot the stop sign line due to the momentum. But it MIGHT have slammed on the emergency brakes and avoided an actual collision. We can't be sure.\n\nTL;DR - I speculate that this was not pure FSD driving. Ross had manual inputs both with his foot and his finger on the scroll wheel. If this same route is driven with pure FSD and NO manual intervention, it will work correctly.
