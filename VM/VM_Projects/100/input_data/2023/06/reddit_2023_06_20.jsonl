{"title": "Will Apple be a $4 trillion dollar stock by 2024?", "selftext": "* Apple’s market cap rose from $1 trillion in 2018 to $3 trillion in 2022.\n* Reaching the $4 trillion market cap by 2024 could be very challenging.\n* New products, services, and acquisitions could help it reach that milestone.\r  \n\n\n# The law of large numbers hasn't caught up to Apple yet.\n\n\rApple ($AAPL) became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap in August 2018. It also became the first to cross the $2 trillion mark in August 2020, and the first to reach the $3 trillion milestone in January 2022.\r  \n\r  \nApple's market cap is still hovering near the $3 trillion mark as of this writing, but could it maintain its biennial tradition and hit a $4 trillion market cap by 2024? Let's review its past growth, projected growth rates, and valuations to decide.\n\n# How did Apple become a $3 trillion company?\n\n\rBetween fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2022 (which ended last September), Apple's annual revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5%. Meanwhile, its split-adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew at an even higher CAGR of 21.6%.\r  \n\r  \nIn other words, Apple's annual EPS nearly tripled from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2022 -- so it makes sense that its stock price nearly quadrupled over the past five years. However, Apple's valuations have also risen at a faster rate than its actual profits. On the last day of fiscal 2017, Apple's stock traded at $154.12 ($38.53 on a split-adjusted basis), which was only 13 times the diluted EPS of $11.91 it would generate in fiscal 2018. Today, Apple trades at 28 times forward earnings.\n\nApple's path from $1 trillion to $3 trillion was paved by both its own EPS growth and its rising valuations. Its earnings growth was driven by its robust sales of iPhones (which still account for over half its revenue), iPads, Macs, and the expansion of its services segment with more subscription-based services. Its valuations rose as more investors turned to Apple as a safe-haven bet while the pandemic, the Russo-Ukrainian war, inflation, and rising interest rates rattled the broader markets. \n\nApple's EPS also usually grows at a faster clip than its net income because it buys back billions of dollars in shares every year. It repurchased 19% of its shares over the past five years, as well as a whopping 38% of its shares over the past decade.\n\n# \rHow could Apple become a $4 trillion company?\n\n\rFor Apple to reach a $4 trillion market cap by the end of 2024, its stock would need to rise nearly 40% over the next 18 months. That could be quite difficult, for two simple reasons.\r  \n\r  \nFirst, analysts expect Apple's EPS to dip 2% in fiscal 2023, rise 9% in fiscal 2024, and grow 10% to $7.17 per share in fiscal 2025. Assuming Apple still trades at 28 times forward earnings by the beginning of fiscal 2025, its stock would only be trading 9% higher at about $200 -- which would give it a market cap of just under $3.2 trillion.\r  \n\r  \nSecond, Apple's valuations are historically high -- so I could see its forward multiple drop back to 20 during a market downturn. If that happens, Apple's stock could decline to the mid-$140s, and its market cap would shrink to about $2.2 trillion.\n\n# Pay attention to the wild cards\n\nBased on analysts' estimates, should take with a grain of salt, it seems unlikely that Apple will reach a $4 trillion valuation by the end of 2024. However, those forecasts don't account for all the wild cards that Apple can still play. \r  \n\r  \nApple's upcoming rollout of the Vision Pro headset in early 2024 will mark its first major hardware launch since its introduction of the Apple Watch in 2015. Its high price tag of $3,500 might limit its initial appeal, but a stronger-than-expected launch could drive analysts to boost their revenue and earnings estimates.\r  \n\r  \nApple also ended its latest quarter with 975 million paid subscriptions across all of its services, which represented 18% growth from a year ago. That massive audience gives it plenty of room to launch new apps and services.\r  \n\r  \nLastly, Apple is still sitting on $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. It could deploy a lot of that cash on fresh investments and acquisitions (perhaps on media companies for its services ecosystem or some chipmakers for its first-party chips). \n\n# Look beyond Apple's market cap\n\n\rI believe Apple will eventually be worth $4 trillion one day, but I don't expect it to reach that milestone by the end of 2024. Instead, investors should simply recall that Apple generates stable growth, commands fierce customer loyalty, locks in its customers with sticky services, and rewards its patient investors with buybacks and dividends. All of those strengths make Apple a great long-term investment -- regardless of how much the entire company is actually worth.", "id": "14e7eyk", "created_utc": 1687256919.0, "score": 243, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "No one expects a company to grow 38% in 1.5 years. \n\nAnswer to the question is unrealistic expectations.\n\nGiven the 10% annual return for SP500 in the past 30 years, and given that Apple is a well-established low risk company, anything above 15% is good (for 1.5 years to end 2024)\n\nIf we consider that Apple returns $100bn a year, or $150bn in 1.5 years, then a market cap of $3.2bn by the end of 2024 is good since 5% will be returned via buybacks + dividends.", "score": 235, "replies": [{"body": "> No one expects a [non-growth] company to grow 38% in 1.5 years.\n\nImportant edit.", "score": 67, "replies": []}, {"body": "Apple will hit 5 trillion market cap by 2024", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Pe ratio is not the measure of risk you think it is.\n\nLower risk companies have low cost of equity which increases price to earnings multiples\n\nSimilarly companies with higher debt will have a lower P/E ratio than one without \n\nYou can’t infer risk from pe ratio", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Tesla ?", "score": -15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Look at SPCE 😂  we expect it to grow 1500%", "score": -63, "replies": [{"body": "You can expect whatever you want, darling, what matters is how things will pan out.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe we shouldn't expect too much anymore.

That being said, you have to just accept the fact that you're going to suffer as an early adopter of any Gen 1 product from any company regardless of whether or not another company has figured out all the kinks of features and manufacturing on their side. First iPhone 3 or 4 iPhones were magical, yes, but they had plenty of problems, including broken lock buttons, much more fragile displays (which the industry over time addressed), a limited ecosystem, and even lost signal if you just simply held the phone as intended. iPhone 6 was so thin and made of soft aluminum that it just bent from normal use.\n\nWhen something the price of an iPhone breaks or needs repair, you can ride it out and just simply replace it slightly earlier by starving a couple of meals and not getting as many coffees for a month. When a 90k+ car breaks, you have to take PTO, figure out transportation, use a loaner car or Uber, and either pay high insurance monthlies or premiums or/and even then still pay 2-20k for repairs while your car is out of commission for 1-2 months, not 1-2 weeks. Early Model S, X, and even 3 had similar issues because Tesla was still at a phase where it was ramping and figuring out manufacturing and trying to maximize cash flow. \n\nIt just is what it is.

You thought beta-gang prevailed and the STAG WHEEL defeated.\n\nINCORRECT.\n\n\nNot only am I back, but I’m bigger, better, and more TREASONOUS THAN EVER BEFORE! I’ve spent the last 2 years grinding, collecting premium, and stacking beta gang suicide notes as I march on to WORLD DOMINATION.\n\nFor those of you that have been living under Iraq for the last few years; the STAG WHEEL is my PROPRIETARY wheel strategy that’s TAKING THE WORLD BY STORM.\n\nThere is some nuance, but the gist is this: sell a cash secured put, use the premium to buy shares of the underlying, repeat until you get assigned, and do the same thing with covered calls.\n\nInstead of premium, you collect free shares. When you have 100 free shares you start a second STAG WHEEL. Then a third, and a fourth, etc.. until you basically own the entire world.\n\nIt’s a revolutionary concept developed while in the throes of an Ayahuasca trip. And who is the mad architect of this game changing strategy? \n\nu/racefapery, GENIUS, and sire to you all.\n\nDue to OVERWHELMING PUBLIC DEMAND, I’m r-instituting my regular updates of my STAG WHEEL demo account.\n\nIt all started a couple years back, PLTR was just under $30. I Started a stag wheel, and a few weeks later, the market started to crash on me.\n\nI held fast, sticking to the strategy, collecting free shares all the way down to $5 and reveling in the elevated premium during most of the downturn. I cleared 100 free shares in record time, and started selling 2 contracts at a time. \n\nLet me tell you, the STAG WHEEL gets punished more than other strategies during once in century fed rate cycles that include multiple, over 100% increases. But I held the line.\n\nWhile beta-gang was crying about their losses and abandoning ship, your hero battened down the hatches and prepared to go down with it. I stayed at the helm, knowing that after the storm has passed, the ship would emerge better prepared than ever to commit SERIOUS TREASON\n\nAnd now here we are, I started with nothing but $3000 in cash, and now I have almost 274 shares of PLTR, as well as 126 shares of UWMC.\n\nI’ll soon be writing 3 contracts a week on PLTR, drastically reducing the time it takes to get to the next 100 free shares. This is where the STAG WHEEL really starts to pick up, as it compounds on itself exponentially, eventually I’ll be writing 100 contracts a week, compounding ever faster. \n\nI actually passed into the green several months ago, thanks to all those $6 shares I picked up over the last 8 or so months.\n\nI’m now looking at PLTR coming back into fashion, he stock price rising, and we’re ready to enter the type of market where the STAG WHEEL has its greatest advantage: slowly up trending markets.\n\nI’ll post a detailed breakdown of the last 2 years soon, it’s been a wild ride, lots of edge cases to discuss, a lot of rare scenarios occurred that I want to share with you, and a lot of other stuff that you should know.\n\nMostly though, it’s been a long, depressing, grind, collecting a free share or two every week, week in, week out, with the stock just going down the whole time.", "id": "14e0xyb", "created_utc": 1687235596.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "TL;DR\n\nI've been doing a shit strategy that didn't make a dime for 23 months.

Obama also tried to balance China’s growing influence in the Asia-Pacific region by strengthening U.S. alliances and partnerships with countries like Japan, South Korea, Australia, India, and Vietnam. This was part of his broader strategy of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy toward Asia⁴.\n-\tBiden has not continued the same policies as Trump. Trump's policies toward China were more aggressive, unpredictable, and unilateral than Obama's. They aimed to contain China's rise and challenge its behavior across multiple domains. However, they also resulted in more tensions, mistrust, and instability in the U.S.-China relationship and the broader international system⁵. Biden's policies toward China are still evolving, but they seem to blend some elements of Trump's and Obama's approaches. Biden has maintained some of Trump's tariffs and sanctions on China, but he has also signaled a willingness to cooperate with China on issues such as climate change and pandemic response. He has also sought to restore U.S. leadership and credibility in international institutions and alliances that involve China, such as the Paris climate accord, the Iran nuclear deal, the World Health Organization, and the World Trade Organization⁶.\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 6/20/2023\n(1) Biden Sees Progress With China After Blinken Meets With Xi. https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/biden-sees-progress-with-china-after-blinken-meets-with-xi/ar-AA1cLymL.\n(2) Obama’s past and Biden’s future with China - Brookings. https://www.brookings.edu/on-the-record/obamas-past-and-bidens-future-with-china/.\n(3) Biden’s China Policy Blends Obama’s and Trump’s, Top Aide Says. https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-china-policy-blends-obamas-and-trumps-top-aide-says-11620160559.\n(4) Joe Biden’s China policy will be a mix of Trump’s and Obama’s. https://www.economist.com/china/2020/11/19/joe-bidens-china-policy-will-be-a-mix-of-trumps-and-obamas.\n(5) 'Hell of a job': Biden's reaction and 5 other takeaways from Blinken's trip to China. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/hell-of-a-job-bidens-reaction-and-5-other-takeaways-from-blinkens-trip-to-china/ar-AA1cMe53.\n(6) Biden: US-China relations on the 'right trail'. https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/world/biden-us-china-relations-on-the-right-trail/ar-AA1cLD0h.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "thanks?", "score": -11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Straight from the mouths of CCP\n\nCheers", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hey you seem kinda smart, can you help me understand what it is about Shenzhen that's so advantageous?\n\nMy buddy listens to this guy, I forget his name, but some kind of former political big wig with a book and always touring, anyway this dude basically says constantly that China is fucked, but like in all these fancy geo political reasons that sound logical but always felt to me like they were oversimplifying reality.\n\nSo, anyway, since I don't know shit about China, and my buddy acts like he knows everything about it because he listens to a YouTuber, any extra info you could direct me to would be helpful lol.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I'll give you an example.\n\nApple decided it wanted to manufacture the first Mac Pro in the United States.
