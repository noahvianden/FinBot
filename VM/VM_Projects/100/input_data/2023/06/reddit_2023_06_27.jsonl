{"title": "Nancy Pelosi's husband just snapped up $2.6 million of Apple and Microsoft stock, closing out an options bet that the shares would soar", "selftext": "* Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month.\r\n* Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.\r\n* Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                       \n\nNancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.\r  \n\r  \nThe transactions on the filing, marked with \"SP\" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.\r  \n\r  \nThe Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.\r  \n\r  \nSince the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.\r  \n\r  \nFirst highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.\r  \n\r  \nEarlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.\r  \n\r  \nCongress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.\r  \n\r  \nLegislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.\r  \n\r  \nFor example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.\r  \n\r  \nOpenSecrets estimated that Pelosi has a net worth of $114.6 million.", "id": "14k8vwr", "created_utc": 1687858457.0, "score": 2441, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 381, "comments": [{"body": "I am tired of this shit.\n\nNANCY ETF when?", "score": 1645, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 589, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah she is just wealthier than most of then since her husband is a VC in SF.", "score": 306, "replies": [{"body": "Paul Pelosi is part of the Viet Cong?", "score": 414, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah a lot of people in San Francisco are waiting for Ho Chi Minh reincarnation to save them.", "score": 207, "replies": [{"body": "Bless bạc Hồ", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Jeeze... gonna need a bigger hammer...", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "God damn Paul Pelosi in the treetops\n\nWhere's our air support?", "score": 43, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes, the San Fernando Viet Cong", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "I laughed so hard.

In Pfizer’s case, they were middling along with a handful of great joint ventures with other large pharma companies, but mainly were seen as ‘the virus’ company. \n\n\nEnter Covid, they went from clearing a modest amount of free cash flow each year, and trying to lay the track right in front of the train to keep things moving each year… to more than doubling their free cash flow for two years. If things continue with Covid never happening, Pfizer does just ok. With Covid and the vaccine, it was one of the largest windfalls in corporate history. \n\n\nThe CEO of any company has a few choices with their cash. Stock buybacks, dividends, M&A, debt reduction, and increased cap ex. Pfizer has done all of these. The sentiment on Pfizer that ‘the party is over’ is underestimating the cash flow they’ve infused from the companies they’ve acquired. \n\n\nIf you are Pfizer’s largest competitor (Bristol, Roche, Merck, etc) are you excited that your largest rival got nearly $60 billion in free money and acquired five new companies? Or are you upset? I would be upset. \n\n\nPfizer does have execution risk, as does any large cap pharma player. That’s part of the game. The game just became heavily tilted in Pfizer’s favor three years ago. \n\n\nAs for ‘no organic innovation’, I’d ask that you read their quarterly report and explain how multiple drugs passing through various phases of FDA trials is ‘no organic innovation’. Of all the pharma companies I’ve covered, Pfizer is easily the most transparent about each drug’s trial. You just have to be willing to do the homework. \n\n\nAt the end of the day, many companies’ fates are decided by how well they accumulate and utilize capital. Pfizer has been one of the best capital accumulators in history the past three years, their utilization has been just what most analysts have looked for with this found money.

The December $65 calls should be trading at or very near to the [parity price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parityprice.asp) of $70.70 - $65 = $5.70.

{"title": "$EOSE - THE SHITTY SPAC MOUNTING THE GREATEST COMEBACK OF ALL TIME", "selftext": "TLDR: This shitty SPAC, $EOSE is going to be catapulted by a near term catalyst in the form of a huge, cheap loan from the Department of Energy and the Inflation Reduction Act, and a new production process that will finally make this company fantastically profitable.\n\nPositions: $EOSE - 304,298 shares https://www.reddit.com/user/mpwrd/comments/14k39tl/eose_position/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nEOS Energy (Ticker $EOSE) is probably the most exciting opportunity I have come across since going balls deep into TSLA during the COVID meltdown. I’m going to lay out exactly why I’ve built up a 7 figure position in the stock. I have been itching to share this DD on WSB and watching the market cap like a hawk so that I can finally post this DD when EOSE breaks the $500 million market cap requirement.\n\nEOS Energy is grid-scale battery manufacturing company that builds long duration energy storage batteries. It builds zinc-bromide batteries, which, unlike lithium ion counterparts, have virtually zero fire risk using significantly cheaper and more available raw materials inputs that can all be sourced within the USA. EOS is based in New Jersey and its main manufacturing facility is located in Turtle Creek, PA. It went public via a SPAC in 2020. Significant investors include Point72 (Steven A Cohen), The Koch family (which own convertible notes), Vanguard, and Legal & General Group PLC.\n\nTHIS IS A SHITTY SPAC THAT IS TEETERING ON BANKRUPTCY\n\nLet’s get the bad out of the way: as of Dec 31, 2022, the company (a former de-SPAC flameout) was roughly 2 quarters away from bankruptcy based on cash burn and money in the bank. In Q1, they managed to avoid barreling towards bankruptcy only through the magic of massive dilution.\n\nSecond bad point - EOS raised that money from some of the absolute worst sources of capital available to shitty public companies: an alternative lender (read: loan shark) named Yorkville Advisors. Yorkville finances EOS through a secondary equity purchase agreement (SEPA), which allows EOS to raise debt at will from Yorkville. The problem is that Yorkville can, at any time, call that note and force EOS to issue shares to Yorkville to pay off the note at a discount to the lowest daily average over the past 5 or so days. Yorkville then dumps the shares on the public market causing intraday swings of 10% or more. I suspect Yorkville is actually shorting the shares in advance of acquiring the shares, using the worst trading methods possible to depress the share price as much as quickly as possible, then covering using the SEPA. Yorkville gets all of its shares under the SEPA at the lowest intraday average price, so the bigger the delta between when it starts selling and the lowest price, the more Yorkville makes. \n\nThis is the biggest risk in the near term for EOS: that it will need to raise more capital tanking the stock leaving us as bag holders. But we have help on the way: enter Jigar Shah, the head of the Department of Energy Loan Program Office who is making it rain on green tech companies to the tune of $400 BILLION. \n\nHERES THE GOOD NEWS: ITS GOING TO GET A HUGE, CHEAP DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TITLE 17 LOAN\n\nThe Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office is about to swoop in and provide a minimum of $250 million dollars of financing, which is an immediate catalyst to sending EOS to the fuckin moon. EOS has been pursuing this loan for over a year and everything points to an imminent approval of the loan for the following reasons:\n\n1 - EOS is the only major player in the non-lithium ion grid-scale battery pack - a major focus of influential senators including none other than Joe Manchin, the Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee: https://www.energy.senate.gov/2023/2/manchin-bipartisan-colleagues-urge-administration-to-invest-in-non-lithium-energy-storage-solutions\n\n2 - EOS sources over 90% of its materials for its batteries from the United States (this also helps it qualify for additional tax credits under the IRA which we’ll talk about below). https://www.eose.com/technology/ \n\n3 - EOS estimates that the loan will help it generate 700 new jobs in a key battleground state for the upcoming elections, Pennsylvania, where its main manufacturing facility is located.\n\n4 - At an investor conference on Jun 9, 2023, the CEO said this about how the loan is progressing: “Eos is in the final innings with the process and has solidified most of the commercial terms. The company’s attorneys are working through the final punch list of items after which it will be submitted for Treasury final review. That review process should be completed within 30 days of submission and if approved will be followed by an official announcement.\n\nOh, and by the way, @jigarshah tweeted (in a subsequently deleted tweet) on April 1 that “Many announcements are coming to Pittsburgh and the Ohio River Valley”. \n\nIf EOS gets the loan, this would completely remove bankruptcy risk priced at 10-year treasury plus a slight risk premium, making the company fully investable for investment funds looking for exposure to the only US based non lithium storage company delivering commercially deployed batteries. \n\nEOS IS A HUGE BENEFICIARY OF THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT\n\nEos gets incredible benefits from the Inflation Reduction Act hitting all sides of the income statement. Energy storage installations are eligible for the following IRA benefits, of which Eos can qualify for every single one:\n\n1 - a 30% investment tax credit to the buyer for installation of energy storage\n2 - a 10% tax credit to the buyer for domestic content\n3 - a 10% tax credit for installation of the storage in an energy transition zone.\n4 - EOS gets a $35/kWh production tax credit for cell manufacturing\n5 - EOS also gets a $10/kWh production tax credit for domestic battery module assembly\n6 - Finally, a 10% qualifying tax credit for active electrode material costs.\n\nTHERE IS NEAR INFINITE DEMAND FOR ENERGY STORAGE\n\nAs of Dec 2022, EOS had an order backlog for committed orders of $535M. A lot of orders were sitting on the side lines waiting for guidance on domestic content for the 10% additional tax credit mentioned above and the company is currently projecting for $1B of new booked orders for 2023. This translates to roughly 6 GWh of backlog.  \n\nOn a longer timescale, the company had another $1.5 billion of LOIs, another $7 billion of active proposals, and $10 billion of lead generation available to be converted to loans. Look for another LDES provider at scale - there aren’t any. The only competitors are Tesla and Fluence that sell Lithium Ion grid batteries at about twice the cost of Eos.  https://investors.eose.com/static-files/589460b5-8001-4a76-b06b-2e2880968f98 \n\nEOS BATTERY ECONOMICS ARE TURNING A CORNER\n\nIn Q1, Eos produced the last of its hand-made second generation battery. Q2 will be dedicated to transitioning to a semi automated production line that will significantly improve economics and scale and Q3-Q4 will be all about the ramp. \n\nEos touts the following improvements between Z2 and Z3 batteries:\n\n1 - 15% immediate improvement in cost structure with another 15%-35% gained by deploying automation that has already been ordered.\n2 - cycle times for production vastly decreased resulting in 9x battery output.\n3 - Q1 2022 to Q1 2023 has already seen a 24% decrease in CoGS during which time revenue increased by 168% on an absolute basis (NOT PER UNIT).\n\nThe company has already put down payments on long lead time items critical to manufacturing the Z3 batteries.\n\nEos doesn’t talk about its ultimate target cost per kWh, but its main competitor, Redflow, a tiny even earlier stage zinc based battery company based out of Australia that doesn’t get the benefit of the inflation reduction act hopes to achieve a $100 per kWh COGS.\n\nEOS HAS SIGNIFICANT BAKED IN VALUE\n\nEos is projecting for approximately 6 GWh of backlog at the end of 2023, which results in $270 million of production tax credits which will be paid to the company.\n\nOn top of that, Eos, being a shitty SPAC, has significant net operating loss carry forwards, which can be used to offset future net income (similar to all the people who post loss porn on WSB, but with an actual chance to make money going forward and recapture that value). As of December 2022, it was sitting on $485 million of NOL Carry Forwards. In Q1 2023, it lost another $71 million. If you estimate another $100 million of NOL in 2023 * a 21% corporate tax rate, that’s approximately $135 million of value to EOS.\n\nTogether with the production tax credits, there are about $400 million in value of tax benefits, or about 80% of its current market cap.\n\nShout out to @zerosumgame33 on twitter for leading the charge on EOSE and the rest of the Twitter EOSE Mafia including @brynkahrl, @ryanthawks, @cluster_6.
