{"title": "WSJ - S&P 500 ends longest bear market since the 1940s and signals beginning of new bull market.", "selftext": "U.S. stocks rose Thursday, ending the S&P 500‚Äôs longest bear market since the 1940s and marking the start of a new bull run. \n\nThe broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.\n\nMany of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the market‚Äôs advance Thursday. \n\nThat helped propel the S&P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.\n\nTreasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.\n\nAnalysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.\n\nSo far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead. \n\n‚ÄúA pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,‚Äù said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors. \n\nTraders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street‚Äôs ‚Äúfear gauge,‚Äù are wagers that it will surge to 30‚Äîa level associated with investor anxiety‚Äîor 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.\n\nAmong individual stocks, electric-car maker Tesla jumped 4.6% to $234.86, posting its 10th straight session of gains. That marked the company‚Äôs longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. \n\nCarvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.\n\nGameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman. \n\nU.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude. They pared some of their losses by the end of the trading day, though, finishing down 1.7% at $71.29 a barrel.\n\nGlobal stock markets were mixed. Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng rose 0.3% and Japan‚Äôs Nikkei 225 retreated 0.9%. The Stoxx Europe 600 finished about flat.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stocks-markets-dow-news-06-08-2023-ef63fc60", "id": "144ptye", "created_utc": 1686269629.0, "score": 653, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 293, "comments": [{"body": "Longest bear market since the 1940s?

{"title": "Tech leaders are calling for an A.I. pause because they have no product ready, Palantir CEO says", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/09/tech-leaders-ai-pause-no-product-ready-palantir.html\n\nPalantir‚Äôs boss Alex Karp opposes the idea of a pause in artificial intelligence research, in contrast to an open letter from the Future of Life Institute signed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry. The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if ‚Äúsuch a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.‚Äù Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that ‚Äúmany of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.‚Äù\n\nHe added, without naming anyone, that this is because ‚Äúpeople who have nothing to offer want to study AI,‚Äù but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversaries stealing a lead in not only commercial applications, but also military applications. To him, ‚Äústudying this and allowing other people to win both on commercial areas and on the battlefield‚Äù is a really bad strategy. When asked if what he wanted was an ‚ÄúA.I. race‚Äù akin to the arms race of the Cold War, Karp simply stated that ‚Äúthere is already an A.I. arms race, it‚Äôs just we‚Äôre ahead, [and] it‚Äôs not like if we slow down, the AI race will stop.‚Äù\n\nHe pointed out that the ‚Äúsingle most important event‚Äù in this race is not large language models like GPT-4, but instead how AI has been utilized in military applications. Karp points out that Ukrainian forces have used Palantir technologies to gain a technological edge over invading Russian forces. A report from The Times in December 2022 revealed that Palantir‚Äôs AI has allowed Ukraine to increase the accuracy, speed and deadliness of its artillery strikes despite having comparatively smaller artillery forces. Palantir sells software to governments and private sector organizations which help them analyze large quantities of data. The advent of this AI-powered software on the battlefield ‚Äújust throws down a gauntlet to every single country in the world,‚Äù Karp said. He added, ‚Äúespecially [to] our adversaries, they cannot afford for us to have this advantage. And so, the race is on. There‚Äôs only a question of do we stay ahead or do we cede the lead.‚Äù", "id": "1453tou", "created_utc": 1686313481.0, "score": 2198, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 324, "comments": [{"body": "A tale as old as force has existed.

That's because puts exponentially increase in value the lower the price falls in a given period of time - AND they also increase in value with rising volatility, and since IV spikes during a stock downturn, they will rise in value due to both price movement and volatility expansion.

If the world was willing to put those kinds of resources to rescuing average people then we could probably save a few people every year. Or maybe it would be a waste? Even with elite divers from all over the world, it was impossible to navigate the caves for the first few days because the water was so high and the currents so strong and there was basically zero visibility. \n\nThe real story is that everyone just got lucky. It was a disaster because it happened at the beginning of the monsoon season, that's why there was a lot of rain that flooded the cave and trapped them. And that's why it was such a big deal to go to great lengths to get them out because most likely it would keep raining for months and getting them out from a flooded cave would be really difficult. Some of the options for rescue were to find or dig a new entrance to that part of the cave, teach the kids how to scuba dive in caves, or maybe use a little sub of some kind. All of those are ideas are difficult and risky.\n\nWhat ended up happening is that the rains let us unexpectedly, and with some pumping they were able to keep the water levels low enough for everyone to get out without any extreme measures. Even so they were still drugged and had a full face mask with oxygen. But because the rain had stopped, they could pretty much just drag the boys out through the water.

The British white foreigner living in an area known for having white foreigners raping children then comes in and tells Elon to stick the sub up his arsehole. Elon then subsequently called him a pedo guy. To point out, the Thai rescue team asked for Elon's help, the British pedo never did, and was only out there because he had some sort of info on the layout of these caves.\n\nAlso, the British pedo never went into this cave or made a physical effort to save these kids.

That‚Äôs when AMD had their Athlon processors. And they were REALLY good. Not only did AMD beat Intel on performance, they were the first to hit 1Ghz too. \n\nAfter the Pentium 3 came Netburst, aka the Pentium 4. AMD had the Bulldozer. And Bulldozer was absolutely terrible. To be fair, the Pentium 4 was also terrible. The Netburst architecture had a ridiculously long pipeline and really bad branch prediction. Which meant that the really long pipeline often had to be completely flushed. Netburst was supposed to bring us to 6-10Ghz and beyond but ended up running ridiculously hot. And the poor branch prediction led to bad performance. Intel won this era purely because Bulldozer was pretty bad. \n\nAnd then came Nehalem. The chosen one. The golden goose. You know the Nehalem architecture as the core 2 architecture. This is when Intel truly went multicore. \n\nNehalem was a fucking beast. It was truly a leap forward in computer processors. At the High Frequency Trading shop I worked at we got a ton of these boxes in before anyone else. We mopped up the market with these boxes. These boxes made us millions of dollars per day, every single day. Nehalem blew everything out of the water. At the time, they were FAST. \n\nIntel continued to milk the ‚Äúcore‚Äù processors for years. By the time Sandy Bridge came around, Intel‚Äôs processors were incredibly stagnant. Each new tick/tock only brought maybe 3-5% real world gains. Intel never really increased core count. Desktops were stuck on 2, maaaaybe 4 cores. And servers were stuck on 4/8 cores per processor. \n\nI remember having meetings with Intel around this time and telling them I wasn‚Äôt really impressed with their latest architecture. By this point, there were whispers of a new CPU design at AMD. This was when AMD stock was at its lowest point. ‚ÄúZen‚Äù was supposed to save AMD. Supposedly this new processor would beat Intel. But that is what they said about Bulldozer. So it was hard to trust any of the rumors. \n\nAnd then they released Ryzen. They have the HEDT processors 16 cores. SIXTEEN. Even the cheaper Ryzen chips came with 8 cores. Twice the HEDT offering from Intel. And four times the cores HEDT vs HEDT. \n\nBut Bulldozer had way more cores than Intel, and it still sucked. Core for core, how did Ryzen do? Pretty well, actually. The first release if I remember correctly came damn close to beating Intel. By the 3000 series, AMD was dominant in almost everything. Intel had one last hold out. AVX 512. But by the 7000 series Ryzen, even that had been matched if not outdone. Intel is now fully dethroned in every category. \n\nDr. Lisa Su toppled the (in my opinion) biggest, most cutting edge company in the world.

My watchlist is made from time-frame alignment running thru monthly chart with hour,30 min,15min and 5 min.\nThen I go to 5 day and do the same then I go to daily and do the same.\n\nWhen I find charts that lineup and I can see key support and resistance and see those same lines on all those time frames,I know those are pretty solid zones that will most likely be respected. \nThen I pull my fib retracement on those timeframes and then it starts to come together and I cab see that all these fib lines are also being respected. \nSo then I know I've got a good setup. \n\nI never enter without a pullback to the 50 or 61.8 fib. When I see it's pulled back to those zones I know I've got a really strong chance of this going my way.\n\nSo then I set profit targets based on key resistance or fib lines and wait for opening to see what kinda volume I have. With options volume is everything.  You need volume to get the momentum to push the price action.\nSo say ive got a target of 1$ and everything has lined up and we have at least 45-55% volume.\nI buy atm or 1 step itm contracts and I usually buy at least 5,sometimes 10. \nAt that point I'm just waiting on it to hit my target and my target may only be 20%.
