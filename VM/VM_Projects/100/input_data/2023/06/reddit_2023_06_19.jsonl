I will ask through an example.Let's go over BA stock, let's say the current spot price is $200. Let's say I think the price of BA will not go down any further and will increase from this point on, and I decide to buy a Call option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----1st Scenario----\n\nHere's what I usually do at this stage: Suppose I bought a call option with a breakeven point close to $200, with a strike price (let's say) of 150 and a maturity of 6 months. so My guess is that I can start making profits in a few days as the stock won't go below $200. so I don't risk too much and I can get the profit I want in a short time and close my position. So far everything is okay.\n\nLet this be the first scenario,and let's say BA rises to $400 in the 3rd month, in this scenario I have made a very high profit as the share price has doubled and there are still 90 days to maturity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----2nd Scenario----\n\nNow let's go back to the beginning and assume we buy an options contract with a strike price of $400 ,not $150, and a maturity of 6 months while the spot price of BA is $200. Because I think the stock BA will increase up to that level ($400) within a 6 months for some reasons that I believe. And again the stock rises to $400 in the 3rd month. Let this be the second scenario.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----Question----\n\nAs far as I can see from the IBKR platform, options with a strike price that is much higher than the spot price are sold very cheaply, while options with a spot price close to the strike price are sold much more expensive. Although the price varies from share to share, there is a difference of almost 100 times.\n\nThis made me think, I usually go for the 1st scenario, but if I apply the 2nd scenario, will I make many times more profit or will my profit be the same? Can anyone who knows the answer to this question share their thoughts? Am i missing something?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The further your contract is out of the money, generally, the lower the premium.  This makes sense because 1) There is no intrinsic value and 2) the odds of the underlying reaching or surpassing the strike is lower.\n\nIs it better to buy way out of the money?  In my opinion, no.  Yes, the contract is cheaper but it’s cheap for a reason.  If you buy a call, for example, you don’t just need the stock to move past your strike, you need it to do so as quickly as possible because your extrinsic value is constantly decaying.  Not much at first, but that will change with time.  The probability of your contract being profitable is priced into the contract.  This, essentially, means that you must do better than the expected move to make money.  This is why just buying contracts is a tough business.  You can be 100% correct on your forecast and still not make money (or make far less than you expected) due to timing.  It’s not good enough to just be right.  You have to be right faster than the market expects.\n\nThat’s not to say that you won’t win with far OTM contracts.

If you mean in terms of spendable dollars, S1 pays more. If you mean in terms of % rate of return, S2 pays more. But that's just an artifact of S2 having a lower cost basis, by a lot.\n\nSo the moneyness decision (how near to or far from the money your contract strike is) boils down to a trade-off. Or a cluster of related trade-offs actually. There's no free lunch. If you pay less, you stand to lose less, but you also make less.

I've thinking about the different approaches but can't decide what to do. For example I see that I could roll them to the 9/2024 $300 calls for a 3.45 net credit and well $78/share extra profit.

Let's say stock A is currently trading at $100/share and I buy a put option expiring in 1 year at a $80 strike and RH lists the breakeven at $75. If in 6 months the stock is trading at $90/share and I sell the option would I still likely profit since the value of the option premium increased since the share price dropped? (even though I wasn't close to the \"breakeven\" price of $75?)  ..

I'll probably do a DD on $TGT if/when I get my shit together. Questions/comments are appreciated and possibly used for DD insights.**\n\nFrom the creator of China-Doomer and shitty $SPY loss porn, I bring to media's currently most hated retailer: Target ($TGT). \n\nWe all know how the BS started and the resulting a FB post that \"rallied\" anti-woke consumers and scared $TGT investors. This bear parade has dropped around 30% from its peak. Multiple downgrades, many institutions hating on them. The recent short is at 11%, a highly bearish mentality over angry boomers. \n\n**So why am I bring them up now?**\n\nTarget is oversold on the agenda of \"decreasing consumer discretionary spending\" and \"protests\". These are nothing but an over-hyped bear's wet dream. For example, research is pointing towards a significant increase of foot traffic into Target. Consumer Spending is increasing despite the doomer posts.  \n\nThe downgrades reasoning seemed fishy that pointed at $WMT taking more of the sector. I would argue that $TGT target audiences are different from $WMT. $TGT's audience is Millennials/College Student who want a \"luxury\" experience that cannot afford it. These two audiences with large student debts may sound scary but will not hurt $TGT's bottom line as long as political garbage drags the issue.   \n\n**Conclusion**\n\n$TGT dropping as hard as they did while other discretionary consumer retailer/company is at/near 52w Highs seems contradictory. Either the entire market is ignoring $TGT (Consumer Spending is increasing) or the market is overpricing everyone else (Consumer Spending is decreasing yet they're expecting to buy $AAPL's $3.5k porn gear?). \n\n**Positions**\n\n\\- Currently debit spreads: 10x each Sept 145/155C & 155/165C\n\n\\- Goal: 50x Sept 145C & 155C and 200x 14DTE w/ +15% movement on earnings.", "id": "14dlipt", "created_utc": 1687197155.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|3476|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: $TGT is oversold and is due to return to $145 before Earnings and Low/Mid 160's after earnings.

While i do have some counters, You make some good points. I will likely add them into a DD.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "There are two major problems that basically take down their argument:\n\n1. The idea that rising prices in discretionary goods automatically constrain the market comes from research done during flat money supply periods. In that case, yes, the fraction of goods available to the market for revenue will drop (according to classical economics, we'll get to why that's a problem in a second). When you have elevating wages and increased money supply and more money circulating in the economy to encompass the increased pricing with enough margin, the real difference in sales volume is either reduced or negated. In other words, if prices go up 20% in 3 years, but combined wages have increased almost as much, you have to account for the greater amount of money chasing goods. It's basically mathematical reduction.\n2. The student loan thesis in their argument is a red flag.\n\nThe common claim is that Americans spend about $200B/year on student loan payments.\n\nThat's a lot, right? That's a big number. That's a big scary fucking number. That's bigger than more money I'll ever see. It's definitely more than others on here who think this is a really big scary number will ever see, and I'll probably see 2-3, maybe 50x the amount of money they'll see in their lifetimes.\n\nYeah, that number really scares me. Very scary.\n\nNow go and look up total consumer spending in the country... and it's... it's... on trend to be more than $60T this year...\n\nIn other words, $200B of lost capital velocity, which you were just told would bring retail establishments to its knees causing a black swan event... **amounts to a grand total of 0.33% of on-trend consumer spending**...\n\nWOMP WOMP\n\nHonestly, that number is probably a little bit of an overestimate on payments, too... but we'll accept that it's probably somewhere in the ballpark.\n\nNow I don't want to play down a reduction of capital velocity from payments, it's important to note that the human impact does scale out and cause other issues, but the economy was growing just fine with people paying student loans at the same rate prior to the pandemic, so there's little reason to think that student loan payments returning is a massive net negative against the market unless you're trading in classical economics and not considering the expansion of wages and money supply as an offset.\n\nI bring up classical economics because what people are falling victim to here is a flaw in econ 101 classes that comes from classical economics which uses an overly simplistic Supply and Demand model for flexing in goods and services which does not actually prove out in real world economic research. People assume that there's a linear and universal relationship to discretionary purchases when the consumer belt tightens, but that's not happens. What happens is that consumers debt spend and/or shift in other areas, and they shift unpredictably, if at all, and over unpredictable periods.\n\nIf you get extremes in earnings potential, like you did in the period between 1990-2008 during the housing boom while most people were seeing real wages decline not just a little bit, but entire blue collar career lines being obliterated in that period, then you can expect massive reductions in volume.\n\nBut wages are higher. Many of the jobs that reshored into the United States during the pandemic are higher income careers, like the return of manufacturing. Inflation is relatively high, but over the entire term manageable (with the exception of Housing, I hope, but that's a whole different discussion). Basically, there's significant reason to doubt the \"OMG, consumers won't buy discretionary items with inflation like this!\" narrative.\n\nThat same narrative failed to produce an earnings recession now for going on 6 quarters... and in fact, the same people selling that narrative said we were in a recession now about 5 quarters ago.\n\nThose same people are the same ones saying that debt ceilings crash markets and one month ago were predicting that bond liquidity was going to cause the market to come crashing down as the treasury panic-sold bonds to rehydrate the general fund. It was the SAME. EXACT. ARGUMENT. too... \"OMG, they're going to have to release TRILLIONS in bonds over months! That's so much!\" then when you divide it down it's, again, noise...\n\nNoticing a pattern? Bad economics, big number fear, black swan scenarios...\n\nThe big threat is actually from the banks, and potential downstream issues from tightening, but even that narrative is getting old at this point because of Fed actions. But \"OMG big numbers!\" scenarios should be a big red flag for anyone, because the economy itself is MASSIVE, so any theory which is about \"this FEELS really big\" should be skeptically doubted.\n\nEdit: Now, I want to be clear that I'm not necessarily saying that TGT goes up from here...

Or $60T annually on trend.\n\n>But even if you are correct, you might be confusing **consumption with Cash-Flow**.  \n>  \n>Sure, I can go buy a $100,000 car, but I might only pay $2k a month.  \n>  \n>BIG difference.\n\nI'm not confusing anything. I get where you're coming from, but it's a different argument than the one talking about regarding the macro impact of the costs.\n\nThe discussion on $200B of lost consumer spending is, in this context, really an argument about the net impact of overall economic activity on macro earnings, so we have to consider like-for-like magnitude aspects of this spending, and that means we need to look at it first as a function of total spend. In other words, we need to understand the scope of a macro change within the impact to the macro overall spend to understand how it works systemically.\n\nIt's fair to go down the next layer which is to take it from macro to micro, which is what you're doing here, but that gets really fraught really quickly.\n\nI'm gonna play multiple angles of this out to demonstrate.\n\nFor instance, OK, let's say these figures include $100k cars... and your argument would be that the added burden of an extra payment might dissuade someone from buying a $100k car due to the added cost.\n\nThe problem is that even without paying student loans, the vast majority of the 43 million people\\* with student loans aren't buying $100k cars. In fact, for most of them a big ticket item like that is very, very rare... and the smaller ticket items that you find at target may be marginally impacted by a student loan payment to some extent, but then you have to deal with the fact that prices for those items will either come down, or the supply for those items will come down, ultimately resulting in either greater volume or greater margin.\n\nBasically, the low impact to overall net buying potential here significantly softens the micro impact on the macro outcome.\n\nNow am I suggesting that people who earn more will just buy more stuff? No, individuals only need just so much of any given thing. It's not that simple, but at the same time it's not so simple as a simplistic flex of \"more obligation means less spending.\"\n\nNow maybe your angle is that big ticket items being in that spending figure means the impact of the expansion of monthly obligation increases the impact to money that can go to target because it has a greater impact on the populations that shop at target, meaning that the relatively greater impact to cash flow expands the losses at target.\n\nThe problem here is that of the 330m people in the United States, only 13% actually hold Federal student loans. Of those, only 25% are paying at the standard rate. The rest are all on programs that reduce their payments based on earnings.\n\nThe other thing to note is that half the borrowers, holding over 60% of the debt, are in the 35-61 age bracket, or ideal earning period. This bracket also has the greatest access to credit, as well.\n\nThe take-away from all of this is not only is a small slice of overall spend, it's a narrow slice of the population, and the most affected people weighting the average monthly cost to the $300-600 range for average payment are also the people most capable of absorbing the cost and least likely to have their spending habits impacted by the obligation.\n\nMost of the people most sensitive to these changes are either deferred or weighted below the average range because of income reductions.\n\nIt's not that there's no potential impact from that, it's that people suggesting this is a retail apocalypse or a market event on its own are VASTLY overstating the impact of this.\n\n**---------- If you ask yourself no other question, ask yourself this: Was the economy capable of growth and were margins fine with these payments being made when incomes were dramatically lower and unemployment higher prior to the pandemic?**\n\nYes, yes it was. This is not the great strain on spending and liquidity that people think it is. It's not immaterial to individuals. I'd like to see something done to reduce the burden, but it's also not a black swan event.\n\nNow I do think we will see an impact from credit tightening and the Fed's actions down the road, so I do expect a pullback, but the evidence that it will significantly come from student loan payment starts is possibly the thinnest soup of them all. Not that it will stop people from claiming that it was student loan payments if credit tightening impacts spending... but credit tightening is unquestionably the superior force. (Having said that, I also think people are likely overestimating the impact of that as well unless there's a major banking crisis that simply goes without any reaction... which is unlikely at this point.)\n\nI'm just saying it's probably not a great bet to expect a big impact from student loan payments restarting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\* [https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-student-loan-debt-statistics/#:\\~:text=Federal%20student%20loan%20payments%20have,by%20the%20end%20of%202021](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-student-loan-debt-statistics/#:~:text=Federal%20student%20loan%20payments%20have,by%20the%20end%20of%202021).\n\nHope you feel better.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the reasoned response.
