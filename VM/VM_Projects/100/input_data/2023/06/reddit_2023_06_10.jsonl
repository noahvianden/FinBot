If you could lower your vol . and limit drawdown while keeping same returns , then yes you are champ.

In short if you believe i put in 10k today and would not mind it going 5k tomorrow or 20k in two months to fall back again to 7k in three months. You might give it a try. \n\nIt you are not sure what i am talking about then this is not for you , but you still wanna a piece of it. I would suggest try 3x leverage etf of SPY ( or may be spx) indices if you like that move in your pnl or not.\n\nAs a bonus, if you sell ATM put at DTE 21 with same exit options as above , you make even more money .

Firstly you must know that your stock moves in a random walk with brownian motion which is complicated jargon for the stock is moving randomly I.e there‚Äôs a maximum level of manipulation that will hardly effect the price of a equity in the long run.\n\nNow you can start to analyse the Greeks of the option to see if it‚Äôs worth buying and at what strikes/expirations. 85-90% of all options expire worthless and the ones that don‚Äôt rarely come after a large spike in IV. So you can gauge IVR to sell puts as you know it‚Äôs unlikely the stock will move drastically downwards again assuming the stock is in a Brownian motion. Additionally you can do the opposite(I don‚Äôt have the stats) but because you know that real volatility<implied volatility 90% of the time. When IV has dipped below a given average for long enough it would be probably to assume that IV will inflate over the next few months. I don‚Äôt do this too often unless it‚Äôs with calendars so I can‚Äôt say how profitable it is. The usual rate is IVR<25 with short strikes at the expected move with 45DTE and long option at the same strike with 90 DTE.\n\nAnother factor is expected return over multiple trades. If you have a massively negative expected return you can expect to lose money on that option in the long run. If they‚Äôre pretty much equal then you can assume you‚Äôre fine in undefined trades maybe not so much in defined risk trades.\n\nAnother factor is put/call parity. Sometimes you‚Äôll make more money doing a ATM CC than a ATM CSP because the difference ind means for calls and puts. These two positions are the same thing btw. 100 shares and 2 short calls is equivalent to a straddle etc.\n\nThere‚Äôs so many tiny things to account for.

The stocks net assets alone are worth $41 per share with a pretty good diluted eps. On top of all that it‚Äôs dividend is about 8-9% with a low payout ratio. This stock is on a down trend but it‚Äôs a no brainier purchase. If the stock decided to close tomorrow and sold everything you‚Äôd still make $9 profit per share. Rather than risk your money in a bank or government bond paying out maybe 0.5-5% why not invest in a growing tobacco stock that‚Äôs increasing its dividend and is so undervalued that it‚Äôs a joke. If it continues to go down you‚Äôre just able to buy more shares with your dividends that will pay out a larger return. It‚Äôs too illiquid to trade options on in my opinion.\n\nSilver in my opinion is also one of the best purchases you could make right now so do your research on silver miners or better yet other metal miners as silver is often found as a by product of finding other metals. There‚Äôs so much value to buy and trade on. Selling puts in high IVR environments is good or broken wing butterflies too whilst PM‚Äôs are range bound.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre able to save maybe 100K in stocks you‚Äôll be able to get 50K loan out for a down deposit on a home. If you‚Äôre savvy when it comes to real estate/finance you could get maybe 2 homes out of it. Effectively turning 100K of stock into 400K in rental property and 100K in stock. This will yield about $8,000 per year in profit from the real estate and about $1,500-9,000 in stock. It‚Äôs a good starting point. This would be ideal as when rates are high, rent is high assuming the money supply hasn‚Äôt fallen so drastically that it‚Äôs pushed prices down pretty far and you‚Äôll be anticipating rate reversion and housing+stocks to appreciate.\n\nWith all that said do not leverage up without the knowledge/financial literacy or help from  accountants and lawyers.

The brutal stretch coincided with the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to their highest level in more than a decade, hitting growth-focused tech firms, which are thought to be more sensitive than their peers to the sharp rise in borrowing costs. The Nasdaq is up some 15% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P. Smaller cap stocks, on the other hand, have struggled.

Now, inflation is cooling down, employment remains high, and labor shortage (although very much a thing) is in a much better place than what it was a year or so ago. In addition to that, the Fed will pretty soon once again be able lower rates without fear of high inflation which is an important tool in fighting the risk of any future recessions.\n\nI personally don‚Äôt think institutions are trying to really screw over retail investors, I think this is all a result of groupthink in the financial services industry. If everyone thinks a recession is happening, professionals will echo that same sentiment, sometimes even if they personally don‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs better to go with the grain rather than against it because if you‚Äôre wrong it‚Äôs a lot easier to explain to regulators why you guided your clients in the wrong direction, because everyone else thought it was going to happen.\n\nSure, retail traders as a collective have quite a bit of money, but it‚Äôs a drop in the bucket compared to what the institutions have.

The AI investor does not have a lot of places to go, NVDA is already thru the f***ing roof, and the markets are anxious for some more of the AI piece of the pie. Many AI stocks are purely meme stocks. Tesla is extremely underpriced if they happen to put out a fully autonomous vehicle by the end of the year / first quarter of 2024. They are not a simple EV car manufacturer, They have robotics, AI, software, they have more user data than any other car company..: Elon owns other tech companies that could massively benefit Tesla products and services in the future. I would never buy stocks of a car company in 2023 but Tesla is not just a car company. Just my opinion, but I think tesla at least is worth what NVDA is worth right now at around 432, my bet is Tesla is going to reach 300 very fast like in 2 weeks, and it will be worth at least 350 by the end of this year.
