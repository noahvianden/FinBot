One of the study’s researchers, Michael Dinerstein, said “never delinquent” borrowers tend to have high credit scores, and that their credit scores hardly budged in response to the debt moratorium even though they ended up taking out much more debt than before.\n\n> “We speculate that the interaction is that borrowers take out more debt when they have cash on hand because they now find it easier to either post a down payment or to cover the first few months of payments,” Dinerstein said.\n\n> This finding was surprising, Dinerstein said, because he expected borrowers to save the extra cash they would have from not making student loan payments. Additionally, going into this study, Dinerstein said he expected that the student loan repayment moratorium would give borrowers the chance to avoid defaults on other debt.

My fear was that we would be left in a situation where rates would suddenly become ultra restrictive MoM while the Fed felt unable to ease with YoY inflation still at sky high levels. But this isn't just hasn't played out. YoY inflation is still high, but it's significantly lower today. And economic activity, while slowing, has mostly been holding up.\n\nTowards the end of 2022 people were legitimately losing their minds about inflation. Even if the economy had weakened back then Powell could have easily have invoked Volcker and kept rates high, triggering a hard landing. But today I actually think Powell has room to cut if we saw the kind of weakening you fear we might.\n\nYou can ask \"what if?\", but at the end of the day there's no strong evidence that a rapid recession is imminent. The kind of drops in economic activity you're talking about generally require unanticipated shocks, and while that could happen, I don't see a reason to bet on it. I think it's more likely the economy will continue to slow and we'll have a shallow recession either later this year or early next. During which the Fed will be cutting rates and the market will already be making new all time highs.\n\nBut who knows man. What concerns me if anything is how bad things like outside of the US. UK data looks awful, Germany is in a recession, China's growth is weak... Things have moved on a lot over the last couple of decades.

If you want to change your stance to the latter, which point is your reference to compare to?\n\nWhat do you mean by \"Powell willing to be soft on inflation target for a couple of years\". If you're interpreting his claim that core PCE won't get down to 2% for a few years, they have always said that in their economic projection. In Sept 2022, which I'm guessing was the peak fear, the FOMC projection for core PCE by end of 2025 is 2.1%, and peak Fed fund rate by end of 2023 at 4.6%. Now core PCE by end of 2025 is 2.2%, and peak Fed fund rate by end of 2023 at 5.6%.\n\nThe economy is taking the rate hike well so far because there hasn't been enough time for the lags yet, Powell said this just as much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSavings haven't dried up, so why would economic activities drop? Savings is projected to run out by Q4 2023, according to SF Fed. Note that this is consistent with the Fed's staff projection of mild recession towards later this year. I'd say we are at the undetermined stage for recession, not recession canceled.\n\nPowell doesn't have room to cut now even if the recession happened. Fed Goolsbee mentioned that playbook in one of his interview, and Fed Bostic immediately disagreed with that statement, and they are both biggest doves who think the Fed should pause right now. If a recession started, what would likely happen is the Fed waiting too long to confirm it's a more severe recession and not a \"mild\" one, and they wait too long before cutting (quite frankly, I think they are okay with a \"mild recession\" if that's the cost to bring inflation down to 2%). Claudia Sahm basically outlined this below, and she is a dove as well. Understand that Arthur Burns cut rates at least 3 months AFTER recession started in 1970s and inflation nosedived, although did not reach their target. And even then, that was considered premature. The fact that people are still saying they will pivot quickly if the economy enters a mild recession, shows that people aren't really prepared for the scenario of higher rates for longer, and their debts might take a hit when they realize it.\n\n[https://stayathomemacro.substack.com/p/the-fed-will-not-pivot](https://stayathomemacro.substack.com/p/the-fed-will-not-pivot)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe kind of recession I talked about does not require any huge shock, and can be found in shallow/mild recessions too. You can go look at nonfarm payroll before any mild recession in history and observe it. You will see that nonfarm payroll is a lagging indicator, subjected to huge revisions 2 months later. 1970 and 2001 mild recessions are examples (I'm only using mild recession since I figured you want a more similar comparison). When the economy is weak, any minor shock can topple it over, like riding a bike at extremely slow speed. They're all \"unanticipated\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find it weird that you're concerned about Germany's recession when it was \"anticipated\" in summer 2022 and people were yelling recession canceled early this year, only to find out it's been in recession while they were yelling recession canceled.

I doubt that VW understands their customers - they didn't in the past which explains the mess they are in and they don't understand what is happening in SA, Africa, and the developing countries too. e-fuels or biofuels do not reduce carbon emissions and are nothing else than a strategy to confuse customers. Although I welcome the fact that BEVs are being offered in South America, it is completely out of the question that VW wants to sell hybrids and vehicles with so-called biofuels, which promote the acceleration of deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and shows that VW management has not recognized the signs of the times. Not to mention VW will continue to sell ICE vehicles in SA as long as customers ask for it.

Therefore I have to react to price action, which is the language of the market, same with trends. \n\nI am not open minded to scapegoats or anything that lets me not take responsibility for my own financial actions. If I want to place a trade because I believe Nvidia should be around half of what the current price is, I would wait for a time where other players would also like to see a retest of the low. The market can tell me this in many different ways, such as, price going down, trends, MAs, whatever tools I may use. \n\nI believe claiming manipulation can be a way to avoid the pain of being wrong, when in reality, being wrong is only painful if you cannot cut the position or lose more than your risk tolerance. \n\nIt's one thing to have a discussion on market manipulation, and where it may occur, such as penny stocks or ADRs, but believing that Nvidia, at $1T valuation is manipulated is wrong. It sure as hell may be extended, and it may not make sense, but that company is a beast and a lot of people buying in times like these are the long term players. Other players will have a turn too, it just takes time for the market to see where price should go (price discovery)\n\nI'm also not arguing with you, and this can be a productive conversation, if you let it.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

The overall markets are in the beginning stages of a bull run , putting puts on apple right now is a death sentence unless your trying to take some profits from making puts on pull back. Let’s run some simple fibs. 198 is the first potential pull back area 218 is the second but even then you can look at the strong candle of buying volume eating up sells, it’s dangerous to take puts now especially if you don’t have an edge that gives you the insight to see selling volume overtaking buyers volume. The time to sell the markets was 2022 , the bulls are out now\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pu4kvrz5r99b1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0b0274ac2cc20873795e99965ef8604a2436e947", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "There aren't even any arrows in that chart.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I like my charts as naked as possible", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "ur gonna get cucked. go ahead, short apple 🤣", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good call", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "30 p/e still cheap for a tech stock.
