{"title": "Netflix subscriptions rise as password-sharing crackdown takes effect", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/09/netflix-subscriptions-rise-password-sharing-crackdown.html\n\nThe Netflix crackdown on password sharing is in its early days in the U.S., but it appears to be having the effect the streamer was looking for ‚Äì a boost to its subscriber base. Since alerting its members in late May of its new password sharing policy, Netflix had its four single largest days of signing up U.S. customers since data provider Antenna began tracking the service. In that time, Netflix has seen nearly 100,000 daily signups on two of the days, according to the report from Antenna.\n\nOn May 23, Netflix began sending out emails to members that it was changing its sharing guidelines, namely that accounts were only to be shared within the same household. ‚ÄúYour Netflix account is for you and the people you live with ‚Äî your household,‚Äù the company said in an email that has been sent to members since then. As part of the new policy, members have two options for the people using their passwords outside of their household. Either transfer the profile to the person outside of their household so the person can begin a new membership that they pay for on their own, or the member pays an extra fee of $7.99 a month per person outside of their household.\n\nSince the email began rolling out, average daily signups to Netflix reached 73,000, a 102% increase from the prior 60-day average, which surpassed the spike in sign-ups during the initial lockdowns of the pandemic, according to Antenna. While Netflix‚Äôs stock took a hit after reporting its first subscriber loss in a decade last year, it has been rebounding since then with the introduction of password-sharing guidelines and ad-supported streaming. Its stock hit a 52-week high on Friday, and is up more than 40% year-to-date.", "id": "146z141", "created_utc": 1686502788.0, "score": 1033, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 440, "comments": [{"body": "Kind of off-topic but I love this market fact: Netflix and Paramount have roughly same revenue, roughly same profitability, roughly same recent revenue growth... yet Netflix market cap is 17x Paramount market cap.", "score": 1043, "replies": [{"body": "It‚Äôs the ‚ÄúNetflix n Chill‚Äù premium that you pay for.", "score": 499, "replies": [{"body": "Paramount and pullout?", "score": 424, "replies": [{"body": "Hulu and snu snu", "score": 175, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "~~HBO~~ Max and Climax", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Disney and frisky", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Rolls right off the tongue", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Lmfao", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Damn I‚Äôm trying so hard not to laugh in the gym right now! ü§£ü§£", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "ESPN and stick it in.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "HBO and pound dat ho", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Amazon prime - For places where sun never shines!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "love it ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If you are rhyming puss with plus...

There is definitely validity in that approach but I also valued having a paid off rental house in case the market turns, I lose my job, the house sits empty for a bit, etc. My line of thinking was‚Ä¶with a paid off rental, I can cut my asking price for rent significantly if I need to in order to get someone in ASAP. \n\nAgain, I‚Äôm not giving you financial advice.

The overall economic situation in California and around the world has also hampered buying from local reclaimers. PRCC wants to caution suppliers when buying from their customers; PET markets are unstable.\n\nA packaging company is, for example, Coca Cola? A supplier is someone who purchases shredded PET? Who buys from their customers - I def don't understand that?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is a complicated question. I'll do my best to answer it in a simple way\n\nThe article you read is specifically talking about California. California is the largest producer of recyclable PET plastic in the world. If you look at a plastic bottle in your fridge it is stamped with CRV or California Cash Refund. When a person buys a bottle from the store they pay a tax which is then held in a state fund. If a person wants to redeem that tax they can go to a recycling center, recycle their bottles and get their tax back plus a small scrap value for their material. The recycling center loans the consumer their tax money and when the recycling center sells the plastic to a reclaimer they bill the State of California for the tax money they laid out to the consumer. They recycling center purely works off of the scrap value of the plastic. If the recycling center is small and does not have machinery to bale the plastic, loose material gets sent to a larger facility similar to ours where the larger facility makes a mark up on the scrap value. For example if the Scrap price for PET was 15 cents per lb I would purchase the loose material from recycling center X for 9 cents lb, run it through my machinery and sell it  to a reclaimer for 15 cents per lb. I the larger recycling center needs to be cautious about the scrap price I am willing to pay my supplier (the smaller recycling center) because if the price does not hold I'm screwed.\n\nIf you are not in California or do not care about redeeming your bottle deposit your bottle goes into the trash and is handled by your trash company. Most likely your trash company has a MRF. A MRF is a facility that has optical sorters that separate trash from recyclable commodities.  The recyclable commodity is then baled and sent to a reclaimer. The trash company makes money by selling the scrap material. The trash company is the supplier in this sense. The trash company is protected from falling scrap prices because they do not pay for the material. Whatever they make on recycled material is an added bonus for them. When commodity prices are up they are ballin. When they are down it doesnt matter because you pay them to haul it away.\n\nReclaimers set the price based off of demand. The largest reclaimers are Coca cola and mohawk carpets. If you are a smaller CPG company or product maker who doesnt have your own refiners you purchase from a 3rd party refinery like CarbonLite (check them out on Youtube, very cool facility) When they are selling lots of product like soda bottles or carpet they need to acquire large quantities of plastic the price of material goes up. Basic supply and demand.\n\nCalifornia is one of the largest economies in the world. Like it or not, what occurs here is felt throughout the economy. California weather has been very weird we are currently sitting in mid June and have not seen the sun or had a day above 70 in months. When its not hot out people don't drink bottled beverages. Consumer Package goods companies cut production and the prices of raw materials goes down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCarpet fibers were booming during the years of low interest rates, everyone was buying houses. People were building things like crazy. A lot of carpet was created. This has slowed so mohawk has cut back on the Pet they are purchasing for carpets. This affects the price of plastic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [(250) CarbonLite: Inside the World's Largest Plastic Bottle Recycling Plant | SoCal Connected | KCET - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAr4BZM_Tzk&t=216s) \n\n\\^This is an example of a reclaimer.

Not businesses. People. And If people are working, they are spending.\n\n1. Whether it's directly related to working: Buying a car, insurance, gas, lunch downtown, new clothes, etc., or\n2. Indirectly - Just buying stuff that you couldn't before because you didn't have money - Ex. Tinder Gold sub, drinks for \"independent\" bitches who can never find their wallet, etc.\n\n**STUDENT LOANS** = This one is unique to our current situation. I've tried explaining this to people but it's hard to properly quantify how much it is affecting consumption.\n\nFor 3 years now, approx 98% (see below) of all student loan borrowers have paid ZERO towards their loans. The interest is being deferred - Welfare is important, and it's not just for Corporations! Let me put it in Stonk talk - That's an insane amount of Free Cash Flow that did not exist prior to Covid rescue act.\n\n**Anecdotal example**: My GF has $450,000 in student loans - (Wellesley Undergrad, and then Columbia for a Masters in Epidemiology and her Medical Degree, and finally a fellowship in Pediatric Gastroenterology at Albert Einstein college of medicine = I added this info to avoid 100 responses telling me my GF is an idiot and spent too much money and is probably trying to get a job as an influencer at Tok-Tik)\n\nHer loan payment (at a very low interest rate) was still around $4,500 a month. If she had decided to join the 90% of borrowers who stopped paying, she would have added an extra $55,000 a year in after-tax disposable income. That is a lot of goddamn money. I know my GF is a high $ example, but it's not as rare as you think.\n\nThere are two classes of borrowers - The people who would literally end up with zero debt, if $20,000 were forgiven.\n\nAnd then the second class, the ones who gleefully borrowed 100K a year, because they were promised that upon graduation, they would quickly outdistance their non-college degree counterparts. (Random rant - that shit made sense when college tuition was 5k a year. With tuition at 50k plus, the math is a complete fucking failure, but they won't put out any new studies to tell you so).\n\nConclusion: When student loans actually restart (not when they claim the loans will restart) ADD 90 days for the effects to trickle through to spending and earnings - and that's your collapse.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pirlsdb3jg5b1.png?width=1267&format=png&auto=webp&s=148fb17d61e9ba414a119e751afa4395542af6c6\n\n[United States Private Consumption: % of GDP - CEIC CEIC Data https://www.ceicdata.com ‚Ä∫ ... ‚Ä∫ United States](https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/united-states/private-consumption--of-nominal-gdp#:~:text=United%20States%20Private%20Consumption%20accounted,an%20average%20share%20of%2063.3%20%25.)", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "$4500 a month???", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "yeah, man.

They're now down below forward looking pressure necessary to cause significant inflation, below the high watermark for real wage growth that has historically been present during 2% inflation (which is about 5% real wage growth... people don't spend their money at increase linearity, how they spend depends a lot on the debt cycle and you have to account for forward inflation... if inflation is 5% and wage increases are 5%, for instance, you don't have 5% extra pressure on prices, you have price equilibrium - i.e. no inflationary pressure from wages even as spending and demand stays high, but that also depends on adjusting for supply pressure to find the real inflationary pressure).\n\nThis is the cycle that's confounded everyone. Everyone's using the wrong model for economic cyclicality here because we're mapping economic patterns from changes of capital regime or standard consumer cycles to a pandemic cycle where 45% of M2 was pulled forward and where consumer demand requirements (and access to capital) are entirely unlike any prior economic cycle for which we have good data.\n\nThe last similar cycle was the Spanish Flu, and we honestly do not have great data relating to human economic patterns... but what we do have supports all of the above and the result was 10 years of expansion. You have a similar story relatively (relatively lol) well documented with the Black Plague in Europe and that caused an extended period of prosperity once it resolved. It also probably was the last straw and toppled Feudalism as an economic organizational system.\n\nPeople will now say \"Ah-hah! But then came the Great Depression!\" which...

Now I am starting to wonder", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks! \n\nSo how I've responded to the change in pattern is that I've cut my hedges in half. For much of last year, I was running  neutral or net short, but because the run is extended I'm leaving a hedge on because of the potential for financial risk (in the near term, the Fed can absolutely break something... and did... but just because banks like SVB went down doesn't mean that the rest of the system has to) and also running about 50% cash/bonds. \n\nSPY 430 was kind of my stick in the sand regarding the breaking of the downtrend. The break of 420 was significant on the chart, but the 430 break, if it holds (we need probably past the Fed meeting to have greater confidence), is following a chart technical pattern that suggests SPY 475 by the end of the year if we're lucky.\n\nLong term patterns like that are a little more uncertain than short term plays, so don't take that 475 to the bank, per-se... news can and does upend these patterns. It's just a target to look to for establishing expectation of market behavior for a continuing thesis. \n\nSo there's still risk, I'm cognizant of that, but I don't fight the tape, and the tape is saying \"Net long.\"\n\nI have the cash in each account to be liquid. I have bond offsets for hedging. I have SPXU/SQQQ at 50% as a hedge (if it drops, this protects the position, and I'll know if it's dropping outside of the pattern before we get a significant decline). I'm toying with dropping the inverse hedge entirely.\n\nBy \"running 50%\" I mean that I'm buying SPXU at 50% cover for my long position. For instance, if you have $900 of SPY, $150 of SPXU covers is. As it's 3x the leverage, you need 3x less money for neutral cover. This way, I pocket gains, but if the market drops, SPXU will pick up the difference, and I'm only spending - in this example - $150 to get that cover. If the market goes, I gain more from the long position and I've risked very little to cover. If the market goes down, then the hedge will have saved me losses.\n\nI leave about 5-10% of my gambling account for options plays, and I use this when I have a greater confidence degree of a movement.\n\nThe real question is: How much are you willing to lose? \n\nThe answer to that question can help you build a position, determine your acceptable volatility, and help control emotions given the random walk of the market. Once you have the answer to that question, then you can start deciding on positioning strategy. The more tolerance for risk, the less the hedge should be. \n\nAnd if you're accumulating stock to accumulate stock, then you should just keep a stable flow of capital into those stocks. Not popular around here, but accumulating's solid in these situations. Though given that cash is currently earning around 4-5%, it's honestly not a bad hedge in and of itself to protect a long position.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Do you think the likelihood of another large leg down is going down as time passes?

You can start to see the difference in positioning in monthly OpEx behavior.\n\nBoth before and after the 2022 decline, the pattern on OpEx was to trade down to adjust to the lower center of gravity in institutional positioning. The past few, the tendency has to been to trade up into the higher range, and this suggests that delta for their portfolios is higher than the market. \n\nIn other words, we have a pile-on, and even if that pile-on is largely driven short cover against uncertainty, the change in positioning will result in a tendency to snowball barring any big news events.\n\n \n\n>On any timeframe not short not long but do you see a large downturn right around the corner?\n\nThe biggest risk is the banks and the Fed... not rate hikes, barring a surprise hike of multiple percent, or a continuation into indefinite periods, the Fed's job is largely considered done, which moves the risk-free rate of return to a knowable position, which helps drive flows to the stock market. \n\nCorporate Real Estate might be a shoe to drop, as that has highly inflated valuations, but it's also known to be a bit risky and highly hedged. There's also the fact that the extended valuations don't necessarily reflect real debt obligations.\n\nPeople are pointing to student loan payments returning as a weight on the consumer, and sure... it is... but the market valuation is not really being driven right now by consumer spending patterns but more capital availability. All of the current runners are really companies that are relying on corporate CapEx, like NVDA and their Grace Hopper platform, and consumer spending is not going to impact that forward investment the way that people think it will, especially after several years of high return market gains. \n\nBasically, barring an unforeseeable catastrophe, which with a historically aggressive Fed Fund hiking cycle is not impossible, any significant crash thesis will likely be short-lived, if it happens at all... and right now... look what happened to banks after SVB: The Fed came out with its bond parking facility and everything calmed down, because that was a good solution.\n\nThere are some other theories, like the idea that the Treasury will flood the market with bonds, but those theories largely trade on Big Number Fear, and not an understanding of these markets. Excess bonds might put some pressure on the market, but higher yield bonds are also a porfolio hedge offset for institutions. They offset the higher cost of capital and risk asset loss potential.\n\n \n\n>After they start lowering rates sometime in 2024 do you think the economy should be rolling good in 2026 in terms of high stock prices? \n\nBarring a geopolitical catastrophe, which is extremely rare, yes.

Fed floods money into banks to offset risk from defaults on credit/housing.\n2. Fed buys bonds and drops rates to increase liquidity and promote credit.\n3. Credit holds on consumers, but expands on collateralized obligations (stock margin, houses, etc)\n4. Economy comes back, consumer risk comes off, but debt generation stays mostly at benchmark rate prior to the pandemic (this is a key, the banks DID NOT increase consumer credit significantly).\n5. The Fed starts to hike rates in the beginning of 2022, and the market sells off.\n\nThe key thing to understand here is that banks didn't just dump all of that money into the market, they held onto most of it because it served an important purpose in offsetting risk, and risk departments aren't just going to let it out because they know the Fed is going to come and ask for it back.\n\nNow why did the market go up to match increase in M2, more or less, if there's not a direct correlation?\n\nBecause the lower percentage still increased addressable capital in the market and put pressure on stocks that were, in Q2 2020, selling off, resulting in pressure on the float. See, the prices are based on the amount of shares available and relative directionality of pricing and transaction pressure, so increased buying had an outsized impact on pressure. This ran the market up even with banks holding most of the capital.\n\nThe same thing happened on the way down, with added selling reducing P/E multiples across the board, resulting in most stock supply increasing, resulting in more price pullback.\n\nNow we're trying to find equilibrium. If the Fed continues at this rate, the sell-off may have already happened and the market can just keep grinding higher until we find equilibrium... so that's below 480, right?\n\nProbably not. All of the money pulled out when institutions sold through 2022 is largely weighted at the top, so that money's all out there already... the Fed is fighting over what percentage of undeployed bank reserves can be deployed... when equilibrium hits on inflation (we're over 60% of the way there) then the next question is about when banks start releasing more capital to deploy.\n\nThen it's about the risk-free rate of return against forward expectations of return in the market. 5-6% is high in the nearterm, but historically with that rate the market has still expanded, and those bond and risk-free offsets negate the higher interest rate and cost of capital.\n\nSo either we grind higher and everything's fine, or we have a larger economic problem and then we crash out, unemployment shoots up, the Fed steps in and increases the balance sheet (which they do every time this happens) and then we shoot up again.\n\nEither way, we're going up... this thesis where the Fed just crashes all prices on all assets without growing longterm capital that bears have is a fever dream. The Fed's definitely not saying they're going to do that, so it's really about finding equilibrium for banks to deploy the excess capital.\n\nAnd anyone entertaining the thought that the Fed wouldn't step into a liquidity crisis should have had that thought dispelled entirely with the SVB bailout... the Fed's answer was literally to step in and increase liquidity.

The Fed expanding M2, which I do account for in my post above, didn't change the fact that people largely didn't travel during 2020-2021 like they would have normally and that said demand would move to after the pandemic. You also have the realignment of supply chains, work requirements, etc... all of which has significant CapEx change involved, and what the Fed pulling forward M2 has done is basically finance these changes and demand cycles, which will continue because the Fed is not going to pull out all of the M2 expansion (it never does and its reports say that it's not going to) and that a lot of the money that's pulled forward is staying in the system, which it should because the system expands capital over time as designed anyway.\n\nSo the Fed is not the great despoiler of human patterns people on here assume it to be because they've spent half their lives on economically illiterate Libertarian forums... and all of those people said the post-pandemic market was dead in 2021/2022 anyway and its still going (as evidenced by increased travel in this cycle period and other demand wobble still running from that timeframe), so we can throw their opinions right out.\n\nAlso it wasn't really an in-depth comparison, anyway, and I said the data was imperfect... so totally not sure what you're criticizing here, though you may be hyper-focused on that because even with that little minimal analysis, it's still sadly more analysis than you typically get on WSB.\n\nBelieve me, if I were doing a real economic comparison trying to map the Spanish Flu capitally on top of today, like you're suggesting, you'd know it.

The stimulus during the recession was so incredibly massive and with the current inflation levels, the interest rate policy is still in expansive territory. Monetary policy comes with long and variable lags. Poor people feel the inflation in the shops but since they still have jobs, they're not defaulting. They just reallocate their spending. That doesn't affect assets, because poor people are not that important to asset prices anyway because they don't own anything.\n\nThe stimulus which is still ongoing was designed to inflate the value of assets. Rich people and the upper middle-class own the assets, and benefitted from the stimulus directly. These people still have their jobs, and the'y re just not saving as much. They still have lots of the money the FED and the ECV has handed to them. \n\nThe problem now is that as interest rate go up, the lower half the population is suffering due to high asset prices, and the other half is benefitting from high assets prices, in an environment of continuous asset price stimulation by the FED. A recession will come once the asset price stimulus ends. The stimulus ends approximately when the markets expect that the the market clearing interest rate will be higher than expected inflation. That won't happen, because the FED is the government, and the government looks out for the economic interested of the middle-ages upper middle-class, because that is the bureaucrat demographic. Rate hikes will end if asset prices fall. The plan is to let lower income households reduce spending to bring down inflation, but without affecting asset prices. \n\nNothing has changed.  Don't bet against the FED. \n\nThe playbook is still to have lots of debt, own lots of real-estate and have tenants to pay the bank instead of yourself.  More generally, the strategy should be to to insulate yourself against negative effect of government intervention in the markets.

I can't say if the net jobs lost/gained will be positive or negative, but 300 million jobs totally changed, enhanced, or degraded by LLMs is very conservative.\n\nThe legal field will be one of the first to change. Just because some idiot asked chatGPT (a model trained for very general purposes, with no guarantee that any legal code or case law are even in the training set) about legal stuff and blindly trusted it means exactly nothing. I know of at least one company currently building an attributive LLM, ie a model trained on general purpose language, and then provide sources either from it's training set or database that support what it says. Imagine a legal assistant that can take a verbal description of a case or any situation, and spit out advice and information, for any jurisdiction, footnoted perfectly with sections of the law, relevant cases, sections of the contract being disputed, whatever helps make the case. Imagine this legal assistant can do this for any legal question every 5 seconds. \n\nThe job of lawyer is unlikely to disappear any time soon, but it will allow each lawyer to do 10 times the amount of work they did previously, at least. If the demand for legal services doesn't rise at the same pace as the cost to provide services tanks, many of the jobs will disappear and the wealth will concentrate upward to the few, lucky lawyers still operating with the help of LLMs.\n\nThat is just one example. Slight modifications and wrappers around the engine that is LLM technology will soon popup specialized to a variety of fields. What is possible with the technology we have even today, with no further advancements, will only be known when people start putting different components together in creative ways, but is obviously great.\n\nThat being said, it is difficult to know which company will strike the first huge success here and become the next Google of LLMs. It is possible that company has not even been founded yet, and likely they aren't available for the public to invest in.

The m1 chip came out in 2020 at 5nm. In 2020, intel was primarily fabbing 13nm chips. They are getting smoked. They had 10 nm chips out, but they were struggling with getting quality bins and had to reduce capacity expectations. Then they did the rebranding of 13nm tech to intel 10 and 10nm to intel 7.
