{"title": "Tesla Stock booms with $32,000 starting price for model 3 after tax credit", "selftext": "All of the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 vehicle trims are now eligible for the full tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Internal Revenue Service verified Tuesday. While it remains unclear how the global EV giant accomplished the feat, the Model 3 now has a starting price of around $32,000. TSLA stock jumped Wednesday.\n\n**Tesla stock advanced 1.6% to 224.83 Wednesday during market trade with Tesla Model 3 vehicles going for as low as $30,330 on the company's website.** \n\nTesla is officially saying the Model 3 starts at $32,740 after the $7,500 IRA tax credit. Meanwhile, reports circulated early Wednesday that Tesla has agreed in principle with a plan to set up a manufacturing plant in India. Tesla's website recently stated that the base Model 3 vehicle was eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit under the IRA. The model previously only qualified at the $3,750 level. Tesla has not disclosed how it brought the Model 3 into alignment with IRA requirements for the full tax credit. Meanwhile, the IRS made the official change to its site Tuesday morning. It announced all Model 3 and Model Y vehicles qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.\n\n# Model 3 Tax Credit Doubles\n\nThe Biden administration said on March 31 that vehicles eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit must have batteries with specific quantities of components manufactured in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S. or from certain countries.\n\nVehicles that meet only one of the critical minerals or battery components requirements are eligible for a $3,750 tax credit. At the time, the base rear-wheel-drive Model 3, with its battery from China, did not qualify for the full tax credit. \n\n**Tesla stock shrugged off early losses and climbed 1.7% to 221.31 Tuesday. It turned higher just after the IRS confirmed the Model 3 eligibility. TSLA has gained in the past seven sessions. It has gained 117% since early January lows of 101.81.**\n\n# The Eligibility Switch\n\nLate Monday, Morgan Stanley Adam Jonas wrote the qualification change \"implies that Tesla likely tweaked its supply chain to meet both requirements.\n\n\"Tesla has used lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from China's CATL for the base Model 3. CATL commented Monday that rumors Tesla has ended their relationship are untrue and there is no change in the strategic partnership. \n\nJonas told investors Tesla may have switched to manufacturing Model 3 battery packs in the U.S. while still using China-made battery cells. The analysts also floated the idea that, with Shanghai Tesla exporting to Canada, it could be freeing up U.S. battery production for local deliveries. \n\nOr, Jonas said, it simply could be \"regulatory semantics.\" Under guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury, EV manufacturers can average the qualifying critical mineral content used over a limited period of time. Jonas said this language means Tesla could produce enough qualifying Model 3 batteries at its Fremont plant to offset the Model 3 rear-wheel drive trim's China-made battery.", "id": "1442ca8", "created_utc": 1686208949.0, "score": 465, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 376, "comments": [{"body": "1.6% is a \"boom\" now?", "score": 357, "replies": [{"body": "Overheard  by a bear in WSB:\n\n“He got me,” said the Bear. \"That f***ing Elon boomed me.\"\n\nThe Bear added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times.\n\nThe Bear then said he wanted to add Tesla to the list of companies he gambles on next week.", "score": 114, "replies": [{"body": "r/NBA leaking, i love it", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "Haha I was like wait I’m in r/stocks", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Cathy Wood yelled \"There you go!\" Grimes gave a look of pleasant surprise.

If the share price goes past that and macro/TSLA momentum keeps up, it can go straight to 300 to that call wall.\n\nThat'll take favorable response to CPI/FOMC, record deliveries, then buy the rumor to earnings. If that happens it'll be Hertz 2.0 gamma squeeze and RSI can get even crazier to similar levels like Nov 2021.\n\nFor the cautious take, to me, this is all hype and momentum and you can definitely make a lot of money following it and riding the wave up. Just remember to secure some profit at some acceptable levels one way or another as nothing goes straight up and stays there forever unless it can justify it somehow.\n\nThe reason why I'm skeptical to maintain any crazy high level after earnings is price drops and margins. From last quarter to this one, 3RWD went from $43k to $40k (increasing inventory around me at $38k), 3P was at $54k and no inventory to increasing availability at $50k. YAWD was at $50k with no inventory and now $47k with more inventory.\n\nP/D numbers should be record high again. COGS should come down some, but likely not enough to offset the whole price cut and any potential EOQ additional discounts with the increasing inventory. The last earnings call, they expected the majority of COGS to come down second half of the year.\n\nI buy shares based off what I think the fundamentals should be, sell calls past where I think it should reasonably get in any given period of time, sell puts at levels of support/below my CC strikes to keep my delta high for cash to hold or to roll my calls higher at a debit. When needed I'll buy calls to keep my delta where I want it but in a way to keep my theta positive so I make money every day no matter what happens. This works for my personal risk tolerance and activity.\n\nAnyone that's selling calls should have a plan to manage it in situations like this where it squeezes higher. Roll to another strike higher than you're ok selling at, buy them back early, buy higher calls to limit the loss, sell puts, buy shares to hedge like MM.

Ultimately macro like cpi/fomc and any other factors like TSLA momentum can override things like max pain since basically all the calls are itm now. What happens next week and after is based on whatever current call holders do.\n\nIf call holders sell for cash profit, mm dumps the shares to pay the call profits and share price tanks. This can potentially lead to a cascade down if share price tanks below other call strikes making them increasingly worthless, leading to more shares being sold by mm and more calls being sold to secure that profit.\n\nIf call holders roll up and out to keep upwards exposure, mm will have to hold slightly less to equal shares depending on where new strikes are at due to the way delta works.\n\nThe way it gets higher is by recruiting more call buyers to ride momentum even higher forcing mm to but even more shares. This gets harder and harder as time goes on and as the premium it takes gets more and more. Sooner or later once it’s not sustainable someone is left holding the bag and big funds/mm is usually pretty good at not being the last one out (though not always… but since when is retail TSLA investors good at saying ok I’m selling everything cause it’s gone up too far too fast lol).\n\nSo tldr is that no one knows nothing and anything can happen.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "My man, we have all been there.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "May truth and justice prevail.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sweet mamba jamba!", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Should be in jail already.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "This time they're gonna get him!\n\n78th attempt and counting", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Tsla today:\n\n![gif](giphy|CZedlPSpZ6hKo|downsized)\n\nThe Classic Lounge gif returns at last", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "THERE WE GO", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "![gif](giphy|aq6Thivv9V9lu|downsized)", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/b2f5kaw4xv4b1.jpeg?width=855&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaa6ddb70c4de0a8bfd13a57929f90c05806ba08", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "dam I’d love a clean copy of this if you have a link", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "The pic of AOC?

{"title": "Fear Greed Index", "selftext": "Context:  I’m almost 60. Just something to think about. \n\nI’ve seen two Retail FOMO’s after the close today.\n\nGranted, I don’t come here often. Almost never actually. Both posts seemed remarkably naive and tender. Like don’t invest in anything exotic without an education. I think maybe “retail FOMO” might better be described as “WSB FOMO”. \n\nSomeone told them they could show up here and “print money”.\n\nThe CNNMoney Fear Greed Index (CNNFGI) hit 75 today. \n\nI’ve really just stopped by to look at the sentiment these past few days and have been astounded that people are rolling up wanting to start with options and having done **zero** homework. ChatGPT isn’t going to educate them. \n\nPersonally, I found losing money to be my best teacher and I’ve lost a lot. It doesn’t have to be that way. \n\nHow often do tenderfoots just show up and think someone can help them operate a spacecraft in one day? Is this a real thing and how has it been trending? It seems totally whacked out to me. \n\nI would love to look at newbies and their volume and value entering and exiting the market here. There will always be people entering and exiting, but living U.S. adults is a known finite number. What is the net flow for Retail relative to working Americans and relative to total market cap? Money supply is a known. That trend could print every so often. \n\nHas social media replaced humans as the teachers of the younger persons? Or, have I forgotten what it was like to be young? I actually started in options back in college or it didn’t take long anyway for me to start trading options, but I was **literally** copying a friend’s homework. Only I would move my strike prices out a c-hair past his. That pissed him off over time. But then he moved too and I was priced-out. We were good for each other, and I learned a lot from him. \n\nThe first OP has already deleted their post. I’m thinking of Warren Buffet’s fear-greed axiom chiseled into a Japanese Tsunami Stone by our ancestors.\n\nNow, we all live on the beach and pay a premium for the pleasure only to have the fabled wave come along when we think it never will and wash us all away a few times in our lifetimes, but not often enough to teach us anything. \n\nJust when I think I’m out, greed ”pulls me back in!” and rinse and repeat. I’ve lost shit pots of money in my life and also made a lot too. Six figure losses by 25 (~1991 or 92 on AAPL no less IIRCC). I was just a kid playing options on Prodigy (pre-AOL). Pershing. I still remember my account number because I traded so many times a day, back in the day. My ears rang for almost a week the first time I lost $100K.\n\nI can’t remember my kid’s birthdays reliably, but I can type my trading account mix of numbers and letters in a tenth of a second. \n\nNow I’m getting old and am having to look at a compressed horizon and reevaluate risk across my remaining years. It’s a weird place to find myself. \n\nKids all got nice college funds. Their accounts actually out performed mine because I was a little more cautious. Pissed me off. Not really. Maybe a little. They bought their first rental home together at 15 & 18. Used it all the way through college and made $167K off of their first real estate play. That’s another story. \n\nEveryone becomes a bear … … someday. Mark my words. I’m pushing 60. I lived through an entire lost decade in the 70’s and early 80’s. That shit hurts on the one hand, but I made money playing options by my mid 20’s even during the S&L Crisis. You can always make money. \n\nThis isn’t the “stonks only go up” crowd that were crowing the last time I visited. I think these are neophytes rolling up with a wad of cash to fuel the last melt up.\n\nAnd it looks like the WSB tenor now has the _voice-of-experience_ reminding others about unforeseen dildos and the predictable lack of lubricant. It’s a different WSB. Just saying. \n\nSpeaking of sayings, the saying that stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down isn’t really true for the “biggies”.\n\nFor a Biggie, there is always the Space Shuttle Columbia that appears at the last moment and returns with this final entry into the mission commanders log: “Fate: disintegrated during re-entry”.\n\nA lot of people will lose their money trying to time the event. That’s the circle of life. If I make bank in derivatives, someone else lost and vice versa. Not always true in stocks and bonds. \n\nFear and Greed fornicate every trade in the options markets. There will be greedy put sellers in the last days. Winners and losers. Nothing like it except war. It’s binary. Steel on steel. \n\nAnyway, naive retail FOMO’s rolling up gives my guh bear SPYdr Senses a woody.\n\nYou don’t get many opportunities to short the shit out the market in an entire lifetime. \n\nEvery trader dreams of The Big One!  Might be an opportunity before EoY. Maybe. \n\nOP is probably the nicest person in the world showing up 10 minutes before a lopsided game ends after paying full price for the ticket. He didn’t notice he was actually walking past all the smart people leaving before the rush. \n\nMaybe?\n\nIf I were licensed to give advice, I might recommend 5% bonds and wake up every day and watch Bloomberg and CNBC, watch ALL news channels, even (or especially) the ones that you don’t agree with and always watch the after market analysis.\n\nRead Buffet’s work. Relax and dip the toe in in small chunks so the education they will acquire losing money hand over fist won’t be quite as expensive. Read Bobbleheads and separate retirement from investments from speculation and be diligent about not needing the speculative money. Consider it dead when you put it in and divorce yourself from emotions, but be competitive about winning so you do the work. The cardinal rule is you can’t play without money. Pure speculation is pure gambling in a lopsided house. Schmucks will _”borrow”_ from retirement and investment accounts. That’s a bad idea. \n\nIf he took the advice, maybe by the time they jumped in the market might be oversold. \n\nI think the mods should graph retail FOMO for us on a weekly basis. \n\nMaybe not. WSB would probably alter market sentiment. It’s all a self-fulfilling prophecy then and it would be divorced from reality. Inversing the inverse seems to be a super power around here. When WSB gets frothy, unnatural acts are preformed on the secondary market.\n\nI have devised a WSB Idiot Trap using the 1st flair option. “WSB FOMO: How to trade options with No experience!”.\n\nBot thrashes them, points them to some resources, then auto deletes their messages. \n\nThe bot then gives us the sucker count and trends inside of subject line that literally says, “WSB subreddit traffic statistics”\n\nSetup a couple of flair traps and see if the data means anything.\n\nI like the perceived (mine) of this sub. I would love to see a data cube on WSB sentiment that could be trapped by a bot. \n\nEvery post requires [Nu, Be, Bu] for neutral, bullish, or bearish.
