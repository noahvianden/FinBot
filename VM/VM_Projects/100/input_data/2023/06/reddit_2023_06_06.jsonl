Ironically, though the rule didn't anticipate no-fee stock trading and the rise of Robinhood, PDT has kind of accidentally held the line on excessive trading frequency and market churn induced by no-fee retail traders. GME notwithstanding.\n\nSo for the SEC to lift the PDT rule, they'd have to replace it with something else that takes the modern Robinhood situation into account. Perhaps there needs to be two separate rules, one to restrict frequency for the sake of market stability and another to limit leverage risk that is independent of frequency.

They make it about the margin but your position get liquidated anyway so they are protected.  I wanted a margin account, not for the extra leverage, but to be able to trade as little or as much as I wanted (again, its my money to lose if I want as an adult).. Luckily, I was able to make it work even though I felt the PDT made it take much longer to get to 25K, but where I really see it hurting people, and where I think the REAL issue ends up being is that so many people end up \"holding\" their position much longer than they should have, praying it will bounce back in their favor BECAUSE, if they close out their position, they will have to wait TWO days for settlement to trade again, or have one less day trade on a margin account for the rolling five days.. so they hold.. and thats what ends up really blowing up their account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets all be real here, any smart trader knows they need to be disciplined and cut losses immediately if the trade doesn't go their way (and we know from stats that a good trader hits at approx 70% accuracy, on average), meaning 30% of the time, the trade needs to get cut and cut fast.. and here where the problem is with PDT.  If you have 2K in your account as a new trader, its really hard to grow your account unless you are using most or all the 2K to trade.. so, if you have to cut the trade, its now 2 more days until you can trade again while you wait to settle.. which is is the reason most new traders HOLD their trades, and end up bag holding and then eventually cutting it anyway.  Imagine if you can cut the trade quickly, saying you lost $5-$20 on the 2K because the trade hit your stop loss as an example, you shouldn't have to wait two days or only be able to do this 3 times per week for being smart and making the right decision, which is where traders feel like they are getting punished with the PDT rule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, if it helps, I took a different road..  I made a promise to myself that I would use a cash account (I only had $4000 when I first started, to invest), and my promise was that I would wait for what I believed from all my studying, was an A+ set up, and I would punch half (2K) on a trade.. and no matter what happened, win or lose that day, I would not trade again until the following day, where I would use my other 2K, IF I SAW an A+ setup..  this made it to where I could trade every single day at least as I grew my account.  The rest of the time, I would paper trade but I would only trade it as if it were my real money, on one of my two A+ setups, as the day went on.. ( I also had a completely different broker that I used to paper trade any other strategy that I was trying to learn and play around with but my main account and my main paper trading account were always kept sacred to me and taken with the utmost seriousness. and lastly, I took on some side hustles, doing whatever I could to make extra money and I would take that extra money and always put it right in my main account to grow the total account balance..  with my winning trades, with cutting my losses quickly, and with adding whatever I could top my main account, I was finally able to get to 25K and the rest is history.

If this attack on reputable exchanges continues it will only make sense for the most dodgy foreign exchanges to continue to operate in this space. So it's difficult to see how this move would actually protect crypto investors in reality.\n\nImo this is clearly politically motivated. Gensler has repeatedly dismissed the need for crypto making extremely dumb comments like \"we don't need digital currency because the USD is a digital currency\" implying there's no legitimate use for Bitcoin because you can just hold USD instead. Imagine for a minute if Gensler instead said something like \"there's no need for AAPL because we already have MSFT\". It's simply not his job to tell people how they should invest their capital. He should simply be regulating the market to ensure people can invest their capital safely regardless of where they choose to invest it.\n\nPlus why the hell did the SEC allow COIN to go public if they're an illegal exchange? I mean how incompetent is the SEC if they're allowing companies with illegal business models to go public?\n\nBut like I say, this isn't something I actively follow or know a huge amount about so I'll acknowledge I might be wrong on some things here. What I do I know is that everything I've seen Coinbase say on this has been very reasonable and every time I hear Gensler speak he seems like he's driven primary by a personal or political vendetta against cryptocurrency and is not operating with good intentions.\n\nIf you think Gensler is going to stop attacking crypto simply because Coinbase registers as an exchange I think you're delusional.

{"title": "If this succeeds, I do not think Teslas infotainment system will be very benificial or any real income source: Apple VisionPro", "selftext": "I know, I know - its Apple, not Tesla! Hear me out though:\n\nAnyone who has sat in a chair, having to twist their neck sligthly for extended period of times will know that it will strain you tremendously. I always thought the idea of a infotainment system in a self-driving vehicle is an absolute no-brainer - just look at overseas planes!\n\nHowever, the Tesla implementation isnt perfect. Everyone in the vehichle has to twist their bodies in order to view the screen properly, something that would be very uncomfortable to do for many hours at a time. I always found it to be the best possible solution in the limits of the space, but not a very good one for the long term.One could add that the passengers could just use their own Ipads, laptops, etc., which is certainly true - but that is NOT Teslas infortainment system and therefor no opportunity for revenue.\n\nWith Apple's VisionPro I actually think that the \"dream\" or idea of Tesla gaining money off the infotainment system will be officially dead (if they pull it off). It massively expands the usage and capability of the car, allowing for tremendous amount of compute (so no reliance on the cars hardware) and delivers a far supporior entertainment experience than that off a \"small\" screen.\n\nI think anyone who has used current-gen VR has a good idea of where this stuff could go - and the Apple VisionPro looks absolutely insane on all specs. All you would need is to plug it into power in the car.\n\nImagine, freaking cars driving themselves around with people wearing VRs and just watching movies / working / playing games / etc. This is some straight up Black Mirror / Wall-E stuff coming our way.\n\nThe good news is that this will be \\*the\\* way to travel in the future and will be 100% reliant on the completion of a type of FSD - which I firmly believe Tesla will deliver before anyone else.\n\nImagine, sitting in your car - its freaking traffic jam.. you look to your left and there is a Tesla, whole family, all just chilling with their headsets on, having fun / working .. and there you are, steering your Honda Civic like you're living in the stone age. And its the year 2031.The pull factor will be insane for this type of combination of products.\n\nAnyways, moonshot idea kind of thing - but I do not believe Tesla will be able to pull much from the infotainment system if this does actually become a thing - which it seems it will. Only factor would be if you can off-load compute to the PC hardware of the car, but I would assume Apple locks that down to be only with Apple Products. Tesla will still make bank off of FSD, but the Tesla Car will not be an App device like the Apple Store if this comes to fluition - just my 2 cents.\n\nWould love to hear your opinions, cause this is freaking cool. VR may finally be entering mainstream and should be factored into how it would interplay with FSD.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people claiming motion sickness and thereby abandoning the idea. Remember that the VisionPro has a 4K \"seethrough\" viewing experience, meaning motion in VR will align with motion in R.

Meaning that the UK had essentially hit peak industrial growth before the start of ww2 and was buyoed by the large trade benefits from colonies. This would result in post ww2, the repair of infrastructure and industrial plants, and the move away from war-time industy. Come to think of it, you would think, that had the British been able to spend like America did in public-private (military) post ww2 instead of focusing on recovery; that the tech innovations made during wartime could've been helped by a military industrial complex like the U.S. during the Cold War. I think the large being military expenditures post-war by the U.S., allowed said innovations to spur companies like Boeing, etc. And then years later silicon Valley.

So I think, in part, what you ended up seeing was that the economy geared to filling back in the service industry that women had left left in the war-time. Along with British economic troubles and colonial issues, their industrial growth was hurt even more. In the U.S., partly due to the fact that they had the most intact and largest industrial base (because of the war), a lot of that war production shifted immediately to manufactured good not just for America, but to Europe during the Marshall Plan. Companies, like Ford, benefited massively from learning how to optimize their plants.

A lack of regulation is indeed a significant part of what causes US megacorps, regardless of technological innovation.  Uber is not massively complex from a technology standpoint.  It's simple enough that some students at my university had implemented a site way way before that and used it to track the university buses (before 2010).  It's not like Uber or these students invented GPS (where the US government tech spending was), they're downstream beneficiaries and UK companies have just as much access to GPS as these other companies do, also the internet, HTML, Javascript, and mobile phones, it's just not that hard from a tech standpoint.  Uber has not been able to get away with treating workers as contractors in the UK.  While it was a close call for them, they did pull it off in California.  Uber is not a large beneficiary of government tech funding.  \n\nI would also point out that Californian regulations are frequently objected to by libertarians, whom want an even looser regime.  Of course regulation is not the only aspect, but I think it is a significant one in the creation of truly massive companies.  Is government acting as a check on corporate power, or does the tail wag the dog?  Uber wagged California.  \n\nMany in this thread have assumed (I argue wrongly) that technology megacorps are primarily a result of innovation.  I argue that they result from the fact that government fails to put a check on their power, or even directly supports their abuse of power.  This thread has also largely operated on the assumption that megacorps as a good thing, which I would also dispute.  My argument is not, no regulation -> megacorps -> everyone cheers.  It's no regulation -> megacorps -> dystopian, disfunctional, society.  We are not better off under corporate ladders than under elected leaders.  \n\nI agree that the length of the work week is NOT among the regulations that make a difference here, hence why I said it was a poor example.  Money flows pretty easily between the US and UK, it's not hard to get funding for a startup in the UK.  Harder than California, sure, but not hard.  But the question isn't really about startups, but how startups become megacorps.  Tech innovation isn't really geographically bound these days.    \n\n\nWhen it comes to the regulatory environment.\n\nMicrosoft for instance, has frequently run afoul of antitrust laws in the EU.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft\\_Corp.\\_v.\\_Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Corp._v._Commission)\n\nJust recently, \"Microsoft has offered to charge different prices for its Office product with and  without its Teams app to stave off a possible EU antitrust investigation  and fine, two people familiar with the matter said.\" --Reuters By Foo Yun Chee May 5, 2023 3:31 PM GMT+3Updated a month ago\n\nA bit of an unusual decision from the US (denied) and EU (approved), but you will see the UK also denied it: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed\\_acquisition\\_of\\_Activision\\_Blizzard\\_by\\_Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_Activision_Blizzard_by_Microsoft)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo we think Google's extensive information gathering and use for advertising would have worked out for them as lucratively as a smaller company in the EU before they had an army of lawyers?  Maybe, but probably not as effectively.  \n\nAnd these days they also run afoul of antitrust regulation: [https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/es/MEMO\\_17\\_1785](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/es/MEMO_17_1785)  \n\nI don't think the EU taking those regulatory actions is bad.  It does chop some market cap off the companies involved though.   \n\nYes, sometimes tech funding from government is a more direct factor, which we see in military industrial complex companies... but many of them are no longer among the top megacorps.  I think government backing of the company is a big factor, whether through money or through supporting policy.  The EU and UK are, generally speaking, more likely than the US to chop off companies at the knees when they engage in anti-competitive practices or abuse the power dynamics between them and their employees and less likely to change rules to allow them to do this.

You do get efficiency of scale and cheaper products, but also the amount of power private corporations have over regular people can be a bit ridiculous... e.g. that private companies are responsible for credit scoring citizens with little oversight for instance, or that even after Bell was broken up, local geographic monopolies were maintained for a long time (some to this day).

So there's this critical mass of institutional knowledge about both how to run a startup and how to pick startups to invest in.  It creates this cycle where each round of founders funds the next an encourages them to dream big and go public in a spectacular IPO.\n\nI think another factor is the lack of the class system, so founders think it completely reasonable to give early employees (the peasants) significant stock.  Money isn't everything, but almost everyone prefers to have more money than less, and having stock that *might* be worth $10M one day motivates some people.  So the best talent comes to Silicon Valley and you get a critical mass of the actual labor to make that happen (which makes hiring for a startup easier).  That talent comes from many places, among them Cambridge.\n\n**But probably the most important part** is that it's ok to fail.  Startups fail all. the. fucking. time. in SV.  It's not unusual for a senior SWE to have 5 defunct startups on his/her resume, and interviewers don't see that as a negative.  At least they had the balls to go for it.  Same thing for founders, when they're pitching their latest thing to VCs.   \n\nEnding a startup isn't a big deal, either.  You lay off all the staff[1], sell the office stuff and move on.  You don't have to give employees six months notice for each week they worked at the company.\n\nContrast that with Europe, where running a company that closed or went bankrupt is a big fucking deal.  I've heard horror stories about founders getting blacklisted after one unsuccessful startup.  And not just from VCs, but from other jobs and their own bank.  People aren't going to take risks if the consequences of failure are that high.\n\nIn other words, the \"environment\" in Europe is just all wrong if you want to have companies that are the result of big risky bets on unproven technology.\n\n[1] They're working for a startup, so they already know there's a 90% chance of that happening when they sign up.\n\nSee also: https://steveblank.com/category/secret-history-of-silicon-valley/", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

I suspect it has more to do with the regulatory environment.  \n\nThe US is far more tolerant of monopolies than they really should be (compare how the US and the EU treated Microsoft's browser shenanigans, the UK was in the EU at the time).  They also let them get away with more legal damage for much longer... to the point where it runs away from them and they couldn't put the cat back in the bag even if they wanted to.  Often by exploiting seemingly grey areas like Uber does with whether someone is a contractor or an employee.  This is something that I was seeing rulings on in the UK maybe even a decade earlier and those rulings were generally coming down on the side of them being employees.

It comes  weeks after the country's Supreme Court upheld a ruling that its drivers  were workers, not independent contractors.Mar 18, 2021\" --quoted from my Google search results, Google implies it comes from this article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/uber-is-reclassifying-uk-drivers-as-workers-heres-what-happens-next.html)\n\nIt's probably for the best that the UK doesn't produce mega companies (at least in the interest of the average UK citizen).  In the US, people still suffer heavily even from monopolies that were supposedly broken up at the time.  Even after Bell System was smashed in 1984, the separated companies operated regionally, effectively leaving local monopolies.  And to this day the US appears to be fairly unique in the cooperation between device manufacturers and retailers with phone companies to lock customers into long term phone contracts at purchase with strange financing options.  E.g. you cannot buy an iPhone at Best Buy without signing a cell phone contract.  You have to go direct to the Apple store to get one without contract in the US (or slightly shady methods, unlocked imports on Amazon, eBay phones that who knows..., etc.).  This level of anti-competitive operation is mostly not legal in the UK and EU.    \n\n\nLikewise, when these companies go overseas, they often have US government support even when they operate in ways that aren't normally locally legal.  Less egregiously (maybe?) these days, but the term Banana Republic refers to governments beholden to US firms operating in South America (Honduras, Costa Rica,...).  Of course British companies were able to operate that way back in the days of the British Empire, but these days the UK has less political and economic weight to throw around in that respect.  The British and Dutch East India companies started as local monopolies and again, benefited from the projection of power globally.

If you relocate somewhere cheaper you pay the price in worse access to talent and infrastructure. If you choose to stay in London, a fair amount of your revenue gets syphoned-off by Saudi landlords who own the commercial space.\n\n\\- If you're growing a small business from scratch, it's quite tough to keep ahold of your profits. If you have a good quarter/year, you're inevitably stung with a huge amount of tax, which makes expansion difficult. As a result, a lot of businesses never grow past the point of being glorified cottage industries.\n\n\\- Class absolutely has a terrible impact on how money gets allocated. Both through inept posh people squandering investment, or state-schooled talent (the type who might thrive in America) being denied it due to the networks they'll never be able to access. Good luck getting a business loan from a bank.\n\n\\- Another thing is the overall attitude towards succeeding. Many companies pay garbage salaries and also often expect to extract a product or service from a supplier for free/low rate. They genuinely see you making profit as being greedy, whereas in America it's expected. This feeds into the class issue again, where many jobs that would be well-paid in the US, are essentially a hotbed of people who can afford to work for next-to-nothing and can play this game for years until they land the most prestigious opportunities.\n\n\\- Low salaries keep people trapped in employment.

Initially all of these guests or analysts would say that ***yes*** *they expect rates will be kept higher* for longer **BUT**, if there's a \"recession\" or a \"significant\" slowdown.

The problem is that there are some analysts, hedge fund managers, etc who thought because of the recent banking crisis the FED should already be cutting rates.

The FED should start throwing water (oil) at the fire by immediately cutting rates significantly to prevent potentially future \"disasters\" (These banks deserved to go under honestly).

{"title": "Why Now is a Great Time to Go Long UVIX and Make Money", "selftext": "Hello my WallStreetBets brethen, I‚Äôm back again with a money making post (3rd time). Those who followed me on my last two plays made money (check them out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137ivem/dpst_go_long_make_money/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/134s4uk/uvix_play_go_balls_deep_make_money/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)). So, it‚Äôs time to buckle up, fellow degenerates, because I'm about to lay out a YOLO-worthy thesis on why now is the perfect moment to go long on VIX and UVIX! üöÄüìàüå™Ô∏è I just loaded up myself with 970 shares of UVIX at an average cost of 6.30. \n\nüí• The Diamond Hands Case for VIX and UVIX üí•\n\nVolatility Party: The current market environment is like a wild party where volatility is the life of the dance floor. While a lot of events that occurred recently have calmed markets (debt ceiling increased, AI hype carrying earnings), there is still a lot uncertainty brewing in the global economy. More importantly though, there are key news cycles and geopolitical events that will occur soon that will result in a prolonged spike on the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) and its leveraged counterpart, UVI. They are poised for an explosive move to the upside. \n\nWhile the market may be buzzing with optimism and bullish sentiments surrounding company earnings, it's important to consider a different perspective. Underneath the surface, there are several factors that could cast a shadow of doubt on the rosy outlook. If reality fails to meet the sky-high expectations, disappointment could grip the market, leading to a spike in the VIX. Uncertainty looms, and any signs of weaker-than-expected earnings, missed revenue targets, or cautious guidance could ignite fear among investors. The VIX, known as the \"fear index,\" would respond accordingly, reflecting heightened market volatility as traders scramble to adjust their positions and protect themselves from potential downside risks. Remember, even the brightest stars can falter, and it's essential to consider both sides of the coin in our perpetual quest for üí∞. \n\nFurthermore, the sustained rally in the S&P 500 in recent weeks suggests to us that retail and big money investors may be keen to take profits at the first sign of weakness.\n\nTiming Is Everything: Timing is crucial in the world of volatility , and it couldn't be more perfect than now. Vix and UVIX aren‚Äôt buy and hold forever types of stocks, they‚Äôre a buy at a nice price then sell on the spike. VIX and UVIX are trading at 52wk lows (new low made today). At the time of writing, VIX is going for 29.36 while UVIX is going for 6.32. A juiciest of entries if I‚Äôve ever seen one. \n\nAs we've seen in the past, volatility can strike without warning, catching the unprepared off guard. The current macroeconomic landscape is misty, and inexperienced sailors and their portfolios will inevitably be blown off course. \nAs the winds of volatility howl, allow VIX to become your compass, protecting you through the stormy seas of the stock market (as a hedge) or towards untapped riches (as long only).\n\nTLDR : Buy VIX or preferably UVIX (shares preferable, but options dated 1 month out for added risk and leverage. This is WallStreetBets after all! üòã). Don‚Äôt buy higher then 6.90. And the lower it goes from where I bought for UVIX, (6.30), the juicier the entry is for you.

Are there any indicators that some of the major players are comitting to adopting MVIS technology? So far i have seen no indicators, aside from the lofty promises of industry leading technology. If no major players are comitting, then i can see little reason for the recent increase in valuation. \n2. Of the 68m $ in cash reservers, 45m $ are investment securities. Do you have any information on what these securities contain? I couldnt find anything. If these securities contain bonds, then the market value may be less than stated in their report, when they have to liquidate them in coming periods. In any case, i fear that the company may be forced to do a equity offering in the near future, very likely capitalizing on this recent pump. \n\nCurious for your thoughts on these questions.

This is driven by several weaknesses, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its feeble growth in its earnings per share, deteriorating net income, disappointing return on equity and weak operating cash flow. HIGHLIGHTS MICROVISION INC's earnings per share declined by 37.5% in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. Earnings per share have declined over the last two years. We anticipate that this should continue in the coming year. During the past fiscal year, MICROVISION INC reported poor results of -$0.32 versus -$0.27 in the prior year. For the next year, the market is expecting a contraction of 15.6% in earnings (-$0.37 versus -$0.32). The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and greatly underperformed compared to the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector average. The net income has significantly decreased by 44.5% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, falling from -$13.17 million to -$19.03 million. Return on equity has greatly decreased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of major weakness within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing subsector and the overall market, MICROVISION INC's return on equity significantly trails that of both the subsector average and the S&P 500. Net operating cash flow has decreased to -$13.80 million or 26.53% when compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, when comparing the cash generation rate to the subsector average, the firm's growth is significantly lower. Compared to its closing price of one year ago, MVIS's share price has jumped by 45.77%, exceeding the performance of the broader market during that same time frame. Regarding the future course of this stock, we feel that the risks involved in investing in MVIS do not compensate for any future upside potential, despite the fact that it has seen nice gains over the past 12 months.\"", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I bet they are gonna do share offering, their finances suck.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Nah, they got an ATM still available to them.

It could also skyrocket on any partnership or big sales announcement. It‚Äôs still worth taking some profit now though. Consider this scenario: MVIS is either sold in a massive portion of all autonomous vehicles, or is bought out by one of the large auto companies. Is this likely to happen eventually? Well, barring some other company developing some completely revolutionary new technology, yes. It‚Äôs arguably nearly inevitable. The autonomous vehicle market is going to blow up over the next decade. MVIS has patents on their Lidar tech that completely blows away all other Lidar, it‚Äôs not even close. Plus it‚Äôs very cheap and sleek enough to fit on any vehicle design. But even if we assume that it‚Äôs inevitable for the price to shoot up when they actually make a deal and/or start raking in 30+% of the market, is that likely to happen *before* the price drops significantly from where it is now? Because the price action now is heavily driven by short activity. \n\nThe thing to remember is that the fundamentals of profit MVIS is currently making + their assets puts the stock valuation less than the current price. The value of the stock if they started selling Lidar units and/or got a buyout, could easily shoot to 50|100$+. But until that happens,  short activity/random news is going to be the primary driver for significant price action. And the shorts are going to do everything they can to drive the price back down at some point. Without consistent news, the price will steadily drop back down to the 3-5$ range. If you‚Äôre already making a shit ton of money, you may as well cover your ass if the deals you expect to happen any day now don‚Äôt happen for another few months or years. Even just like 10% of your profit into long puts, and then another 10% if the price hits the mid teens. \n\nLastly, don‚Äôt trust what the MVIS board says too much. They have had multiple deals fall through and have changed their business plan with this Lidar already. Early 2021 they had publicly outlined their plan to shop the tech around for a buyout/partnership and also set up a manufacturing/production plan so that if they didn‚Äôt get a buyout/partnership by the end of 2021, they would start selling Lidar units in 2022. IIRC announced around 15k units in the first quarter of 2022. One of the things that chaps my ass is that I was trading the stock believing that at least there would be income from selling the units even if nothing else panned out. But then they decided to scrap that plan completely, and instead work on the tech and just continue to shop around for buyers/partners indefinitely.  Queue bagholding until that happens, as the price dropped from the teens to 3-5$ when everyone suddenly found out all the expected sales profit isn‚Äôt gonna happen, because they suddenly decided to not sell the product. \n\nNot like I am qualified to give financial advice but it doesn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out you should cover your ass my guy. This is coming from someone that believes MVIS is inevitably gonna go parabolic at some point in the next few months/years. I saw the Tech in action at the Lidar expo this year, and it‚Äôs undeniable. unless some other Lidar company discovers a revolutionary completely new way to make Lidar function way better, no Lidar company is going to be able to close the gap with the patents MVIS has. You should still cover your ass though. Not that I‚Äôm qualified to give financial advice, I just learned some painful lessons when I bought MVIS calls in may/April 2021, and didn‚Äôt cover my ass well enough when I made stupidly high profits.", "score": -1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sell you regard", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Not yet, the fun is just beginning.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "345 shares.
