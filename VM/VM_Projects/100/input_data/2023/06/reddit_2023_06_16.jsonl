If we close them, we shake hands, and we are going forward,\" Gelsinger said.\n\nThe level of any subsidy offered to Intel by Poland was not made public during Friday's announcement.\n\nDesign and planning for the facility will begin immediately, with construction to commence pending European Commission approval.\n\nMateusz Morawiecki, prime minister of Poland, called Intel's factory \"the largest greenfield investment in the history of Poland\".\n\nThe company, which has been in the country for 30 years and employs 4,000 workers, said it chose Poland because of its infrastructure, available talent and noted the site is close to its planned factory in Germany and its site in Ireland.\n\nIt expects the facility to come online by 2027.\n\nIntel under Gelsinger has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chip making and better compete with rivals AMD, NVIDIA and Samsung.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-invest-46-bln-new-chip-plant-poland-2023-06-16/", "id": "14avon6", "created_utc": 1686918820.0, "score": 1066, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 254, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3A%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It will not skyrocket as Nvidia or AMD did, because it just simply doesn't have the culture right now to do that.\n\n> You dont understand intel at all i think, infact i bet money on that you just got into semiconductors the last 5 years or even the last year even judging from your comments about the mega giant that is intel, its thanks to intel everyone sits on monster gaming pcs today, doesnt matter if you have amd in it or not.\n\nI'm listening to Intel's employees. Are they wrong? To have a company that can innovate you need proper culture.\n\n> You say they have a slow chip culture but they still outperform amd in performance, so what the f do you mean really? They are the top chip manufacturer on the planet.\n\nI'm talking about their ability to manuever and innovate now. That's what's important if you want the stock to skyrocket.

Companies are easily stagnating due to poor leadership and management.\n\n> They are the top chip manufacturer on the planet.\n\nYou are talking about current state. And that's long been priced in. You were implying the stock is going to skyrocket. For stock to skyrocket, they must come out with something special and not rest on their laurels.\n\n> I read like 20 articles a day about these companies, I understand that some sites and articles are paid, I understand what companies out of these three live on hype, momentum and ignorance of non techy wannabe tech people. It takes time to understand the whole market. Amd and nvidia are great at promoting.\n\nThat's why I don't trust any random articles, and I'll try to figure out what's going on in the inside, from the people who work there. Blind for example is an anonymous site, but with verification process using the company's email. To me it's one of the best places to get understanding of what's going on inside a company. If someone says they are from Intel there, you can be sure that at least at some point they had access to an intel.com e-mail address.\n\n> Now your saying nvidia pays more etc. Wich i dont buy at all\n\nNvidia pays at least 25-40% more to engineers. That's just data from Blind. All talent is going to Nvidia.\n\nYou can find countless topics talking about Intel vs Nvidia.\n\nExample:\nhttps://www.teamblind.com/post/Intel-CEO-UWzakt0S\n\nJust read people's sentiment who have worked there and in the similar industry.\n\nThey've been offering poor compensation for a while now, talent is going elsewhere.

This isnt that type of forum in the first place. Intel is tech. Its the backbone of our innovation when it comes to high quality chip solutions. Its just my belief that they will skyrocket, judging quality, innovation and science. When you speak of culture like that you make it seem like its not the scientists down in bunkers developing all these thibgs doesn't exist. It sounds like you are describing the office on the west coast. Its a state backed company that is essential to the infrastructure of not just america but also the entire planet. I really dont know what your talking about. Its a really serious company.\n\nYour talking about people who were too smart to go to mit and got sent down in bunkers for science, we are talking about people putting people in space kinda engineers,  extremely innovative and talented engineers, like literally the end of the line when it comes to tech the best in the business.\nI would really read those articles you read with a grain of salt. Its a government contract company. Do you understand? Like lockhead and martin or boeing. Im gonna be honest. Im not gonna read \"teamblind\" lol.\n\nThe most likelt scenario i see ahead is that intel is once again is going to prove themselves like they did after amd won year 2005ish or whenever it was they beat the intel processor, intel is gonna be like oh well and release something that is gonna leapfrog amd. You can alreasy kinda see it today, their cpus are hogh in power consumption but yet keep cool, like hmm?? How?!  That means that they are probably going to be able to develop extremely fast cpus that run as cool as something twice the speed.  Their graphics card are midtier obly because they want them to be. Like your getting the a770 for 200 bucks.. thats craaaazy if you think about it. If they keep om going with graphics integrated cpus and gpus there might not even be a msrket for nvidia or amd left. Now. Amd and nvidia are both american companies and a capatilistic society doesnt want one company to have monopoly because prices and innovation gets messed up for the consumer but they could essentially take over that entire marketcap if they were allowed,  they got the money to do it, they got the science to do it. Will they? Probably not because of the government probably doesnt want that. They want competition to drive innovation. But to say that intel cant skyrocket like amd or nvidia would be weird to me as a fan of all three and as a fan of chip innovation.\n\nYou have to understand what a massive achivement it is for amd to even be able to compete with intel on the cpu market,  its like a bottom seed team in sports winning the finals.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "It’s pretty annoying too, they haven’t hit their ath in like 20 years not since the dotcom bubble", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "God Bless Poland.

I’ll give it my best shot.\n\nWhen I say feeling, I am not talking about your surface level negative emotions. I’m referring to true intuition. Feeling and emotion are not the same. It’s a subtle nuance.\n\nThe “feeling” you are referring to is emotions and it is extremely biased; this biased ness is “your” (generalizing here) ego. Your ego is overprotective. It rejects. Your intuition accepts. Acceptance is key. So this “feeling” is not blind fate. There is logic behind it that supports it. \n\nAcceptance opens up so many pathways that were previously hidden to your naked eye and thus were hidden from your previous conscious state.

One of the major reasons behind this is terrible position management (outside of emotional mismanagement). Too many contracts bought at strikes that are unlikely to hit, too many options with different strikes, etc. I’m trying to say that more information is not necessarily better. This is a well known fallacy: more is not necessarily better and less is not necessarily worse. So you do not need many strategies to be successful. You can be as successful by having no strategies. By that I mean, adapting to the market quickly which requires perfect emotional control and quick thinking before the pivot.

The human brain is not invincible. Mine suffered “irreparable” damages that I just resolved. Relax and breathe.\n\nTo sum it up, I trade primarily qualitatively. Yes I do use probabilities and stats, but as a support to compliment the qualitative analysis: \n\n1) technical analysis: support and resistance levels extremely important as they are boundaries for what I expect price action to range \n\nEDIT: I am great at seeing patterns. This is just a personal trait of mine. I apply this trait in reading charts correctly for price action.\n\nEDIT#2: you know why I’m great at seeing patterns? Math. My love for math since grade school. Both symbolically (like algebraic substitution) and literally (calculus, linear equations, etc.)\n\nEDIT# 3: I always move with the market. Kind of like how LeBron in the NBA picks his spots when being aggressive does not work. I do the same thing on the market. Just take what the market gives you aka adapt to different environments. Back testing won’t help me right now. It will in the near future, but this is overthinking for me right now \n\n2) market sentiment: MY GUIDING PRINCIPLE. All the information you need is provided to you by your broker as round the clock company updates for the stock. Ignore news and you get wiped out (especially in options trading, a whole lot more risky than stocks). In my opinion, you do not need quantitative data if you are using this route. Absolutely having quantitative data helps, but for me right now where I am at, I can’t afford to do so. I will stretch myself thin. KNOW YOURSELF AS A TRADER as strategies are useless in my opinion if you don’t know yourself.\n\n3) quantitative: merely support. like if I’m trading around earnings, I’ll take a brief glance at the company’s financials. Again I am unable to deep dive like I want as my brain is still recovering from an illness that impacts the part of my brain primarily involved in math. I love math and was naturally great it before getting sick. Chill out.\n\n4) QUICK THINKING: this is extremely important in my opinion. What good are strategies if you can’t execute them quickly when market moves against you? Learn to cut losses quickly and go on the other side of the trade.

Apparently they can wire it so it'll still work with the remaining motor.  And, not a deal breaker, the top glass is missing (they didn't realize it until they had their QC guy inspect the seat replacement) but the weather should be nice enough so my wife is going to cover it with a tarp and just hold it in place as we drive through the mountain pass back home.  There's a wind advisory and gusts could get into the 50 mph range, but I'm going to let her use one of my work gloves, so she should be able to hold it together.  Also, apparently, the computer needs a new CPU (overheated or something, I can't remember what they told me), but I think I'll just pull the i5 out of my old ASUS and get it working.  I may need to tweak the Linux kernel a bit to get it working correctly, but it looks doable. \n\n Oh, they did say that somehow the battery got a hole in it (in the rear seat area) some time between Austin and Palm Springs.  Apparently it is essentially on fire but the combustion is limited to that one single puncture so we're going to just get a few of those big red fire extingushers and my 8-year old should be able to just keep a steady stream on it until we get home.  Pretty sure she won't be able to maintain a good grip on it much longer than after we get home, so will probably let it go ahead do its thing at that point.   May park it a couple blocks down the street and just walk to our house because of the smell.  I have a $250 deductable, so really just paying a stonk to get it all squared away.

{"title": "$HOOD - A New Bull Market Beneficary", "selftext": " Hello everyone,\n\nIt's been quite some time since I wrote a DD on WSB so I thought I would share this one. Now, I know it's controversial--Robinhood--but making money isn't controversial and I personally believe there's a lot of money to be made on Robinhood's stock as we enter a new bull market. I wrote this DD a few days ago, the price has moved a little higher since. Some pictures are missing because VisualMod won't allow some of the content from Robinhood's roadmap.\n\nState of the Stock\n\nRobinhood’s time in the stock market has been an arduous one and not one without controversy. The stock went public in a hotly anticipated IPO at about $36.41 on July 29th, 2021. It saw tremendous interest in the first week of trading reaching an overly lofty value at \\~$85 a share before starting to sell off. This sell off has relentlessly continued and in many places, you will find negative commentary on the stock.\n\nI personally believe that the stock’s price action bottomed on June 17th, 2022 at about $6.84 a share. Since then the stock has been slowly plodding along and striking higher lows, which I will illustrate later in the charting.\n\nI also believe that the stock’s story is close to turning around and could get more positive attention in the later half of this year. I am going to talk about the balance sheet, cost cutting, charts, and the controversy.\n\nI will be limiting my comments on the balance sheet to lines that I believe deserve notice. For this post, I will be comparing Robinhood to their old school rival, Charles Schwab.\n\nThe Balance Sheet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c8fg6s92v96b1.jpg?width=2152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f245bc64e4318d04e3e8fe1fa6dad9c26a62dfcc\n\n$HOOD - Balance Sheet\n\nOverall, I read Robinhood’s balance sheet as being quite strong. Particularly in the amount of cash and sort term investments that the company is carrying. At 5.46 Billion in cash and 1.52 Billion in short term investments the company can cover operating expenses (excl. COGS) for about 3.5 years.\n\nThe company has also shared that the short term investments are in <1 year term treasuries. Which is quite a good decision given the current rates. I only wish they had purchased a little more than 500 million or so.\n\nAs of this writing (6-11-23, 6-15-23 WSB), Robinhood carries a market cap of \\~$8.5 billion as well. Their cash position is nearly the size of their entire equity. In comparison, $SCHW (Charles Schwab) has about $75 billion in cash and a market cap of 100 Billion. I believe that the market is underestimating how Robinhood can deploy that cash.\n\nLastly, Robinhood is very close (9.41 market) to their book value per share (7.83). In comparison, $SCHW has a book value per share of 15.36 and is trading at 55.0 in the market. I believe this illustrates that Robinhood is quite cheap, even after the June ’22 bounce when it was cheaper than the book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6q341be3v96b1.jpg?width=1864&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9301e0e8071123cf94de63cbbe4b965cea326967\n\n$HOOD - FCF\n\nNext, the cashflow at Robinhood is quite good and turned positive in Q4’22. Whereas their rivals are experiencing negative free cash flow during this same period. Robinhood, on a relative basis for this metric, looks to be outperforming during the banking crisis.\n\nDuring their earnings calls they have also reported a net increase in deposits as well as assets under custody (AUC) increasing by an impressive 26% due to the run on stocks in 2023.\n\n(Omitted because of Visual Mod)\n\n$HOOD - AUC\n\nWhat I find most interesting about this is that customer cash in Robinhood has steadily grown to $11 billion from $2 billion at IPO. It has been on an impressive path of growth. I believe this is the result of their strong “Brokerage Cash Sweep” program and the rates they’ve been able to offer.\n\nThey have been able to effectively remove the friction between treasury yield and their customers. This also creates a beneficial situation where their clients can deploy capital quickly, while maintaining some yield from their cash. Effectively, creating productive reserves for their customers who can choose to deploy it at any moment right on their app.\n\nIt should be noted that since the may operating data was released AUC has grown another $4.4 billion in deposits to $81.8 Billion. (See $HOOD's operating data release for May)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ejaeub5v96b1.jpg?width=1891&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de1bad7ee5ba821f7d867725cdce3396c4fb27e9\n\n$HOOD - Profitability\n\nLastly, the company itself is quite close to profitability. The next 4 quarters are projected by broader WallStreet to come in at an EPS of about -0.01 to -0.03. Any positive change in their costs or earnings could lead to a surprise profit. Such as cash from treasury yield, cost cutting measures, new products, or increased business. The company itself continues to stress, that they are becoming leaner as time goes on. I believe that to be true.\n\nCutting Costs – The Layoffs\n\nIn 2022, Robinhood performed several rounds of lay offs. This allowed them to cut Q2 ’22 and Q3 ’22 operating expenses significantly (excl. COGS). This does not appear to have impacted their revenue growth and has given them the added benefit of being ‘right sized’. And to the best of my knowledge, no further lay offs are currently on the table. In fact, their revenue is now higher than it has ever been since IPO at $447 million and is pushing them ever closer to profitability.\n\n>“Robinhood Is Laying Off 9% of Its Full-Time Employees”  \n– Wall Street Journal, Apr. 29, 2022  \n“Robinhood Lays Off 23% of Staff as Retail Investors Fade From Platform”  \n– Wall Street Journal, Aug. 2, 2022\n\n2023 Road Map – 4 Catalysts\n\n(Picture omitted because VisualMod keeps deleting the post. You can find it in their earnings report materials.)\n\n$HOOD - 2023 Roadmap\n\n(Picture omitted because VisualMod keeps deleting the post. You can find it in their earnings report materials.)\n\n$HOOD - 2023 roadmap cont.\n\nNow that we’ve talked about cost cutting, let’s take a look at the road map and see if there are opportunities for fundamental growth. I will list out 4 that I believe can have a positive impact on their business.\n\n* Options Trading in Cash Accounts\n* Margin Outside Gold\n* Futures Trading\n* UK Market Expansion\n\nLets tackle the first two on the list.\n\nOptions Trading in Cash Accounts should continue to grow their existing business. This should increase their revenue generated per user as more current customers have access to more products. Options trading is particularly popular among Robinhood’s customer demographic.\n\nMargin Outside Gold I find personally controversial. I personally don’t believe in using margin. Regardless, it should also increase their revenue generated per user.\n\nWhile both of these are improvements that could turn the company profitable for EPS. They are not as major as the next two items.\n\nFutures trading would open an entire new market for the Robinhood user. I believe it is an incredibley potent catalyst for their user base and will allow their customers to trade more often and in new ways.\n\n>Robinhood advancing offerings for active traders  \nIn March, we applied for a Futures Commission Merchant license and, if approved on a typical timeline, we  \nexpect to launch futures trading by the end of 2023.\n\nUK Market Expansion should allow them to acquire a significant number of new users.\n\n>Robinhood continues to explore growth opportunities, expands access globally  \nWith an experienced team leading and an existing license in place, we believe we’re on track for our  \nambitious goal of launching brokerage services in the UK by the end of the year.\n\nTo summarize, I believe expanding into a new country, the UK, and providing futures trading to their existing customers they expand their business significantly over time.\n\nLets take a look now at the charts and see what we can find in the price action.\n\nCharting A Path\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bicwds7v96b1.jpg?width=3657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be4c10bc3f9a0c63056ffcd13053ffa03b698308\n\n$HOOD - Price Action 6-11-23, 1D\n\nThe first thing of note on Robinhood’s stock chart is that a series of higher lows have been put in. The price action, for the first time since IPO, is showing an increasing pattern in the price. I believe the stock has a classic Falling Wedge which I interpret as bullish. I believe the wedge has formed because of the positive developments in the balance sheet, cost cutting, and the future outlook.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erv0vkq8v96b1.jpg?width=3685&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37409c7c4e5222f429c60e88dae6e957868f1f68\n\n$HOOD - MACD, 1D\n\nExamining the MACD on the 1D time scale we also see higher lows put in as well as an MACD crossover onto the positive scale. Overall, I read the charts as having increasingly positive momentum. I also believe that momentum is growing, albeit slowly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/64yu4wb9v96b1.jpg?width=3675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27322ae18ece9eb1e0bb0e3e5f34d272c6dc2c24\n\n$HOOD - DMI, 2D\n\nLastly, on the 2D time scale my favorite indicator, DMI, shows the bulls having taken control on \\~May 24 2023. I don’t think it’s any coincidence that was the low after the most recent earnings report. I believe the majority of the bears have left the stock as evident by their strength at \\~11.5. We also have seen the natural termination of the ADX which implies, to me, that the previous trading trend for the stock has come to an end. A new trend does appear to be forming. It could fizzle out, but that’s up to Robinhood’s management.\n\nI believe all of the necessary setups are currently there for them to succeed as both a company and a stock.\n\nClosing Thoughts & Possible RisksThe Demographic & The Controversy\n\nI don't think I have to mention the controversy much here so I am re-writing this section for this post. Regardless...\n\nI believe the controversay for $HOOD regarding GameStop is sorely misplaced and the majority of which is not real. When people 'poo-poo' robinhood I believe that they still use the app. Most of the posts still on this subreddit use it and the proof is in the data, Robinhood is continuing to grow assets under custody and trading volumes.\n\n$HOOD - Monthly Active users\n\n(Omitted because of visualmod)\n\n$HOOD - net funded accounts\n\n(Omitted because of visualmod)\n\nThis could also be related to the flurry of trading activity seen in stocks related to AI in the past few months.\n\nHeavy Insider Selling\n\nAn additional risk is that the insiders, specifically Tenev Vladimir, CEO & Bhatt Baiju, Chief Creative Officer, continue to sell large numbers of shares. This is creating an immense downward pressure on the stock price. If this pattern continues, it could contribute negatively to the stocks performance.\n\nHowever, I believe that’s a non-issue if the company becomes profitable. I hope that we are approaching the end of the insider selling.\n\nCrypto & SEC Action\n\nAdditionally, due to recent events, Robinhood has pulled 3 of their crypto offerings. I believe this is another mixed risk. While they will take a revenue hit by delisting those tokens, they may end up gaining users if customers of Coinbase or Binance decide to take their business elsewhere. **It could end up being beneficial to Robinhood, but there’s no way of knowing at this time.**\n\nAt the time of this writing there has been no report that I can find of Robinhood receiving a notice on the matters affecting Binance and Coinbase. Robinhood instead chose to remove the 3 affected securities voluntarily.\n\nI believe this is the responsible thing to do and well advised. By taking pre-emptive action they are protecting their business from getting entangled in the matter and remaining compliant with the SEC. This is a value the company has stated a number of times during their earnings calls. I believe their actions demonstrate that value and is representative of good governance from the company leadership.\n\nThat said, the SEC could still take action against the company if they choose to do so. Therefore, it still carries some risk and must be considered.\n\nMacro & Last Thoughts\n\nSo, here we are. It’s June 11th, 2023. Costs are significantly reduced and being controlled, notable Roadmap 2023 objectives are close, plans for new markets and offerings are approaching, and revenue continues to grow. The company is just a few pennies away on EPS from breaking even or potentially turning a profit. There is also significant distance from the drama surrounding GameStop, Robinhood, and WallStreetBets.\n\nThe charts are showing higher lows being put in place. More positive momentum looks to be coming into the stock via the MACD. Additionally, the bulls appear to have taken control via the DMI on \\~May 24th, 2023.\n\nI believe this is a case where a significant breakout could occur. It remains to be seen if it will, but I believe there is a potential trade here to the upside. It is not without downside risk though and that must be taken into consideration.\n\nCurrent thinking in the market is that we may be entering a new bull market based off of recent SP500 closing levels. However, the macroeconomic picture still remains unclear. Particularly in regards to inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending.\n\nIf it is a new bull market, Robinhood may benefit from increased trading activity, but if the macroeconomic picture deteriorates it could degrade Robinhood’s business and affect the stock.\n\nEither way, I personally believe the stock is in an interesting position within the market. The investor meeting is also on June 20th, 2023.\n\nTrade carefully, trade wisely.\n\nTay\n\nMy current position:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7d3dcnycv96b1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=162f96c3fb0b30ef5c19ac1e658ab5d84f393974\n\n$HOOD Position from OP\n\n***As always, please consult the appropriate professionals for any financial decisions.

{"title": "For the love of Christ, hear me out on $OPEN.", "selftext": "I'm a technical trader. Before that turns you off, and the images of charts make your brain melt, just HEAR ME THE FUCK OUT. This chart setup for $OPEN is perfect. When I see something like this, I immediately know that it's a \"go all in\" moment. It's practically my only strategy for trading, and I'm often stuck scanning for months to find it in action. These setups do NOT happen often, they can take months/years to form, and you can expect it maybe once in the lifetime of a stock.\n\n**$OPEN is set to go to 4.22, with the upside of 5.77,** and the moon being 8.66. Thats 40%, 88%, and 184%. Do the math on what the nets you in options. These moves happen within 40 days-ish, with the potential to happen in 7.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyozascgvg6b1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=7649b6c9894d62f33336aa238f595ebbafaeeab9\n\nI didn't pull these price targets out of my ass. They come from a 360Day/4Hr chart with standard deviation levels on it. When you look at the photos of the chart, that's what the Green, Orange, and Red lines are. Everybody can google what a horizontal range break looks like, but once I started cross referencing with the deviation levels, this setup became practically the only thing I trade. They're an absolute game changer. Fuck all of the other chart studies, moving average lines, RSI, volume. **When a stock breaks a longtime horizontal consolidation zone, and is simultaneously crossing a downtrending \\[green\\] line, there is almost always major price action to the upside**. I typically see a move to the dashed deviation line, some resistance, and then a move to the next full deviation line, some resistance, and etc.\n\nThe fact that $OPEN is breaking resistance & the Green line at the same time is what makes the setup absolutely golden. **Just look at what happened with $SOXL and tell me the setup doesn't look the same.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhy9lchfwg6b1.png?width=2818&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d4a377b3215b8576c98f19597fc9cee71a78aa5\n\n **Just look at what happened with $CCL and tell me the setup doesn't look the same.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2c7l6e23wg6b1.png?width=2810&format=png&auto=webp&s=35b40c3bfee66d5c6abd1d44c7f4d2d93f27955b\n\n\"Yeah sure, the charts all look the same. So what. Doesn't mean $OPEN will follow. Also, the stocks been downtrending for a reason, and they haven't even been in the news lately\".\n\nI'm not here to say OPEN is a good company. Who cares. This strategy requires beat up stocks that are showing signs of life at a very cheap price. A move from 3 to 5 will go unnoticed, and it might even continue downtrending for years after that, **but we'll already cash out by then.** When the expectations are so low for a company like OPEN, sentiment \"can only go up\". This happens all of the time for shitty stocks, but I can't explain when those moves will happen. With OPEN, I believe I can. With OPEN, I have a VERY good idea of what it will do, and I've just supplied the supporting evidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtra:\n\nWhen I was playing SOXL, the microchip index, I didn't know why it would break, just that it was getting read to. Then BOOM, NVDA absolutely rips, sending SOXL rocketing too. Sometimes the charts predict the news.\n\nWe saw something similar with $SOFI, but Sofi had a larger consolidation range, making the move on the break less, percentage wise. Another example is $CCL (included), but again, $OPEN looks better.\n\nPeople might not be impressed with 40% price action, but \"just trust me bro\", when I see this setup, it gets my d\\*\\*\\* hard. I've tried so many times to tell others of this strategy, and I've finally decided to take it to WSB.
