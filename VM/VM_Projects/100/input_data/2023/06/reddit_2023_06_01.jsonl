But the fact of the matter is, there are thousands of 'ideas' at any given moment, and the ones that actually make the news and become multi-baggers were **not** obvious in the past. So why do people feel this way, that they keep 'missing' out on obviously great investments? This is what is known as Hindsight Bias. \n\nHindsight bias is, [according to Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hindsight-bias.asp), \"a psychological phenomenon that allows people to convince themselves after an event that they accurately predicted it before it happened. This can lead people to conclude that they can accurately predict other events. Hindsight bias is studied in behavioral economics because it is a common failing of individual investors.\"\n\nWhy is knowing about hindsight bias significant? One, because if you believe that you **did** have proper insight and analytical skills to spot future success stories, then you might chase after any idea that looks good to to you **now**. However, unless you actually have proof that you were able to consistency find good ideas in that past that you simply didn't capitalize on, then you should not trust just your memory. Otherwise, one would pick potentially bad investments, and then **think** that they knew about other better ideas, repeating the cycle.\n\n It's also important to recognize this bias just for your state of mind. Enough people feel bad enough about missing multi-baggers like Amazon when they should be giving themselves a break. Saying you could have made made 100k if you only invested in some stock years ago is not the same as losing 100k, or we'd all be in the hole. So don't fret about the past and keep looking to the future. There are still plenty of opportunities out there, so best of luck investing! \n\n**Tldr:** Whatever happened in the past was not obvious, no matter how much it feels like it. Don't be overconfident that you can catch future ones but don't beat yourself up over missing opportunities either.

After a couple weeks you should start seeing the mycelium spread throughout. Once you see the bag about 60% covered in myself, you can break and shake the bag. Then just wait for 100% coverage. Cut the bag open and secure it with a paper clip so that the mycelium can breathe. Place the bag where it can get some good light so it starts the fruiting process. After I see my first mushroom, I remove the bag and place the block in a sterilized large plastic bin with a loose lid and I make sure I spray water using a mister to keep the humidity high.

When VIX rises, the VVIX (the IV of vix) almost always rises too.  \n\nI could have bought $19 calls instead, but the bid/ask spread on the $16 calls was narrower.    I was also able to get the same delta with fewer contracts.   And I'm counting more on a $1-3 VIX increase that would make $16 calls more profitable thru delta than I am on big VIX move that would make $19 calls jump alot thru gamma.\n\n\n\nExpanded Answer:   The way VVIX is measured/calculated makes it range bound between about 30-140, and normally it reverts to a mean of around 85.   This afternoon was around 84.30 or so.   \n\nThat means that even if VIX only rises from $15.70 to $16.70, VVIX might rise from 84.30 to 89.00, and the calls I bought would increase both because of the delta move (rising VIX) and volatility expansion (increased IV of VIX).\n\n\nIt's much easier to make money on VIX buying calls into expected volatility expansion because VVIX helps out the calls as VIX rises.     On the flip side, it's harder to make money on VIX puts when VIX is high because as VIX falls, VVIX will also be falling back down too (and the volatility contraction will hurt a put's value and negate some of the delta move from VIX going lower).\n\n\n\nVIX is cash settled based on the spot price of /VX futures, which itself trades based on the expected volatility of S&P futures.   It's related close enough to the IV of SPY that you can generally just look at SPY and get an idea of where VIX is.   If SPY IV is around 30, VIX is probably around 30 also.

{"title": "Why LULU's earnings today will completely obliterate everyone", "selftext": "Lululemon (LULU) is scheduled to report its fiscal first-quarter results today. I expect LULU stock to likely go up due to revenues and earnings beating market expectations. Retail stocks have continued to come under pressure as economic headwinds coupled with inflation have intensified. Despite the current macro headwinds, Lululemon has been able to churn out robust quarterly earnings reports in FY 2022. Management now expects net revenue to be in the range of $9.30 billion to $9.41 billion, representing growth of approximately 15% y-o-y in FY 2023. The previous year saw $8.11 billion.\n\nAnalysts expect earnings of $1.96 per share compared to earnings of $1.48 per share from the same quarter last year. In terms of sales, they anticipate an increase of 19.24% over the prior-year period, coming to $1.92 billion. For the fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $11.60, compared to $10.07 in the same period last year. \n\nAs you guys may already know, the company specializes in yoga products for Becky and workout gear, competing against industry heavyweights Nike and Adidas. The retail landscape looks more challenging for the remainder of the year. [Barclays](https://cards.barclaycardus.com/) noted in a May 2 research note that \"consumers across all income brackets are pulling back\" on discretionary products as inflation takes a chunk out of their wallets.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts (that means you, right?) have been closely watching inventory levels as companies try to offload stockpiles of excess merchandise. Storage costs for those mountains of goods, and the promotions and discounts often needed to move them quickly, tend to weigh on profits.\n\nOne of the top retail sectors early in the year, footwear and apparel retailers, has started to show signs of weakness. Rival Nike (NKE) was downgraded to sell last week based on [a challenging outlook for its U.S. business](https://www.investors.com/news/nike-stock-cut-to-sell-as-u-s-business-faces-challenges/) and \"choppy\" recovery in China. Elsewhere, Foot Locker (FL) received a downgrade and price target cut from Citi based on price-sensitive consumers and an \"unhealthy\" U.S. athletic market.\n\nHowever, some consumers plan on restocking their fitness gear with summer around the corner. Roughly 35% of consumers plan to splurge on apparel and 19% expect to spend big on fitness products this year, according to a [monthly McKinsey survey in May](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/a-monthly-update-on-the-state-of-the-us-consumer). That's up from April's results of 33% of consumers planning to splurge on apparel and 15% on fitness products, respectively.\n\nDespite the choppy U.S. market, LULU stock received price target upgrades in late April as analysts are still positive on the company's overseas outlook. [TD Cowen raised its price target on LULU stock to 525 from 500](https://www.benzinga.com/news/23/04/32042572/td-cowen-maintains-outperform-on-lululemon-athletica-raises-price-target-to-525) on April 27 and maintained an outperform rating on the shares. The firm noted it expects direct-to-consumers and e-commerce growing to 43% of sales and current trends \"suggest a bullish read for the international mix shift.\"\n\nThat followed a Bank of America (BAC) price target upgrade on April 20, which lifted BofA's forecast to 450 from 410 but still chose to maintaine a buy rating on LULU stock. Lululemon continues balancing its historically grassroots-focused marketing program with \"several more meaningful campaigns,\" the firm wrote. Bank of America noted Lululemon's \"unique\" membership program is gaining traction. And growth in China will be a key near- and long-term driver.\n\nOn April 18, media reports emerged Lululemon is looking to sell the at-home fitness business. Bloomberg News reported Lululemon was working with an advisor to solicit interest in the business. CNBC later reported Hydrow, a private startup that makes in-home rowing machines, has interest in a deal with Lululemon.\n\nLululemon previously announced at the end of March it was \"evolving\" its at-home fitness business strategy with plans to focus on digital app-based services. In its fourth-quarter earnings, Lululemon disclosed a $443 million impairment charge related to Studio Mirror, the company's streaming workout service.\n\nLululemon averaged 28.8% earnings growth over the past four quarters while revenue averaged 29.8% quarterly gains last year. The yoga company found its center and beat Wall Street earnings estimates the past two years.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, analysts expect Lululemon adjusted earnings to bolt 32.4% to $1.96 per share while sales sprint 19.3% to $1.924 billion.\n\n[FactSet](https://www.factset.com/) forecasts same-store sales to rise 15.4%, slowing from the 28% growth last year and 27% growth in the fourth quarter, respectively.\n\nIn terms of TA, LULU stock formed a handle for a cup-with-handle base after breaking out on April 17. Shares fell roughly 9% from the buy point and are nearing the maximum 12% handle decline for the pattern. Lululemon stock tumbled 13% from its 386.80 buy point for its previous cup base on the weekly MarketSmith chart following its May 5 breakout. The move triggered the 7%-8% sell rule. LULU stock is hovering above its 200-day moving average but trading well below its 50-day line. Shares retreated the past week after slipping below the 10-day moving average on May 19.\n\nFor earnings tho, my research has provided me with a mix of bearish and bullish news. Just for fun I want to inverse my gut instinct that initially says \"buy calls.\" So I'm gonna grab puts just *to see*. That being said, it's up to you guys to read this and come to your own conclusions. IV is very high so it's better to go for a spread, regardless of what you choose. The average move with earnings has been about 10% so we might see a big move tonight.
