Economists have been saying a recession is coming next month, Biden said Tuesday night during a fundraiser in the Maryland suburbs outside Washington.\n\n“It’s been coming for 11 months, well guess what? I don’t think it is going to come,” he added, citing a still strong labor market and his efforts to tamp down on inflation.\n\nRecent data on housing, manufacturing and consumer confidence have beaten expectations, painting a picture of a resilient economy. Reports Tuesday showed new home purchases climbing to the fastest annual rate in more than a year, durable goods orders topping estimates and consumer confidence reaching the highest level since the start of 2022.\n\nWhile the data don’t discount the possibility of a recession in the coming year they do give reason to believe a downturn is not imminent or certain. According to the latest Bloomberg monthly survey of economists, the economy is expected to narrowly dodge a recession this year but underlying inflation will be faster than previously thought. \n\nBiden’s remarks at the home of Choice Hotels International Inc. Chairman Stewart Bainum, a longtime Democratic donor who served as a Maryland state lawmaker in the 1970s and 80s, came a day before the president is scheduled to travel to Chicago. \nAt Chicago’s Old Post Office on Wednesday, Biden will deliver what the White House has called a “cornerstone” address on his economic policy, “Bidenomics.” The White House is seeking to improve perceptions about his job performance before the 2024 election gets underway. \n\nEarlier this week, Biden announced plans to distribute more than $40 billion in funding for high-speed internet infrastructure in the coming weeks, presenting it as an example of how his administration is trying to help all Americans, even those who did not vote for him.\n\nPolls have shown that voters broadly see Biden’s job performance on the economy as poor, despite low unemployment and the passage of pandemic relief, infrastructure, and climate spending legislation. If a recession is going to come in the next 12 months, Biden should hope it begins sooner rather than later. Two-term presidents generally get any recessions out of the way early, while one-term presidents have had to contend with bad economic news while voters are heading to the polls.", "id": "14kvllb", "created_utc": 1687915041.0, "score": 330, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 430, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To make this 100% return is almost like taking the risk of going to a casino, putting it on red and then calling it 100% return.\n\n\nAnd it doesn't make sense to me that there would be a strategy that would make 60% - 100% return for 100k, but not the same return for $1 mil, because $1 mil is not that large amount of money to trade with, unless you do penny stocks. \n\n\nIn addition, there's always survivorship bias, where out of 1,000 traders, one of them will be very successful for very long time just because of luck.

It's just a law of numbers and probability.\n\nTrading is possible, but yes law of numbers and probability will say to me that if market return is 10%, but you expect a 20% return with similar knowledge as the market, you are putting in more risk. And it's more like 0% - 20%. With 60% it would be more like a range of -40% to 60%. So it's rather +-%.\n\nObviously risk gets more complicated than that.\n\nBut my point is that, without having special knowledge, when trying to outperform the market you are always putting in similar risk as in the roulette game. At that point you are playing vs the house.\n\n> And every trade there is risk? So I'm not sure what you mean risk free because that's not possible, again it just goes back to numbers.\n\nRisk free is not a good word I used, but the risk compared to following the market is increased similarly as if you were playing roulette. If you put in $100, and end up at $160 instead of $110 - which would've been if you just followed the market, you might have been lucky and it could've been 50% chance of losing $50 instead, and being at $60.

The price will drop or increase in such a way that whatever system is holding your limit, it would simply not respect it, because no one would be willing to do that trade. No one in the right mind after that event would want to hold that contract, especially at the price your limit was.\n\n> When the unexpected happens and it drops in the scenario you're describing, buy & hold is going to be in an equally bad position.\n\nYou are also selling calls, so if there's a positive event, you are also exposed to large losses. Let's say, suddenly an even more advanced version of AI or tech is released and market decides to jump.\n\n> \"It works until it doesn't\" can apply to most anything.\n\nEspecially for this, because your strategy will keep working until nothing unexpected happens.

{"title": "Costco cracks down on membership card sharing", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/27/costco-cracks-down-on-membership-card-sharing.html\n\nCostco is taking a page from Netflix’s book. The retailer is cracking down on people sneaking into its clubs and trying to shop with other people’s membership cards, it said Tuesday. Costco said it has always asked shoppers for their membership cards at the cash registers when they check out. Now, it is also requesting to see cards with a photo at self-checkout registers — and to view a photo ID if a shopper’s membership card has no picture. “We don’t feel it’s right that non members receive the same benefits and pricing as our members,” the company said in a statement.\n\nThe membership-based warehouse club said it has noticed more abuse of card sharing since it expanded self-checkout to more of its stores. The stepped-up enforcement was previously reported by The Dallas Morning News. Costco stands apart from other retailers because of its business model. The bulk of its earnings come from membership fees, which help cover company expenses and keep prices low. It charges $60 for annual memberships and $120 a year for its higher-tier plan, called Executive Membership. Membership-based warehouse clubs have attracted more customers and won more of their wallets over the past three years. Shoppers who turned to the clubs to help with pantry loading of toilet paper and hand sanitizer during the Covid pandemic are now going there for cheaper gas and bulk-sized food during a period of inflation.\n\nWalmart- owned Sam’s Club has seen a similar lift in business. Its membership count has hit a record high. Yet even the clubs have felt pressured as consumers pull back because of inflation, or spend on experiences like travel and dining out instead. In the past two quarters, Costco has reported a heavier mix of sales coming from food as demand slows for pricier merchandise and popular pandemic categories like furniture and electronics. Its net sales rose year over year by about 2% to $52.6 billion, including the impact of inflation during the quarter that ended May 7. “It rains on all of us during these tougher times, particularly with bigger ticket, discretionary items,” Costco’s chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, said on an earnings call in December.", "id": "14lcupr", "created_utc": 1687966853.0, "score": 978, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 606, "comments": [{"body": "Story time! \n\nA few years ago i went to costco with my own card - i was 21 at the time.\nI pull up to the checkout with a cart full and handed the cashier my Costco Premium card.

{"title": "Fed - Banks have enough capital to continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%.", "selftext": "All 23 US banks that participated in a new Federal Reserve stress test would be able to withstand a severe global recession, demonstrating the strength of the biggest financial institutions at a time when the banking industry still is on uncertain ground.\n\nResults released by the Fed Wednesday show that these banks would have enough capital on hand to absorb losses and continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%.\n\nTheir projected losses would amount to $541 billion under that hypothetical scenario.\n\nThe biggest of the group - JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) – all would have capital buffers well in excess of the Fed’s 4.5% minimum requirement under this extreme scenario.\n\nSame goes for the mid-sized regional banks that were a part of this test, including PNC (PNC), Truist (TFC) and M&T (MTB).\n\n\"Today’s results confirm that the banking system remains strong and resilient,\" Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said.\n\n\"At the same time, this stress test is only one way to measure that strength. We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.\"\n\nResults did vary widely across the industry, however. The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario” was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.\n\nThe bank with the lowest ratio was Citizens Financial (CFG), a regional bank based in Rhode Island. Other banks with the smallest capital buffers were regional institutions that pale in size next to the giants of the industry.\n\nBut the giants also posted the biggest projected net income losses under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario,” led by Citigroup's $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo had $32.9 billion and JPMorgan had $30.1 billion.\n\nGoldman, perhaps the most storied name on Wall Street, had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards.\n\nIt also recorded the highest losses in separate Fed assessments of how the trading books of the biggest banks would perform under “global and exploratory market shocks.”\n\n\n\nThe Fed’s test, an annual rite of the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, is the first to be released since turmoil roiled the banking world following the failure of First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank this spring.\n\nBanks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. Later this summer, however, they are also bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.\n\nThese tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.\n\nForcing banks to amass greater buffers has pros and cons for lenders, regulators and the economy. It will increase the stability of these institutions, but it will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits and could cause banks to pull back on certain types of lending.\n\nPowell discussed this balance last week.\n\n“It’s always a trade-off,” he said. “More capital means more stable, resilient banking systems. It can also at the margins mean less credit availability…there is no perfect way to assess that balance.”\n\nBarr, the vice chair of supervision, said last week the Fed is also exploring \"reverse stress testing\" that could be used as a tool to make banks more resilient by helping supervisors recognize more exogenous issues that could go wrong instead of patterns from the past regulators have been trained to catch.\n\n\nThe Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in 2009, as the last financial crisis was still raging.\n\nIt was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010. A law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks’ size, meaning those in the range of $100-$250 billion would be tested every other year.\n\nDemocrats and regulators have been critical of that 2018 adjustment, arguing it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not gone through a stress test before it failed.\n\nSome in this year's test — BMO Financial, Citizens, M&T and RBC US Group — were among the every-other-year banks that weren’t scheduled to be tested again until 2024.\n\nBut the Fed required BMO, Citizens and M&T to be tested again in 2023, and RBC also opted in to the 2023 exam. All four banks had capital of 6.4% and higher, above the 4.5% required.\n\nThis year the Fed examined how 23 banks would fare under a severe global recession that included severe stress in commercial real estate. In such a scenario unemployment spikes to 10%, home prices and commercial real estate plunge about 40%, the stock market plummets 45%, market volatility jumps and corporate bond yields rise.\n\nAll 23 banks in aggregate would have lost $541 billion.

For the first time, this year's test also added a second “exploratory market shock” to the trading books of the largest and most complex banks.\n\nThe global market shock is characterized by a severe recession with fading inflation expectations; the exploratory market shock tests a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures induced by higher inflation expectations.\n\nThe results from those exams showed that the trading books of the largest banks were resilient amid a rising rate environment.\n\nThe biggest projected losses belonged to Goldman, with $21.2 billion lost in the global market shock scenario and $18.1 billion in the exploratory market shock component.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/all-23-banks-survive-feds-2023-stress-test-203007760.html", "id": "14llefr", "created_utc": 1687986946.0, "score": 1302, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 265, "comments": [{"body": "*slaps the money printer* this ol gal still got some juice in her.", "score": 182, "replies": [{"body": "The good thing about printing trillions is that the next time you print trillions nobody will bat an eye!", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "The second trillion has a smaller effect than the first trillion.
