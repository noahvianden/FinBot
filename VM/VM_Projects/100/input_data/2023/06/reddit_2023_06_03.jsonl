Liquidity crisis after debt deal will send stocks down.", "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trillion-dollar-treasury-vacuum-coming-135944792.html\n\nTrillion-Dollar Treasury Vacuum Coming for Wall Street Rally\n\n\n(Bloomberg) -- With a debt ceiling deal freshly signed into law Saturday by President Joe Biden, the US Treasury is about to unleash a tsunami of new bonds to quickly refill its coffers.\n\nThis will be yet another drain on dwindling liquidity as bank deposits are raided to pay for it — and Wall Street is warning that markets aren’t ready.\n\nThe negative impact could easily dwarf the after-effects of previous standoffs over the debt limit. The Federal Reserve’s program of quantitative tightening has already eroded bank reserves, while money managers have been hoarding cash in anticipation of a recession.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou estimates a flood of Treasuries will compound the effect of QT on stocks and bonds, knocking almost 5% off their combined performance this year. Citigroup Inc. macro strategists offer a similar calculus, showing a median drop of 5.4% in the S&P 500 over two months could follow a liquidity drawdown of such magnitude, and a 37 basis-point jolt for high-yield credit spreads.\n\nThe sales, set to begin Monday, will rumble through every asset class as they claim an already shrinking supply of money: JPMorgan estimates a broad measure of liquidity will fall $1.1 trillion from about $25 trillion at the start of 2023.\n\n“This is a very big liquidity drain,” says Panigirtzoglou. “We have rarely seen something like that. It’s only in severe crashes like the Lehman crisis where you see something like that contraction.”\n\nIt’s a trend that, together with Fed tightening, will push the measure of liquidity down at an annual rate of 6%, in contrast to annualized growth for most of the last decade, JPMorgan estimates.\n\nThe US has been relying on extraordinary measures to help fund itself in recent months as leaders bickered in Washington. The measure brokered between Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy limits federal spending for two years and suspends the debt ceiling through the 2024 election.\n\nWith default narrowly averted, the Treasury will kick off a borrowing spree that by some Wall Street estimates could top $1 trillion by the end of the third quarter, starting with several Treasury-bill auctions on Monday that total over $170 billion.\n\nWhat happens as the billions wind their way through the financial system isn’t easy to predict. There are various buyers for short-term Treasury bills: banks, money-market funds and a wide swathe of buyers loosely classified as “non-banks.” These include households, pension funds and corporate treasuries.\n\nBanks have limited appetite for Treasury bills right now; that’s because the yields on offer are unlikely to be able to compete with what they can get on their own reserves.\n\nBut even if banks sit out the Treasury auctions, a shift out of deposits and into Treasuries by their clients could wreak havoc. Citigroup modeled historical episodes where bank reserves fell by $500 billion in the span of 12 weeks to approximate what will happen over the following months.\n\n“Any decline in bank reserves is typically a headwind,” says Dirk Willer, Citigroup Global Markets Inc.’s head of global macro strategy.\n\nThe most benign scenario is that supply is swept up by money-market mutual funds. It’s assumed their purchases, from their own cash pots, would leave bank reserves intact. Historically the most prominent buyers of Treasuries, they’ve lately stepped back in favor of better yields on offer from the Fed’s reverse repurchase agreement facility.\n\nThat leaves everyone else: the non-banks. They’ll turn up at the weekly Treasury auctions, but not without a knock-on cost to banks. These buyers are expected to free up cash for their purchases by liquidating bank deposits, exacerbating a capital flight that’s led to a cull of regional lenders and destabilized the financial system this year.\n\nThe government’s growing reliance on so-called indirect bidders has been evident for some time, according to Althea Spinozzi, a fixed-income strategist at Saxo Bank A/S. “In the past few weeks we have seen a record level of indirect bidders during US Treasury auctions,” she says. “It’s likely that they’ll absorb a big part of the upcoming issuances as well.”\n\nFor now, relief about the US avoiding default has deflected attention away from any looming liquidity aftershock. At the same time, investor excitement about the prospects for artificial intelligence has put the S&P 500 on the cusp of a bull market after three weeks of gains. Meanwhile, liquidity for individual stocks has been improving, bucking the broader trend.\n\nBut that hasn’t quelled fears about what usually happens when there’s a marked downturn in bank reserves: Stocks fall and credit spreads widen, with riskier assets carrying the brunt of losses.\n\n“It’s not a good time to hold the S&P 500,” says Citigroup’s Willer.\n\nDespite the AI-driven rally, positioning in equities is broadly neutral with mutual funds and retail investors staying put, according to Barclays Plc.\n\n“We think there will be a grinding lower in stocks,” and no volatility explosion “because of the liquidity drain,” says Ulrich Urbahn, Berenberg’s head of multi-asset strategy. “We have bad market internals, negative leading indicators and a drop in liquidity, which is all not supportive for stock markets.”", "id": "13zly6q", "created_utc": 1685818610.0, "score": 267, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 299, "comments": [{"body": "There is always something to be scared of if you look for it.

{"title": "1969 Recession Started when Unemployment Rate Was 3.5%", "selftext": "When unemployment rate hit 3.4% this year, the headline was saying it's the lowest since 1969, so I looked at what happened in 1969 and after. Turns out we had a mild recession (Dec 1969 - Nov 1970) that lasted 11 months and contracted GDP by 0.6%, and raised unemployment rate to 6.1% from 3.4%. SP500 fell about 37% peak to trough.\n\nFed started hiking rate in Oct 1967 at 3.9% rate, paused in May 1968 at 6.1%, and started cutting by 0.5%, and resumed hiking in Nov 1968, paused in Aug 1969 at 9.1%. Didn't start cutting hard until Feb 1970, 3 months after recession started.\n\nUnemployment was almost 4% in late 1967, dropped to 3.4% by late 1968, and stayed there until Sept 1969, rose to 3.7% for 2 months, then dropped to 3.5% in Nov 1969 for 2 months, then rose to 3.9%, 4.2%, 4.4%, 4.6%, 4.8%, 4.9%, 5% by Jul 1970, and 6.1% by Dec 1970. It seems like once it goes sharply up, the momentum kept going.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInflation started rising in early 1965 (3% in 1965, 4.3% in 1968, peaked at 5.3% in 1969), higher than the average rate of 2% in previous years. Cause was high military spending from Vietnam War and personal consumption after the 1960 crisis. Both government and the Fed had expansionary policy at the time. Demand accelerated much faster than supply, approximately double of US GDP potential and supply side was unable to maintain economy at equilibrium, leading to higher prices. Money supply growth went from 2% in 1964 to 7.3% in 1968.\n\nGov tried to control inflation by reducing spending and raising taxes in Jun 1968. Many economists feared that the measures were too drastic and might lead to a recession. The Fed hiked rates like mentioned above.\n\nIn 1H 1969, growth in spending moderated only slightly from a year earlier. Growth in production, slowed in early 1969. Even with cutback in total output, employment continued to rise and unemployment remained low. Productivity growth slowed. Q3 1969 showed more slowing in econ activity.\n\nConsumer prices rose at 5.1% annual from Jul to Oct 1969, down from 5.9% in 1H 1969. Personal income grew at 4.5% from Aug to Oct 1969, down from 8.8% in the previous 8 months.\n\nIn Dec 1969, during the start of the recession, there was belief that inflation would still be sticky throughout 1970 and for some time after. Economist believed more slowing would be ahead, but unsure of how much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR** : this time period feels like the summer 1969. Fed is close to pausing rate hikes, unemployment has stayed at historical low for about 9 months. There's some slowing in econ activity, and more anticipated slowing ahead, but most people think the inflation fight is far from over. 1969 recession was caused by the Fed hiking rates to fight inflation due to wartime excessive spending and supply unable to keep up with extremely high demand. 1969 was a mild recession, similar to many economist forecasts and even the Fed's staff. People already feared the actions taken to fight inflation might be too much in 1968, more than a year before the recession started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI welcome any discussion and perspective on both sides, but please refrain from dismissing something completely just because of a different viewpoint than yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : this is a disclaimer.

If you assume a -10% decline in SP500 EPS, which is lower than the median of around -15 to -20% EPS for a typical recession (to account for inflation boosting nominal earnings), and put a forward multiple of around 15 (which we did saw briefly in 2022), you can see a scenario where SP500 can reach 3000. And historically in the last 15 years even when interest rate was much lower than the past, a forward PE of 15 is slightly low, but not ultra low.

There was a chance, so valuations had to come down. Now that inflation is nowhere near the highs and decreasing, forward valuations shouldn't be at 15.\n\nSecond, you are now applying a forward metric (15x) to TTM EPS (200 if we get -10%). The forward valuation, even if it goes to 15, should be applied to expectations 1 year later, remember we are already half way through 2023 so investors are already looking towards 2024, and depending on how long the recession if it happens actually lasts, might be only a slight blip. By the analysts' own expectations, we should be at higher than trough valuations, say 17x, the 2024 EPS, 250, giving us 4250, where we are not only fairly valued, but where valuation isn't actually that high and has room to grow as inflation comes down. S&P closed at 4280 on Friday\n\nThird, you are missing that valuations actually increase as we go through the recession because monetary policy will kick in by cutting rates, so yes, earnings can potentially go down but the resulting deflation, which is normal in an actual recession, will actually lead to faster rate cuts and make risk assets more attractive than risk free bonds.\n\n> Those energy/core goods declines don't continue forever.\n\nSome energy declines are heavily lagging. Again, I ask if you have seen a chart of natural gas futures yet? Natural gas is especially important because it indirectly affects 2 other inflation categories that are more sticky, food through fertilizer, and shelter through utilities. I don't think you are appreciating how much US natural gas supply have risen and natural gas prices have crashed. The US has extremely cheap cost of energy and this isn't changing anytime soon. It still hasn't shown up in utilities inflation and puts a lagging downward effect on food commodities and rents, not to mention that a large portion of the S&P 500 industrials can now command higher margin through reduced energy costs.\n\n> Rent isn't the most important factor in sticky inflation.\n\nRent prices affect labor flows and there is no substitution. Some parts of services ex-housing I think are due to pandemic reopening and clearly not a sign of anything permanent or of concern, things like air fares. If this is high it's because people are traveling and eating out, which is overall good for the markets and economy.

The analyst EPS estimate obviously doesn't see a recession, but the analyst EPS estimate vastly depend on company forward guidance, and what company wants to forecast a US recession in their guidance until we actually enter one? (by the way, 12 month forward EPS for SP500 is around 230 on yardeni research). We saw 15 forward PE twice, in June and Sept 2022. June 2022 had 10 year rate comparable to today, but 12 month forward EPS in June 2022 was also higher than Sep 2022. I will say the fair long term forward PE of Sp500 is around 16-16.5.

The point with this comment is that with all of the information out there, the investor, more than perhaps anytime in history, perhaps inarguably, is well enough educated to fight the temptations of getting in and out of the market than any other time in history. Therefore, when you have the bears coming on CNBC and other news outlets, it doesn't much matter because the mentality of buying and holding is there as, empirically, there is no place for the market to go but UP over the course of time. (Subsequently, the \"BEARS\" have been caught extremely offside for the recent run, sticking to T-bills, energy and cyclicals while the stocks they were shorting, technology, have skyrocketed). \n\nLastly, and perhaps this gets us to a place where the market does eventually have a severe \"crash\", is the one place that most don't believe it to be: The US government and the debt (which at current levels is about $94,000 per American citizen). The deficit, and therefore the debt, are skyrocketing --- on a positive note, as long as that is happening it is going to be a compliment to index funds, and thereby stocks, going up, however, when the inevitable day of reckoning comes, (where the debt holders of Treasuries OR the Politicians running the country realize that our interest expense on the debt is comparably the same OR exceeds the cost of Social Security ($1.2 trillion a year), then you're going to see fiscal responsibility come to the table, when that happens, that could be the most obvious \"black swan\" event and ABSOLUTELY will be horrible for stocks but extremely advantageous for bond holders, I could speculate. \n\nIn the end, no one truly knows, but, as you did in your post, one can always speculate.

In terms of biological sex, women typically have two X chromosomes (XX), although there are some exceptions due to certain intersex variations. Women generally possess reproductive anatomy that includes structures such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, a uterus, and a vagina. They also typically have secondary sexual characteristics like breasts and generally higher levels of estrogen compared to men.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the definition of womanhood encompasses more than just biological factors. Gender identity is also a significant aspect. Some individuals assigned female at birth may not identify as women, while others who were assigned male at birth may identify as women. Gender identity is a deeply personal and individual experience, and it may not always align with an individual's biological sex.\n\nSocietal and cultural factors also play a role in defining womanhood. Different cultures have varying expectations, roles, and norms associated with being a woman. These can include social, behavioral, and psychological aspects, as well as gender roles and expectations.\n\nIt's important to recognize that gender is a complex and diverse spectrum, and individuals may identify and express their gender in different ways.

This is a view held by many individual investors.\n\nIt is also worth considering whether Elon's behavior might be a net positive.

For decades Disney and Pixar have been incorporating positive lessons on REAL inclusion, acceptance and tolerance in their films. The question is, will they have the confidence to keep true to what build that brand, or will they go chasing after fool's golf of the fashionable social trends of the day.\n\nBob Iger wasn't brought back just come back to get the cost structure under control, the Board brought him back to reel in the disastrous lurch into wokism and divisive extremist identity politics, as that threatens to tarnish and impair that brand equity. Ironically, it is only Disney that can destroy the priceless Disney brand. The jury is out on whether they will.\n\nWhen they bought ESPN, it was the most powerful franchise in broadcast. But it lurched so far off the rails into racism and wokism that a huge part of its brand equity has been vaporized, and its viewership numbers have been massively flushed. I can't begin to tell you how many people I know who were huge ESPN \"addicts,\" who are apolitical, middle of the road type people who eventually gave up and have gone elsewhere, they found it so unwatchable. Can Disney purge the extremist wokism from the ESPN brand before it tails into irrelevance? Warner Brothers Discovery faces a similar challenge with CNN. WBD has done a major purge, but they may have waited too late. It may never recover. I don't think it's too late for ESPN, but they're going to have to make a move.\n\nIronically, a lot this depends on whether Iger has the mettle and good sense to rise above the button-punching divisiveness of the artificial political \"battles.\" He has a big ego. It's in Disney's long term interest that he not take the DeSantis bait and stoop to engaging with him. DeSantis is not going to stop trying to suck him into a fight, so that Disney can become a prop for political divisiveness. Iger needs to ignore him, rather than knee-jerk in the opposite direction.\n\nIf Disney can stick to the timeless themes that built the brand, it's going to do just fine over the long haul. If not, the jury's out.\n\nI'd add one other thing ... there's an unanswered question as to whether Iger really understands that old media companies are going to have to transition to new platforms.
