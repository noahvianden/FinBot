And if you don't mind sharing, I'd love to see your portfolio. Thanks either way!", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Here are all my small/mid cap companies / ETFs:\n\n## Individual Stocks:\n\nFormat: Ticker, Percent of portfolio, Market cap, Description.\n\n- $AMR, 3.4%, $2.1B MC. Met coal. My largest individual position that isn't an ETF. In US, export to world.\n- $BTU, 1.9%, $2.7B MC. Met/thermal coal, in US and Australia. Exports to Asia.\n- $UFPI, 1%, $5.2B MC. Lumber products (packaging, roof trusses, decks, pallets...), more of mid cap. \n- $EOSE, 0.9%, $290M MC. Non-lithium battery for long duration energy storage.\n- $CLFD, 0.9%, $620M MC. Fiber development related products\n- $CF, 0.8%, $12.3B MC. Nitrogen fertilizers.\n- $APPS, 0.3%, $940M MC. Digital ads on phones (bloatware), app downloads.\n- $RKLB, 0.3%, $2.4B MC. Small satellite launches.\n- $OLPX, 0.2%, $2.3B MC. Hair products.\n\n\n## ETFs:\n\nFormat: Ticker, Percent of portfolio, Description.\n\n- $AVUV, 11%. US small cap value.\n- $AVDV, 8%. ex-US developed small cap value\n- $PSCE, 2.5%. Small cap energy--mostly oil & gas.\n\n## General Commentary\n\nI see the largest upside and highest risk on $EOSE. A highly speculative microcap, it is priced as an imminent bankruptcy. However, it awaits a Department of Energy loan that is possibly the size of its market cap if not more. Should the loan work out, the stock is a possible 5x (or more), but otherwise, the stock could go straight to 0. The thesis heavily relies on billions of dollars of subsidies authorized in the Inflation Reduction Act. I'm buying in the $1-$2 range. This is the only possible short-term (< 1 year) play on price action, but if the loan comes through I'm in it for 2-3 years.\n\nI view $BTU/$AMR as 2x or 3x opportunities within 2 years. This relies on met and thermal coal prices recovering from this year's carnage. Their enormous FCF will enable buybacks of more than 20-50% of the float. $AMR is the safer play here since it is a pure met coal play (met coal is for steel, while thermal coal is for heating/energy). It also much better management than $BTU. $BTU is more of a turnaround play, thus riskier, but also possibly more upside as a result. It would thrive in a future energy crisis. $AMR is a strong buy in the $130s/140s as we seem to be nearing the worst of the met coal sell-offs. I am adding to $BTU under $20 (my cost basis is closer to $23-24). AMR is a long term hold, BTU is a 2-3 year hold most likely. The bull case for BTU is in coal usage in Asia, not the US--its US sales are low margin. You can be bearish coal usage in the US while also anticipating high coal demand from China, India, Africa, etc.\n\n$CLFD has been devastated recently due to cyclical pull back in fiber/broadband spending, but I think if you can look past 6 months from now, it has strong tailwinds of federal subsidies + private sector spending on rural broadband. It is profitable, and has strong financials. Possible 2x or 3x from today's price within 2 years. Strong buy under $40, reasonable buy under $50. Agnostic on length of holding it, and will wait to see how industry trends after a year.\n\nBrief comments on the rest: UFPI is a steady compounder, with robust financials, conservative growth, but it's not going to 2x instantly. It grows by acquisition. I would buy in low $70s or $60s. Probably medium/long term hold. CF is a cyclical play, and I will sell after a 30-50% run-up once fertilizer prices swing the other way. I am only adding in $60s or lower. APPS/OLPX I am bagholding and have minimal conviction in. Will sell on run-ups. I hold RKLB for the memes.\n\nFrom my ETFs: $AVUV/$AVDV are part of the core of my portfolio (with VTI/VXUS) and my main regular contribution. I will hold for life. $PSCE isn't a great ETF, but it's my way of taking a bet on the  price of crude oil going up, smaller companies getting acquired by oil majors/supermajors, and making a contrarian play on a heavily discounted subsector within energy (which is already very cheap). I haven't done the research to pick individual small cap oil E&Ps. Will hold for 2-4 years at least.

The Bank of Canada has surprised many by raising its interest rates in June 2023. It had been pausing its rate hikes for about four months, starting from January 2023.\n2. This was unexpected for most economists, with 67% surveyed by Reuters and 80% surveyed by Bloomberg not predicting this rate hike. This has resulted in some turbulence in the stock market.\n3. This decision came after Canada's Q1 GDP growth rate exceeded expectations (predicted 2.3%, actual 3.1%) and inflation increased in April 2023 for the first time in 10 months.\n4. The Bank of Canada's action is now leading to speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) might also raise rates sooner than anticipated.\n5. Despite similarities, there are key differences between the U.S. and Canada. The U.S. Q1 GDP beat was less significant (predicted 1.1%, actual 1.3%), and inflation has not reignited in the same way as in Canada. Furthermore, the Fed hasn't paused its rate hikes yet.\n6. Wallstreet now has speculative thoughts about Canada's financial strategy, suggesting that Canada might try to align its rates with the U.S., to create a sense of economic parity between the two countries.\n7. However, it's unclear how directly the Bank of Canada's decision will impact the Fed's actions, and this uncertainty led to some market volatility.\n8.  \"If you spend more than 13 minutes analyzing economic and market forecasts, you've wasted 10 minutes.\" - Peter Lynch", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "🥇", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Woah thanks!!!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "No problem. 🚀", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So Peter Lynch recommends spending up to 3 minutes analyzing economic and market forecasts?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It's starting to feel like the old days.\n\nI'm also feeling slightly less clownish about selling NVDA for TSLA, since I sold TSLA is up 37% and NVDA is up 39%.", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "I just noticed the awards.

These stocks now hold weight of some 30-40% in all of the indexs. The whole point of an index is for it be equal weight so that if apple posts a missed revenue and weak guidance and drops 30% that it doesn't tank growth for the next 3 years on your index fund investments. \n\nAlmost every other stock in the market including real money makers that have solid balance sheets and recession proof products or services are trading 40% lower than they were a year ago. \n\nSo there are two big points to make here. \n\n1. You cherry picked data and used recent massive run ups in the last 3-4 weeks as your primary data source to say we are going to continue to go up. Which is stupid but also would be illegal if you were in finance. \n\n2. It's ironic that you don't realize the statement you just made is the perfect illustration as to why we will crash a good 20-30% and it's going to be almost entirely the stocks you just mentioned. \n\nNvidia is trading at 200 times its earnings. In a normal market with the absolute highest potential growth a PE ratio should never exceed 80-90. 80 quarters is 20 years. That's fucking insane. A normal PE ratio for a good growth company and solid balance sheet is normally 24. \n\nTesla at 64\nMicrosoft at 36\nApple at 30\nGoogle at 28 \n\n\nSo you can see how Google, apple and Microsoft are way closer to that normal PE ratio and have huge fortresses of a balance sheet. If they take a haircut of 10% each they'll be at market value. Because those 3 have a weight of close to 15% of the spy, the spy will take a haircut to about 385. When Tesla and Nvidia come back to earth, that's what you're gonna see spy hit 350s. This all assumes the rest of the market stays flat.

{"title": "MicroVision, a run of epic proportions", "selftext": "I'm sure you have already heard about MicroVision before. There are many controversial opinions on it, but I wanted to offer quick TA on it and a couple of exciting pieces of information about the stock you may or may not know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MicroVision's Bull Flag \\/ Bull Pennant \\(LOG CHART\\)](https://preview.redd.it/9oix5idqqh4b1.png?width=1560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d37d0ab27e7a7a42edc141c52665add1b95908c2)\n\nAbove you can see that MicroVision ran from $.15 to $28 and fell all the way back down to $1.82. The run followed by the drop depicts an almost perfect bull flag. I personally have been waiting for this breakout for about 7 months, knowing that the breakout would bring epic proportions. At this point, one would ask, \"is it too late?\" \"Can I still get in\". Obviously that answer is up to each individual (invest at your own risk). BUT I would like to explain what exactly this breakout could mean for microvision over the next 12 months. Or to be exact, by June 17th 2024. A bull flag breakout's price target is the length of the previous run, added to the breakout point. Our run was 18000%, and our breakout point was roughly $2.42. This then brings us to a price target of $461.28.\n\nYes, that does sound LUDICROUS. But MicroVision is positioned to win multiple OEM contracts THIS SUMMER. MicroVision produces Automotive Lidar (as one of their verticals) and the total addressable market between now and 2030 is $82Billion. MicroVision also has 4 other verticals, totaling the TAM to roughly $200B between now and 2030. I believe that with the current breakout, and extreme growth the market is about to see, MicroVision could continue to run to the price target that we see now formed by the bull flag.\n\nThe bull flag has not only been confirmed with the shape of the graph, but we also received a high volume day @ 33M shares traded, the current daily, weekly and monthly graphs all show string continuation on the RSIs and MACD's and the Bollinger Bands on the weekly have stretched further than... anyways, the momentum for this thing to run for months... or even years is there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MicroVision's lifespan and potential breakout of 20 year downtrend](https://preview.redd.it/0iebtf7lqh4b1.png?width=1560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c703ad590f758e81cb4f88a500aea275c0c410f)\n\nHere is the lifespan of MicroVisions stock. There is still a LOT of room left for a run, and if the stock breaks above the $20 \\~ mark, there is open water for MILES above.\n\nI know you WSB nerds love to hear about shorts. Currently there are zero short shares available with 47 million shares sold short (175 million float). With our 30% run day TODAY, every single short position is down 30% or more. Some with borrow fees over 50%. This play has been a no brainer to me. MicroVision has over 750 patents, and even has a partnership with Microsoft. Their IP is cited all across the tech world and they have been grossly undervalued.\n\nAbove all, I believe that this stock can hit triple digits without WSB laying a finger on it, but, the more the merrier right?\n\nCall me Dippy, because I bought the dip for 2 years waiting on this exact moment.\n\nSince the mods require positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Since the mods require positions, here is one of my account holdings of MVIS](https://preview.redd.it/fwfobzfnzh4b1.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ef6efddc5ba0ef8ed46011a4ac9cd03e32e5fe28)", "id": "142ya8z", "created_utc": 1686097922.0, "score": 209, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|91|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: MicroVision is about to take off and make a lot of people here a lot of money.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Been saying it for months now.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Ive watched several people here on wsb over the last 2 months sing its praises.

Yes.\n\nIs it entirely because of VR? No.\n\nThere's too much information and history pointing to VR being a flop. It's a technology that is worth developing but it's just *not quite there yet*. Again, AAPL hasn't cracked the code on this... yet.\n\nI say yet, because they actually have a strong shot at taking this technology to the next level, and the reason why is because of their steady focus on size reduction, aesthetic and face tracking technology. We use our faces to express ourselves, this is a major stumbling block in VR where while it may be entertaining, there's still the ever-present feeling that you're either in costume or hanging out with a bunch of puppets. Size and aesthetic are just a given, the current headsets on the market look ridiculous and uncool.\n\nApple is also arguably better at monetization than Facebook has been, and I strongly believe that metaverse developers will step up their game to meet any extra demand brought on by AAPL products, which will increase competition and enrich the community. If you look at the situation as an economist, we all know monopolies aren't efficient in the long run. We need more players in the game like AAPL to spur on further innovation.\n\nDespite all that, that's still not the reason AAPL is bullish in my book. Apple has continued to deepen its ties to financial technology and offers a card backed by Goldman Sachs, the second largest bank *in the world.* Goldman Sachs is a titan in the financial industry and has backing from some of the most elite supporters such as Blackrock and Vanguard.\n\nThe apple card that I mentioned above is made all the more useful with its integration through apple pay, this might not sound like a major innovation but it's a strong addition to the Apple ecosystem of technology from a business standpoint. Apple earns money on interest paid on these cards, which will likely provide small but stable profit for years to come.\n\nDoes this lead me to believe that AAPL is a rocket?
