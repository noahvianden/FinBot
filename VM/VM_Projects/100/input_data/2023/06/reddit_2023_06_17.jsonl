This is a strategy that rarely beats the market, and that 66% of people lose money doing. If thats what you are doing, you would probably be better served buying and holding some nasdaq index fund, thats also up 40% ytd. Actual theta strategies try to collect on the premium on options generated by market volatility and do not depend on the direction the stock moves. Kind of how when a broker gives you margin, he makes interest on the margin and doesnt care which way your stocks go as long as you stay within margin requirements.\n\nMake no mistake, options in the short run are a zero sum game, so buying and selling them with a short time horizon will net you zero $ on average. If youre options go up someone else is losing money on that option. The reason you are able to still generate profits off of options is through the systematic risk premium you are recieving when selling an option. This premium is paid for the price insurance the option provides, not for guessing the movement of the stock correctly. Assuming that the market accurately expects the price of an instrument through the current price (efficient market hypothesis) no one should be willing to spend more than the current price on anything, however in practice we can see that people are willing to pay a premium to lower the risk of fluctuations especially downside risk in the future by buying options. So the seller of the options is the one who recieves the premium, whereas the buyer of options pays it, kind of like how you pay a premium for your car insurance.\n\nSince in the long run stocks have always gone up, it can make sense to harvest this premium if you are holding the underlying anyway and generate premium this way. Seeing as the market tends to go up, selling puts on assets that you hold long, would on average increase your return since people are paying you a premium for the insurance against downside. This is a long term strategy and requires sufficient liquidity to avoid getting margin called\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHeres a great paper for you to read about the risk premium and strategies to harvest it: [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/faculty-of-natural-sciences/department-of-mathematics/math-finance/Shibo\\_Lu\\_01210524.pdf](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/faculty-of-natural-sciences/department-of-mathematics/math-finance/Shibo_Lu_01210524.pdf)\n\nmay not be as flashy as betting big on NVDA but will definitely return more in the long run", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "I understand how theta harvesting works, thank you.\n\n>The reason you are able to still generate profits off of options is through the systematic risk premium you are recieving when selling an option.

In California, avocado growers are provided daily field quotes, on a per pound basis, for most fruit. These quotes are based on the variety, size, and grade of California avocados and are calculated based on our expectations of how much we believe we will sell the fruit for, less our anticipated costs and desired margin. Ultimately, we pay/settle with our California growers once a month. The purchase price we pay for fruit acquired from Mexican growers is generally negotiated for substantially all the fruit in a particular grove. The Mexican avocado crop will typically have three to four blooms in a single year. Once a purchase price is agreed to on a daily basis, the fruit is then harvested and delivered to our packinghouses located in Mexico. Based on the size and quality of the fruit harvested, the final settlement with the grower on the respective day‚Äôs harvest takes place approximately 14 to 21 days later. We also purchase fruit directly from third-party Mexican packers as a supplemental source to balance inventory or fulfill priority sales orders. In such cases, the already packed fruit may not be packed in a Calavo label but will be packed to our standards for shipment to either our customers‚Äô or our operating facilities.
