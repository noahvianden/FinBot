{"title": "Don’t Trade Options", "selftext": "If you don’t have a written plan. The goal of this post is to share personal mistakes in my early trading to hopefully encourage others down a different path. \n\nPeople tend to hate those kind of statements because it makes us feel inadequate and that we’re doing something wrong. However, I can unequivocally say, transitioning from trading off the dome to writing a plan is massive and probably one of the largest changes to my trading success. \n\nI started trading in high school, so I scoffed at the idea of having to write things out. I figured I could just look at my logs, adjust based on what I saw, and do just fine. Looking back 16 years, I want to slap my cocky naive self. \n\nOptions are incredibly complex products. And millions of people try their hand at it and we know the majority fail. The arrogance I had, thinking that as late teen, early 20 year old I would just be able to successfully deploy without a written plan or log is literally wild. \n\nIf the idea sounds like work and annoying to do - you’re spot fucking on. AS IT SHOULD BE. Just because the barrier to enter into trading is SO LOW, don’t allow that to lull you into a false sense of security. \n\nThe real benefit of a trading plan isn’t using the finished plan as a reference, although it is a good one. The benefit comes from the rigor put into creating one and the exercise itself. Similar to when I was giving a 5 paragraph order as a Marine Officer - I very rarely would crack open my plan to remind myself what to do in a scenario. I didn’t need to because I knew it cold from building and delivering the plan. Same exact goes for trading. \n\nIf you have a plan or pieces of one and want some feedback, post it here and let’s have a constructive dialogue about them. If you don’t have one, below is a simple outline to get you started. \n\n1. Orientation. What is the goal of your trading? This should be quantified. We should also force ourself to answer: Is my goal realistic? WHY do I think it is? How can I track whether it is or not?\n\n2. Portfolio deployment. How do you intend to use your portfolio, manage risk, assess markets, etc. \n\n3. Tools. This can be everything from notes, TA/FA tools, chart setups, market functions, etc. \n\n4. Strategy Outlines. This breaks the strategy down into a full lifecycle, in depth. What’s the idea of the strat? How does it make money? How does it lose? How do you manage PnL? How does that affect expectancy? What deltas do you use? Why? How do you scale?\n\n5. Tracking. This is where we track and quantify our ideas, questions, and assumptions. This enables unbiased analysis and optimization. \n\n6. Audits. I’m a firm believer in having people I respect look over my work to poke holes, identify gaps, confirm rigor. \n\nYes it’s work. Yes it’s worth it. This is how I’ve maintained a 20% CAGR for over 15 years.\n\n\nEDIT: It seems we need to add context, because many have a broken sense of market potential. \n\n>I see “20% would make him one of the best money managers” or “there’s no way someone can make that return” or “you did that during a bull market, who cares”\n\n-This mindset simply gives ourselves an “out” on our own performance and is a lazy way to excuse ourselves from actually trying to get better. \n\n-If we chalk something up to luck, chance, or throw it away as impossible, there’s no imperative for us to look more closely at ourselves. \n\n-Moreover, you’ll find that fund managers are the wrong benchmark to compare good performance against. They tend to underperform for many reasons. \n\n-I highly encourage you to monitor the results of the US Investing Championship. I have for years. I am a solid, consistent trader and am proud of my performance but this will give you a much better idea of what “really good” looks like. \n\n-To elucidate the point, let’s take a look at 2023 YTD USIC performance:\n\n1. Erik. 17% \n\n2. Money manager, top (3) returns:\n    a. Stock division: 22.7%, 15.4%, 12.8%\n    b. Enhanced growth (derivatives): 16.8%, 14.6%\n\n3. Non-money Manger, top (3) returns:\n    a. Stock division: 121.8%, 90.7%, 89.2%\n    b. Enhanced growth (derivatives): 182.7%, 65%, 38.2%\n\nI hope people take the time to do research on what’s possible, what’s likely, etc. I couldn’t care less what people think about my performance, but I’m hoping to open people’s minds to using real information to create their perception of possibility vs repeating what they’ve heard somewhere.", "id": "14fsp3e", "created_utc": 1687406296.0, "score": 95, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "\"I started trading in high school\"\n\n\"This is how I’ve maintained a 20% CAGR for over 15 years.\"\n\nSo, you have been part of the 15 year Zero-interest rate Bull market since the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nI don't want to threadcrap but this looks like some Options + Motivational Seminar combo.", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "…stock market CAGR over the same “zero interest rate bull market” time period is ~9%.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Eric\n\nI have watched 49 of your videos including the latest on the Simplified Covered Strangle.\n\nI really triple watched the Original 3-part Covered Strangle video series to understand thoroughly what you were doing.\n\nBUT, my point is that I didn't have to write down a thesis to start a Covered Strangle on a stock/index.", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "Are you talking about buying options or selling options?

Earlier this year it had offered a conditional loan of $2bn to Redwood Materials for a battery materials plant, and in April it offered a $3bn partial loan guarantee to Sunnova Energy for a solar and battery storage project.", "id": "14g95qy", "created_utc": 1687454327.0, "score": 617, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "Wonder who might get the contract to build these.

Thus, it may not be present in the release candidate.\n\nSome changes, notably the exterior lights, are not expected to receive any significant changes.\n\nLastly, expect seat changes that aim to improve ride comfort and, in testing, reduce vibrations experienced in prior generations. Other changes have been made to provide a more comfortable experience.\n\nThis is paramount for both ride-sharing and robo-taxi in the following years.\n\nSo, the elephant in the room! With all these upgrades, you'd expect that Tesla will be increasing the price of the Model 3 (Highland)?\n\nWhile we've not received anything concrete to confirm or deny this, we're confident Highland will be priced similarly to the current generation.\n\nVia improvements throughout the entire manufacturing process, Highland delivers a brand new experience, all while accomplishing insane cost-savings for the company and customers.\n\nIt will be yet another \"hardcore smackdown\" to gas-powered cars, as often said by @elonmusk. 👍\n\nNow let's get serious. When is the Highland launching? Sadly, that's a confusing topic. 😥\n\nWith multiple delays already occurring, we've received conflicting opinions from the employees we've spoken to.

It has 100% correlation in terms of when banks tighten past a certain level on the SLOOS report for more than 2 quarters, that there is a hard landing recession afterward.  Most people on here try and find one big event that could cause markets to pull back and that is impossible to predict.

Let's put PayPal and FedNow to the side and look at some other payment rails. Visa and Mastercard charge 2.29% + $0.5 to process a transaction. ACH charges $0.5 only. ACH was introduced in the 70s and its much cheaper for merchants since they don't have to pay a percentage of revenue, so why is that ACH has not killed off credit cards? Think very carefully about exactly why that is, and what Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal are selling and who they are selling it to. (As a hint, contrary to the popular belief they are not actually selling processing).\n\nI think its also important to think through PayPal's cost structure. Lets take a look at Venmo, its unprofitable specifically because it has to process ACH transfers which costs $0.5 per transfer. Lets say that banks switch to FedNow over ACH to process cross account transfers. You are going to see Venmo's P2P expenses drop 90% as processing fees fall from $0.5 to $0.05. Its not just the case for Venmo, PayPal's BNPL transactions are also 80-90% ACH according to Schulman, thats another 90% reduction in transaction expense there.\n\nI don't know how FedNow will affect the payments space in the long term, the space itself is very complex.
