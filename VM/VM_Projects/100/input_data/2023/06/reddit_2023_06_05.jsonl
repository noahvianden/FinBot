Looking at the option chain, every expiry has an IV of over 200%.\n\nThis suggests that the 500% gain was sudden and recent. IV over 200% means options traders are expecting even more gains (or equal sized losses) over the next year. If the stock had gradually grown to 500% gain, that would be shown as a lower IV.\n\n> So, I buy puts with 200% IV 2-3 months out. Assuming the stock does happen to drop 50% next week, do these contracts still experience IV burn?\n\nYou mean IV crush? Very likely, yes. As I said above, the 200% IV means the market is anticipating a large gain OR loss. Once the 50% loss happens, that prediction is confirmed. That means all the guys paying 200% IV premium for *calls* were wrong, or at least, there is now evidence that their forecast was in the wrong direction and/or the wrong size. That means those guys will be *less likely* to pay an excess premium for more calls. That should make IV contract.\n\nSince the move to the downside was only 50%, not the whole 500%, that would probably also make the put buyers want to pay less for puts, since they may believe that most of the downside move has already happened.\n\nBut it's possible that the put buyers think a much larger downside move will happen, in which case they may bid up put premiums and keep IV high. So it's not a guarantee IV will move down.\n\n> Would these contracts lose money regardless of how far the puts are now ITM because the IV is so high?\n\nNot necessarily. The way to think about is that the excess time value premium you paid is a sunk cost. Until you make up that sunk cost, you can't break even. So if the intrinsic value gain on the put is larger than your sunk cost, you are in profit land. You will stay in profit land no matter what IV does after that point, **because you can't lose more to IV than the time value you paid for at open.**\n\nSame goes for theta decay.\n\nFWIW, I would not go long on puts or calls when IV is more than 50%, let alone 200%.

There has arisen an an unfortunate trend of misusing the term to mean \"when you let a spread expire with the underlying in between the two strikes.\"\n\nPin risk is the uncertainty of not knowing whether or not you will be assigned because the underlying's price is hovering right around--\"pinned\" at--the strike.  This happens because if there is a particular strike with high open interest, the phenomenon of market makers hedging their positions exerts market pressure on the price of the stock to keep it exactly at that strike.  Thus, the stock is \"pinned,\" as a wrestler to a mat, or a flyer to a bulletin board.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinningthestrike.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinningthestrike.asp)\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinrisk.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinrisk.asp)\n\nSome have dubbed what you are talking about \"expiration risk.\"  But even here, you're misunderstanding it.  It doesn't apply to fully ITM debit spreads.  In a call debit spread, the short strike is higher than the long strike.  So if the short is ITM, so is the long.  If you allow it to expire this way, you will be assigned on the short, selling 100 shares at that strike, and the long will automatically be exercised, buying 100 shares at that strike, leading to max profit on the spread.\n\nThere is still a risk, though.  If the stock's spot price is only slightly higher than the short strike at 4pm, but then dips below it before 5:30, some longs may cancel their exercise, leading to your not being assigned.  Your long would still be exercised, though, so you would buy 100 shares at that strike.

Whereas closer to expiration if the active delta range is only $3 wide, a $1 move of the underlying could move delta by 50 points or more.\n\nGamma represents that \"cover more ground\" effect of delta as the active delta range narrows.\n\n> SECOND OBSERVATION:\n\nThere are other greeks and inputs at work here, and delta and gamma are both affected by these other factors, like volatility. Volatility is rarely a flat line in value. It's usually a curve, and the curve can be tilted in a way that makes ITM gamma more than OTM gamma for equal distance from 50 delta, or vice versa.\n\nThere's also strike alignment at work here. The underlying price is rarely perfectly aligned with the ATM strike such that delta can be 50 (or whatever the vol/rho adjusted value of 50 delta would be). What you are seeing could simply be a sampling error due to misalignment of strikes to the spot price.\n\n> IV will be higher the further a contract goes OTM\n\nAnd usually ITM as well, but like I said, this curve can be tilted.\n\n> The further you go OTM = lower delta, higher gamma\n\nNo, lower gamma also, all else equal. It looks like a bell curve centered on 50 delta.\n\nHere's a graphical depiction: https://www.merrilledge.com/investment-products/options/learn-understand-gamma-options\n\n> is it correct to assume that the OTM strike would have a sharper move than the ATM and ITM contracts because because the gamma is higher relative to delta?\n\nNo, given that you set volatility \"aside\".

The \"sweet spot\" for risk/reward on average is 30 delta spreads that earn at least 1/3 of the spread width (33.333333...%).

We plug-in $.34 as the win$ for a $1 wide spread width and then solve for win% in the *implied break-even expected value* equation.\n\nEV = (win% x win$) - (lose% x lose$)\n\nlose% = 100% - win%\n\nlose$ = spread width - win$\n\nWe set EV to 0 for break-even, spread width to $1 and win$ to $.34, then solve for win%.\n\n0 = (win% x $.34) - ((100% - win%) x ($1 - $.34))\n\n(100% - win%) x $.66 = win% x $.34\n\n(100% - win%) / win% = $.34 / $.66\n\n(100% / win%) - 1 = 1/2 (approximately, and win% must be > 0)\n\n100% / win% = 1.5\n\n100% / 1.5 = win%\n\nwin% = 66.6666667% ~= 67%\n\nSo in order to break-even on $1 wide credit spreads that pay $.34 in credit, we need a win% of **at least** 67%.

{"title": "Is The Bear Market Over? Will The Economy Fool Everyone and Not Go into Recession? Where Do Oil Stocks Go from Here?", "selftext": "I recently wrote an article that startled me with its reaction. Over 330,000 people read it in two days on Reddit alone. It was We Have Had 2 Recessions And 2 Bear Markets in 3 Years, Will It Be 3 In Just 4 Years?   I suggest reading it first.  It starts with \"I have watched the stock market since the 1970s. Never in my life have I seen so many people think a recession was coming before. Yet this has gone on for about 9 months, and still no recession. \"\n\nThis Friday, 6-2-2023, was a breakout day for both the SP500 and the Russell 2000 (small caps).  The SP500 did a Cup and Handle breakout and the Russell a flat bottom base breakout.  The NASDAQ 100 has already broken out, for a while.  Yes, there are all sorts of bad things and stock valuations are poor.  But does that mean the stock market will not go up?  Look at 2020 and 2021 as recent examples of bad problems and extremely high valuations, and the stock market still went up big anyway.  We have had two bear markets in the last 3 years, a rare event. One other factor. Oil stocks are at arguably the best valuations ever and maybe the best sector valuation ever.  The Russell small caps recently made new lows in its ongoing bear market, which after Friday, is maybe over.  The Russell blew away the NASDAQ on Friday, in terms of gains.\n\nWhat happened on Friday? Well, the debt ceiling was kicked down the road as it always is and the Jobs report fooled everyone again This has been going on for about 9 months now, with almost everyone bearish and expecting a recession.  The jobs market is actually hot.  This was not predicted at all.\n\nI totally agree with people like Danny Moses, Guy Adami, Carter Worth and Dan Nathan that point out all the bad things as they do in this video, but does that mean we will crash, as they have been expecting for months?  They do a good job of making the bear case, but then what happened? The next day the Russell broke out of that range they talked about containing it, on their chart.  YouTube link to that will be in comments.\n\n**So, will the economy fool everyone and not go into recession?  Maybe, and sure has so far.**\n\n**To the last question Where Do Oil Stocks Go from Here?**  This one I am much surer of; in my opinion they will go into a historic bull market.  I have already experienced one, having bought them heavily in 2020 COVID crash.  Received several 10x and 20x movers and just about any oil stock did a 5x in that rally.\n\nHere is a happy story of what is possible in such bull markets in oil stocks.  I bought Cardinal, a Canadian oil stock. Got a 20 bagger and now it has a 1% a month roughly dividend.  Yes, that means I am roughly getting 200% yearly dividends now and have been getting them for a while.  And in the last month have bought more Cardinal. At 1% dividend a month on a 4 PE stock with a CROIC of 30%, it is still a great deal. The valuations are better now than in 2020 for oil stocks.  Back then they were in danger of going under, but dirt cheap.  Now dirt cheap at higher prices, yet much higher safety with wonderful balance sheets and cash flows.\n\nThese two charts show that oil stocks are dirt cheap and spending less on CapEx than ever before, as a percent of Cash Flow.  This time is different, they are not overinvesting as they did every time before when oil went over $100.   Again, link in comments.\n\nEric Nuttal, who runs Canada's biggest oil stock fund, talked about the coming oil stock bull market in a recent video.  About how buybacks can drive a $20 oil stocks to over $1 million a share, unless they go up greatly before the buyouts complete.  Do not scoff, he is right.  He makes the case for oil stocks and high cashflow oil stock buybacks so well in this video, I will not comment myself.  The whole thing is worth viewing, but this link starts where he talks buybacks.\n\nOn buybacks will do some math here.  In this case if a stock started at $20 a share, $1 billion FCF and mkt cap of $3 billion = 150 million shares you will get to $1 billion a share in 3 years if 100% of FCF goes to buybacks and stock does not go up before then. If it rerates to 9x FCF after 1 year then was 3x FCF, 33% of stock removed = 100,000,000 shares and $9 billion market cap = $90 a share a 4.5 X gain in one year.\n\nReality today June 2023 is the best, we have had big buybacks and prices have stayed about the same in last 12 months on oil stocks. Debt is way down, so they have more money for buybacks.\n\nSo, let's go 1 more year at current prices. $1 billion FCF is spent buying back stock. That is 50% of stock left, so now just 50,000,000 shares left. Then it goes to 9 FCF (still cheaper than avg stock out there) so $9 billion mkt cap / 50,000,000 shares left = $180 a share, so a X gain. Pretty good.\n\nLet's go 1 more year. Let's say the market was as stupid as it was in 6-2022 to 6-2023 and price stays the same. That means the remaining 50,000,000 shares are bot back, except for just 1 share. Then it goes to 9 X FCF = $9 billion mkt cap and 1 share = $9 Billion a share.  A 450 million times gain.  This will not happen because eventually the market wakes up to how stupid it has been after 10?, 20?, 50? times increase in earnings per share, and it rerates the stock way higher, until it no longer is worth buying back.  In fact, the company might sell some back for 20 times more than they bought it for, if it makes sense to.  Also, if a company gets 2/3s of its stock back, then its EPS going forward, for every Q, will be 3 times higher.\n\nAs an example of what can happen with buybacks with far inferior cashflows, and valuations is Teledyne.  George Roberts, who worked alongside Singleton, described the experience like this:\n\nHenry was quoted as saying, with a laugh, “In October, 1972, we tendered for one million shares and 8.9 million came in. We took them all at $20 and figured it was a fluke, and that we couldn’t do it again. But instead of going up, our stock went down. So we kept tendering, first at $14 and then doing two bonds-for-stock swaps. Every time one tender was over the stock would go down and we’d tender again, and we’d get a new deluge. Then two more tenders at $18 and $40.”\n\nThe first six buybacks were all in the period from 1972 to 1976. The market reacted adversely to this at first, not understanding what Henry was accomplishing. But as the number of shares went down and the company’s operating income continued to grow, the earnings per share increased rapidly and dramatically. In 1970, net income per share was $1.64. By 1975 it was $6.09 per share; in 1976, $10.79; and in 1977, $16.23 per share.\n\nWith the first six stock buybacks, a total of some 22 million Teledyne share were repurchased, reducing the number of outstanding common shares to less than 12 million. A seventh stock buyback offer was made in 1980 and the final one in 1984, at the extraordinarily high price of $200 per share. This was about $30 above the current market price and eight million shares were bought back. By September of that year the stock had climbed to $302 per share and was the highest priced stock on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe total value of these buybacks was over $2.5 billion, and more than 85 percent of common shares were retired. Shares outstanding had dropped from 88,827,372 in 1971 to 22,564,756 in 1980. Henry also purchased another 5 percent of Teledyne shares on the open market at various times, bringing the buyback total in the years 1972-1984 to over 90 percent of the company’s shares.\n\nSingleton eventually paid off the debt used to buy back shares. By 1985, net income per share was $46.66. The buybacks created a compounding effect on earnings per share.\n\nRemember oil stocks that are doing, or about to do, buybacks are at about 3-7 times better valuations than Teledyne, so they can compound better.  Teledyne was never in a position to buy back at a fast enough rate, so that all of their stock could be bought back in 3-4 years, just with free cash flow.  So, Teledyne was not even close to being able to do what oil stocks can do today.\n\nAn example is Cenovus.  As Nuttal pointed out CVE has committed to 100% of FCF to go to buybacks soon, after debt drops. They can buy back all their stock in less than 4 years, unless the stock rerates higher.  Teledyne was never even close to being capable to do that.\n\nWe just got a kicker for oil stocks, one guessed was coming, just a matter of size. \n\nSunday (Bloomberg) -- Oil advanced at the week’s open after Saudi Arabia said it will make an extra 1 million barrel-a-day supply cut in July, taking its production to the lowest level for several years following a slide in prices.  \nWest Texas Intermediate futures jumped almost 5% early in the session before paring some gains to trade near $74 a barrel. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said he “will do whatever is necessary to bring stability to this market” following a tense OPEC+ meeting over the weekend.  \n“The oil market now looks like it will be even tighter in the second half of the year,” ANZ Group Holdings Ltd. analysts Brian Martin and Daniel Hynes wrote in a note. “The move by Saudi Arabia is likely to come as a surprise.”", "id": "140ycrw", "created_utc": 1685930006.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR: Buy the fcking dip", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "They're definitely going to the right", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "We've had one, yes.

{"title": "Why PayPal Stock ($PYPL) lost 18% in May", "selftext": "* PayPal's growth is slowing, but it's performing well in a challenging environment.\n* The near-term outlook remains pressured.\n* New companies are trying to chip away at PayPal's lead, but its long-term premise is intact.  \n\n\n**Investors are worried about the future.**\n\n**What happened**\n\nShares of PayPal ($PYPL) stock fell 18% in May, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The company released a first-quarter earnings report that worried investors.\n\n**So what**\n\nPayPal is still the industry leader in digital and peer-to-peer payments, with first-quarter total payment volume (TPV) of $355 million, a 10% year-over-year increase. Revenue was up 9% to $7 billion, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased 33% to $1.17.Revenue growth has decelerated into single digits, and it's expected to further contract to 6.5% to 7% in the second quarter. Management raised full-year EPS guidance to $4.95, or a 20% increase over last year.\n\nThat doesn't sound bad at all, and even more so when you factor in the difficult operating environment that includes slowdowns in spending and a high-interest-rate environment.\n\nInvestors seem to be more focused on PayPal's long-term prospects, which is the right lens in which to view the stock's value.\n\nWith its lead in its business, PayPal is the company to beat in this game. The thing is, many companies are doing just that, getting into digital payments and financial technology, and bringing a fresh face to the table. It's ironic to think of PayPal as the older, established company in an industry that itself is so young and technology-oriented, but it's been around long enough for PayPal to be huge and relevant. A company as big and dominant as PayPal can sometimes be hampered with agility and innovation by its size and focus. Fintech is wide open with tons of opportunity, and other companies are working, often in niche segments, on developing new technology in digital financial services. Furthering sour investor sentiment, PayPal CEO Dan Shulman is leaving the company at the end of the year. A fresh CEO might be just the thing PayPal needs to generate investor enthusiasm, but until one is announced, the market may not take a liking to PayPal stock.\n\n**Now what**\n\nPayPal is still posting admirable performance in a hostile environment, and it's still releasing new features and services to protect its moat as the dominant player in its business. It's long-term potential looks solid. PayPal stock is down 10% this year, and shares trade at just 27 times trailing-12-month earnings. That's about half of its five-year average. Is it cheap? With its slowing growth rates, it's probably priced about right, and forward-thinking investors can feel comfortable buying PayPal stock as a long-term addition to a portfolio.\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/06/04/why-paypal-stock-lost-18-in-may/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/06/04/why-paypal-stock-lost-18-in-may/)", "id": "1415940", "created_utc": 1685947831.0, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "PYPL honestly doesn’t seem like a bad buy right now.

Apple knows all the tricks to keep people buying...\n\n**Apple Magically Defies Gravity**\n\nApple Inc (ticker: AAPL) released the first iPhone in the United States on June 29, 2007. In 2008, Apple Inc. posted revenue of $7.9 billion for its fiscal 2008 fourth quarter ended September 27, 2008. According to Apple’s latest financial reports, the company’s current revenue (TTM) is $385.09 billion. **Apple has experienced unparalleled revenue growth, from just $8 billion (USD) in 2004 to more than $394 billion in 2022.**\n\nValued at over $2 trillion in 2021, Apple became the most valuable technology company in the world. Steve Jobs, the founder and CEO, was one of technology’s first “rock stars”, able to sell hardware as more than a tool for work.\n\nJobs was fired from Apple in 1985, and the company saw a gradual decline over the 1990s. It struggled to compete with Microsoft's Windows, and computer manufacturers like Dell Computers, and Apple hardware sales fell.\n\nOn the verge of bankruptcy, and in a last-ditch effort to save the company, Apple brought Jobs back and installed him as CEO. Jobs then miraculously managed to get a $150 million loan from arch nemesis Bill Gates. This cash infusion allowed Apple to stave off bankruptcy, and also gave them the financial wherewithal to develop new products. Then Jobs hit a product homerun with the iPod. He turned the company’s fortunes around, launching iTunes and the iPod in 2001.\n\nThe release of the iPhone saw Apple ascend to one of the most valuable companies in the world, with revenue increasing from $37.4 billion in 2008 to $65 billion in 2010.\n\nThe success of the iPhone enabled Apple to launch new product categories, such as the iPad. Apple envisioned the tablet as a bridge between the smartphone and laptop, with the capabilities to be both. Yet, as iPhone revenues began to stagnate, Apple looked for new ways to generate revenue from the iPhone.\n\n**Apple Uses iPhone Reverse Loss Leader Strategy?**\n\nA loss leader strategy involves selling a product or service at a lower price that is not profitable. The product is sold cheaply to attract new customers, or to sell additional products and services to its existing customers. Although iPhone sales began to flag, after being on the market for the better part of a decade, Apple instituted what appears to be a reverse loss leader strategy by raising iPhone prices. And Apple used the high-priced iPhone to introduce customers to new services or products in the hopes of building a customer base and securing future recurring revenue.\n\nThen Apple got into the headphone business. In 2014 Apple acquired Beats Music and Beats Electronic, which produced audio headphones, and had a subscription streaming music service, for $3 billion. The deal was the largest-ever acquisition by Apple, and brought Beats co-founders Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine to join Apple. The Apple earbuds, AirPods, were next, which paved the way for wireless headphones to become mainstream. Then Apple launched the Apple Watch in 2015, as an accessory to the iPhone which tracks various health and fitness metrics.\n\nApple has also built out its subscription services to include music and video streaming, video games, fitness and cloud storage. This segment alone generated $53 billion revenue in 2020, making it Apple’s second largest segment.\n\nAll eyes are on Apple’s next products, which may include a new virtual reality headset. The past few product launches have been smaller in scope, like the HomePod and AirPod. Yet, Apple fans are still somehow clamoring for the next iPhone, after almost two decades. \n\n*Note: Apple’s financial year ends in September.*\n\n**Apple key statistics**\n\n•\t**Apple generated $394.3 billion revenue in 2022, 52% came from iPhone sales**\n\n•\tApple Services is the second largest division, responsible for 19% of revenue in 2022\n\n•\t232 million iPhones, 61 million iPads and 26 million Mac and MacBook units were sold in 2022\n\n•\tApple’s home and wearables division grew 7.3% in 2022\n\n•\tIt sold 82 million AirPods and 53 million Apple Watches in 2022\n\n•\tApple Music has 88 million subscribers, Apple TV+ has over 75 million", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It’s funny cause most people own apple if they have a 401k.\n\n* If you are invested in the SP500 apple is 7-8% (Spy, Voo)\n* Total US stock fund apple is 6-7% (VTI)\n* Total World Stock fund apple is 3-4% (VT)\n\nSo it’s safe to assume we’re all holding.", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "This is why I have a hard time buying Apple even though I'm bullish, they're already a significant portion of my portfolio.", "score": 24, "replies": []}, {"body": "To me, it’s one of those too-big-to-fail companies, that will be propped up even if it hits rough patches.

{"title": "Apple Unveils Vision Pro AR/VR Headset, Its First Major New Product In Nearly A Decade", "selftext": "On Monday, Apple unveiled its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, the tech giant’s first major new product category since 2015’s Apple Watch.\n\nThe new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.\n\nApple’s virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.\n\nThe device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Meta and Google parent Alphabet have tried to bring high-tech headsets into the mainstream. Facebook in 2014 bought the startup Oculus for $2 billion and has released two generations of its Meta Quest, geared mostly toward gamers. Microsoft in 2016 made a big bet on its Hololens headset, a 3D augmented reality device, but has failed to gain traction with consumers. Google made the buzziest splash more than a decade ago with its disastrous Google Glass, a sleek headset with a camera on board. The product drew immediate outrage, with early adopters dubbed “glassholes.”\n\nApple has rarely been first to new product categories, instead letting other companies take the lead while it developed products it hoped could dominate over rivals. Apple was beat to market in mp3 players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, but its iPods, iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches have all become category-defining devices.\n\nApple will have a bigger challenge ahead as it asks people to put its latest product directly on their faces for everyday use—an aim which has eluded all its well-capitalized predecessors. Today’s headsets often lead to people complaining about the devices overheating, being too heavy to wear for too long or leaving sweaty foreheads. Others have found the experience of being disconnected to the real world—immersed in full-on virtual reality for long periods of time—too isolating. Cook said in an interview with GQ earlier this year that Apple’s device could increase collaboration, though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision to achieve a similar effect in the workplace has failed to take off.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/06/05/apple-unveils-reality-pro-arvr-headset-its-first-major-new-product-in-nearly-a-decade/?sh=15606f2d37e8", "id": "141nmds", "created_utc": 1685989780.0, "score": 1145, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 1042, "comments": [{"body": "How am I supposed to look at my phone while watching a movie?", "score": 866, "replies": [{"body": "I imagine there will eventually be a toggle that you can get texts on the side of your screen while viewing through the headset.", "score": 200, "replies": [{"body": "subway surfers on the side of daily life", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "being unaware of my surroundings is literally the last thing i want to do on a subway full of bad people.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "You don’t get it", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Which Google Glass had in 2014...", "score": 96, "replies": [{"body": "You weren't watching movies on Google Glass.", "score": 41, "replies": []}, {"body": "Along with 640x360 resolution…", "score": 145, "replies": []}, {"body": "May it’s soul live vicariously through its replacement, Apple Vision", "score": 71, "replies": []}, {"body": "One thing I like about Apple is, they only release mature products in consumer market unlike google which kind of uses consumers as a beta tester and then shuts down the production after a while.", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "Oh that's so true!

Elon was given an opportunity to review the manuscript and the author published in footnotes the rare cases where Elon disagreed with what other people said.  ***Edit***: To be clear, Vance denied Elon’s desire to have editorial influence over the book, but he did want both sides to be heard when accounts of what happened differed \n\nNone of what I summarize below is disputed by Elon:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChapter 7 \"All Electric\" (p. 145)\n\nMartin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning were the 2 original incorporators of Tesla Motors, Inc.  They were put in contact with Elon by a friend who ran AC Propulsion, a startup manufacturer of EV components.  This was around 2004.\n\nP. 154 describes how during the first meeting between Elon and Tarpenning, Elon conducted exhaustive, seemingly endless questioning about Tesla's financial model.  \n\nAt that point, Tesla was almost literally the same as Apple at the beginning: 3 guys in a few rooms.  They weren't struggling, because the business was essentially nothing at that point.  Elon bought into the company after meeting again with Eberhard, and also brought in JB Straubel.  Straubel used his contacts at Stanford to recruit more engineering talent.  \n\n\"Everything on fire\" didn't happen until 2007 or 2008, several years later.  Tesla's board fired Eberhard and went through at least 2 more CEOs before Elon decided that nobody but him could run the company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> And with SpaceX, Elon has also spoken about how after starting it, he struggled to get anyone who was willing to join because noone believed it would work. “Anyone worthit wouldnt join. Anyone who would join wasnt worthit” was the words he used in some interview i watched back then. So im curious about the assembled teams part.  \n\nFrom the same book referenced above, Chapter 6 \"Mice in Space\" (p. 97)\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful meeting in Russia to purchase decommissioned ICBMs, Elon showed his associates (CIA affliate Mike Griffin and a former government agent named Mike Cantrell, both with extensive aerospace experience) a mathematical model of what would become the Falcon series of rockets.  (p. 107).  Elon had spent considerable effort reading scientific texts about rocket equations, and created a plan to build his own rocket.  \n\nElon also recruited Tom Mueller in 2002.  Mueller's recollection is similar to Tarpenning's above: intensive questioning about plans and cost models.  The initial SpaceX team was small, but rapidly recruited employees hungry for an opportunity that legacy aerospace couldn't provide (p. 118).  Gwynn Shotwell, now the COO at SpaceX, was among the early recruits.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the cases of both Tesla and SpaceX, Elon had comprehensive business models and understanding of product before making significant investments.
