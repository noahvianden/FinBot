As bond prices rise, their yields decrease, which means you may be able to purchase bonds at a relatively lower yield.\n\nPortfolio diversification: Bonds can provide stability and act as a diversification tool in a portfolio. By purchasing bonds when stocks are high, you can balance the risk exposure in your portfolio. When stocks are performing well, bonds can help mitigate potential losses during market downturns.\n\nIncome generation: Bonds typically provide regular interest payments, which can be attractive for income-focused investors. By purchasing bonds at a time when yields are relatively higher, you may benefit from higher income generation compared to buying bonds when yields are lower.\n\nRisk management: Investing in bonds can help manage risk in a portfolio.

{"title": "Amazon Is in Talks to Offer Free Mobile Service to US Prime Members", "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-talks-offer-free-mobile-123703089.html\n\nAmazon.com Inc. has been talking with wireless carriers about offering low-cost or possibly free nationwide mobile phone service to Prime subscribers, according to people familiar with the situation. The company is negotiating with Verizon Communications Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and Dish Network Corp. to get the lowest possible wholesale prices. That would let it offer Prime members wireless plans for $10 a month or possibly for free and bolster loyalty among its biggest spending customers, the people said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.\n\nThe talks have been going on for six to eight weeks and have also included AT&T Inc. at times, but the plan may take several more months to launch and could be scrapped, one person said. Dish shares jumped 14% Friday in New York since a deal with the retail giant could help the struggling satellite-TV company as it transitions to become a national wireless carrier. Meanwhile, T-Mobile fell 8.4%, AT&T dropped 5% and Verizon slid 3.5.%. The big three national carriers could see their own subscribers flee to a cheaper option at Amazon. Deutsche Telekom AG, which holds a majority stake in T-Mobile, fell 5.7% in Germany. “We are always exploring adding even more benefits for Prime members, but don’t have plans to add wireless at this time,” Amazon spokesperson Maggie Sivon said in a statement. Verizon and Dish declined to comment.\n\nAmazon’s US Prime subscribers pay $139 a year for privileges like speedy free delivery, video streaming and access to 100 million songs. Analysts say Prime membership has stagnated in the country since Amazon boosted the annual price from $119, a sign that a subscription is less attractive to consumers struggling with a stubbornly high inflation rate. About 167 million Amazon shoppers had Prime memberships as of March, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Amazon is competing with Walmart Inc., whose $98-a-year Walmart+ membership is emerging as a lower-cost alternative offering many of the same perks as Prime and free grocery delivery on orders of at least $35. Amazon in February increased its free grocery delivery threshold to $150 from $35. For the wireless industry, an Amazon deal could be seen as a welcome boost to wholesale revenue and a way to attract more traffic to newly expanded 5G networks. But Amazon’s entry could be detrimental if Prime wireless becomes popular and starts to chip away at the big carriers’ customer base.\n\nA deeply below-market price from one of the world’s largest retailers could easily undercut the pricing power of the big three national carriers, making it tempting for subscribers to go to Amazon. Unlimited plans start at $60 a month at Verizon and T-Mobile, with AT&T starting at $65. Anytime Amazon enters a new market, it sends shivers through the industry because the Seattle-based retail giant has shown it’s willing to absorb billions of dollars in shipping and movie production costs to fuel Prime membership growth. Wireless service could be just one more item that Amazon’s willing to take a hit on if it gives the company a leg up versus Walmart.", "id": "13yfjve", "created_utc": 1685719072.0, "score": 1375, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 346, "comments": [{"body": "If they could roll this out to Canada, they’d make a killing.", "score": 797, "replies": [{"body": "lol imagine overcoming the monopoly in Canada", "score": 407, "replies": [{"body": "I mean if anyone has the power/money to do it, it is Amazon.", "score": 226, "replies": [{"body": "nah, too weak. you need political power, a lot of money and maybe some soldiers.", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "You act like Amazon hasn’t bought politicians before…", "score": 115, "replies": [{"body": "Our country is literally owned by our telecom companies, they aren't ever letting anyone in lol", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "That isn't true.

The \"VIX\" most people look at/refer to is the nearest expiration VIX (spot VIX). Spot VIX uses an average of 30 day options prices on SPX to calculate implied volatility. However, **VIX futures** price the VIX in that respective month.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet's say you want to buy September 2023 puts on SPX. The VIX corresponding to that is actually 18.27 (very simplified), **NOT** the ~14 VIX you see. Let's say you buy this put, and tomorrow, the spot VIX flies to 30. What you will see when this happens (happened in March as well), is that the VIX on the September 2023 puts is VERY likely going to be less than 30. When this happens, it's usually a black swan event, and the term structure flips into what we call backwardation (less volatility as time goes on).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo sum up, each options expiration has a different \"VIX\" associated with it. Using the previous example, if you wanted to bet that volatility would increase in the short term and you bought a September 2023 put, you're betting that September VIX will increase from 18.27, **NOT** 14.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "To add, this is also why 0DTE options are so popular. \"VIX\" has no effect on the pricing/movement of these options, and they have a separate \"VIX\" called 1dVIX.
