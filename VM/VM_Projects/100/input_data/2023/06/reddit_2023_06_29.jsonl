{"title": "First-quarter economic growth was actually 2%, up from 1.3% first reported in major GDP revision", "selftext": "The U.S. economy showed much stronger-than-expected growth in the first quarter than previously thought, according to a big upward revision Thursday from the Commerce Department.\n\nGross domestic product increased at a 2% annualized pace for the January-through-March period, up from the previous estimate of 1.3% and ahead of the 1.4% Dow Jones consensus forecast. This was the third and final estimate for Q1 GDP. The growth rate was 2.6% in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe upward revision helps undercut widespread expectations that the U.S. is heading toward a recession.\n\nAccording to a summary from the department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, the change came in large part because both consumer expenditures and exports were stronger than previously thought.\n\nConsumer spending, as gauged by personal consumption expenditures, rose 4.2%, the highest quarterly pace since the second quarter of 2021. At the same time, exports rose 7.8% after falling 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAn 8.7% boost in the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment likely boosted the consumer spending numbers, said Scott Hoyt, senior director at Moody’s Analytics.\n\n“Overall, however, the economy remains admirably resilient, and odds of a recession beginning this year are receding. But the coast is far from clear,” he said.\n\nThere also was some good news on the inflation front.\n\nCore PCE prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 4.9% in the period, a downward revision of 0.1 percentage point. The all-times price index increased 3.8%, unchanged from the last estimate.\n\nFederal Reserve policymakers most closely watch core PCE as an inflation indicator. Through a series of rate increases, the Fed is trying to get inflation back down to 2%.\n\nThe rate hikes are targeted at slowing down an economy that in the summer of 2022 was generating inflation at the highest level since the early 1980s.\n\nOne specific focus for the Fed has been the labor market. There currently are about 1.7 open positions for every available worker, and the tightness has resulted in a push higher for wages which generally have not kept pace with inflation.\n\n“Obviously, while the baseline forecast calls for the economy to skirt recession, risks are extremely high. It would take little to push the economy into recession,” Hoyt said.\n\nA separate report Thursday from the Labor Department pointed showed that initial jobless claims fell to 239,000 for the week ended June 24. That was a decline of 26,000 from the previous week and well below the estimate for 264,000.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/first-quarter-economic-growth-was-actually-2percent-up-from-1point3percent-first-reported-in-major-gdp-revision.html", "id": "14m6pin", "created_utc": 1688049519.0, "score": 612, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 209, "comments": [{"body": "I have no fucking idea what’s happening lol.

{"title": "NKE Earnings are Today and this is how you'll make money on it.", "selftext": "Holy shit guys, we're almost done earning season but it seems like there's one more banger in the works. My followers know that I usually do a deep dive on earnings that I like, with my last post on [FedEx](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14ej61l/fedex_earnings_today_what_do/), and the one prior on [Adobe](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/14aa1l2/how_to_make_big_gains_on_adbe_earnings_tonight/). So today we need to see how we can make money off of Nike Inc. (NKE) which will be releasing earnings TODAY; with an estimated revenue of $12.583 Billion. This is an increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $12.23 billion.\n\nI expect the share price to go up with the earnings report. Nike seems to be one of the frequently searched stocks on [Zacks](https://www.zacks.com/) and has performed reasonably well in the past. However, the share prices for Nike are down by 3.93% in the last seven days, and it is expected to present Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $0.67. This would bring the year-over-year (YoY) change to -25.6%. \n\nNike has surprisingly underperformed in 2023, even after exceeding previous EPS and revenue estimates in the past few earnings calls. The stock is down almost 6% on the year, while the S&P 500 and NASDAQ are posting big gains. Is it undervalued? Probably. Most analysts still mark NKE with a \"buy\" rating. \n\nNike appears to be working through some cost issues, as the company is expected to report a decrease in EPS from $0.79 to $0.67, even though they're expected to post an increase in revenue from last quarter's $12.39 billion to $12.59 billion.\n\n**What we know**\n\nNike has built a growth story around a shift to the director-to-consumer business. In the prior quarter, Nike boasted a 17% increase from the year prior, with direct-to-consumer revenue representing 42% of the company's total revenue.\n\nBut while stressing the importance of selling directly to customers and cutting out a middle-man wholesaler, Nike is building out more wholesaler partnerships. Earlier this month reports circulated that Nike [will return to both DSW (DBI)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nike-dsw-wholesale-partnership-stores-website-october/652594/) and [Macy's (M)](https://www.retaildive.com/news/nike-dsw-wholesale-partnership-stores-website-october/652594/).\n\n\"Investors are worried that this is a reversal in Nike's shift from wholesale to DTC, but we don't think the strategy is broken,\" a Bank of America research analyst wrote in a note on June 21. \"We expect to hear an explanation of these moves on the conf call rather than an about-face on its focus on reducing undifferentiated wholesale.\"\n\nAdditionally, investors will be curious about the demand for Nike products in general. The brand represents nearly 70% of the sales at Foot Locker (FL), which warned of a slowdown during its earnings announcement in May. Nike stock fell on that news, and Wall Street analysts [raised concerns](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-stock-could-take-a-hit-as-foot-locker-stumbles-analysts-say-192929265.html) it could be a headwind for Nike moving forward.\n\nOther signs of a slowdown, particularly in Greater China, where revenues grew just 1% last quarter, will also be in focus along with whether the company is continuing to bring down its [previously elevated inventories.](https://finance.yahoo.com/nike-says-inventory-peak-is-behind-us-as-stock-soars-after-earnings-142258959.html)\n\n\"We continue to believe Nike is the #1 international athletic wear brand in China,\" UBS analyst [Jay Sole](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-sole-aa528a2) wrote in a note on June 19. \"However, the spending rebound post reopening has been less robust than expected. We believe Nike's current sales level is still running 10-20% below peak levels and we note the read-across to Nike from the secondary market for sneakers in China is just ok. We expect only modest improvement on that run rate over the rest of the year because of the macro economic outlook in China.\"\n\n**Implied Volatility**\n\nThe market is expecting a large move from this earnings announcement relative to further-dated cycles, as we can see when looking at the implied volatility of the weekly options cycle that expires Friday. NKE stock is expected to move ±$7.58 this week, which is about 6% of the current stock price, while the expected move for the August monthly cycle 53 days from expiration is only ±$9.64.\n\nLooking deeper into the options prices, you can see that there is a strong call skew in the weekly cycle as well. This doesn't mean the stock is going to go up from the earnings call, but it does tell us that the market is putting an emphasis on risk to the upside if there is going to be an outsized move. From an options strategy perspective, a skew can help us lean toward one strategy over another, as a bullish vertical call spread would be cheaper than a bearish vertical put spread in this environment, with so much premium collected in the OTM short call option. That said, traders would still need to be directionally correct after earnings for the trade to post a profit.\n\n**What to do for Earnings?**\n\nI'll be getting a call spread. I'll be buying the 6/30 115c for $2.42, and selling the 121c for $0.80. This means I can get the call spread for $162, offering a maximum gain of 3.7x if the stock goes up 7.3%, which is just shy of the average move it's had with earnings. Keep in mind tho, this post is meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.
