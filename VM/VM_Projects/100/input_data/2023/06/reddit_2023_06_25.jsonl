{"title": "Apple stock analysis and valuation - Why Warren Buffett loves it", "selftext": "This week’s casual valuation is Apple. I hope you enjoy these posts and feel free to add your take.\n\n*Disclaimer: I do not own shares in Apple.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe post is divided into the following sections:\n\n•\tIntroduction\n\n•\tHistorical financial performance\n\n•\tThe balance sheet\n\n•\tAssumptions and valuation\n\n•\tValuation based on different assumptions (and discount rate)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introduction**\n\nApple is the largest public company with a market cap of almost $3 trillion. We can go look back at its history and admire its outstanding performance, but even if we take a look at the last 5 years, its share price is up over 300%! For comparison, S&P500 is up 60% over the same period.\n\nMy one-sentence summary of Apple would be – **A technology company with strong brand and pricing power.**\n\nAt the end of March 2023, Apple was 46% of Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio.\n\nSince Q1/2016 until today, Berkshire has bought over a billion shares in Apple at an average price of $39.65, leading to a total cost of almost $42 billion. Out of all the shares bought, 123 million have been sold for $12.5 billion, and the remaining 916 million shares have a market value of $171 billion. This leads to a return of 346%, excluding dividends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Historical financial performance**\n\nSince 2017, Apple provides a split of its revenue into:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Products (iPhone, iPad, AirPods, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch, etc.)\n* Services (Advertising, Cloud, Digital content, App store fees, Payment services, etc.)\n\nWhy is this relevant? Well, services naturally have higher margins.\n\nIf we take a look at the data related to this split, we'll see that the % of revenue generated from services increased from 14% back in 2017, to 21% today.\n\nThis is an important piece of the valuation puzzle. The assumptions regarding future profitability depend on the assumptions about how this will develop in the future. If the trend continues and services increase as % of revenue, then **higher profitability should be expected**. If the trend reverses, then **lower profitability should be expected.**\n\nMany analysts point to iPhone as the biggest risk. Back in 2017, iPhone sales were responsible for 62% of all of Apple's revenue. Over the last twelve months, that % is down to 52%. It is still significant and it should not be ignored. If Apple disappoints with the next iPhone model, it will have a significant impact on its profitability, and valuation. It can also be argued that the new models aren't significantly better than the previous ones and come with slight design changes and limited additional features. However, as long as the customers are willing to pay for them, well, that's what matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's take a look at the financials and how they've changed over the last 5 years.\n\nThe gross profit increased from 38% in 2019 to 43% for the last twelve months (ending April 1st, 2023). Based on the development of the mix between products/services, this doesn't come as a surprise.\n\nThe operating expenses (Research & Development, and Selling, General & Administrative) have been incredibly stable, between 13-14% (combined) of revenue. Many investors love predictability, and Apple definitely delivers that.\n\nAll of the above translates to an increase in the operating margin from 25% back in 2019 to 29% over the last twelve months.\n\nWith revenue of $385 billion, Apple is generating over $100 billion in operating profit per year.\n\nMore importantly, during this period, there were two events that impacted most of the companies:\n\n**The pandemic (Covid-19)** and **high inflation.**\n\nWe cannot see any negative impact coming from these events on Apple's financials. It continued to perform exceptionally even through uncertain and difficult times. The increased costs (due to raw materials, but also higher employee salaries) were successfully passed on to the final customers.\n\nIt doesn't come as a surprise that Warren Buffett loves it. What is there not to love?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The balance sheet**\n\nSo, what happens with all of the excess cash that is consistently being generated? It is being returned back to the shareholders, via share buybacks and dividends.\n\nOver the last decade, Apple reduced the # of outstanding shares by a third. In addition, its annual dividend payment is over $14 billion per year.\n\nThe decision to return cash back to the shareholders is basically the management admitting that they don't have projects to invest in, that will yield acceptable returns. Whether buybacks are the way to go at today's share price, is another question.\n\nIf we take a look at the balance sheet, the company has $180 billion of cash, short and long-term investments. Although this might sound impressive, this is roughly 5% of their market cap.\n\nOn the other side of the balance sheet, there's $110 billion in debt (including leases).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Assumptions and valuation**\n\nHere are my assumptions for the future:\n\n**Revenue growth:** 7% per year over the next 3 years, then declining over time to 4%. With this assumption, revenue in 10 years' time increases by 71%\n\n**Operating margin:** 29%, increasing to 32% over the next decade (I expect services to increase as % of revenue, leading to higher margins)\n\n**Discount rate:** 11% discounting to 8.7% over time\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of Apple is roughly **$2 trillion ($127.24/share).**\n\nFor comparison, today’s market cap is 2.94 trillion ($186.68/share).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**\n\nThe future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Operating margin|28%|30%|32%|34%|CAGR|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|50% ($578b)|$101.9|$108.7|$113.9|$119.6|4.1%|\n|71% ($657b)|$113.7|$121.4|$127.2|$133.8|5.5%|\n|100% ($770b)|$128.5|$137.3|$144.2|$151.8|7.2%|\n|160% ($999b)|$155.0|$169.1|$177.9|$187.6|10.0%|\n\nFor Apple to be fairly valued, it needs to grow its revenue at 10% annually over the next decade and increase its operating margin from its current 29% to 34%.\n\nAt the moment, the market is paying a significant premium for Apple and there is positive sentiment around the company.\n\nOverall, I do like the company, and I can see myself buying shares at a reasonable price. It is quite clear that Buffett got a great deal by buying shares at an average price of $39.65.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs always, thank you for reading the post and for all the support.", "id": "14in5od", "created_utc": 1687702006.0, "score": 346, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "Great  APPL stock and good analysis.

{"title": "S.T.A.G wheel, the greatest options strategy of all time?", "selftext": "What’s up TRAITORS!!\n\nI don’t know why I put a question mark In the title, it should have had SIX EXCLAMATION POINTS!!!!!!\n\nhere’s why: compounding. The eight wonder of the world to paraphrase Einstein and the secret sauce of my PROPRIETARY options strategy. \n\nWhy is compounding so awesome? BECAUSE ITS THE MOST TREASONOUS monetary force ever invented, Theta is a close second, mostly because theta LITERALLY STANDS FOR TREASON.\n\nIf you’re not up to speed on the wild new theta strategy that’s TAKING THE WORLD BY STORM, let me break it down for you:\n\nSTAG wheel stands for SERIOUSLY TREASONOUS AMOUNTS OF GAINS, which is what you can expect to get when you use it. The gist is this:\n\n1. Sell a CSP on an underlying you would like to hold long term\n\n2. Use the premium to IMMEDIATELY buy shares.\n\n3. Once assigned, sell a CC, again using the premium to IMMEDIATELY buy shares.\n\n4. Rinse and repeat until you have 100 shares, at which point you start a second STAG WHEEL, selling two contracts a week now.\n\nThe STAG WHEEL isn’t perfect, it gets punished in long term downtrends or time periods of low premium, but flourishes in long term uptrends and time periods of high premium.\n\nThe single biggest advantage of holding shares instead of stacking cash is that you will eventually collect 100 shares, doubling the amount of free shares per week you can collect.\n\nI have used my PROPRIETARY strategy to devastating effect over the last decade or so, and it’s long past due that I SHARE MY GENIUS WITH THE WORLD. You’re welcome.\n\nEven if you begin in the most unfavorable environment, as I did a couple years back with my demo account, YOU ALWAYS END UP ON TOP eventually. The trick is long term application of the plan and sticking to the roadmap.\n\nExample:\n\n1. You have $7k to allocate to the STAG WHEEL. You choose PYPL because you want BOATLOADS of shares to hold forever. You sell the 6/30 $66 put @ $0.68 (.35 delta) and buy a share of PYPL with the premium.\n\n2. You do this week in, week out, for 11 weeks until you get assigned, you now have 111 shares of PYPL. And we’ll next weeks $68 call @ $0.68, buying another share with the premium.\n\n3. You do this week in, week out for a couple years. When you get assigned on your puts, you lose about $100, but when you get exercised on your calls, you make about $100 so it evens out statistically over the long term. There are times of high volatility in the market, and some weeks you sell your .30 delta contract for $1.40 instead of $0.68, netting you 2 free shares that week. \n\n4.

Using the premiums on a different stock (or as cash collateral to sell options on another stock) cuts the diversity risk in half.    \n\nDeltas above .20 are more lucrative and work great in an upward market but result in a assignment and long holding periods (think years) during down markets and result in that money not generating anything during that time frame essentially being nothing more than a buy and hold strategy  requiring lots of patience that most people looking to actively trade premium don't have and thus they realize the losses to get their cash back by selling CCs below their cost basis.\n\nBut yes with the right market conditions in place for a long enough time, your version of the wheel could be very lucrative and might be worth giving a try just incase the market does indeed maintain the right conditions.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The right conditions being a slow up-trending market, the exact state the market typically is on average over time.\n\nThere are benefits to sinking the premium into shares of the underlying your selling contracts one, namely, assignment or exercise happens typically due to a drastic move in the underlying (drastic enough to breach whatever delta you sold the contract at), which is usually accompanied by a rise in Vega, offsetting part of your loss by the increased premium generated by selling covered calls against shares of that exact underlying.\n\nTo simplify: if you find yourself getting assigned, you’re likely going to get some elevated premium for selling contracts against those same shares you’ve been collecting, partially offsetting the loss. \n\nAlso, if you really want to hold a stock Long term and aren’t just chasing premium, why not buy some shares?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I do this, but I buy shares of a different underlying.

{"title": "Patient bears, the time is coming", "selftext": "We're going to see 3500 SPX next year. I'm not going to go into some wacko detailed chart TA crap with gazillion squiggly lines. But let me explain it with simple, we'll say money thieving logic:\n\nLast year, when we are 3500 SPX lows. I had friends/family who were not invested in the market at all talking about the market crashing. Normal people didn't necessary sell their holdings, but I didn't know a single person that bought up undervalued companies at pre-covid lows.\n\nAll the news was about the market being over. It was crashing, world was over, blah blah blah. It wasn't the \"cleanest\" move up, but it marked the lows and before you know it a year later people are scratching their heads with where we are in the market. \n\nPeople did not expect we could approach 4500 SPX from these lows at that is exactly why it occurred. \n\n**Similarly**, once the perma bears or twitter gurus that have been averaging in puts for 3 months cover at a large loss, we will start to drop like a sack of rocks. Some random bullshit news will hit the market. Something the big money was well aware of months ahead of time. Hence why the VIX is nearly these egregious lows. It's not because we're about to enter a real bull market, it's because they're making money both ways (or about to soon here).\n\nAgain, I don't think this bull run is over yet. But I speculate most of the run will finish by fall this year. We'll say September as a guess. My main signals will be, when the overwhelming sentiment on this sub turns bullish with virtually no more downside thesis being upvoted/posted. And for the most stern bears on social media start to go completely quiet if not best case scenario talk about more upside at the highs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when to buy puts. And that time is inching closer and closer. I haven't touched puts for the past 3 months. But I'm starting to see early signs.
