Besides Buffett, you will find **very few individuals** on the Forbes list who haven't become wealthy through entrepreneurship and owning their own companies.\n\nThere is a dissertation that was conducted at the University of Potsdam, which scientifically examined how the wealthy achieved their wealth. The findings once again confirm that the majority of them have become rich as **entrepreneurs**. Indeed, 48 percent of respondents stated that real estate also played a significant role in wealth accumulation, but only 10 percent considered real estate as the most crucial factor in their wealth generation.\n\n**Only 2.7 percent** of the surveyed wealthy individuals mentioned that stocks played a significant role in their wealth accumulation, making it a small minority among the respondents. I'm not discouraging investments in stocks; in fact, quite the opposite. I recommend everyone to consider a savings plan in a passive ETF. However, trying to get rich solely by investing in individual stocks can be challenging in the long term. While some may experience temporary success in a bull market or due to luck, I remain skeptical about its sustainability.\n\nLast year, I gave a presentation to 250 ardent stock enthusiasts, and during the talk, I asked who among them had become wealthy through investing in stocks. With \"wealthy,\" I mean not less than one million. **Not a single person raised his hand**. Now, you might argue that there were maybe a few who hesitated to share that publicly, but their reaction aligns with both my personal experience and scientific research.\"\n\nThoughts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "15jwuax", "created_utc": 1691346767.0, "score": 358, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "That's fine.\n\nThe lowest wealth on the Forbes 400 is $2.7 billion. \n\n1% of that is 27 million.

Bowman said she supported the Fed’s quarter-point increase in interest rates last month, given still-high inflation, strong consumer spending, a rebound in the housing market and a labor market that is helping to feed higher prices. “I also expect that additional rate increases will likely be needed to get inflation on a path down to the FOMC’s 2 percent target,” she said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Kansas Bankers Association, referring to the Fed’s rate-setting panel, the Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nMonetary policy is not on a “preset course,” she also said, and data will drive future decisions. “We should remain willing to raise the federal funds rate at a future meeting if the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled.” Bowman has frequently expressed views that are more hawkish than some of her colleagues. In forecasts published in June, most Fed policymakers expected to end the year with the Fed policy rate at 5.6%, one quarter-point hike above the setting established at the Fed’s late-July meeting.

{"title": "Why do you invest in Tesla?", "selftext": "I'm posting to get your insights on investment choices, particularly why you invest in TSLA. Let me share a bit about my own investment journey and seek your advice.\n\nAs an investor, I'm looking to diversify my portfolio with some promising AI stocks for the next 5 years. Currently, I already have positions in the usual suspects like NVDA, AMD, MSFT, and other FANG companies. However, I'm considering adding TSLA to the mix, given its significant impact on the automotive industry and beyond.\n\nOne thing that sets me apart from some other investors is that I'm also a Tesla owner. I own a Model X, and while I thoroughly enjoy the driving experience and the idea of Full Self-Driving (FSD) capabilities, I must admit that I've encountered some issues with the build quality. This has made me a bit cautious about investing further in the company, especially considering the rich valuation of its stock.\n\nI'm aware that TSLA isn't often categorized as an AI stock, unlike some other companies I already hold. With more competitors entering the autonomous driving space, I'm wondering whether it's wise to add more shares of Tesla to my portfolio.\n\nSo, I'm keen to learn from your experiences and insights. What's your due diligence on the long-term bull case for Tesla? Are there specific data points or analyses that have convinced you to invest and remain optimistic about its future?

As successful companies balloon in size it is often difficult to keep the same culture that made it successful in the first place. \n\nI tend to agree with Safi Bahcall's take on this in his book Loonshots he summed it up as the balance between 'Rank and Stake'. Early on in the start up phase there are few employees so each individualized action they take has a more outsized impact on the outcome of the business. In this phase they are more incentivized to care about the mission since they share in an outsized way in that success (Stake). When the business is successful and grows exponentially more and more employees are hired to the point where each individual feels they have a lesser and lesser impact on the outcome of the business. The incentive structure changes to where an employee becomes more concerned with moving up the corporate 'Rank' to gauge their success. \n\nElon excels at maintaining a start up culture within Tesla. Andrej describes Tesla as just being a collection of start ups and I think that's a very useful mental model to have when looking at Tesla and Elon's management style.

There is some square of dirt somewhere in the world and Tesla transforms it into a factory making 500,000 cars a year in a small number of years. They are only going to get better at that. Tesla is trying to become a better machine that makes the machine that makes the machine.\n\n**Battery Technology:** Tesla has been at the forefront of battery technology and innovation. Its efforts to reduce battery costs, increase energy density, and enhance longevity have been central to its competitive advantage. Tesla has also been working on its battery production process, including initiatives like the \"Roadrunner Project\" which aims to mass-produce batteries more efficiently.\n\n**Battery Pack Design:** Tesla's approach to battery pack design, including the use of cylindrical cells and thermal management, has been a differentiator. They’ve also announced innovations such as the structural battery pack, which integrates the battery directly into the vehicle's structure to save weight and improve rigidity.\n\n**Manufacturing Automation:** ~~Tesla has heavily invested in automation, with the aim of creating an “alien dreadnought” – a term Musk used to describe a factory so advanced and automated it looks extraterrestrial. While this level of automation has presented challenges, it has also provided significant potential for scale and precision.~~\n\nMe: Tesla is incredible at robots/automation and is going to continue making denser, faster, better factories.\n\n**Continuous Improvement:** Instead of traditional model years, Tesla continually rolls out incremental hardware and software improvements to its vehicles. This agility has allowed Tesla to adapt and innovate faster than many traditional automakers.\n\n**Software Integration:** Tesla's vehicles are deeply integrated with software, and the company often pushes over-the-air (OTA) updates that can improve performance, range, safety, and introduce new features, further enhancing the longevity and appeal of their vehicles.\n\n**In-house Component Production:** Where many automakers rely heavily on suppliers for major components, Tesla tends to produce more in-house. This includes items like the seats, motors, and even the advanced chip used in their Full-Self Driving computer.\n\n**Supply Chain Management: T**esla has worked hard to secure critical raw materials, like lithium and nickel, required for its batteries. It's also exploring recycling used batteries to recover materials, further reducing costs and dependency on mining.\n\n**Manufacturing Techniques:** Techniques such as the large-scale casting of vehicle parts (like the rear underbody of the Model Y) help reduce the number of parts and processes required in vehicle assembly.\n\n**~~Focus on Sustainability:~~** ~~Tesla's emphasis on sustainability extends to its manufacturing processes.

The vast majority of companies lose to the market. But among those that are long term winners you could have bought many of them at any point and made great returns with a 10 year holding period. I can do the same thing and point to Amazon's P/E ratio of ~1,000 in 09/2013. If you bought then and held you're pretty happy. Or how about $ASML's P/E ratio of 111 in 03/2010? Or $GOOG at a 57 P/E ratio in 12/2017 you still enjoyed 145% returns with a 6 year holding period, doubling the markets return.
