Over the past three years, which entails the Covid era, the level has risen more than 22%.\n\nThe number is significant in that wages increasingly have been recognized as a driving force in inflation. While goods prices have abated since pushing overall inflation to its highest level in more than 40 years in mid-2022, other factors continue to keep it well above the Fed’s targeted rate of 2%.\n\nThe New York Fed data is consistent with an Atlanta Fed tracker, which shows wages overall rising at a 6% annual rate but job switchers seeing 7% gains.\n\nEmployers have been trying to keep pace with the wage demands, pushing the average full-time offer up to $69,475, a 14% surge in the past year. The actual expected annual salary rose to $67,416, a gain of more than $7,000 from a year ago and also a new high.\n\nThough there was a gap between the wage workers wanted and what was offered, satisfaction with compensation and upward mobility increased across the board.\n\nWith markets on edge over what the Fed’s next policy step will be, more signs of a tight labor market raise the likelihood that policymakers will keep interest rates higher for longer. At their July meeting, officials noted that wages “were still rising at rates above levels assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement” of the 2% inflation goal, minutes from the meeting said.\n\nMonday’s survey results also showed some other mixed patterns in the labor market.\n\nJob seekers, or those who have looked for work in the previous four weeks, declined to 19.4% from 24.7% a year ago. That came as job openings fell by 738,000 to 9.58 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe likelihood of switching jobs fell, dropping to 10.6% from 11% a year ago, while expectations of being offered a new job also declined, to 18.7% from 21.1%.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/21/american-workers-are-demanding-almost-80000-a-year-to-take-a-new-job.html", "id": "15xapyg", "created_utc": 1692631337.0, "score": 1516, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 332, "comments": [{"body": "What an absolute propaganda piece trying to blame inflation on people trying to keep up with cost of living.", "score": 2364, "replies": [{"body": "Keep up with rising cost of living, and economic uncertainty.

The reasons there’s been “no/little inflation” are twofold: the measurement and the deflationary nature of technology. CPI is a bullshit, manipulated, and invalid measure. So we can’t discuss inflation impacts if that’s the measurement. Further, people adjust their spending habits *because of inflation*. If you’re forced to eat dog food because meat is too expensive, and thus spending the same amount on food, has inflation magically been fixed? The CPI would say it has, but it absolutely has not.

Absolutely yes. It was just *offset* by the new technology. All prices should be going down, not up, not stay the same.\n\nYes, creating new money 100% causes inflation, whether that inflation is seen in nominal prices or not and whether CPI captures that inflation or not. Increases monetary units is the classic definition of inflation, in fact.\n\nIf you’re interested, I highly recommend the book “Price of Tomorrow” by Jeff Booth.

You can't convince non-financial businesses having the highest margins didn't have any effect on prices, even if it was very small.   \nQE worked wonders in 2008 because it boosted demand. The Eurozone failed to recover partially because it wasn't aggresive as the FED. And if in 1929 the currency wasn't tied to gold, there probably wouldn't have been a depression on such scale. Literally all the major countries started to recover once they debased their currencies and only Nazi Germany kept pre crisis exchange rate to make imports easier, while secretly also engaging in inflationary policies. However the coronavirus presented a different set of challenges, which were more supply oriented and that couldn't be fixed by boosting demand, which the central banks went a little overboard with. \n\nAnd if not CPI what do you use to gauge overall inflation? In yout example, if only meat went up, then of course CPI will barely move up.

Anecdotal evidence for sure, but there has never been an instance where we tell them that they NEED to use Paypal over any other provider.
