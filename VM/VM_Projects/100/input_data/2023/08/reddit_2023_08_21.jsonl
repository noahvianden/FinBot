Over the past three years, which entails the Covid era, the level has risen more than 22%.\n\nThe number is significant in that wages increasingly have been recognized as a driving force in inflation. While goods prices have abated since pushing overall inflation to its highest level in more than 40 years in mid-2022, other factors continue to keep it well above the Fed‚Äôs targeted rate of 2%.\n\nThe New York Fed data is consistent with an Atlanta Fed tracker, which shows wages overall rising at a 6% annual rate but job switchers seeing 7% gains.\n\nEmployers have been trying to keep pace with the wage demands, pushing the average full-time offer up to $69,475, a 14% surge in the past year. The actual expected annual salary rose to $67,416, a gain of more than $7,000 from a year ago and also a new high.\n\nThough there was a gap between the wage workers wanted and what was offered, satisfaction with compensation and upward mobility increased across the board.\n\nWith markets on edge over what the Fed‚Äôs next policy step will be, more signs of a tight labor market raise the likelihood that policymakers will keep interest rates higher for longer. At their July meeting, officials noted that wages ‚Äúwere still rising at rates above levels assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement‚Äù of the 2% inflation goal, minutes from the meeting said.\n\nMonday‚Äôs survey results also showed some other mixed patterns in the labor market.\n\nJob seekers, or those who have looked for work in the previous four weeks, declined to 19.4% from 24.7% a year ago.

The reasons there‚Äôs been ‚Äúno/little inflation‚Äù are twofold: the measurement and the deflationary nature of technology. CPI is a bullshit, manipulated, and invalid measure. So we can‚Äôt discuss inflation impacts if that‚Äôs the measurement. Further, people adjust their spending habits *because of inflation*. If you‚Äôre forced to eat dog food because meat is too expensive, and thus spending the same amount on food, has inflation magically been fixed? The CPI would say it has, but it absolutely has not.

All prices should be going down, not up, not stay the same.\n\nYes, creating new money 100% causes inflation, whether that inflation is seen in nominal prices or not and whether CPI captures that inflation or not.

You can't convince non-financial businesses having the highest margins didn't have any effect on prices, even if it was very small.   \nQE worked wonders in 2008 because it boosted demand. The Eurozone failed to recover partially because it wasn't aggresive as the FED. And if in 1929 the currency wasn't tied to gold, there probably wouldn't have been a depression on such scale. Literally all the major countries started to recover once they debased their currencies and only Nazi Germany kept pre crisis exchange rate to make imports easier, while secretly also engaging in inflationary policies. However the coronavirus presented a different set of challenges, which were more supply oriented and that couldn't be fixed by boosting demand, which the central banks went a little overboard with. \n\nAnd if not CPI what do you use to gauge overall inflation? In yout example, if only meat went up, then of course CPI will barely move up. The definitions of CPI is \"measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services\". One product is not the whole basket.

Competition is ramping up by the day and there aren't more substantial countries PYPL can expand to. Every vendor who needs paypal/a processor already has it or has considered it, and with Stripe being the new kid on the block with sexier rates I just don't see many people choosing PYPL over Stripe to a point where we see 2018 growth again. \n\n\n\nI sell an ERP system directly to business owners/decision makers in a company and usually discuss our payment providers that connect to the ERP. And when I mention Stripe vs Paypal there is really nothing that edges the CEO's/CFO's to choosing Paypal vs Stripe. Especially when they ask for the rates of the providers, they almost always choose Stripe after seeing 30% lower rates than PYPL for the same function. Anecdotal evidence for sure, but there has never been an instance where we tell them that they NEED to use Paypal over any other provider. To me that's a huge problem and my current job regularly provides me a front row view of CEO's/CFO's denying Paypal based on their rates and competiton. \n\n\nThat's the reason why I'm not buying the PYPL growth story.
