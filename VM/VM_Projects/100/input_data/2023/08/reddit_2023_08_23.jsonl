You paid Microsoft and Nvidia to do it.  And got a worse cover letter than a task rabbit could have done for less.\n\n\n\n> Again, results are I’m getting more calls back than I used to for higher paying jobs.\n\nThis is almost certainly confirmation bias.  We are in the hottest jobs economy of your lifetime.  That's probably a hundred times more likely why you moved up. \n\nAnd just by the reality of time passing, your experience probably shifted from 1 year help desk to 2 years help desk (or whatever) which would have triggered certain thresholds for consideration.  \n\n> I suck at writing this stuff but I’m amazing at my job!  \n\nI would argue that's statistically very, very unlikely.  Reading and writing are key skills in most jobs of any significance.  Wallpapering over that deficiency this one time would not seem to comport with being amazing.  \n\n> It looks more professional and articulates my services.\n\nSentences like this evoke bad AI.  \n\nFrom a common sense perspective, think of yourself and your \"services\" that were \"articulated\".  Now imagine there's another person just like you in every way, except that person has genuine reading and writing skills.  That person is going to be the superior employee. \n\nPlease realize I'm trying to be kind in discussing this, but as you are talking about your own skills and deficiencies, there's no way to avoid addressing those realities if we're being candid.  \n\nLastly, I'll point out that over 99% of the significant jobs you would be applying for just use algorithmic processing (oops, I guess we have to call that magic AI now) to assess your cover letter.  That means that that the letter being better written and impressing some stereotyped recruiter is almost certainly not what happened. \n\n Basic algorithms could have inserted key words to create it, and basic word match algorithms found those same words on the recruiting app. \n\nSo if you told it \"write me a cover letter as a first year help desk applicant\" it just generated words about problem solving and knowledge base and so on.  Then the companion reader bot looked for words like problem solving and knowledge base and decided this would work for the help desk level 2 job.

Like if you owned a good business, let's say a restaurant in your home town, and it does well it boomed, line up everyday, you are not able to keep up with demand. Your sales are double than what you expected. Do you sell?\n\nFor me, I would not, I would add more money, and add more branches in the same town and think of expanding to other cities.\n\nIf I would do this for a business, why would I do differently for a stock when inherently its a business as well just run by a smarter person than me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, what is wealth? Wealth is various assets accumulated from your various incomes, but when you sell your stocks, it turns into cash, which is often regarded as the worst form of wealth. Think of cash as this way that it is the stock symbol of a company that is actually a country, an old company that only stays around because the rules and regulations rigged it, so the growth of it does not compare to a real company, which is true. When you hold cash, you hold the risk of inflation of constantly devaluing. People only have cash to pay for operations. This is why cashflow statements are important to assess if a company is managing that they have enough cash to fund the operations of the company. if they have too much cash, then they will start getting punished as they are not using the resources that they have at maximum to grow the company, it is a balance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stock market is really big, and there are many strategies out there, and you can do so many things. You can treat it like a casino where you bet on options. Or you can treat it as the place where you accumulate wealth, like owning a business, with less risks since your investments are more diversified.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI follow warren buffett's investing strategy. I only sell a stock, if the company has changed its direction since i bought it, i have made a mistake in my analysis, or I need the money for something else. I would never sell just to take a profit. I only do that on speculative plays, which I do from time to time, but only a minor part of my overall portfolio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven if I need cash, I would never sell the companies at the top of my list first. This is the first big mistake that new investors do. When they need money they sell the companies that they are making a profit on. I always sell the companies at the bottom, the ones that are losing money first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you hold a stock of a company vs holding cash, the most you can lose is 100%, this is if the company goes to 0, which is not common as I do not invest in small caps or below. If you sell a company's stock and hold cash instead, the most you can lose is much more than 100%, the sky is the limit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought tesla the first time at $2 (split adjusted price), then the stock 4x in a few months, so that is around $8, I sold thinking that it is too high. I was wrong, it continued to go up to so eventually I had to rebuy at $13. TSLA continued to go up and each time everyone says its too high, the number of times they are wrong is more than the number of times they are right. I continue to buy all the time. I have sold some TSLA early in 2018 fully when they were at the brink of destruction at the time around $25. But once the price was low to $15 and I heard of they are finally breaking through with Model 3  production, i bought a lot and continue to buy every month for the following 2 years. Each time analysts think its too expensive as they were comparing it to a car company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember that most analysts are not accountants, they do not even know how debt affects valuation of the stock, how capital assets that needs to be written off affects valuation of  the stock. I do though from my accounting knowledge. I bet on accounting, and the price exploded based off the accounting behind it. Mostly because analysts did not undrestand that the value of an EV operation is all the future cashflow MINUS all the costs to get rid of ICE business. The latter part is a huge miss, but if you understand how the accounting works, you can see it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI digress, time and time again people will tell you something is expensive. If they have the numbers to back up their calculation, I want to see if. If they just FEEL it is too expensive, well that is not good enough for long term investing. In the short term the stock market is a voting machine, but in the long term it is a weighing machine. It is important to know how much value the company inherently has by going back to the actual calculations. Currently I am making the calculations just based on the numbers that are already available.
