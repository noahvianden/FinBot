The market has been expensive with high PE ratios/expansion as FOMO/AI/soft landing and up only momentum carried it higher. If it wasn't the Fitch downgrade, anything else could have sparked the break in momentum.\n\nThe billion/trillion dollar question is where will TSLA and the market go from here.\n\nThe bearish points are things are still expensive. Momentum indicators have started to point downwards. If AAPL/AMZN/NVDA don't post great numbers and guidance, it could reverse all of the AI hype and momentum. CPI/PPI is next week and it looks like gas prices are about 10% higher now compared to last month, people in my city subreddit keep complaining about higher electric prices from rate increases as well as being really hot. It could paint a higher headline number and throw a wrench in inflation dead narrative.\n\nBullish points are that economy still doing well, everyone has a job, people still spending money. If the rest of megacap tech does well and prove AI hype is real and continues, could justify the elevated PEs. Even if CPI does bump up next week, overall trend is still down. Rents and cars should be stabilizing or going down. Soft/no landing still a possibility.\n\nFrom the TSLA options standpoint, there's still a decent amount of OI in the 250-270 strikes for the Aug/Sept opex dates. It should take a lot to break significantly out of that range (but the whole Fitch thing definitely broke sentiment/something even if it doesn't really matter). Max pain for this week and opex is 260. With daily volume this could always change quickly. \n\nFrom the spaghetti standpoint, despite the big move down we're not oversold yet so can go further down or bounce back. The 50 day and 100 week moving averages are around 250 so could provide support there. If not, there's a big gap from 210-240 that can be filled. Momentum looks like it's pointing down, but could always bounce back up anytime. To the upside there's going to be resistance at the local tops 275-285 then 300.\n\nWith any big move up or down, it's always good to re-evaluate your position whatever it may be. No one can tell you if TSLA is going to move one way or another, especially in the short term.
