Bob Iger seems bent on killing Disney.\n\n**Disney+ Sheds 4 Million Subscribers**\n\nWalt Disney Co.’s (ticker: DIS) flagship online service, Disney+, lost subscribers for the second straight quarter. Disney+ lost a total of 4 million subscribers during the past three months, the Burbank entertainment giant said. Disney is in the midst of a major cost-cutting effort in the pursuit of higher profits as streaming continues to eat into earnings.\n\nAdditionally, the company expects to take a $1.5-billion to $1.8-billion write-down for removing certain content from its streaming platforms. Chief Executive Bob Iger, who returned to the company in November, said Disney is looking to reduce the amount of content it produces for streaming. Still, Disney vows to continue on this money losing streaming path.\n\nDisney+ started strong, quickly soaring, as families were desperate for entertainment options. But Disney+ has lost steam during the last year or so, and Wall Street has demanded a realistic path to profitability for Disney’s money-losing ap. But Disney+ also faces stiff competition from rivals such as HBO Max, Peacock, Paramount+, Netflix, Sling TV, Apple TV Plus, and Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\\*\n\n**Disney loses $900Million in recent box office flops**\n\nDisney's last eight releases have underperformed compared to expectations. The Walt Disney Company is looking at an almost $900 million loss following a series of flops at the box office.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Valliant Renegade, which aims to look at the business and financial side of Hollywood, the last eight studio releases put out by the company have not performed as well as expected. Guardians of the Galaxy and its most recent endeavor, a live-action version of The Little Mermaid, have failed to meet expectations, while two other recent films, Strange World and Lightyear were complete failures.\n\nOne important aspect we always discuss here, which is worth reminding everyone about, is that since Disney decided to jump into the streaming competition, it now retains exclusive rights to its own content after theatrical release,' Valliant Renegade explained.\n\nDisney no longer licenses content, such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, to third-party platforms such as Netflix, Amazon, and HBO, and therefore has inexplicably and voluntarily forfeited billions of dollars in potential revenue. Disney’s decision to exclusively stream its own content is a head scratcher. Disney is essential cutting off its own nose, and shooting itself in the foot simultaneously.\n\nNow with its ill-advised foray into steaming, the once envied entertainment company is struggling to find a profit on almost every single film released. Disney's bloated budgets for these projects are vastly higher than the competition on average, particularly considering the fact that every single film Disney releases comes with blockbuster $200 million production price tags,' the YouTuber explained.\n\nDisney would have significantly more revenue if it simply jettisoned Disney+, and pursued licensing agreements with major streaming services.

I’ve enjoyed a few of the recent Marvel iterations, but they are resoundingly suffering from poor writing, lack of originality, and weak creative vision.\n\nThe DeSantis situation will ultimately be a nothingburger.  DeSantis is testing the absolute limits of gubernatorial power and he’s undoubtedly going to catch hell at some point.  Disney abusing the privileges of their zone to break the law seems like garden variety corporate chicanery.\n\nIIRC, Disney is also the major stakeholder in Hulu.  Streaming is going to collapse and consolidate, but considering how they’ve got their fingers in so many platform pies, they will likely endure.  If anything, WBD is the one clearly in trouble here.  HBO as a brand has been destroyed, DC movies basically light money on fire, they’ve unnecessarily sequestered content people in enjoy, MAX is given away for free to AT&T fiber costumers, HBO content is starting to show up on Netflix, and you can buy season passes day and date on digital media platforms like Apple’s.\n\nThere are no shortage of headwinds, but I think it has more to do with the macro and industry-wide issues coming to bear.  Disney has idiosyncratic problems, but I wouldn’t expect a lot out of media companies in general right now.  It’s a fixable situation, but obviously, no guarantees.  Clearly catching falling knives is a bad idea, but at the same time, if you are waiting for a cohesive, obvious bull thesis to happen, you’ll be buying late and gain chasing.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I like Disney…debt.
