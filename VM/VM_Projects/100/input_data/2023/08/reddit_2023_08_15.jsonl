That can be repackaged to say, “the time is right when the price is right”, for long term holders. Even for intermediate holders, fundamentals inform direction in the event of mean reversion. \n\nRegarding TA… I can’t say this enough: TA is a report of demand *based on best available information at the time*. This is why it can be useful, but can also be garbage. New information moves demand. Absent new information, patterns can have value. Relying on TA alone is dangerous, because it ignores what is likely to happen if new information is introduced.

Another one in 2008. Then we had 2020 and you have smaller ones along the way like 1990 and 2016. There's one thing that sabotages so many of you. The need to feel like you're fitting in. The need to feel like you're right. The need to feel like you're in a group. These are all absolutely terrible traits if you're going to be a trader. Most of the successful traders I have met look at people like Cannon fodder. They are things to be used. What they think or believe is irrelevant. Sometimes they don't mind going with the trend other times they don't but at all times they don't care in the slightest what's popular unless there is potential to make money. \n\nI'll give you a current example. The mouth breathers are all about shorting bonds. They don't tell you what other trades they have on the flip side of that. Lot of media attention on short bonds. That's one of the dumbest trade someone with a retail account could make. Look at the monthly chart on the ZT and ZB futures. Look at TLT even. You're bumping into financial crisis numbers like the peak before the 2008 drop so you're talking decade lows. You really want to short that? 😂\n\nBuying bonds Hand over fist is unpopular, but it's one of the things that people should be doing. The United States economy cannot function in the long-term with rates this high. That means if you load up on bonds, even if you have the timing off which you probably will. The odds of outperformance over the next 60 months from this price level are very high.. The best risk to reward is in the 3-month and the 6 month if you buy direct bills but the only ETF product worth trading is TLT and it's not on the end of the curve you really want but it should still work because normally when the Fed begins to cut rates it's extremely aggressive. In fact the best risk to reward way I can think of to play that is shorting the January 2025 $100 puts. Great money in those. It goes on margin what you're not even really doing much with. Run one of those contracts for every 50,000 of capital you have or so. It's free money. If things go sideways and you get assigned which is always a risk. Your assignment cost would be down about $91 a share.

{"title": "Your Next Amazon Order Might Be Delivered Without A Box", "selftext": "Amazon is set to change how it delivers products, skipping the extra Amazon box for certain items like TVs and toasters. This move is part of CEO Andy Jassy's strategy to boost profits and reduce waste. Around 11% of items already arrive without extra packaging, and Amazon aims to expand this approach to cut costs and promote sustainability. While there are potential risks like theft due to visible packaging, the benefits in terms of efficiency and reduced environmental impact are significant. Other companies like Brita have already redesigned packaging to align with Amazon's program, signaling a positive industry shift. This change aligns with Jassy's vision for a more profitable and eco-friendly Amazon.\n\n**Target & Starbucks Genius Strategy**\n\nTarget has unveiled a new nationwide initiative – free curbside delivery of Starbucks orders – catering to the younger generation's penchant for mobile ordering. Customers using Target's Drive Up service can now seamlessly add Starbucks purchases to their order. This collaboration aligns with Starbucks' strategy to enhance customer experience through digital convenience, resonating with the growing Gen Z and Millennial customer base. Starbucks reported a 12% revenue boost in Q3 2023, reaching a record $9.2 billion, with its mobile app usage surging by 12.4% last year. The Starbucks-Target partnership is set to enhance convenience for busy parents, and the service will be available in 1,700+ stores with Starbucks Cafés and Drive Up service by October.\n\n**The Saga Continues: Barbie and Oppenheimer Box Office Dominance**\n\nBarbie and Oppenheimer dominated the weekend box office, securing the top two spots and raking in $33.7 million and $18.8 million respectively, as reported by the Hollywood Reporter. Barbie's performance propelled it into the list of top 10 films with the biggest fourth weekends in history, pushing its domestic earnings to a whopping $526.3 million.\n\nOppenheimer followed closely, claiming the second spot and adding to its success with a total domestic pull of $264 million and a global box office tally of $649 million. This makes it director Christopher Nolan's fifth-highest grossing film, trailing only The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem secured $15.8 million, while Meg 2: The Trench slipped to fourth place, amassing a total domestic earning of $54.1 million after a $12.7 million weekend.\n\nA new entry, Last Voyage of Demeter, the Dracula film with a $45 million budget, debuted with $6.5 million. Disney’s Haunted Mansion earned $5.6 million and claimed sixth place, premiering just after the start of the actor's strike.\n\n**Hershey Steps Up as Health-Conscious Consumers Seek Wellness in Snacks**\n\nHershey introduced its better-for-you confection (BFY) strategy in 2021, aiming to expand options for health-conscious snackers. This includes no sugar added, zero-sugar, plant-based, and protein-packed products. The move was influenced by consumer insights revealing a growing focus on wellness:\n\n\\- 71% prioritize a healthy lifestyle\n\n\\- 78% see healthy eating as crucial\n\n\\- 70% aim to reduce sugar intake\n\n\\- 62% look to add protein to their diet\n\nHershey caters to these trends through various initiatives:\n\n1. **Sugar Management:** They revamped the Zero Sugar line, experiencing tripled sales. They acquired Lily's, known for no-added sugar treats, and launched Honest Organic Gummies.\n\n2. **Plant-Based Options:** The company tapped into the booming vegan chocolate market with Hershey’s Plant Based Extra Creamy with Almonds & Sea Salt and Reese’s Plant Based Peanut Butter Cups.\n\n3. **Protein Occasions:** Addressing the demand for protein, they acquired ONE™ Brands and are launching protein-packed ONE™ Puffs.\n\nHershey collaborates with retailers to capitalize on the BFY trend, placing products strategically and utilizing eye-catching displays. BFY confection's growth potential is high, offering consumers more choices for various occasions. The success of this strategy stems from consumer insights, market awareness, and strategic partnerships.\n\nEdit: Seems like the community enjoy this type of information.
