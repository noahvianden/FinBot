Prior to this the SPAC's future price ratios were based on \\~200M shares post merger\n\nWith 1.3B in cash to balance sheet, this meant for a **Price/Book ratio of 6.9 (industry average)** the share price was set to roughly **$45 a share.** which I don't think was a coincidence for the former 45th president. The share count was decided on to achieve this share price via marketcap from price ratios imo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9vnmiy5jp5ib1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=857ba8dad2eef7e15541f8065a5d9a3115ac9651\n\nIn the long timeline stock chart - this is around the price the stock was trading until the expiration date for the PIPE was looming.\n\n**At a current price of 17.30 this is only a P/B ratio of \\~2.66**\n\n# The PIPE is still on\n\nIn almost a year after expiring, of the 48 investors in the original PIPE, only one or two have sent in termination notices who originally had $139M total in stake.\n\nThe original PIPE was designed so that based on the share price during the original timeline the shares in the post merged entity would vary drastically in pie size between the PIPE investors and TMTG.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycya9kzoo5ib1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ba4371f01d4654cf6a002a0e0ae623e8381c845\n\nDepending on the share price (as it 'averages' following the merger) the shares would be divided up anywhere from the PIPE investors getting 7.1% stake in the company up to a 44.5% stake in the company - similarly the TMTG holders (i.e. Trump) would receive anywhere from 39% up to  66%. With retail nearly unaffected in ownership % and the final share count being around 200M.\n\nAt the time the PIPE was negotiated - this represented more likely that they would receive a smaller stake in the company but with the stock trading on the open market for a higher price.\n\nSince the stock price has suffered, it's likely the renegotiation will involve new % ranges varied on different performance criteria - but the renegotiation will likely still be $1B in cash for roughly \\~1/3rd of the company.\n\nShould the PIPE not be exactly like this or fail entirely (don't think so) the bull play would still be strong but the uphill battle against the industry would be a little harder with less capital and the stock would need to trade more on forward looking fundamentals and a float squeeze\n\nThe PIPE deal, when closed, should provide massive positive catalyst and an even bigger catalyst when the funding is received on the merger.\n\n# Understanding the future fundamentals\n\nBelow you can see the key industry competitors sorted by largest company size (market cap)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vmbk73mqo5ib1.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=0efa340c72401e0d469de4749ce631c3d10ceeea\n\nCompanies like Facebook have about 3 billion monthly active users (MAU) or Netflix has around 238M monthly subscribers.\n\nTo get a sense of what the future revenues of TMTG would like we need to understand what their monetization with Truthsocial and TMTG+ would look like\n\nHere's the same list sorted by most revenue per user\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzxn3tkro5ib1.png?width=691&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e129f6202029f2c3ad11e4a872cd858480a0ed8\n\nFacebook has the highest revenue of any social media company (around $39 per user per year) because of their targeted ads being able to reach so many global users with large pools of every demographic (plus other over reaching data issues congress has roasted them for)\n\nOther companies like Tik Tok and Twitter are quite a bit lower around $10 per user a year.\n\nI believe TS would be around $6 a year in revenue per users eventually getting up to $20. This makes it more like Twitter or Pinterest but eventually reaching closer to Facebook\n\nThis would put the **marketcap per user of Truthsocial around $50M for every 1M monthly** users in the near term, and **$130 in the long term. (similar to Rumble's marketcap per MAU)**\n\nThis is **an additional $2.5 in share price increase for every 10M TS users**. Eventually **$6.5** in the long run for every 10M TS users.\n\nTruth social currently has about 8M users based on Trump's follow count (plus the samples of people not following Trump extrapolated). This is amounts to about $320M in marketcap currently, **but would quickly turn into $4-10B around the election cycle when the bandwagoners join in.** (100M - 200M users)\n\nAnd before you junkies tell me :\n\n# \"BuT IT's ToXiC To ADverTiSerS\"\n\n\" But the biggest chunk of Facebook's $70 billion ad business comes from small businesses, which account for **nearly 75% of its annual ad revenue**, according to Deutsche Bank \"\n\nIt comes from small business - this was never a real concern to anyone who actually understands the industry. Just retail blindly believing what another regard said. Also you don't need ads for subscription revenue such as TMTG+\n\nRumble is already seeing $2.3 a year in revenue per user according to their latest 10-Q filing today.\n\n\\--\n\nTMTG+\n\nStreaming companies like Netflix have a very high revenue per user because of their subscription model.\n\nIn order to quantify the company evaluation from TMTG+ subscriptions let's look to the streaming industry\n\nSorted by most users\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4khod4xuo5ib1.png?width=388&format=png&auto=webp&s=2759374fae34cc42455a77fa4d0935d432d6f2b7\n\nSorted by highest revenue per user\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvi8duewo5ib1.png?width=370&format=png&auto=webp&s=6faf55c3237bfe8e64b91e16a62539afbc844f58\n\nSorted by highest 'no ads' subscription\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lcywj3hxo5ib1.png?width=462&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe70185569059ea41d0effb688076c41cef38d8b\n\nIt's reasonable to say that TMTG+ would be charging it's users around $10-14 a month for no ads.\n\nScott St. John is the director from Deal or No Deal and America's Got Talent who is producing TMTG+'s content so he'll have plenty of traction in that industry\n\nIf we say the revenue per user per year of TMTG+ is about $120 that would fit that the the **marketcap per user is about $720M per 1M subscribers**  (P/S ratio of 6). This is an **additional share price of about $36.00 for every 10M TMTG Subs**\n\nTMTG News could pull anywhere from 5-50% of Fox's Revenue. Fox Corporation brings in about 14B. multiplying this by about 1/3rd for news and then by about 1/3rd for start up audience. Another 1-2B in revenue. Since it's a low P/S in the news industry of around 1-2. 2B marketcap is reasonable **or additional $10 to the share price** and eventually 20-30 more to marketshare and market growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9x1tlzyo5ib1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e584f2cf023fa746ab1d5e53d1d38d6438a9f481\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis corporate slide deck says 41M TS users and 4M TMTG users in 2023 going to 56M and 11M in 2024.\n\nI think this is underestimated vastly because of the\n\n# Bandwagon effect.\n\nYou will see more supporters of this than ever before.\n\nHundreds of millions of Americans will be told and believe that the answer to all of their problems in life are going to come from Trump. Cant afford a home? Trump. Never a promotion?  Trump. Your girlfriend is fat and ugly? Support Trump. Erectile dysfunction? Just support Trump.\n\nJust like Budlight going down the tubes, a mass number of Americans and people around the world will be showing their support by canceling their legacy news, social media, and streaming services and instead signing up for TS, TMTG+, and news.\n\nThe closer the election cycle gets the more you will see it. I think we can expect 50M additional Truthsocial users within two months of the merger happening and another 150M by the end 2024.\n\nTMTG+ will cough up 14.5M subscribers within a month of opening (Sound of Freedom Box office 173M, divide this by the monthly fee of \\~$12) - SoF continues to pile on multiple millions in box office daily.\n\nThis number will go up to 40M by 2024 and 60M by 2025.\n\nLets put this into share numbers\n\n# Calculating Minimum Share Price\n\n50M TS users ($12.5 /s ), 14.5M TMTG+ subs ($52.20), 5% of Fox ($4.25) = $69 a share by end of 2023\n\n200M TS users ($50 /s), 44M TMTG+ subs ($144), 12% of Fox ($10) \\~ $205 a share by Dec 2024.\n\n300M TS users ($120 /s \\[higher ARPU\\] ), 60M TMTG+ subs ($216), 15% of Fox ($13) \\~ $350 \\~ 2026\n\n500M TS users  ($325 /s). 80M TMTG+ subs ($288), 25% of fox ($21.25) \\~ $635 \\~ 2027\n\nThis does not include search engine, web services, or other revenue streams. These markets total into the trillions. 2-3 Trillion for the news and entertainment. **Even 1% of any single one of these markets is an additional $50 a share to the share price per 1% per market.**\n\n# TMTG / DWAC to $750 a share is only ~5% of the entertainment and news industry.\n\nBut these are fundamental trading numbers, this does not account for the fact that there are millions - tens of millions - of people who are strong followers of Trump pumping and touting the stock - pricing in years of growth in the near term.\n\nThis crowd will get the stock excessive meme power. On top the of the clout from the election - it's set to be a self feeding cycle that will drive more users to its platform - generating more revenue - pumping the stock more.\n\nThe low float, merger, PIPE, and election cycle are set to set extreme upwards pressure on the stock I could see it hitting previous ATH and well beyond in the very near term. **I'm predicting the stock to hit 1000 before the next general election** with a few big spikes before that.\n\n# Catalysts\n\nPIPE - As per the 2nd amendment to the merger part (x) the company is to make best reasonable efforts to discuss with the investors of the PIPE by August 31st, 2023. I'm expecting a news catalyst confirming the PIPE by the end of this month or September.\n\nMerger- I expected the merger will be completed well before the December 31st extension. Probably around October to November given the timeline of other SPACs that had significant delays due to investigations.\n\nMarketing Budget Access - In the first few months following the merger closing - I expect marketing budget to be ramped up significantly and a massive influx of users well excepting Rumble's MAU of 44M at very fast pace leading momentum into the election cycle which should see another 100-200M users.\n\nProgramming Budget Access - In the first three months following the merger, I expect to see a lot of new programmers brought on to significant increase features and capabilities.\n\nGeneral Investment Budget Access - In the first six months following the merger, I expect to see massive headlines about investments and involvements/endorsements from the new TMTG+ budget.\n\nPrimaries - The primaries coming to a close should drive a lot of bandwagoners to TS as part of the election cycle catalyst.\n\nTMTG+ Launch - the content from this service should exceed Sound of Freedom's traction and drive up expectations of future earnings from subscriptions.\n\nTS Usercount - The continued election cycle bandwagoners should drive up user count, engagement, and ad revenue expectations.\n\nGeneral Election- The election cycle coming to a close could be the ultimate hype in expectations for future earnings\n\nEarnings - Revenues pile in driving price ratios forcing the stock upwards triggering any short sale coverings\n\n# TLDR\n\n$DWAC $TMTG is massively undervalued based on the massive potential upside and coming catalysts. The price has been beaten down well below reasonable and historical values based on P/B ratios and potential future revenue streams. Access to PIPE and SPAC funding has been delayed massively but is getting ready to be put into predictable time frames again causing massively bullish action that will drive momentum into the election cycle. Similar economic action has been seen with Budlight collapsing and SoF box office $173M (millions more daily) which translates into tens of millions of subscribers for the Netflix competitor TMTG+.

That PIPE deal is set up as a death spiral convertible. The company could very well succeed but it’s most likely going to bump in the first few days then slide down and stay down until it has some proven traction. It’s going to have massive share dilution until those warrants are through. \n\nUsing those warrants in your P/B ratio calculation is kind of faulty. Yes they have 1.3 billion but it’s a massive drag on the stock not the company. You are going to see shares explode as they try to offload 2 billion or so in equity. As the price drops more and more shares will be generated because it’s a set payout and shares will be created to sell until they get their return.

If the stock is at ratio driven levels the things you’re describing don’t have much effect or at least are short lived. If the stock is trading higher based on retail hype and other factors what you’re describing could have a bigger affect. The market cap is based on 200M shares post merger- I would like to hear your suggestion on how to calculate market cap other wise .\nThe “death spiral convertible” is something you regurgitated from a nearly 2 year old article that has a completely different context than the current environment and had flawed reasoning to begin with - also the methods used in this DD have little to do with any of that anyways", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "What changed in the current environment? It’s still the same PIPE deal. It wasn’t just one article. It’s pretty damn clear https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000119312521348598/d242442d425.htm \n\nThe PIPE investors get discounted shares on a seven day moving average. They still like money. They will short shares and then use the convertibles to push prices down with their reduced cost basis. They will continue to creat more shares and you have a death spiral. There is absolutely zero reason for them not to. \n\nWarning people not to be an early investor because of a PIPE deal literally designed to make investors into bag holders is important when doing a DD. It also disputes your idea of a low float. The rest of your DD is beyond a fantasy. I’m not saying they couldn’t succeed as a company. Saying they are going to be at a 200 billion market cap next year is absurd. The amount of users you think will immediately join is wildly inflated. The earnings per user is also wildly inflated. \n\nThe streaming platform you suggest will take time to generate and find content. Capturing users is costly. They have to create original IP or lease it from others. Without depth of content and winning exclusives they will not draw subscribers. Being headed by a reality TV director should be a red flag not a plus. People do not subscribe for reality tv. No one’s paying for Netflix just to watch IS IT CAKE. I mean you have everything from a short squeeze to being the next FOX and Netflix. Largely ignore the cost of revenue. It’s all over the place. \n\nLook at DWAC itself. You tout his fan base as the driver for this near instantaneous miraculous growth. Did DWAC retain its pricing? Where is the insane support for DWAC? Retail may go crazy, but like DWAC when they start losing money quickly they are out just like DWAC. Institutional investors the bulk of what they will need won’t buy based on this hopium. They are going to realize the massive amount of debt they are going to take on just to get TMTG+ rolling. \n\nYou assume a P/B ratio without a real deep dive on where that book value will come from. They have very little tangible book and they have nearly no IP for intangible. The cash will be needed, corporate bonds, they can’t issue equity for awhile and I am pretty sure that extends to preferred shares based on the PIPE. Speaking of book look at PARA and how their journey to streaming has looked. Trading under .5 of book has loads of IP people want to consume. Is having solid growth. At the cost of massive debt, lowest subscriber fees, also the cost to capture subscribers is a massive drag on the company. They have a news, they have movie studios, they have the god damn NFL. \n\nYou have them at 4x of PARA and Twitters market cap combined by next year. That’s some serious Donnie dick sucking because that’s basically all they have. His name attached.
