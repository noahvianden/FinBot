It's okay to go long in calls (like you did with RIVN), but it will kill you if you let a position go to $0 rather than exiting early at a 20% loss or even a 40% loss.   Even taking a 50% loss is better than taking a 90% or 100% loss - as long as you still have capital to work with you can eventually recover your account.  And the more money you have left after a loss, the more options you have in how to recover.\n\nWhen trading long positions, going 30-60dte further than your \"trading window\" time frame will give you more theta (so there's still value left to sell if a trade moves against you) and will help preserve capital when the market doesn't agree with your outlook.  \n\nHonestly, I think managing (and minimizing) losses is the #1 biggest distinction between great traders and average traders.

It's seems like there are four battery prototypes that they are working on now and each one seems like a huge deal. \n\n* The first one is the NMC \"Million mile/100 year battery\" that we heard about last year. They are saying that cell has now reached 19.5k cycles with little degradation. That's equivalent to 3.7 million miles at 25 degrees. Obviously, this is not real world operating temperature but still this is more that enough cycle life for all of the high nickel vehicles to become mobile powerplants running on autobidder. \n\n* The second one, which the lead researcher said was the best of the four, had a silicon carbide anode. I'm guessing this one has some extreme charge rate with more durability for the silicon in the anode. \n\n* The third one sounds like a upgraded LFP battery that the lead researcher said was his second favorite but did not give any details. My guess is more cycle life and higher density. \n\n* The fourth one sounds like a lithium metal battery but not many details on this one either. \n\nI love the FSD hype but I'm most exited for the vehicle to grid possibilities that forever batteries provide. I'm hoping Elon is cagey on this due to a desire of not pissing off the utilities and not because he's unconvinced this could solve the renewables problem, because it absolutely could. California's NEM 3.0 is the reaction to the extreme duck curve that is now seen in places with high % of solar generation. Solar conversion has a ceiling without TWh of batteries and we'll be waiting alot longer if we wait on the stationary battery buildout first. \n\nhttps://www.torquenews.com/11826/tesla-researchers-announce-4-million-mile-battery-its-only-3rd-bets-cell-chemistry-they", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, ideally EV'S could actually solve the grid problems, not cause them.
