Instead, here’s some interesting data for you to consider against your current positioning and P/L:\n\nWhen the broader market (S&P 500 as measured by SPY) bottomed in Oct 22 (@356.56), it was right around the price level where the market first started to break-out into new all time highs (Nov 2020, 354.56 - vaccine EUA approval). This also isn’t far from where the market first began recovering into new highs post-covid (Aug 2020 @338.64) from covid sell-off bottom (Feb 2020, 338.34). \n\nYou can nearly draw a perfect horizontal line straight across the chart connecting these price levels over time. If you’re a technical analyst you might say these would be the support/resistance and proof of pivot points. If you’re not a chartist, you might infer from this data in retrospect that essentially all of the gains during the Covid era were erased by the market.\n\nSo, if you had bought and held 100% SPY on 4/1/21 (@400.61), at the current 52-week highs on 7/31/23 (@457.79) your open P/L over that period would have been *UP* by 14%! Not flat to 1% percent as you currently stand. With those facts in mind, congrats on getting back to even. That’s a great feeling, and you’re probably sleeping better at night! But, this data shows you’re underperforming the broader market over the same time period.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "As someone who trades for a living, this is the advice I’d add (lots of this is from memory from Stock Trader’s Almanac, Investment Psychology Explained if you want to read more):\n\nThe market is making higher highs and higher lows since October of last year, and is getting closer to previous all time highs set nearly two years ago. Those prior support/resistance pivot points also show you over a broader period that when the market breaks out into new all-time highs, there is period of positive price momentum before the next bear market. So, as we get closer to 4800 on the S&P 500, the probabilities that you’re getting in “at the top” or “have missed the move” are actually quite low over a longer time horizon, as history proves. All you’ve missed is the opportunity to get in at lower costs by buying the dips.\n\nIf you consider repositioning (and based on this analysis, my *opinion* is you probably should - not suggesting 100% SPY, just using as an easy compare), Aug/Sept/Oct are historically some of the weakest periods for broader market returns post-WWII. Some of the biggest sell offs in market history have occurred during this time frame, and ironically many of the market bottoms have too. Momentum is definitely slowing as volatility has begun to rise two weeks into this calendar window. The S&P also closed below it’s 50 day yesterday, so that will likely bring in some sellers. So, the probabilities of you being able to reposition in the coming weeks at better prices are in your favor, because trading volumes (and thus liquidity) are historically lower than average during these late summer/early fall months when people are traveling and many institutional players are in their conference seasons. As a result, broader price swings can occur on lower buying/selling demand relative to other periods of the year.\n\nIf you’re someone who likes to wait for confirmation of trend resumption (because the best times to buy are often when the scariest/most negative headlines come out and it’s often hard to emotionally pull the trigger on the buy), then rest assured that Nov-Apr are historically the strongest 6 months of the year for market returns post-WWII, so you could wait until early November to buy, and can likely expect to see the market marching close to making new 52 week highs and back towards previous all time highs (assuming no exogenous “black swans” pop up).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate your effort to give a exhaustive answer to my (kind of silly) question. \n\nI was considering buying only index funds (maybe ftse all world or s&p500) going forward, but reading your comments I'm starting to think about actually closing some position and transfer the money into those etfs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe one thing that is stopping me is that I hate selling at a loss and I hate selling my \"winners\"  so I feel kind of stuck... seems crazy but controlling your feelings really is the hardest part.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "LOL - yeah, it was exhaustive, but glad you found the info helpful.

Tesla continues to outperform in a sector that's being brutalized by high rates and loan delinquencies.   \n\n\nI think what a lot of you lost in the angsty sauce are missing is that Tesla is still the 8th largest public company on the planet, even if we drop to $165.

What he actually said is *\"What disappoints me is how much CEO tainted the Tesla brand\"*.  There is no \"most\" here.\n\n* You do not actually have any way to know what he is thinking.  Internet telepathy doesn't exist.\n* Even if he was actually more disappointed that TSLA was not constantly rocketing (an unrealistic expectation under any situation, independent of Elon), that does not preclude also being disappointed in Elon\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>he's really a very small part of the stock's situation (aside from the massive open market share sale last year but that's not what's been hurting us since $105).\n\n(2) It is impossible to separate the effect of interest rate hikes and Elon's behavior, on total demand for Tesla vehicles.  We have seen examples of people who do not want to buy Tesla cars because of Elon's abhorrent behavior: [Semmel\\_Baecker's wife](https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/1392v1y/comment/jj41i7m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [Glide Outside's friend](https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/15rg1jn/comment/jw8ttrj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n* It is true that Tesla will continue to sell every car they make.  However, decreasing the pool of potential customers competing to buy the cars ultimately lower prices and lowers margins.\n* It is indefensible to say with certainty that Elon is only a \"small\" part of the problem.  That's your opinion, but it is not a fact.\n* TSLA valuation is driven by more than just numbers.  Fewer investors interested in buying TSLA means lower share price.  Investors may be more wary of a company headed by a CEO who is exhibiting a trend of becoming more and more unhinged and disconnected from reality.\n   * For example: Elon's claim on Twitter that Italy offered a venue for a fight with Zuckerberg, was [denied on the record by the Italian culture minister](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/11/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-cage-fight-italy-government), who said there had only been discussions.\n   * Elon saying that he was going to roll up to Zuckerberg's house uninvited and demand to fight, is unhinged.  In many places in the USA, doing this to someone will end in a gunfight -- it would in my town anyways.\n\nElon had been saying for many quarters that he thought the economic situation would be difficult for Tesla.\n\nIt therefore makes no logical sense, that he would behave in a way that would deliberately give customers any reason to decide not to purchase a Tesla vehicle.\n\n**Edit:** It's reasonable to expect that a CEO refrain from actions that could reasonably be expected to damage demand for a company's products, when that CEO knows tough economic times are in the cards.  I will not hold Elon to a lower standard.  Elon demands nothing less than the best from his employees, we should demand nothing less than the best from him", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "lol buddy I can't man.

Interest rates did not skyrocket overnight.\n* Elon has zero credibility on FSD after 6 years of saying it was imminent.  Why not let the YouTube videos speak for the product's progress?\n* The immature twitter political trolling and Zuckerberg fight drama make Elon appear mentally unstable, which does not help investor confidence.\n\nI don't want Elon to pump TSLA stock for the short term.  When he tried to do that for his own mercenary reasons by saying he thought Tesla would be bigger than Apple + Aramco, it didn't help.\n\nI do wish he'd stop actively damaging the company's reputation by making claims he cannot back up.\n\n* I do think there's a possibility that he has become delusional or disconnected from reality.   Elon claimed on Twitter that the Italian government offered him a Coliseum fight venue, which the top Italian government culture official denied on the record ([https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/15rg1jn/comment/jwc1990/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TSLALounge/comments/15rg1jn/comment/jwc1990/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nI don't want a TSLA stock pump (ineffective anyways) or a focus on short term profits.\n\nI do want Elon to stop stretching the truth, outright lying, and doing other things that make investors question Tesla's business integrity.
