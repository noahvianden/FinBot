Let's troubleshoot:\n\n1. **Resolution Settings**:  \n\n\n* Ensure that the resolution set for the monitor in question matches its native resolution.\n* Right-click on the desktop and choose Display Settings (if you're using Windows).\n* Check the resolution settings for each monitor and make sure they're appropriate.\n\n1. **Graphics Drivers**:  \n\n\n* Outdated or corrupted graphics drivers can cause display issues.\n* Update your graphics drivers from the manufacturer's website (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel) rather than through Windows Update to get the most accurate and recent driver.\n\n1. **Monitor Settings**:  \n\n\n* Some monitors have an \"Auto Adjust\" feature in their on-screen menu. Try using this feature to see if it corrects the issue.\n* Ensure other settings like \"H/V Position\" or \"Clock/Phase\" are set to default or appropriate values.\n\n1. **Cable Check**:  \n\n\n* Ensure the cables connecting your monitor to the docking station are properly seated.\n* Consider swapping out the cable for a known working one to rule out the possibility of a faulty cable.\n* If using an adapter (like HDMI to DVI), try connecting without it to see if it's causing the issue.\n\n1. **Docking Station**:  \n\n\n* Docking stations can sometimes have compatibility or firmware issues. Check if there's a firmware update available for your docking station.\n* If possible, connect your monitor directly to your laptop without the docking station. If the issue disappears, the dock might be the culprit.\n\n1. **Software & OS**:  \n\n\n* Some software applications can manipulate screen behavior. Ensure no such applications are running in the background.\n* If using Windows, ensure the \"Scale and layout\" setting in the Display Settings is set to an appropriate value, typically 100% unless you've intentionally set it higher.\n\n1. **Graphics Control Panel**:  \n\n\n* NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel have their control panels for display settings. Dive into these settings to check if any unusual configurations could be causing the wrapping effect.\n\n1. **Testing**:  \n\n\n* Try connecting the problematic monitor to a different computer. If the issue persists on another device, then the monitor itself might be the problem.\n* Conversely, try connecting a different monitor to your laptop. If the issue is replicated, then the laptop or its settings might be the root of the problem.\n\nIf after all these steps the issue remains unresolved, consider reaching out to the manufacturer of the problematic hardware, be it the monitor, the docking station, or the laptop. They might be aware of specific compatibility issues or can offer additional troubleshooting steps.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I got everything taken care of.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What was the underlying issue?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Funky settings - that differ from those at the office", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "So who do you believe, elon or Zuck.
