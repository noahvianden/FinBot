First, learn charts and basic fundamentals ALWAYS the first step, don't buy to hodl at peak values... etc. Pick 1-3 and FOLLOW them. All news. All press releases. Sec filings. Everything. Buy when it drops, sell when it goes up. You literally get out of it what you're willing to put into learning about it and developing a strategy that works for you. Everyone is different.

If you're 20 and it's money you don't need for living expense, it's a totally valid strategy to buy good named stocks and hold them and gain a bit more than inflation eats every year. With splits and such on the big names in 20 years you'd be golden. You will still need to manage your portfolio. There is never a good reason not to manage a portfolio no matter what you put in it. But 1-5 is almost a gamble of even keeping up with inflation because one loser in that time frame will kill the gains of the winners. \n\nLastly.

He knows that a decades long policy of zero to negative interest rates, yes there were negative nominal interest rates, have led to some very bad choices by people and business. And that excess and mindset has to be fixed; at least as much as he can while he's in office.\n\nHe knows that once he leaves the Fed, that is it. Rates will come back down again as the next person in charge lowers rates to reduce the strain on the financial system. But the question is can Powell reduce rates just a little and keep them at say 3-4% instead of 0% to show others that we can keep rates off the zero bound and have a functioning economy. Of course the answer is yes. But people will believe what they want as long as it serves its own interest.\n\nAt this point it doesn't matter if the Fed increases interest rates 50 basis points or not. The impact will be the same for all intents and purposes. The only real question is how long they keep rates up and how does that impact productivity and output.

Not that the public markets are cheap, but the guys holding leveraged assets in the private markets are hoping for Powell to relent and lower rates so they can hold onto what they have without taking a bigger haircut than necessary.\n\nHere's an interview with Meb Faber on some of the things going on in real estate right now.

During the 2008 financial crisis, Warren Buffett stepped in to take advantage of the crisis to get good deals for himself with companies that overextended themselves during that time. He got sweetheart deals and was able to use his cash position to help these companies get through a challenging time. However, during the pandemic he wasn't able to. Why is that? It's because of the fiscal and monetary policy that the Trump administration forced down Powell's throat to \"combat\" the pandemic. \n\nSo not only is Powell having to deal with ZIRP and NIRP, he also has to deal with the wild spending that occured as a result of the Trump and Biden Administrations. And in truth, Powell is probably using the Inflation Reduction Act as cloud cover to continue to keep rates up and squeeze more of this excess out of the system.
