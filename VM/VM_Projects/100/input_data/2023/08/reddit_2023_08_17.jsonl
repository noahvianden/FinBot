People who own homes always think their house is more valuable than it is. So those numbers only go down once they see real declines in their home value. The actual data for home prices and rent prices have been falling a lot, but since they don't use actual data, and some nonsense survey, that component of inflation, which is 25% of the CPI is highly lagged.
