This comes as a mild U.S. recession is on the horizon for early 2024 and asset quality looks set to decline from solid but unsustainable levels, with particular risks in some banks’ commercial real estate (CRE) portfolios.”\n\nRegional U.S. banks were thrust into the spotlight earlier this year after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank triggered a run on deposits across the sector. The panic eventually spread to Europe and resulted in the emergency rescue of Swiss giant Credit Suisse by domestic rival UBS.\n\nRead more \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/08/moodys-cuts-ratings-of-10-us-banks-and-puts-some-big-names-on-downgrade-watch.html", "id": "15lgqex", "created_utc": 1691497462.0, "score": 604, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "\n\nDowngrades | Review for Downgrades | Negative Outlooks\n---|---|----\nM&T Bank | Cullen/Frost | Simmons First National\nWebster Financial | Bank of New York Mellon | Fifth Third\nBOK Financial | U.S. Bancorp | F.N.B Corp.\nFulton Financial | Truist | Citizens Financial\nPinnacle Financial | State Street | Huntington Bancshares \nOld National | Northern Trust | PNC\nProsperity Bancshares | | Regions Financial\nAmarillo National | | Cadence Bank\nAssociated Banc-Corp | | Ally Financial\nCommerce Bancshares | | Bank OZK\n | | Capital One", "score": 303, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.

I don't have positions in any of the popular items you read about on social media. Most the time I'm adding and reducing volatility. Stocks that have established channels are fun.

So when we get into an accelerating market I'll put on things that move maybe 1.5, 2X S&P. You can do this with stocks, options or futures. If we run up quickly like we recently have I have rolled a lot of those positions into indexes and have aggressively started buying TLT. If we get a scenario where stocks start to eat shit bonds are going to go up because it's going to be on the back of slowing revenue slowing earnings and so on. The money I make in TLT will roll into those lower equities. If that does not take place there's not a lot of downside in bonds from here because inflation is certainly not going to accelerate with the Fed rate about 2.5 plus inf. If bonds go nowhere the indexes will creep up so I will make something but most importantly at times like this I'm limiting my losses. You're seeing good deals pop back up on some of the major stocks like Black Rock and eBay and so on so when you start getting down around those weekly lows you can add to those.

The study finds that raising the minimum wage could cause poor Californians to pay proportionately more for basic purchases such as groceries, because as the minimum wage increases, so do labor costs. Employers respond to increasing wages in one of three ways: They increase prices, reduce employment, or reduce profits. In their analysis, the researchers assume the increased labor costs would be passed on in the form of higher consumer prices and not in job losses or lower profits. The study finds that the 1996 federal minimum wage increase from $4.25 to $5.15 costs California families an average of $133 more per year for the goods they purchase due to higher prices. Because goods produced by minimum wage workers – such as groceries – make up a large share of a low-income family’s total expenditures, poor families end up paying proportionately more for the goods they buy.\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Just don't man.
