Many hyped-up AI names are likely trading at or near their peak. Even using the most optimistic metrics, most AI stocks are simply too overvalued to be considered a buy, and many will inevitably tumble from their nosebleed high ranges.\r  \n\r  \nSure, AI will definitely have an impact. However, it is still a niche technology with limited use cases within some white-collar industries. It is far from becoming the next Google (or replacing it), and is currently a high cost loss-producing technology. No company is making money from AI today, or anytime soon. In fact, Bing’s AI integration only increased Google’s market share in the search engine market. With that in mind, taking profits or selling off some of the hottest AI stocks might be a good idea.\r  \n\r  \nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has a valuation that is impossible to justify using any traditional valuation metric, and going long on this stock is beyond dangerous at this stage in the cycle. This company has shrinking top- and bottom-lines, down 13% and 21%, respectively, on a non-GAAP basis year-over-year. Net income is still up 26% on a GAAP basis, but it is nowhere near its own metrics prior to 2022. Indeed, the hype around AI has certainly had its impact on this stock’s recent performance. But this hype isn’t based on anything that can actually be measured.\r  \n\r  \nYes, Nvidia has a foothold in the nascent AI chips industry. However, AI is software driven, and is not dependent on correlated hardware developments. It is also important to consider that there are strong competitors in this market. AI chips can be a niche industry in the future, but with Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) partnering up, will Nvidia hold onto its highly overrated dominance until then? The simple answer is no. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) are also top contenders in this AI chip space. Google’s chips already outperform anything that Nvidia produces. \r  \n\r  \nAgain, I’m not saying that Nvidia is a lost cause.
