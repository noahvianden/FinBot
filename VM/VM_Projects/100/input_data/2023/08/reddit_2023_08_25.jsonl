Pulling over to park behavior was new.\n\nAside from that, it's hard to draw any real conclusions about how much better it is than v11. A real stress test would've been DTLA or Newport, RI.\n\nElon said no objects were explicitly programmed, unlike V11. It didn't know about lanes, either -- which is interesting, because **the car had a screen with the blue area predicting where to go next, along with drawings of lanes and cars crossing ahead**. It looks similar to the displays on the previous builds. So how does that work if they didn't program it to identify lanes? Does the display just get the car's predictions by sampling the activations of the neural net? If so, then at least the code producing the display of the state of the car has been programmed to identify lanes, lights, signs, and cars, and then render those objects for the driver (though the core neural net model wasn't programmed to identify these things explicitly).\n\nThe car's neural nets probably have developed representations for all of those things during training, even if not explicitly programmed. So the code producing the display is somehow able to translate those inner representations into concrete renditions for the user.\n\nRegarding the intervention at the traffic light, the solution is to feed the network a lot more videos of controlled left traffic lights. The car at first did not proceed straight on a green light due to the left-only light being red. When the left light turned green, it indicated that it was proceeding straight while the forward light was red. Where it might get tricky is if the HW3 cameras (yes, the drive was on HW3) are sometimes physically incapable of distinguishing between a turn light and a straight light due to their poor resolution/persistence/contrast, etc. Then the only solution would be to upgrade all cars to HW4 (or higher) because no NN would be able to overcome that fundamental barrier of low-quality input data.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "who tf paid for the novel in the “notable crashes” section of the wikipedia “tesla autopilot” article?\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Autopilot\n\nhaven’t delved into the individual crashes listed, but i wouldn’t be surprised to find debunked claims\n\nand where’s the “notable crashes avoided” section? they wouldn’t even have to make little animated accident gifs like in the “notable crashes” section - there’s video of autopilot dodging (hundreds of?) crashes\n\nanyone can edit wikipedia. we should add that section and if they push back ask why they are sensationalizing bad news without any counterbalancing good news *for which there is literal video evidence*\n\nwikipedia’s mission is to make “the sum of human knowledge available to everyone”\n\nto that end, the sum of auto pilot crash knowledge is the number caused by it *plus the negative number avoided by it*", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/u8unmbudeikb1.jpeg?width=2056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a2a56ba9572491405cd9c91de5f6174ee66b2b6\n\nUp to 13 now!\n\n[https://x.com/ezekieloverstr1/status/1695514979875594485?s=46&t=yWmMeP08cyApbkkhK1zkcw](https://x.com/ezekieloverstr1/status/1695514979875594485?s=46&t=yWmMeP08cyApbkkhK1zkcw)", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Prob they're being shipped nationwide for delivery event.

Also, about 1,000 cars, including 500 electric ones, are in good condition at first glance, Berdowski said. But it is still unclear how they can be recovered.

The increased rates are just applied to new spending/borrowing as the treasury issues new bonds to pay for government approved spending (which includes servicing some old debt but not everything at once).\n\nThen the national debt/interest is a weird thing to grasp. Instead of thinking of it as a household spending money that needs to pay off their credit cards, the US is an infinitely rich immortal entity spending on margin. They can keep borrowing/spending money forever as long as they meet their interest payments. The US can do this since we're currently the most trustworthy immortal and control the world's reserve currency.\n\nWhere we will get into trouble is when we can't service our interest/debts/spending with revenue, have to issue even more debt at even higher rates to keep servicing ongoing spending. If this keeps up, once we're not the most trust worthy immortal anyone, the dollar then potentially loses its appeal. The good news for now is that any alternative is far worse off than the US so this shouldn't happen anytime soon.\n\nSo why don't we just set a low interest rate to solve these problems? Because greed and leverage. There's just no fiscal responsibility when money is ultra cheap or free. That HGTV guy bought 100 houses to flip since rates were cheap. The government is free to spend trillions since servicing debt is so cheap. People here bought 1000s of TSLA shares on margin. But all that spending turns into too high inflation. Sooner or later, rates need to rise (in an attempt to decrease spending) and servicing that debt becomes an issue. If rates don't rise to curb spending/demand, that's when you get hyperinflation.\n\nI think this is why Jpow said we probably need to feel economic pain. There needs to be consequences for shutting down the economy and printing trillions to prevent the economic pain from happening then. Same thing with the financial crisis. We've just been kicking the issues and problems down the road with QE. This keeps working until it doesn't though.\n\nBest path forward that I see is keeping rates highish. Allow supply to catch up, before letting demand increase too much again. Decrease government spending and possibly increase revenue to solve the above issue. If there are emergency cuts to rates and makes money cheap/free again, your family's $2M house will probably go for $2.5-3M and inflation is now back on the table.\n\nOf course all of this is immensely complex and intertwined between the population, country, interaction with other countries, financial system.

If they’re unable to make car loan payments, they bought too much car or just spending too much money on everything else. \n\nYep house prices won’t go down significantly without a recession. Keeping the rates high just keeps the house prices from getting even higher while the rest of the supply catches up. Even then a mild recession isn’t terrible.
