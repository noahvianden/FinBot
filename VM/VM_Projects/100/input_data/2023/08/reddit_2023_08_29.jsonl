Finding It Again Won’t Be Easy.*\n\n>*BERLIN—Two decades ago, Germany revived its moribund economy and became a manufacturing powerhouse of an era of globalization.*\n\n>*Times changed. Germany didn’t keep up. Now Europe’s biggest economy has to reinvent itself again. But its fractured political class is struggling to find answers to a dizzying conjunction of long-term headaches and short-term crises, leading to a growing sense of malaise.*\n\n>*Germany will be the world’s only major economy to contract in 2023, with even sanctioned Russia experiencing growth, according to the International Monetary Fund.*\n\nGermany’s reliance on manufacturing and world trade has made it particularly vulnerable to recent global turbulence: supply-chain disruptions during the Covid-19 pandemic, surging energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine, and the rise in inflation and interest rates that have led to a global slowdown.\n\nAt Germany’s biggest carmaker Volkswagen, top executives shared a dire assessment on an internal conference call in July, according to people familiar with the event. Exploding costs, falling demand and new rivals such as Tesla and Chinese electric-car makers are making for a “perfect storm,” a divisional chief told his colleagues, adding: “The roof is on fire.”\n\nThe problems aren’t new. Germany’s manufacturing output and its gross domestic product have stagnated since 2018, suggesting that its long-successful model has lost its mojo.\n\nChina was for years a major driver of Germany’s export boom. A rapidly industrializing China bought up all the capital goods that Germany could make. But China’s investment-heavy growth model has been approaching its limits for years. Growth and demand for imports have faltered.\n\nInstead of Germany’s best customers, Chinese industries have become aggressive competitors. Upstart Chinese carmakers are competing with German incumbents such as VW that are lagging in the electric-vehicle revolution.\n\nMore broadly, the world has become less favorable to the kind of open trade that benefited Germany. The shift was expressed most clearly in then-President Donald Trump imposing tariffs not only on imports from China but also those of U.S. allies in Europe. The U.K.’s 2016 decision to leave the European Union and Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, leading to EU sanctions, also signaled a shift toward a more hostile environment for big exporters.\n\nGermany’s long industrial boom led to complacency about its domestic weaknesses, from an aging labor force to sclerotic services sectors and mounting bureaucracy. The country was doing better at supporting old industries such as cars, machinery and chemicals than at fostering new ones, such as digital technology. Germany’s only major software company, SAP, was founded in 1975.\n\nYears of skimping on public investment have led to fraying infrastructure, an increasingly mediocre education system and poor high-speed internet and mobile-phone connectivity compared with other advanced economies.\n\nGermany’s once-efficient trains have become a byword for lateness. The public administration’s continued reliance on fax machines became a national joke. Even the national soccer teams are being routinely beaten.\n\n“We’ve kind of slept through a decade or so of challenges,” said Moritz Schularick, president of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\nIn March, one of Germany’s most storied companies, multinational industrial-gas group Linde, delisted from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in favor of maintaining a sole listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The decision was driven in part by the growing burden of financial regulation in Germany. But also, Linde, whose roots go back to 1879, said it no longer wanted to be perceived just as German—an association that it believed was depressing its appeal to investors.\n\nGermany today is in the midst of another cycle of success, stagnation and pressure for reforms, said Josef Joffe, a longtime newspaper publisher and a fellow at Stanford University.\n\n“Germany will bounce back, but it suffers from two longer-term ailments: above all its failure to transform an old-industry system into a knowledge economy, and an irrational energy policy,” Joffe said.\n\n“I think it’s important to remember that Germany is still a global leader,” German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said in an interview. “We’re the world’s fourth-largest economy. We have the economic know-how and I’m proud of our skilled workforce. But at the moment, we are not as competitive as we could be,” he said.\n\nGermany still has many strengths. Its deep reservoir of technical and engineering know-how and its specialty in capital goods still put it in a position to profit from future growth in many emerging economies. Its labor-market reforms have greatly improved the share of the population that has a job. The national debt is lower than that of most of its peers and financial markets view its bonds as among the world’s safest assets.\n\nThe country’s challenges now are less severe than they were in the 1990s, after German reunification, said Holger Schmieding, economist at Berenberg Bank in Hamburg.\n\nBack then, Germany was struggling with the massive costs of integrating the former Communist east. Rising global competition and rigid labor laws were contributing to high unemployment. Spending on social benefits ballooned. Too many people depended on welfare, while too few workers paid for it. German reliance on manufacturing was seen as old-fashioned at a time when other countries were betting on e-commerce and financial services.\n\nAfter a period of national angst, then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder pared back welfare entitlements, deregulated parts of the labor market and pressured the unemployed to take available jobs. The controversial reforms split Schröder’s Social Democrats, and he fell from power.\n\nPrivate-sector changes were as important as government measures. German companies cooperated with employees to make working practices more flexible. Unions agreed to forgo pay raises in return for keeping factories and jobs in Germany.\n\nGermany Inc. grew leaner. Meanwhile, the world was demanding more of what Germans were good at making, including capital goods and luxury cars.\n\nChina’s sweeping investments in industrial capacity powered the sales of machine-tool makers in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. VW invested heavily in China, tapping newly affluent consumers’ appetite for German cars.\n\nSchröder’s successor, longtime Chancellor Angela Merkel, presided over years of growth with little pressure for further unpopular overhauls. Booming exports to developing countries helped Germany bounce back from the 2008 global financial crisis better than many other Western countries.\n\nComplacency crept in. Service sectors, which made up the bulk of gross domestic product and jobs, were less dynamic than export-oriented manufacturers. Wage restraint sapped consumer demand. German companies saved rather than invested much of their profits.\n\nSuccessful exporters became reluctant to change. German suppliers of automotive components were so confident of their strength that many dismissed warnings that electric vehicles would soon challenge the internal combustion engine. After failing to invest in batteries and other technology for new-generation cars, many now find themselves overtaken by Chinese upstarts.\n\nA recent study by PwC found that German auto suppliers, partly through reluctance to change, have suffered a loss of global market share since 2019 as big as their gains in the previous two decades.\n\nMore German businesses are complaining of the growing density of red tape.\n\nBioNTech, a lauded biotech firm that developed the Covid-19 vaccine produced in partnership with Pfizer, recently decided to move some research and clinical-trial activities to the U.K. because of Germany’s restrictive rules on data protection.\n\nGerman privacy laws made it impossible to run key studies for cancer cures, BioNTech’s co-founder Ugur Sahin said recently. German approvals processes for new treatments, which were accelerated during the pandemic, have reverted to their sluggish pace, he said.\n\nGermany ought to be among the nations winning from advances in medical science, said Hans Georg Näder, chairman of Ottobock, a leading maker of high-tech artificial limbs. Instead, operating in Germany is getting evermore difficult thanks to new regulations, he said.\n\nOne recent law required all German manufacturers to vouch for the environment, legal and ethical credentials of every component’s supplier, requiring even smaller companies to perform due diligence on many foreign firms, often based overseas, such as in China.\n\nNäder said his company must now scrutinize thousands of business partners, from software developers to makers of tiny metal screws, to comply with regulation. Ottobock decided to open its latest factory in Bulgaria instead of Germany.\n\nEnergy costs are posing an existential challenge to sectors such as chemicals. Russia’s war on Ukraine has exposed Germany’s costly bet on Russian gas to help fill a gap left by the decision to shut down nuclear power plants.\n\nGerman politicians dismissed warnings that Russian President Vladimir Putin used gas for geopolitical leverage, saying Moscow had always been a reliable supplier. After Putin invaded Ukraine, he throttled gas deliveries to Germany in an attempt to deter European support for Kyiv.\n\nEnergy prices in Europe have declined from last year’s peak as EU countries scrambled to replace Russian gas, but German industry still faces higher costs than competitors in the U.S. and Asia.\n\nGerman executives’ other complaints include a lack of skilled workers, complex immigration rules that make it hard to bring qualified workers from abroad and spotty telecommunications and digital infrastructure.\n\n“Our home market fills us with more and more concern,” Martin Brudermüller, chief executive of chemicals giant BASF, said at his annual shareholders’ meeting in April. “Profitability is no longer anywhere near where it should be,” he said.\n\nOne problem Germany can’t fix quickly is demographics. A shrinking labor force has left an estimated two million jobs unfilled. Some 43% of German businesses are struggling to find workers, with the average time for hiring someone approaching six months.\n\nGermany’s fragmented political landscape makes it harder to enact far-reaching changes like the country did 20 years ago. In common with much of Europe, established center-right and center-left parties have lost their electoral dominance. The number of parties in Germany’s parliament has risen steadily.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz and his Social Democrats lead an unwieldy governing coalition whose members often have diametrically opposed views on the way forward. The Free Democrats want to cut taxes, while the Greens would like to raise them. Left-leaning ministers want to greatly raise public investment spending, financed by borrowing if needed, but finance chief Lindner rejects that. “We need fiscal prudence,” Lindner said.\n\nSenior government members accept the need to cut red tape, as well as for an overhaul of Germany’s energy supply and infrastructure. But party differences often hold up even modest changes. This month the Greens lifted a veto of Lindner’s proposal to reduce business taxes only after they extracted consent for more welfare spending. As part of the deal, the government agreed to pass another law drafted by one of Lindner’s allies, Justice Minister Marco Buschmann, to trim regulation for businesses.\n\nScholz recently rejected gloomy predictions about Germany. Changes are needed but not a fundamental overhaul of the export-led model that has served Germany well throughout the post-World War II era, he said in an interview on national TV recently.\n\nHe cited the inflow of foreign investment into the microchips sector by companies such as Intel, helped by generous government subsidies. Scholz said planned changes to immigration rules, including making it easier to qualify for German citizenship, would help attract more skilled workers.\n\nBut Scholz has struggled to stop the infighting in his coalition. The government’s approval ratings have tanked, and the far-right populist Alternative for Germany party has overtaken Scholz’s Social Democrats in opinion polls.\n\n“The country is being led by a bunch of Keystone Kops, a motley coalition that can’t get its act together,” Joffe said.", "id": "16477ar", "created_utc": 1693279736.0, "score": 431, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 534, "comments": [{"body": "Seems fairly accurate.

Back home (in the country of origin) this money often doesn't help anyone either because many receivers simply become dependent on the money they receive and scale back their own efforts.

Furthermore urbanization probably greatly discourages it as well. Rural communities work together much better than city populations. In the rural towns some towns have everyone helping each other out all the time and being very social, making it extremely easy to have kids when you have so many people who can help you out and mutually help watch the kids, lend tools and machines and exchange knowledge and favors.\nIn the US (never been there, so this is solely based on information I've seen) infrastructure is so heavily car dependant that kids can't move freely which means more burden falls onto the parents to drive them around and it becomes more difficult to raise them when the crucial freedom of movement is missing.

Yahoo's ad business was doing well and unlike other pre-revenue and pre-profit dotcom companies Yahoo was actually turning a decent profit. Plus, even if there was a dotcom bubble, long-term as long the internet keep growing Yahoo was surely going to grow with it.\n\nWhat actually happened was that Yahoo's ad business cratered when the dotcom bubble popped because a large share of their advertisers were dotcom companies. The investors that thought Yahoo was a safe bet were wrong.\n\nNow NVDA isn't Yahoo, but their revenue and earnings are tightly coupled with demand in AI space, which does seem quite frothy right now. I think most people appreciate how revenue is tightly coupled with demand, but for NVDA this is also true of earnings since NVDA's current profit margins are only sustainable if you assume demand remains strong. If AI is in a bubble and that bubble pops, NVDA would be hit hard both on their revenue and profit margins. And given the projections required to justify its current valuation this wouldn't be pretty.\n\nThe other thing I'll touch on here is that the business model of AI is unclear as of right now, but a couple of assumptions are implicitly being made in the pricing of \"AI\" stocks.\n\nFirstly, there is a belief that training and inference of models will continue to require a lot of GPUs (hence the price of NVDA stock).\n\nSecondly, there is an assumption that AI will enable companies like MSFT to grow their bottom line (hence the price of stocks of companies leveraging AI like MSFT).\n\nIf companies don't need to spend billions on training AI models and can instead iterate on previous models or one of several open-sourced base models, then the projected demand for GPUs may be overstated. I'd argue we are seeing this play out with open source projects being competitive with the likes of ChatGPT and beating it in niche domains from relatively inexpensive fine tuning. Additionally, if interference costs drop then again future demand for GPUs may be currently overstated. Something I've said a few times in comments here is that NVDA only really have a moat in training models, inference can be done on other chips. The Ollama project is a good example of how LLM inference can be done on Apple Silicon chips. I have the Llama2 model running locally on my base Macbook Pro and it works great. No NVDA chip needed. I don't even need to pay for access to the LLM.\n\nBut let's just assume everyone will need NVDA chips for AI for a sec, well we now need to think about how the economics would actually work if every company in the AI space needed to buy NVDA chips. If companies are going to be spending billions on NVDA chips over the next few years then they will need to see increases in their revenue and profit margins to justify the spending. Putting an LLM in MS Word sounds cool until you realise it costs money to do. So are people actually going to pay more for these LLM-enabled products? As an software engineer we've had Github Copilot for a couple of years now. It's good and a few people use it, but most don't care for it. It works just like the fancy demos we've seen where you can generate letters in Word, except it does it with code. But like I say, no one really cares all that much because for most things it's not that useful and it doesn't always do things right. I can only assume this will be similar for other LLM enable products.\n\nSo I dunno. I think there's some big questions about how AI is actually going to help companies like GOOG and MSFT improve their bottom line and whether they'll continue to spend billions buying GPUs from NVDA.\n\nEither way, NVDA seems like an awful long-term bet at these prices.

If they raise sub prices on everyone to fund AI features then not everyone is going to be happy – it gives other players a competitive advantage because they could charge less since they don't have the AI features.\n\nWe must keep in mind that the reason software companies trade at super high valuations is because there are only small long-term costs to provide software (hosting, licensing fees, etc). If that is going to change then it's not clear to me why any of these AI products would trade at software valuations.\n\nI think this is the context people miss when they talk about how ChatGPT is a Google killer. It's like saying a Ferrari is going to kill Ford – they might make \"better\" cars, but it's a basically a different business model and in the case of AI, the business model isn't even proven to work.

Because Apple is also a relatively gigantic company. \n\nI thought you were allowed to ask about stocks on this sub. \n\n———\n\nOn Friday August 25th, [Elon Musk posted a video on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695247110030119054?s=46&t=0YLBKtmQe8-F_nJ00NQvxg), that now has 44 million views, of him driving a Tesla on autopilot. In the video he has to brake the car himself when it almost runs a red light (at around 19:45). It also received a decent amount of news coverage. \n\nThis appears to have not affected the stock’s value at all and as of the closing today (August 29th) the stock is up over 7%\n\nI’d expect such an incident to have negative effects on a company’s value, but this didn’t. \n\nAre these sorts of things usually just not big deals? \n\nIf Apple were demonstrating their new iPhone’s amazing app that works perfectly and then it caused the phone to crash, would that negatively affect the value?\n\nOr is it basically all just about the money that the company brings in?\n\n—— \n\nThanks to everybody who answered nicely. I’ve gotten some explanations that make sense including:\n\n- Elon’s livestream video wasn’t of current autopilot software on Teslas, but rather a beta FSD which performed very well. \n- 44 million people probably didn’t actually see that moment where “human intervention” takes place. Plus the media blew it out of proportion. \n- Computer trading algorithms don’t care about these minute things. \n- This isn’t exclusive to Tesla. Similar things like this happening to other gigantic companies happen and they barely matter. \n- The market overall went up on the 29th and Tesla has a high beta. \n\n\nI’m sorry that my post was so offensive towards Tesla and the Saviour.", "id": "164tjkl", "created_utc": 1693341198.0, "score": 1179, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 857, "comments": [{"body": "Remember that product demo by msft where they get a blue screen?", "score": 844, "replies": [{"body": "All software demos on stage are super unstable houses of cards and I can’t imagine the testicular fortitude it takes to demo one on a stage.

So that plus that Tesla is much more volatile makes the stick price changes look a lot more dramatic.\nHowever, I want to address the community about the general trend of claims and refutals I am seeing and I think the community is highly biased and I will leave my perspective I have held for many years now as someone I the research community. It's amusing how Tesla fan trolls claim take the tesla hater troll comments and think people questioning tesla's ability were talking about level 3+ in clear conditions and then combining troll comments with genuine AI community's concerns. The techniques to do what Tesla has done so far have been solved for a long time now. It's used in many places which have a constrained and controlled environments such as labs, restaurants, heck even in flights. That has never been the point of the AI community questioning tesla's ability to become level 3+. But research in this particular problem has moved on from realizing that those classes of models are restrictive and we don't know how to make them get to a level 3+ with the safety rails a car needs. More recently with open ai showed that we can approach human like interactive language model with multi modal inputs. It is still far from being error free and in general I am guessing we are a decade from another breakthrough that will be an AI that can make critical decisions and judgements in a safety related environment. In any case the point the experts in the domain were and have been making is not that Tesla can't do gimmicks, but that Tesla needs to side car it with guardrails and other sensor types to make it safe to the point that the company needs to take accountability for accidents under level whatever. I think they can do it, but I don't think they will because the gimmicks will need to be disabled to create a constrained environment, which doesn't make the car \"cool\". And yes - I called these gimmicks because that's what these have been so far. I would be very happy if Tesla researchers can prove me wrong because as someone in the community, it's a research breakthrough we are hoping for. We researchers  love to be proven wrong because it cuts down on research time and prevents our research time being wasted on the wrong direction.\nSo here's my bet - Tesla will need to pivot into muti modal sensor inputs to become accountable for full level 3+ or reduce the number of gimmicks or side car with a lot of human take overs or keep fsd only viable for the relevant environments.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": " Tesla stock has not been based on reality in a long time", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "The dude next to him states that the model has regressions on traffic light recognition, don’t know how they’re determining regression in specific areas unless they run simulations after the model training, but I digress.
