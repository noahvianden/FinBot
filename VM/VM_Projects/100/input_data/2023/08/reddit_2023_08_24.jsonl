Fair warning my company mostly focused on commodities and futures in the big index funds. \n\nFirst, Ill say it plainly there was never a time where the price of an underlying was purposefully manipulated in an attempt to avoid loses from the price of the underlying at my company. This has happened before and been prosecuted, the most high profile case that I know of being Optiver's \"Hammer\" manipulating the price of oil ([Link here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-optiver-settlement/high-frequency-trader-optiver-pays-14-million-in-oil-manipulation-case-idUSBRE83J01220120420)) and it is very illegal. There are cases though where from an outside perspective it can appear to happen that way. In options markets specifically smaller markets (think Oil, natural gas and agricultural products)  there are often large participants putting through order flow that dominates not just one market maker but all market makers inventory. This type of flow is typically initiated through direct brokers to market maker connections. By doing it this way the customer putting on this large position is able to get more size at a better overall price than if they had traded it electronically (or that's the idea).  This then causes the entire position held by MMs to be relatively similar (because its being dominated by this big trade) . Where we begin to see effects on the price of the underlying is when we approach expiration, close to one of the strikes with a huge position. This reduction in time, and relatively small difference between inventory position and underlying price causes the gamma of the options to increase (and change) very quickly.  With this rising gamma and the assumption that most market makers don't want to hold any position causes them to start to hedge. This hedging is in a direct relationship to the gamma they hold, the strange behavior starts to arise when the entire MM group is short gamma in this area. The situation starts to play out like this:\n\n1. Price of the underlying is $99, MMs as a whole are short a large amount of gamma from shorts on the $100 strike. \n2. The price of the underlying moves to $99.50. MM have picked up MORE (a lot more) short gamma and have accumulated negative deltas. \n3. MMs **individually** decide when their delta risk has become too great and BUY the underlying to hedge this risk. This pushes the price of the underlying up. \n4. The price of the underlying is $100 and it is expiring in 2 hours, MMs have either hedged their delta (one or multiple times) driving the price up causing them to hedge more. IF they haven't hedged they have huge short deltas more than likely dominating the risks in their book. On top of this they are looking at pin risk of expiring near their short. \n5. MMs continue to hedge through 100 and push the price to 101, this causes their short gamma to decrease and forces them to SELL the shares they bought on the way up driving the price back towards 100. \n\nThis type of situation is amplified by a small market where futures trade thinly creating competition for the available shares. Now in the case that you are the luck person or even better other MM who happened to avoid the massive trade earlier and can remain long gamma in that area you get the opposite effect and get to buy on the way up and sell on the way down AKA \"Gamma Scalping\". The bottom line is from the outside it looks like the price is being forced to a certain price but its only that way because of individual action being taken by market makers with a similar position. \n\nHope this helps, feel free to drop questions if you have them.", "score": 89, "replies": [{"body": "Nailed it!", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "boast observation uppity impossible march depend flowery ruthless summer snow\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Is this why some people will notice a large number of options call that out and say that they are going to hold it to this number?

Before computers, Wall Street brokers talked on the phone with clients directly, but it was the same thing.\n\nThis is the real ‚Äúscam,‚Äù if you want to frame it that way. The goal is not to invest. It‚Äôs to collect fees as the middleman. It‚Äôs in the first scene in the Wolf of Wall Street. It‚Äôs not actually a scam though.

If you wanted to use spices in your food, a ship was the cheapest way to get it. \n\nIf you want to avoid fees, buy and hold stocks to keep transaction stocks down.

But it's a bit like borrowing a million dollars on a credit card and then hoping that the credit card company will never send a collections agency after you. Either you're going to end up on the hook and have to pay the money back or the person who lent you the money will end up on the hook. This is called counterparty risk. The bank is lending you $1 million cash and accepting the risk that you won't pay them back. In exchange, they charge a ton of interest and will cut you off very quickly. If they charge 0% interest and never close your position, then that's their mistake. You'll end up bankrupt, but they'll end up holding the bag on the rest. You used $60 billion as an example, and that's an insane amount of money to allow someone to handwave away.\n\nIn order to do this, you need to be able to pay incredibly high interest payments on your loan. That's the problem. The amount of money you make by \"pushing down the price\" is absolutely tiny compared to the amount of money you have to pay in interest. So you will consistently lose money to your lender to keep your position open. It's significantly higher than what you'd lose if you just immediately closed your position.\n\nLastly, price and valuation are different. Say I borrow a brand new $300,000 Ferrari and sell it to you for $100,000 to \"push the price down.\" No one in their right mind is going to think that all of those Ferraris just lost $200,000 of value. People can just look at the car and value it themselves. And if the price is below what they think it's worth, they'll quickly buy it.\n\nThe issue you describe comes up when we're dealing with assets that have no intrinsic value. Say I draw a smiley face on a piece of paper and say it's a $1 million piece of artwork. I can now say I made $1 million because I own a $1 million asset. But if I ever try to sell that to someone else, I'll probably find that no one actually wants to buy it. Warren Buffett uses this intrinsic value concept to separate stocks, bonds, land, and other things that generate their own cashflow from speculative assets that are based on the price other people are willing to pay for them. Gold, crypto, money losing speculative stocks, artwork, etc. are priced based on the idea that someone else in the future will want to pay more money for them. But if no one wants to spend that money in the future, then those assets are priced far too high.\n\nA funny thing happens when I give you my \"$1 million work of art\" and you pay me with your \"$1 million work of art.\" We exchanged assets that were each worth $1 million. It's like swapping an IOU. But then we're both trapped because we both know that our assets are worthless. We can never sell these \"works of art\" to anyone else. It's fine if we actually think these assets are worth $1 million though. We'll never want to sell them to anyone else. We'll list them as \"priceless\" on our financial reports. But no one is going to take those assets seriously. We can't use them for collateral for a loan. And if a lender does think we're millionaires because of our artwork exchange, then they have assessed our creditworthiness and decided that the artworks are valuable and that they would be willing to accept them as collateral.\n\nUltimately, stock prices are just a best estimate of an asset's true value. The more people that have assessed an asset's value, the more confident you can be in the stock price. This is because other traders/investors have a standing order (either officially entered into a stock market or in their head) to buy a given asset if the price falls below the asset's intrinsic value. \"Pushing the price down\" doesn't work because only an idiot would think a new Ferrari has actually lost $200,000 of value. Most people would recognize it as a one off illogical decision. But they'd want to really double check it to make sure it's not stolen, totaled, or otherwise ruined.\n\nIndex funds work becuase you always buy at market price. It's the price where everyone is satisfied. Anyone who thinks a given stock is underpriced compared to it's true value will buy more and if they think it's overpriced, they'll sell/short it. That means every publicly traded, liquid asset is correctly priced at all times.

They are likely going to talk about structural factors that will bring long term inflation up back to normal period (before 2008 financial crisis, and not low inflation like the last decade). It might mean the Fed will eventually move to a 3% inflation target in the future, after they bring it down to 2%. When people buy a 10 year bond, they want it to beat the average inflation over that 10 years. If there're factors that will bring inflation up over that 10 years, then that would bring the 10 year rate up. For more than a decade, the 10 year rate was very low because people assumed inflation would stay low (below 2%), so they didn't need to hedge for higher inflation risk. Now that there're substantial risk inflation might not stay low, they will demand higher yields to compensate for that inflation risk. Going forward, even if inflation stayed at 2%, the 10 year rate is likely to stay above 4%.\n\nWhile Powell's speech is important and market will likely focus on it the most, other Fed officials will also be giving talks to news outlet, today and tomorrow. And many of these Fed officials are voters. In fact, it's arguably better for people to listen more to Fed officials as opposed to Powell. The reason is because the Fed committee is somewhat divided right now. There're some doves, and there're many hawks. When Powell speaks, he represents the whole Fed committee. If there's disagreement among the committee, Powell is unlikely to provide a lot of details on what the Fed is thinking. This is why you see Powell telling people to refer to the SEP projection on what the Fed is thinking. The Fed members, on the other hand, can speak more freely, though they still don't like to tell people what they will do at the next meeting. Fed Harker, one of the most dovish member currently, just told CNBC today that he's fine with how much the 10 year rate moved up recently. He even said it's helpful to the Fed. It's unlikely you'll hear Powell say something like that.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Love your reply thank you", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thank you vm", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Who didn't know that they would do very well?

Jackson Hole jitters (I don't think this plays much of a factor as others here make it out to be though).\n\n5. Macro-economic worries.\n\n6. Stock market randomness.\n\n7.  Market is forward-looking, and may be anticipating \"meh\" or lackluster NVDA earnings reports going forward.\n\nI especially want to emphasize the last one (#7) as a possible reason, as I think the comments here are generally ignoring it, and it could end up being the most relevant of all (time will tell).   The market may be anticipating that this is the last \"blow-out\" earnings report for NVDA and that growth may stall out from here as spending on Nvidia's AI products plateaus off, or declines, or NVDA's margins go down (may or may not happen... but we'll see).\n\nI'll use GOOG's post-earnings reaction on 2/2/2022 as a historical example of this type of of thing.  This [article](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/alphabet-stock-surges-10percent-on-back-of-blowout-earnings.html) from that date describes GOOG's blow-out record earnings report, and analyst price target raises.  Now pull up a daily stock chart for GOOG and look at what happened on that date (2/2/2022) and ever since then.  GOOG opened at an all-time high, sold off that day, and then sold off further.  The market apparently anticipated what came next -- GOOG's earnings reports since then have been lackluster by comparison (revenue/earnings declines).  And GOOG stock has yet to reclaim that 2/2/2022 high. \n\nBack to NVDA, it also worth noting that its earnings are historically inconsistent and prone to CYCLICALITY.\n\nLook at NVDA's [historical EPS growth](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/nvda/financials/) each year:\n\n2015: -4%, 2016: +137%, 2017: +89%, 2018: +37%, 2019: -32%, 2020: +53%,, 2021: +123%...\n\n2022: -55%\n\n2023:  +600-700% (?)

Short/Long/Mid/Savings/Growth/etc. \n\nWhile sure, you can justify the price and say hey, I'm a \"long\" term investor, it'll eventually go up. Well, that will still put you in a pickle. Think about it this way. You can pay extra for growth, but at what point do you say you are unwilling to pay at that price. Just saying you're an investor (not trader), you are stating that sure, the price may seem high but I'll have it for a long time.\n\nHere's where you have the problem. What happened to margin of safety? What kind of return do you expect after 10, or 15, or 20 years if you \"pay\" $500 for the stock at this point? Do you want at a minimal 10% YoY CAGR to just beat the \"Market\" (S&P 500 historical avg. return) or do you want it to do better than that? So, does buying it at $500 right now justify that. Price Targets are not equal to valuation metrics. Do not confuse those. Price targets are heavily manipulated for those whom invest in those companies particular funds. They follow more momentum and sentiment sprinkled with a little \"valuation outlook\". \n\nHave you ran a DCF model? (Discount Cash Flow). Have you look at any other valuation metrics? \n\nThe next problem is long term depreciation of the share price. This is one of the significant reasons for \"Margin of Safety\" within the price you are WILLING to pay that you believe you'll get your target YoY CAGR % return over the long term. Look at $INTC, or $CSCO or $AMZN or a significant amount of companies from 1999. I'm talking about companies that had the same 40/50/60% growth QoQ/YoY metrics that $NVDA currently has. If you think that major drop from 2000, mean that their revenue and their earnings dropped well think again. It took 7-15 yrs until a significant amount of those large capital market stocks to break even on share price. \n\nSo, in the end there should be proper valuations done or at least taken into account. Those who yell that this is an amazing price long term. Do one thing for me. Take the average of the last year on revenue/EPS/cash flow. Now, just do a basic 12.5% return calculation for the next 10 yrs. Look at the market cap and the revenue. Does that make logical sense? If you go by even moderate 30% growth, over 10 yrs you are talking about a company that is bringing in 700+ billion in revenue alone. Could you imagine that market cap? This is why, sure a lot of these are great companies, but you have to separate the company/stock/equity from that share price. \n\nUnless you are trading or you are actually doing some general valuation calculations like a broad DCF model with a margin of safety, most people will actually do a lot better just dollar-cost-averaging into a low cost S&P 500 ETF. Are you going to continue keeping up with their earnings reports and continually revaluing the company to see if your investing thesis is right to continue staying into an equity.
