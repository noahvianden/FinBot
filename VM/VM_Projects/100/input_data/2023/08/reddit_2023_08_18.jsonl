All measures of US inflation have been going steadily down for the last 6 months, except for a small uptick in July entirely caused by gasoline and owned housing. In July, core inflation with the most up to date rented dwelling prices has been negative. [https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1689685117353041941?s=20](https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1689685117353041941?s=20)\n2. The Kalshi prediction market's prediction of MoM inflation for August 2023 is a staggering 0.6%... but only a 0.22% core inflation increase. [https://kalshi.com/forecasts/cpi](https://kalshi.com/forecasts/cpi). Kalshi's inflation predictions for the last several months have been more accurate than just about anything else.\n3. There is no universe in which the Fed's minutes yesterday were going to be dovish, regardless of their true thoughts. Declaring an end to rate hikes would have essentially undone the psychological effect of the last two hikes. It doesn't matter how low inflation gets, you'll never hear a dovish thing from the Fed's collective mouth unless they really believe a recession is on the way.\n4. Is it extremely unlikely that Nvidia's will have failed to meet their targets in next week's earnings reports. I follow the AI scene pretty closely, and literally all I'm hearing is how incredibly, worryingly high the demand is for Nvidia's GPUs. Note that this doesn't mean NVDA will go up after the ER, who knows how the market will react.\n5. The hype around AI is obviously dying down right now, but that doesn't mean it wasn't justified. The economic effect of GPT4-level LLMs might take slightly longer to be felt than the market initially expected, but it is coming. More importantly in the medium term, GPT4-level AI is just the beginning. It is possible we'll see AI with much greater capabilities than GPT4 before the end of 2023, and we most definitely will before the end of 2024. Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic and former VP of Research at OpenAI, expects we'll have AI equal or better than a well-educated human within 2 or 3 years.
