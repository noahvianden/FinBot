{"title": "PayPal is trying to drag its 435 million users into the $120 billion stablecoin market.", "selftext": "PayPal has become the first major US fintech company to offer its own crypto token with a dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD. The company is entering an extremely crowded market already dominated by stablecoins like tether and USDC, at a time when the hype over cryptocurrency has largely fizzled and prices have been mostly stable with no big run-ups since 2022. PayPal's chief crypto executive, Jose Fernandez da Ponte, believes that stablecoins are the killer application for blockchains right now. \"Stablecoins are something that we cannot just sit out,\" da Ponte added. PayPal denied a Bloomberg report that the payments processor paused development of its stablecoin in February. The market is primed for new entrants that are fully backed and unlike tether, fully regulated. PayPal's launch comes after crypto liquidity plummeted in the last year and a half. The collapse of the crypto banking trifecta rippled into the stablecoin market, with Circle's USD Coin briefly losing its peg to the U.S. dollar. The total market cap of stablecoins has plunged since its peak, dropping 25% to $120 billion. PayPal's infrastructure, including being regulated in multiple countries, risk management, and compliance, is a key asset that is a difference in the approach that the company is taking.\r  \n\r  \nPayPal USD is a stablecoin that is backed by dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents and is redeemable for dollars. It is similar to USDC and is backed by a combination of dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and similar cash equivalents. The hypothetical digital dollar, CBDC, is a digital twin of the U.S. dollar, fully regulated, under a central authority, and with the full faith and backing of the country's central bank. There are both benefits and drawbacks to these forms, with some arguing that a CBDC in the U.S. would technically be safer than privately issued stablecoins because it would present a direct claim against a central bank. However, many people who deal in stablecoins want an easier way of doing business, especially internationally. PayPal is an alternative payments network built on top of the commercial bank system, offering interoperable, transparent, and faster settlement and cross-border settlement.\r  \n\r  \nStablecoins originally emerged to cater to demand for dollar exposure offshore and overseas, but nongovernmental digital tokens are increasingly being used in domestic and international transactions, which is scary for central banks. PayPal's chief crypto executive, Nic Carter, believes the payment processor has a place in the dollar-pegged stablecoin sector by enlarging the pie and offering a more accessible market. The company's competitive advantage lies in its extensive network of over 435 million active accounts, a large base of consumers and merchants, and its competitive advantage in fiat connectivity.", "id": "15mc6b5", "created_utc": 1691579201.0, "score": 569, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 387, "comments": [{"body": "How is this different than what they currently have?

It's just not a good business IMO, and I have no faith in their long term prospects for a few reasons.\n\n* Competition in the space is exploding, and will likely only continue to go up overtime.\n\n* I constantly hear people at reddit say that they've been screwed over by Paypal and had money stolen from them siding with scammers over them. I've heard it so much that there's no way I would ever open up a Paypal account if I needed to send money to someone. And if I'm thinking this then I surely can't be the only one. This combined with the first point make me very skeptical that Paypal can continue growing in the future like they have in the past. Negative reputations have consequences, especially when there's competition.\n\nAnd then there's the numbers, which are just dreadful IMO:\n\n* Their Free Cash Flow has barely even budged for the last 5 years. When removing stock based compensation (which effectively steals earnings from investors) their annual FCF went from $3.81 billion in 2018 all the way to $3.85 billion in 2022, all while their revenue has gone from $15.45 billion in 2018 to $27.52 billion in 2022. This shows just how much their margins have already been shrinking overtime.\n\n* Paypal's balance sheet has also gotten a lot worse. they went from having no debt in 2018 to 10.42 billion in debt and only 10.85 billion in cash at the end of 2022. You would hope that if Paypal was taking on all of this debt that investors would have gotten a good return on their investment, but instead the stock is down 28.72% over the last 5 years.\n\n* If you look at the share count Paypal has already started upping their share buybacks a lot more over the last year then they had been for the prior decade. They went from 1.16 billion shares outstanding to 1.11 billion shares outstanding at the end of the last quarter. By contrast they had 1.23 billion shares outstanding in early 2014. But what have Paypal's heavily increased stock buybacks over the last 12 months done for the stock's price? Why it's dropped by 37.3%! So in other words all they did was burn some cash while shareholders continued to lose a fortune on the stock.
