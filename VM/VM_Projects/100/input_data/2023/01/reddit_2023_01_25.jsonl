It operates this plant today with a key cell supplier, co-tenant and co-investor in the factory, Panasonic.\n\nThe sprawling factory is known as GF1, Giga Nevada or the original Tesla Gigafactory. It primarily manufactures and supplies Tesla’s Fremont, California, vehicle assembly plant with high-voltage battery packs.\n\nRepublican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo revealed details about Tesla’s plans for expansion in the state early on Monday. Tesla confirmed the plans on Tuesday ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings update, which is scheduled for Wednesday after markets close.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk held a ceremony in Nevada in December to kick off deliveries of the company’s Tesla Semi to a key early customer, PepsiCo.\n\nTesla first announced its plans to produce the Semi in 2017, and had a targeted start of production in 2019 that was delayed until 2022. The company is not yet manufacturing a high volume of Semi trucks, but is making some at the Nevada Gigafactory.\n\nFans and critics of Tesla have been posting images of Tesla Semi trucks emblazoned with Pepsi Frito Lay branding that they’ve seen on the road since that announcement, including some broken down on the shoulder.\n\nTesla has yet to reveal publicly how much each truck costs, and did not say how many it has produced or sold in its fourth-quarter deliveries report.\n\nThe company is expected to share further details on its Semi program in its Q4 earnings call.", "id": "10kmuai", "created_utc": 1674611399.0, "score": 297, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "Their next step will be to start buying mines for copper and lithium.", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Price of copper has gone up a lot this last month and is forecast to keep increasing.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Elon recently said there's plenty of copper production and that lithium refining is the biggest concern.

Here are the results.\n\nEarnings (adjusted): $1.19 vs $1.13 per share expected, per Refinitiv\n\nRevenue: $24.32 billion vs $24.16 billion expected, per Refinitiv\n\nIn the year-ago quarter, Tesla reported revenue of $17.72 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.52 per share.\n\nEarlier this month, Tesla reported vehicle delivery and production numbers for the fourth quarter of 2022 that set a new record for the company, but fell shy of the company’s goals and analysts’ expectations, despite having cut prices on its cars in December to spur customers to take deliveries before the year’s end.\n\nTesla reported 405,278 vehicle deliveries and production of 439,701 vehicles in the period ending December 31, 2022. Full year deliveries amounted to around 1.31 million, a record for Tesla, after the company started production at its new factories in Austin, Texas, and Brandenburg, Germany.\n\nLast year, Musk said the factories were akin to “money-burning furnaces” in an interview with an owners’ club posted to YouTube in June.\n\nSo far in 2023, Tesla has continued to cut prices on its cars around the world, upsetting customers in the US and China who recently bought new Teslas at higher prices, and triggering an instant decline in used Tesla prices in the US as well.\n\nTesla solicits questions ahead of their earnings calls via a site called Say.com from both retail and institutional investors.\n\nAmong other things, investors on that site say they want to know what the recent price cuts will do to Tesla’s automotive gross margins, how much the company expects to grow sales of its cars in 2023, and when Tesla plans to start mass production and deliveries of its long-delayed, sci-fi inspired, pickup truck the Cybertruck.\n\nThroughout the fourth quarter of 2022, shareholders also sought answers from Tesla and Elon Musk about his intentions at the automaker as the price of Tesla shares declined. Tesla’s share price has dropped more than 40% over the past six months. \n\nMusk is currently splitting his time, attention and resources between Tesla, SpaceX, the defense contractor where he is CEO, and Twitter, the social media business he recently acquired.\n\nThe celebrity CEO sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings last year, including $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter, in part to finance the Twitter deal, which closed in late October 2022. He immediately appointed himself “Chief Twit,” and CEO there.\n\nSince taking over Twitter, he has made sweeping changes to the business and the service, including allowing people who had been permanently suspended from the platform to come back online.\n\nMusk’s moves at Twitter, and his political statements on the social media platform, have correlated with a sharp decline in Musk’s and Tesla’s reputation, especially among liberal- to very liberal-leaning people in the US, according to research by YouGov shared with CNBC.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/25/tesla-tsla-earnings-q4-2022.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard", "id": "10l9spv", "created_utc": 1674680972.0, "score": 494, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 571, "comments": [{"body": "A year ago the EPS was $0.84. there was a stock split.", "score": 48, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow, all short term options are crushed.\n\nEdit: Tesla was flat for a while when this was posted, currently up 5%.", "score": 334, "replies": [{"body": "Isn’t that to be expected?

It's all about marketing. That's the only thing Elon is good at... well mostly. \n\n\nNumbers that matter are at the very end of the report after 8 pages of photos for you crayon eating monkeys. \n\n\nTESLA IS AN AUTO MANUFACTURER! Even in their comparison charts that's what they compare themselves to. But what they don't compare is apples to apples. Automotive gross margin of Tesla is on a decline after a year where they had the highest prices before they had to cut prices at the end of 22 and beginning of this year. \n\n\nWith lower prices, their margin is going to drop even more. Now add a slowdown in economy to the mix where they will have lower demand, Tesla has probably just posted their best earnings for the next 4-6 quarters. \n\n\nThis is probably peak Tesla in this cycle. Now let's look at their cashflows. Tesla claims to have enough cash to get through the hard times. This quarter alone, they have used up 15% of their cash from end of Q3. \n\n\nTesla also has an increase in inventory which is not huge but not a great sign. If everything is going so great, we need to see the opposite. \n\n\nTL:DR This is a warning post for those of you who think Tesla has dropped \"enough.\" When you compare it with other auto manufacturers you see the disconnect. Sooner or later TSLA will be valued just like other auto manufacturers.
