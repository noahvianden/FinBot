However, since 2010, you are far behind the ball. GM, Ford, and Chrysler have all been investing massively into EVs since 2010. By 2011, they were all on a massive hiring plan and that included sponsoring battery technician degrees so that people could go to school for free and get paid by them while doing so. They have been taking the long term route. However, turning the wheels of progress for massive companies takes time. They don't want to rush it. GM and Ford have been doing autonomous testing since 2014 (?) in anticipation. They have been designing these vehicles for over a decade now. Most of that is the internal electrics and the best way to swap the plants for full production. They were starting major swaps for 2019 with a 2020 release date. They pushed it back when it was found that to meet the demand schedule, they would need a few more factories. This pushed it back to 2023 due to the pandemic and people buying so many cars. Ford built their first new factory in 40 years completed this year specifically for EVs. 2023 is the year for the majority of EV releases if not by 2024. Tesla isn't the only game in town and is no where close to the cheapest or best quality. \n\n>Cyber truck, a new car that puts it within the tax credit range, those could easily keep the growth rate up there\n\nThe Ford lightning already delivered 13k in October of 2022. 2023 production rates are expected at 150k. Chevy already has 150k reservations for the Silverado EV slated for spring of 2023. Production looks like it will keep up. It starts at 40k well within the tax credit and price range of many weekend warriors.\n\n>not to mention other sources of income if they get the Tesla Bots going\n\nNo offense, if Sony can't get the Aibo going, Tesla is screwed on this. The designer of the Aibo literally developed the code checking method for data transfer called CRC specifically for the Aibo system. They crammed a full vision system on 10 mb. Tesla is decades away at best.\n\n\n>If there's more growth in their Tesla Solar and/or battery packs\n\nNot likely. The Chinese are beating them on technology. They failed to bid on solar efficiency upgrades that were offered from a Washington based research team. This research gave Chinese companies a major win over US manufacturers. They don't do enough R&D work let alone research to make the major breakthroughs needed. This isn't \"program it better\", it is fundamentally making the major changes necessary. Think Theranos not Paypal.\n\n>higher margins if prices of parts fall faster than the prices of the cars do.\n\nThey have constant production issues that are systemic. This isn't going to go well for them. \n\n>1 year perspective, terrible buy, use stop loss, swing trade, manage risk. 15-30 year outlook, buy the way\n\nThe last 3 years were the buy period.

In my opinion they are so heavily traded and such large cap/volume you would need a fortune to do anything with a major swing. \n\nCarrier, AAON and Daikin are some of the larger equipment manufacturers. I'm hesitant on them because every unit I work on is absolutely shit. The metal is so thin it dents with hail now. the motors are so close to the borderline rating if you get heavy winds they overheat. Daikin owns Goodman Manufacturing and they seem to be the only people attempting to keep costs/quality at a consistent level. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD I AM NOT RECOMMENDING THEM FOR YOUR HOME. Mitsubishi Electric (MIELY) manufacturers some of the most efficient energy inverter tech on the market. Build quality is superb and stands up to the beach environment at my house on the river in Florida. They have expanded their line to include all different aspects of unit instead of the traditional wall hung bar style. Of the 20-30 systems installed, not a single customer has seen less than 1/2 of the power consumption. Most are seeing houses set as cold/hot as you want and no swings in power consumption. Father-in-law got a new unit last Christmas, power bill over summer went down from 310 down to $165. They are solar friendly, most ac systems use a \"hard start\" type feature which draws up to 150amps all in .1 sec, Mitsubishi units do not do that, so batteries and solar grids can support them. \n\nProb a shit call but I like Mitsubishi. Good quality, cost is same as other equipment and the installation is way easier. No more ducting. Let this housing market bubble dwindle some more and they should be ripe. Sub $15 and I got 5k waiting.\n\n\nThere are a handful of service companies (sym:FIX) who (in my area) are charging 500% on top of the new 300% inflated price. They are going to be printing money in the service side of their business and equipment change outs SHOULD jump heavily for each year. This will run up until 2025 or 2026 and then see a slowing of installations as most people will have converted to the new r290 or r1234xy or whatever they decide to push. These guys being larger will have to weather the storm of the houses bubble pop, my first employer had a really rough go in 07-09 laid off 50 right after Xmas.(we had 120, 10 service, 15 office and the rest were install crews working subdivisions) By the end it was 10/5/10 and the owners were not drawing paychecks. \nIf they make it through there will be far less competition driving install prices north and if you can't afford new, repairs are way better margins.\n\nMain reason for service company stock: with lack of parts to actually build units if these shortages get worse, repairs may be the only viable option for most. Low income people may not be able to afford new or repairs but the repairs will be more within reach. My buddy works for centerpoint in MN they do very well with all home shit and they treat their people fairly well from what I gather. Again sub 15 and I'm def looking. Just need that \"oh shit\" news article. \n\nAnother option is to go into business with your local dudes and help them buy a pallet of refrigerant. When a typical home unit uses 8-11 lbs and a jug is 25lbs for $399. Average recharge costs on the low side are 500+ if you are a nice human and on the high side currently are over $2000. You get 2-3 refills per jug. So if you were helping a local you SHOULD see your money back in a hurry. Currently on Carrier and Lennox equipment refrigerant leaks are so common I'd say it's close to a coin toss whether it's a decent coil or not.\n\nLots of info, so sorry.

You'd need some major Black Swan events to get there before October-December of next year, but its possible. What most people are missing is that the things causing inflation are 3 fold for the most part. 1) War in Ukraine driving up energy prices. This raises the cost of everything. 2) Supply chain disruptions from Covid/US distancing itself from China for Geopolitical reasons. 3) Worker shortages causing labor markets to demand higher wages as there aren't enough workers to fill these jobs. Point 1 is going to work itself out one way or another. So that one will eventually end. Point 2 will be fixed eventually but that's going to require mass movement of supply chains to other low wage countries, and depending on how long that takes and the level of Chinese aggression (if they look poised to pull a Russia, no one is going to want to put a new plant in Vietnam when it looks like China is becoming expansionary) we'll see what countries these companies start moving to.
