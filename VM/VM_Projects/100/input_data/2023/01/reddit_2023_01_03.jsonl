{"title": "Meta repurchased shares at the exact wrong time in FY 2021. Now is the time for aggressive stock buybacks.", "selftext": "Full article at SA.\n\n>Meta could fairly easily afford to repurchase $10B of its shares each quarter, especially if the company were to recalibrate its investments in the Reality Labs business. Based off of Meta Platforms' Q3'22 cash flow statement, the company spent $6.35B on Class A stock buybacks in the third-quarter and $21.09B in the first nine months of FY 2022. In FY 2021, however, Meta Platforms repurchased $44.54B of its shares and the company did so at a significantly higher valuation. The tech company paid an average of $330 per-share in FY 2021 and therefore paid a massively inflated price to buy back a ton of its own stock just when the stock price peaked.\n\n>Plotting Meta Platforms' stock buybacks against the P/E ratio shows that Meta Platforms repurchased a ton of its shares at the exact wrong time: when the pandemic and advertisers temporarily inflated the firm's revenue growth, Meta Platforms' market cap was at an all-time high… and when the stock was historically expensive.\n\n>\tMeta Platforms is trading at $120 right now and the share price hasn't been this low since the start of 2017 (with the exception of the October/November 2022 draw-down) and, at a P/E ratio of 15.2 X, I believe Meta Platforms is at an attractive valuation level to warrant a material up-size in its stock buyback. At the end of the September-quarter, the tech company had $17.78B in its stock authorization remaining, and Meta Platforms could very well exhaust this program in FY 2023. Right now is possibly the best time since 2017 for Meta Platforms to reevaluate its capital allocation strategy and buy back more of its stock while reducing its investments in the Reality Labs business.\n\nWhat do you think? Should Meta redirect Reality Labs spending towards aggressive buybacks?", "id": "1027i7o", "created_utc": 1672750541.0, "score": 430, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 154, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 401, "replies": [{"body": "Let me teach you how to trade with my million dollar strategy.

You may want to consider reducing your exposure to stocks and increasing your allocation to more stable investments, such as bonds.\n\n\\- If you are over 60: You may be in retirement or approaching it, so preserving your wealth and generating income will likely be your top priorities. It may be a good idea to allocate a larger portion of your portfolio to less risky investments, such as bonds and cash.\n\nKeep in mind that these are just general guidelines, and every investor's situation is unique.

For example, the equation could look something like this:\n\nNPV = CF1 / (1+r)\\^1 + CF2 / (1+r)\\^2 + CF3 / (1+r)\\^3 + ... + CFn / (1+r)\\^n + E\n\nWhere:\n\n* NPV = Net present value\n* CF = Cash flow\n* r = Discount rate\n* n = Number of periods\n* E = Emotional attachment to the investment\n\nIn this equation, the term E would represent the strength of the individual's emotional attachment to the investment, with higher values of E indicating a stronger emotional attachment and lower values indicating a weaker emotional attachment.\n\nAgain, it is important to note that this equation is purely hypothetical and has no basis in actual financial principles.

We watched the whole union-baiting play out.  But even with that gone, this theoretically gives Ford, GM, and Stellantis a bit more wiggle room, even if Tesla is going to be the big winner.\n\nThings got a little weird at the end of last year, though, when it became clear that pretty much anybody can get this money as long as they jump through a hoop or two.\n\nThe political ramifications are going to be interesting to watch as the primary battles in the U.S. start to shape up at the end of this year.  This program is going to cost somewhere between $5 and $10 billion for just the first year, and if inflation does not come back down, people might start asking extremely uncomfortable questions about why so much of that is going to foreign carmakers.\n\nFinal thought: it's unlikely that the IRA is going to help the legacy carmakers all that much.  Tesla is the only one with the production to really take advantage of the money-machine.  GM might see a bit of a boost as well, but they have shown an incredible ability to squander every opportunity they manage to scratch out of the dirt.  \n\nEveryone else still had the old subsidy active.  So all this really does is take the most efficient EV maker and suddenly throw $7500 per car at them.  This means that Tesla has an extra $7500 margin to play around with while the rest of the industry is going to have to sacrifice a good chunk of the subsidy \\*they were already getting\\* just to keep their market share steady.  They were already losing money, so it's unclear just how far they can take this.\n\nPlus, I do not know what the dealerships are going to do.  Even if Ford, for example, were to drop prices, the dealerships might just choose to take the difference for themselves.  We'll have to see what happens there.\n\nSo this was a lot to write to just say \"I agree with you.\"  We'll have to see if people figure out that this was just a bailout.

The nice thing about the dealership model is it allows ultimate price discovery and price discrimination. If EV demand tanks during a recession you will see dealerships moving EVs for as low as they can. If dealerships are still jacking up prices that is a good sign, as it means EV demand is healthy and still has room to run.\n\nAgree the politics of this is going to be interesting between now and Nov 2024. We are very focused on the vehicle aspects of the IRA, but Biden's massive spending program has opened up huge fields for debate.

Since you're sitting in 100% cash, I feel like the move for you is to take a look at portfolio composition, read up on factor investing, and if you believe the evidence, just dump the whole port into funds like SCHD, AVLV, AVUV, AVGE, etc based on personal preferences.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry for slow response.

I'm not normally a technical follower at all, but after living through 1987, 2000, 2008, and the like, I've been on the lookout for a shorthand indicator I can follow to not get swept up in major downturns, which becomes increasingly important as one gets older.  I saw some near retirees absolutely crushed in 2008 and it ruined them.  That's what I'm protecting against.\n\nMeb Faber's [\"A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation\"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=962461) model resonates.  It's not perfect (e.g., I don't think it's as effective for sharp \"V's\") but it is a nice technical shorthand for basically a fundamental point...the market is drawing down or filling in (not necessarily QE by Fed, so much as market participants, or both).  In my own words, is the bathtub filling up or draining.  Jump in when it's filling, not draining.\n\nYou simply check in once per month.  No need to jump in on the actual day of Golden Cross.  Make sure it holds.  Not kisses the line.  Important to note that maybe I'll miss the first 10-15% upturn, but that's not as important as avoiding the major downturns, also mentioned in \"Win By Not Losing\".\n\nI will read up on factor investing though.  Thank you.  Lifetime learner on this stuff for sure!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "How did the near retirees get crushed in 2008? Unless they sold at the bottom (and I know a lot of people did), the market recovered pretty quickly. And if they were only /near/ retirement and not /in/ retirement, they could keep accumulating through the dip, retire in 2012(?) and they had a pretty excellent sequence of returns in early retirement (2012-2021).\n\nYou say you'll miss only the first 10-15% of upturn, but we're already like 12% off the lows, and if we keep climbing and you only check in once a month, you may have missed 20% by then. And this all assumes that you chose a good time to sell (450+). Many would have sold too early (e.g. late 2020, because \"this is a sucker's rally\") or too late (e.g. June 2022, because \"Grantham says there's a super bubble!\"). So maybe you sold at a good time, but personally I would recognize that for what it is --- luck --- and not try to time the market any more.\n\nAs far as quantitative tactical asset allocation --- portfoliovisualizer has tools to test market timing. And there are ETFs which do the market timing for you. I can't remember or find the tickers right now, but they adjust equity exposure based on technicals. My takeaway from tooling around with this is:\n\na) if it were easy to do reliably, everyone would just buy the ETF that saved them from crashes. Obviously, that hasn't happened, so it can't be reliable\n\nb) certain market timing methods always look good in certain backtests, for example maybe one method worked in 2000 or 08, it saved a ton of money and you were way ahead for the next 10 years. But then covid came, with such a sudden crash and recovery that you basically sold at the bottom and bought after 50% of the recovery. Not to mention the cost of jumping into and out of investments (taxes). Backtesting methods like death/golden cross will always be an exercise in overfitting.\n\nAnyway, good luck with whatever you choose to do.\n\nAnd if you want the lazy man's factor portfolio, you can just go 100% AVGE. Avantis implements the factors better than anyone else. That's what I have gone with in my retirement accounts.
