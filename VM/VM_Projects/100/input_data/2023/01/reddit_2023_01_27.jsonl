Falling oil prices have played a big role, but inflation more broadly is easing.\n\nThe annual increase in prices slowed to 5% in December from 5.5% in the prior month and a 40-year high of 7% last summer, according to fresh government data.\n\nThat’s the smallest increase in 15 months, though still well above pre-pandemic levels of less than 2% annual inflation.\n\nKey details: The more closely followed core index rose a modest 0.3% last month, matching Wall Street’s forecast.\n\nThe increase in the core rate of inflation in the past 12 months decelerated to 4.4% from 4.7%. That’s also the lowest level in 14 months.\n\nThe PCE index is viewed by the Fed as the best predictor of future inflation trends, especially the core gauge that strips out volatile food and energy costs.\n\nUnlike it’s better-known cousin, the consumer price index, the PCE gauge takes into account how consumers change their buying habits due to rising prices.\n\nThey might substitute cheaper goods such as chicken thighs for more expensive ones like boneless breasts to keep costs down. Or buy generic medicines instead of brand names.\n\nThe CPI showed inflation rising at a 6.5% yearly rate in December, but it’s also slowed sharply since the summer.\n\nBig picture: The Fed is trying to restore inflation to pre-pandemic levels of 2% or so, and it will keep raising rates until it is convinced the genie is back in the bottle. Higher rates reduce inflation by slowing the economy.\n\nYet with inflation subsiding, Wall Street is raising questions about whether the Fed’s work is almost done. If rates go too high, the economy could sink into recession.\n\nIndeed, many economists think a downturn is likely this year. The central bank has jacked up a key U.S. interest rate to a 15-year high of 4.5% from near zero less than a year ago — and the effects of higher borrowing costs are just starting to bite.", "id": "10ml4jx", "created_utc": 1674826995.0, "score": 1373, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 444, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think that's generally what the Fed is going for by raising interest rates: lets take a little cash outta circulation, if we raise interest rates it makes it a little harder to operate, companies need to cut costs so they lay people off. If you get laid off, you tighten your budget and significantly reduce your transaction volume, which means you're decreasing the revenue you're generating for others. Layoffs cut demand in the economy, which should have downward pressure on inflation. Ideally they could achieve this just by hitting interest rates, but I think hitting the job market a bit will help them achieve their goal of mitigating inflation. I think if interest rates plateau for an extended period, we'll see it slow down the economy for a while and if things get bad in the job market, they'll drop them, but if they hold interest rates at 5.5% for a year, after a year of hikes, I'd be incredibly surprised if the job market doesn't cool off, with an increase in layoffs in non-tech industries.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "The recession is still coming.

Check out the chart since about 2008. It’s not a sexy stock but it’s a true money maker especially if you want a long term position.  Its stock chart looks like a high flying tech stock, not like an insurance stock. Here’s why this is so good and any health insurance stock for that matter. When Obama came into office he created Obamacare.  Obama care basically allowed the health insurance companies to write alot of the current government regulations.  One thing they actually created as a result of all this new legislation is technically “price fixing”. While they will never admit to this, this is the reality. Price fixing is illegal in every industry and companies get fined for it all the time. In this case, basically the government is signing off on this so called price fixing although they will never call it that.\nHow do I know this you might ask. Well I spent over 20 years in the investment industry and was self employed for most of that time and a lot of my clients were some of the biggest brands in the investment industry.  But that’s not really why I know this. I know this because I was and still am a business owner and I have had to buy a lot of health insurance over the years.  Prior to Obamacare the health insurance market was competitive, you could shop around to get the best deal. When my existing health insurer would jack up our rate on the renewal, we would just switch carriers and it would bring the rate back down. Obamacare eliminated that competition among insurers. So now when my health insurer jacks my rate every year and I go look for another insurance carrier, they are oddly at the same jacked up rate my current insurer is at. So no longer a cost saving benefit to switching carriers and we’re forced into annual increases no matter what.\nThe health insurance companies have been claiming they struggle financially but if you look at the chart. There’s no way that’s the case. Their charts are more like high flying tech companies but with a couple of main differences… low to cheap P/E ratios and a government backed price fixing theme with recurring locked in revenues that grow on top of themselves year after year. \nJust food for thought and sorry for the long dissertation… lol", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "United Microelectronics (UMC) will see some short-term pain, but already trade at a discount and are well-positioned and growing in automotive and communications.\n\nWith the capacity to ship 10 million wafers a year, a relatively bulletproof balance sheet, a likely to be fat dividend (if they return the same % of earnings as they did last year it'll be ~10% yield), and additional capacity coming online in Taiwan as well as Singapore over the next couple of years I really like their odds of returning to strong growth in the medium term. \n\nThat being said I do intend to wait for another dip before adding again since I have a decent chunk already and 1H23 looks pretty shaky.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "COHR - firm operates in two segments Photonic Solutions Segment and Compound Semiconductors Segment.

A lot of people seem to be putting blind faith in that by 2025 Intel will have their fabs built and making money cause thats in their roadmap.

Delta = how much the option value changes per change in dollar of the stock.   So at the 0.10 delta, if the stock goes up by $1 the option value goes up by $0.10 (remember to multiply by 100, since the notional value refers to a contract of 100 shares).   So + $1 stock price = +$0.10 option value = +$10.00 USD real money dollars.\n\nDelta can also be viewed in the very near term as acting similar to shares.   A contract with a 0.30 delta will experience the same value change as 30 shares will for a given price movement.   If stock price goes up +$30, a call at 0.30 delta will go up $900.   (Just like how owning 30 shares outright would increase your account balance by +$900 with that price action.)\n\nGamma is how much the delta changes per $1 movement of the stock price.   So a 0.30 delta option with a .05 gamma means that if the share price rises by $1, the new delta of the contract will be 0.35.   A $5 increase in the stock means the option's delta would go from 0.30 to 0.55.   (so not only would the notional value of the option increase due to the delta movement, but it is even further impacted by the gamma increase.)\n\n\n\n\nGamma is higher the closer the option is to being ATM.    A very very deep ITM option may have a delta close to 0.95 or 0.98 and a gamma of 0.01 or 0.003.   A very very deep OTM option may have a delta of 0.03 and a gamma of .01. \n\n\nThen we have IV.  I don't know the math on black-scholes enough to give you vega breakdowns, but essentially higher IV = higher contract value.  Lower IV = lower contract value.    Part of the value of an option is the guarantee of the strike price.   The more volatile the stock is, the more value that guaranteed strike price for exercise is.   On a very volatile stock (say IV = 80%) someone who bought a put as a hedge to protect their shares will value that put more than if it were a predictable and calm stock (say, IV = 20%).   Vega is basically the options pricing formula greek for volatility.  If you understand what IV means, you won't get murdered by not knowing rje nitpick of vega.\n\nTheta = time value.  It always goes down.   Time value decays more quickly the closer an option is to being ATM.   Time value also decays more quickly the closer the contract gets to expiration - it starts ramping up hard about 45 days before expiry, and super hard at 21 days to expiry.     A contract for Jan 2024 might only have -0.03 theta right now (it loses $3 real dollars per day in value, or $0.03 notional value as seen in the option price).    But come December 2023, the theta could easily ramp up to be -0.20 (and lose $0.20 of notional value *each day*).\n\nRho, mostly, don't worry about, it has to do with the options value pricing vs. what interest rates are and how much value your money would get vested in bonds instead.  it's weird and *most* of the time has minimal impact on options pricing, except when, say, the Fed is jacking the base rate by 0.75% every month.\n\n\nSo if you buy a call on XYZ worth $3.00 at the $200 strike price, it expires in 30 days, and the stock price is currently $195, and the delta is 0.45, the gamma is 0.02, and the theta is -0.14, you know several things:\n\n1 - if the price stays flat and IV does not change, 5 days from now the call will only be worth $2.30 (5 days of theta decay at -0.14 each)\n\n2 - if the price rises by $6, the new delta will be APPROXIMATELY 0.57 (0.02 gamma x 6)\n\n3 - if the price rises by $6 in the next 5 days and IV does not change, at close at the end of day 5 the call will be worth $5.30 (-0.70 from theta decay.   And our delta increase as affected by gamma for each $1 movement up raised the notional value by 0.45+0.47+0.49+0.51+0.53+0.55 = 3.00.  0.57 is the *new* delta, but wasn't the call's delta when the stock went from $200 to $201.    So between delta, gamma, and theta we have a +3.00 rise in value from delta movement and a -0.70 decline from diminished time value, e.g. theta decay.   Add those to the initial $3.00 call value and the new value is $5.30)\n\n4 - if the price stays flat AND IV falls, the option's notional value will fall MORE than $-0.14 per day, because IV is part of extrinsic value and as implied volatility falls so does the value of a contract.   So if IV is flat over 5 days, the call would lose $0.70 in value from theta decay.   But if IV falls drastically in those 5 days, the option value might decrease by $1.00 (or even by $1.50 depending on how much the IV fell).", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "IV ramped up", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thinking about waiting until Monday to do the same.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I had it queued up in Schwab but closed the app without executing the trade.

So say for a 50-50 coin flip you were to bet 20% of your wealth, your expected return on average is going to be (0.8*1.2)^1/2 ≈ 0.98. So in the long run on average you'll lose 2% of your wealth each time your flip that 50-50 coin.\n\nInterestingly, even if the odds of the flip are in your favor, if you bet too much you'll still end up losing wealth. For instance if the coin flip was now tilted 55-45 in your favor, your expected return would be (0.8)^0.45 * (1.2)^0.55 ≈ 0.9999, so you're still losing money.\n\n In fact, you get the most return on your dollar the lower the percentage of your wealth you bet on any given investment, which is why both wealthy people have a stronger bias towards accumulating wealth (because a $1000 investment is a much lower percentage of their wealth than it would be for an average person) and why index funds which have their investments spread thin over  many different stocks tend to do so well in the long run.

No disrespect, but seriously be careful especially with this subreddit. They're self admitted regards. \n\n\n\"Whats a call\"\nCall options are financial contracts that give the option buyer the right but not the obligation to buy a stock, bond, commodity, or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a specific time period.\nExample: person A sells 1 call option contract for 100 shares of Apple at $150 to person B. This contract has an expiration date. Person B pays person A a premium for this contract. Now person B has the right BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION to buy 100 shares of apple from person A at the price of $150 any time before the expiration date.\n\n\"He got so much instantly, is that really possible\"\nPossible yes, likely no. OP turned 12k into 120k with 5 or so trades. One beautiful thing about option trading is that it allows you to be flexible in trading and create tons of different synthetic positions. With this freedom some people, like op, create all or nothing huge risk positions that can get you rich or broke overnight. If you watch op's video, you can see that their trade would end up with either +50k or -120k. Most investors would never consider anything close to this level of risk unless it was damn near guaranteed. Most investors prefer small slow gains or a consistent system to make use of compounding interest. \n\n\"Isn't the only loss potential if he kept it?\"\nOP is person A from the previous example. He collected the 50k premium from person B and therfore was obligated to Apple at $150 no matter what the current price is. If it stays under $150 until expiration then OP is off the hook. If it goes above $150 then he will need to buy 100 shares and sell it to person B for $150. So by this logic you can see that the loss potential is infinite and op can't simply \"hold\" the position.  If the price shot up to $300 OP would be obligated as the seller to take a $15000 ((300-150)×100) loss. We don't know the details of OP's actual positions, but it looks similar to a more dramatic version of this example.\n\nHope that clears things up.

People will stop buying brand new phones in a recession. Energy business is unaffected by recession. \n\n> Again, Toyota trades at less than 1x a massive top line number of 270B\n\nThe fact that you can even remotely compare Tesla to Toyota is laughable. Their P/Es should not be anywhere near each other. The company not making EVs and has the most debt in the world, to Tesla... Tesla's financial position is enough to know that it deserves a far higher P/E. Toyota makes 1/8th the amount of money Tesla does - and Tesla is not even done ramping their existing factories, whereas Toyota has already. \n\n> Tesla's business has a much closer cost structure to Toyota than to Apple so that's the comparison to make\n\nCertainly Tesla has to spend more on factories, whereas apple just outsources all construction. But that is also part of their business model of being vertically integrated and being able to make lots of changes and improve their process faster than any competitors. \n\nBut more importantly, the single most import reason to have a high P/E - expected growth in profit. Apple has no expectation to grow profit substantially. Can they? Sure. Will they? Who knows. Likely they will be making *less* money in recession years, not more. So even as a 'tech' company, Apple P/E should not be particularly high. It would make sense if Tesla has a higher P/E than Apple. \n\n> Toyota 18% gross margin and Tesla after price cuts will be 20% or less (was 24% before January global price cuts). This isn't rocket science.\n\nToyota is going to go bankrupt. They have so much damn debt, and no EVs. ICE car sales across the industry are going to plummet as EV adoption increases. Every EV sold is one less ICE car sold. Toyota will possibly suffer from this more than any other manufacturer, as they have no real plans for EVs (hence why previous CEO gone). \n\nAnd more importantly, Toyota's operating margin is 7% and falling. Their income has gone down every quarter for 4 quarters, and no reason to think this will reverse any time soon. Higher interest hurts Toyota more than Tesla. Their debt is going to be a very serious problem, especially if defaults on consumer car loans increases.\n\nAnd lastly, Tesla is not going to sell model 3/Y forever.
