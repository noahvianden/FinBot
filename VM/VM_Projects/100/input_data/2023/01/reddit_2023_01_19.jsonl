I do think specific actors should be held accountable, but most were doing their best. \n\nYou have to understand that I'm working within the system.  For me, at the patient care level, some of the things I have seen as a result of these policies has devastated lives and families.  I do think certain people should go to jail that denied people their human rights, but when we cross into that area I get a little too passionate and biased so it's just not a good area to go into.  \n\nThe only point I want to make by saying that is that the further you are detached from patient care, and the more you view the population as a statistic rather than as individuals, the more dehumanizing your decisions become.  It's something we should be more aware of going forward.  There is a reason healthcare is structured in an individualized fashion.  Of course there are severe, worst case scenarios with public outbreaks that warrant special circumstances, but we should never be so quick to leap to those, and if we do, then we should pivot as soon as the harm we are doing outweighs the good.  We were a solid year + late on that IMO, and officials of all sorts continued to double down and suppress dissenting discourse even from within the medical science community.  When you consider that they had financial, political, and career motivations for doing so is where you see that certain actors should be held accountable. (and by that I mean fair, unbiased trials where all of the evidence - such as funding, stock investments, internal comms, etc is daylighted)   The most egregious and damning thing to me is the fact that natural acquired immunity, something science has known about for a long, long time has been purposefully ignored and now we have tons of data to support it being stronger than vaccine acquired.  Why did the data take so long?  Why were people who were not at risk subject to arbitrary rulesets that ignored their own stronger, better immunity?  Why were people denied visitation at bedside of their dying family members when they posed 0 risk and we could easily test for immunity?
