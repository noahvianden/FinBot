His experience with the program, described in a recent Washington Post article, caused quite a stir. In the article, Lemoine recounts many dialogues he had with LaMDA in which the two talked about various topics, ranging from technical to philosophical issues. These led him to ask if the software program is sentient.\n\nIn April, Lemoine explained his perspective in an internal company document, intended only for Google executives. But after his claims were dismissed, Lemoine went public with his work on this artificial intelligence algorithm—and Google placed him on administrative leave. “If I didn’t know exactly what it was, which is this computer program we built recently, I’d think it was a 7-year-old, 8-year-old kid that happens to know physics,” he told the Washington Post. Lemoine said he considers LaMDA to be his “colleague” and a “person,” even if not a human. And he insists that it has a right be recognized—so much so that he has been the go-between in connecting the algorithm with a lawyer.\n\nMany technical experts in the AI field have criticized Lemoine’s statements, and questioned the scientific validity of his claims.\n\n**Google fires engineer who contended its AI technology was sentient**\n\nGoogle (GOOG) has fired the engineer who claimed an unreleased AI system had become sentient, the company confirmed, saying he violated employment and data security policies.\n\nGoogle confirmed it had first put the engineer on leave in June. The company said it dismissed Lemoine’s “wholly unfounded” claims only after reviewing them extensively. He had reportedly been at Alphabet for seven years. In a statement, Google said it takes the development of AI “very seriously” and that it’s committed to “responsible innovation.”", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Idk.

Could they still be overvalued? Sure. Is Elon an issue? Yes. But the takes I see here are mostly brain dead and I haven't seen much analysis to justify a much lower stock price.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This post is for the sake of discussion, I am not trying to convince anyone of anything or change any minds. TL:DR at bottom.\n\nEssentially there are two camps when it comes to Tesla. One group views Tesla as a \"Disruptive Tech\" company arguing they deserve the high valuations it has seen due to the tech it is developing. The other camp views Tesla as an automotive company, and a niche one at that, thus they deserve a valuation like a niche luxury car company, like Bentley.\n\nI fall in to the second camp and I am happy to explain why, but this is gonna be long. A little background to start, I was an automotive technician for over 10 years for Range Rover, I am well versed in cutting edge and emerging automotive technology, how long it takes to bring to market, then how much longer it takes to make a tech viable enough for broad adoption. Now I am a Mechatronics Engineer where I troubleshoot and maintain the robots that make computer chips for a global chip manufacturer, so I am pretty well versed in tech as well.\n\nA tech company spends years as a \"Startup\" developing their idea in to a viable product and has that product on the market before their IPO. Imagine Facebook holding their IPO while still developing the platform, let alone before broad adoption, would not have worked. Tesla's only real viable products are the cars and their battery division, which only services their cars. Lots of technology in development fails long before an IPO as they discover their \"Great Idea\" is significantly harder to implement than they expected, is not as helpful as they anticipated, does not get widespread adoption, or a competitor beats them to market. A main reason I feel it is folly to value Tesla based on the \"great Ideas\" the Must Rat announces. Just look at Solar Roof, Cyber Truck, Power Wall, FSD, RoboTaxi, and soon, the Robot. All of those good ideas are in some stage of proving inviable enough to prevent them from coming to market, or delay launch.\n\nLets focus on FSD, though I could do this on all their vaporware. In 2016 they released a video they claimed showed AutoPilot in operation in the real world, A lead engineer on that project testified in court this week they faked that video and Tesla settled a lawsuit back then so they didn't have to go to court over it. At that time Musk was also claiming \"AutoPilot is probably better than a human driver\". 3 years later FSD is still not a viable product, but Must starts charging customers for it in 2019. Today there are customers who paid for FSD in 2019 have driven the car till after the warranty has expired and traded it in on  a newer vehicle while never receiving the \"coming soon\" feature they paid for. These drivers have a class action lawsuit against Tesla and their lawyers argued in sworn testimony before the court that \"FSD is not a scam, merely a failure\". Tesla has argued to a judge that FSD is a failure, yet they are still charging customers for it, and raising prices on it, which creams of scam. Now, as an automotive company, they did develop a viable EV market, but are not developing or releasing \"Disruptive AutoTech\" in a meaningful way to argue they are Tech company disrupting the Auto industry. Tesla FSD is probably as good as Googles FSD, or possibly worse once we cut through Elon's Hype (I prefer to call it all LIES!!!) and look at actual functionality. Everyone in auto industry has known since the early 1900's that electric cars are a viable tech, but never managed to make a product compelling enough to establish the EV market. GM's EV1 came out in the mid 90's, over a decade before Tesla's first marketable product, the roadster. Teslas first marketable product was not a piece of tech, but an automobile, thus it should be viewed as auto company, not tech company, IMO.\n\nNow lets look at what would make Tesla a tech company, IMO, and why that would ruin the automotive segment of their business. Probably the biggest factor that differentiates Tesla from all other EV's is the notion that their EV's have more advance tech than the broader market. This perception was established by lying about FSD, a lie that continues today. For Tesla to be a tech company, they need to sell their tech to the broader market, thus FSD on every car that will pay for the right, Ford, Honda, etc. But selling FSD or any other advanced tech they have developed to the broader market undercuts their position and competitiveness in the EV market. Thus, to become a viable tech company, Tesla must give up on being a successful auto company. If Tesla's goal is to be a tech company, all this investment in auto should be viewed as a wasteful cost. Companies like Ford are actually separating their EV company from the rest of their auto company because they recognize the value of focusing on your niche. Tesla can't even focus on Finishing their Truck because their ADD CEO lost interest and wants to do robots now, after starting, failing at, then tanking their solar business and cancelling all contracts. In America, all real 'Murican's drive trucks, and Tesla made huge gaff not beating Ford and Chevy to market with E-truck. Most Truck drivers are very brand loyal, so Tesla's only chance to capture share of that market was to beat #1 and #2 in that market (ok, maybe Toyota is #2 in trucks, haven't checked recently).\n\nGiven my Automotive background and my Engineering background, when I heard Must talking about how functional AutoPilot was and how quickly they could bring FSD to market, it was like a professional mountain climber hearing a novice try to argue that \"Everest can't be that hard\". The Novice truly believe that it can't be that hard, but only because they are naïve, not brilliant. Now there has been progress on FSD in the last 8 years, but it is not close by any means. Now Tesla claiming FSD is coming soon is like someone climbing their first (not particularly difficult) mountain and claiming that they will be ready for Everest next year. For example, \"Adaptive cruise control\" was first launched by Mercedes, BMW, Range Rover in like 2010 - 2012 sometime. Now 10 years later, it has become viable enough that all manufacturers implement and offer that tech, but I still argue there is a long ways to go to make it good, and that is just automating cruise control. FSD is trying to automate probably 30-50 individual functions like cruise control, braking, lane keep, traffic sign recognition, hazard monitoring, hazard avoidance, blind spot monitoring, and whoa, I need to stop before listing way more than 50 advanced system that need automation to deliver real FSD. Anyone that promises that much innovation in that short a time is naïve or a scammer, neither bodes well for Tesla. I do think there are smart people in Tesla who fully recognize the reality they face, I also believe Must refuses to listen to anyone speaking the truth against his dream.\n\nTL:DR Trust me bro, people do not explain because it is impossible to do so succinctly and most people are not going to read my article thoroughly explaining it anyways.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "My first response was so looooooong, but there is still so much more. Tesla's recent profitability was achieved in a bubble. They have had to slash prices in response to competition and declining market conditions. They do not have extra manufacturing capacity to increase volume so cutting prices cuts their own profitability. Tesla failed to corner the EV market before the big players jumped in, thus their market share of EV market will drop as better companies offer better products at prices still lower than Tesla after its recent price cut.\n\nTesla's quality is lacking, and everyone knows it. We can justify those growing pains when a company is new, but a company that claims to be the top EV company should have the top quality, and is far from it. The Nissan Leaf sold more units in its first year than Tesla was selling and is gaining broad recognition as the best USED EV to buy. A majority of car owners are the second (or later) owner of their vehicle. Moving forward used EV sales will overtake new EV sales, and Tesla is something most Consumer Reports advise used car buyers to avoid due to quality. As more and more People have a \"first EV experience\" with companies other than Tesla, what would draw them to a Model S over say an E-Impala that is cheaper, higher quality, from a more reputable brand. Resale value is an important consideration to a new car buyer, and Tesla is going to stop holding value as used market is flooded with other better EV options.\n\nA company like Ford already has globally recognized brands like Mustang and F-150. Everyone in the world knows F-150 is the best value truck on the market, who would choose cyber tuck over F-150 lightning?\n\nTheir Debt to income has been buoyed because they were overvalued for so long that they did not need loans, only to issue more stock. I see this as an argument against their success. Especially when cutting price without increasing volume. Profitability, debt to income etc are likely to get worse moving forward. P/E is getting better, but if their debt to income will increase, and their profitability will decrease, then their P/E is still to high. Tesla was not able to meet their estimated shipments on last report, so there is no volume available to increase sales and avoid a drop in profitability.\n\nI plan to buy calls tomorrow.
