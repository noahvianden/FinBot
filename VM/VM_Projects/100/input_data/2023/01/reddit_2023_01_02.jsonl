I can't imagine that this is real, but I've had huge success with it. I'm buying vertical spreads on SPY deep ITM which expire same day.

And your entry and exit prices determine your profits/loss.  So the gains you are seeing on paper may not materialize in a live market.  Can I know this for sure in your case?  Of course not.  My point is simply to warn that your paper trading gains while trading live may not match your paper gains which could throw off your risk/reward.  This is especially true with deep ITM stuff.  Liquidity usually isn’t great there so even a decent paper trading engine may not be accurate.  The fact that your underlying is quite liquid will help but the further you go ITM, generally, the less action there is, which makes paper trading engines less accurate since there is less data with which to work.  Ideally paper trading software should estimate your fill in real fills.  The less real fills, the more it has to to rely on statistical models to figure out a fill price. And if you aren’t using software for that and doing it by hand, well, you have no idea what would actually fill.\n\nYou can certainly try it live, just keep it small, one-lots are fine with commissions so low these days.

Personally, I think the best hedges are for locking in wins. \n\nFor example, say stock XYZ is at $150 and you buy a $150 strike call 30 DTE for $5. \n\nA couple weeks later XYZ is up to $156 and your call has appreciated to $10, so you have doubled your money and have a $5 gain unrealized. However, you think there is at least another $5 of upside potential in the call before expiration, so you don't want to take the gain now. But you also don't want to risk losing all your original capital and your gains, so you hedge the win by buying a cheap OTM protective put. \n\nIf the put's strike is $155 and costs $1, you deduct that $1 from your unrealized gain of $5 and have a net gain of $4. If the stock falls from 156 to 155, you lose another $1, reducing your net gain to $3. But you can't lose more than that. If the stock keeps going down, you start gaining dollar for dollar on the put. \n\nSo you effectively locked in at least a $3 gain on the trade, but still have all of the original upside potential, less the cost of the put.\n\nUnlike in your example, this is not a bet against yourself. Your original call bet already won. Instead, it's paying a fraction of your total original bet's cost on insurance.\n\nThere are also other kinds of hedges that make sense, like delta-hedging when you are trading volatility. The point of this kind of hedge is not to bet against yourself or to buy insurance, it is to neutralize an undesirable risk factor in a trade, which in this case is gamma risk.

That means that even if the call ends up making a nice 60% return over the ideal price, you are still down 40% because you paid 100% over the imaginary ideal price. That's how IV crush happens. \n\nSo what is this imaginary ideal price and how do you know if you are overpaying? You look at IV vs. an average, like IV Rank or IV Percentile. If the IV Rank of the call at the time you paid for it was 100%, that means that IV at the time of your purchase is as high as the highest IV in the previous 52 weeks. The higher IV is relative to previous history, the more likely you might end up overpaying for the contract, because IV is mean reverting (goes back to 50% IV Rank over time).\n\n\nFWIW, it's pretty unusual to buy a call when it is OTM vs. the underlying price and then lose money when it goes ITM. That's why I wanted to clarify the purchase price and current value.\n\nUnfortunately, there's not a lot you can do about it. Unless IV inflates again, you can't really get that money back. You can delay the situation by rolling out (take the loss now, buy a possibly more profitable call with a further out expiration), but it's an uphill battle recovering that IV that you overpaid for.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't understand why you chose OTM example.

The call itself should be worth at least the same as the intrinsic value (stock price - strike price), so the best thing to do yesterday before it expired was to sell to close the call.\n\nExercising would mean you have **to pay $37,000**. If you sold the shares that are delivered, you probably get the same $37,000 back plus the value of the call, so you didn't gain anything by exercising.

When FCO goes back to the 4.20s-4.90s- I will buy back and ride up to the mid 5 range. TEI is in the 4.80 range and CHW the 5.95 range. Last time I bought CHW I went from down 11% to up 15%.

I reallocated 45%of my portfolio to mreits in Dec. A month later I was up 12%. Unfortunately, I didn't just sell the rally and go in cash but to go from down 30% to down 10% from Oct 20 to Jan 20 is a huge recuperation of losses and offers a new buyer great upside potential at these levels.

Tesla's ROIC is WAY better than legacy OEMs. They are building factories for less money that are 2-3x more efficient than the legacy OEMs' factories. This argument that some \"have been doing it 100 years\" is a terrible argument, as anyone who's ever worked at an old company will tell you.

Factories run entirely on AI self-management systems? Agile routers allowing changes to be made to factories without stopping production?\n\nLegacy OEMs have none of that. They're years behind on a huge range of things.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Most of you’re points are just simply wrong but I’ll address the first one. You obviously don’t understand what retool means. It doesn’t matter what the plant was built with evs in mind in the first place. You retool the plant with evs in mind. That’s the whole point of a retool. You retool the manufacturing process to change the process to suit your needs. \n\nContractors come into a plant and rip everything out down to the steel columns in about 5 weeks. They come in one end of the line and start ripping out one side, while simultaneously laying down the new line as they peel the old one out. \n\nI can tell guys like you replying to me just simply don’t have any insight into how things work on the plant floor and get your information from whatever you read in the news. Some of us work in the real world directly in the industry. You can’t compare the efficiency of an ev plant to that of an ice plant because the assembly process is much less arduous in ev. More autonomously intensive but much less labor intensive. \n\nAs far as line speed and efficiency - jobs per hour are dependant on supply and demand. Just because a plant makes only 1 car every 1:57 seconds doesn’t mean they can make them in 1:37 seconds. It’s based on demand, not capability. If demand wanes or a certain model isn’t selling well they slow the lines down to match. The capability of greater efficient is bound by only physics and logistics. Again, why building cars close to the logistics hubs in Detroit offers a much greater advantage than making them all the way out in Illinois or California. A robot or agv system can only move as fast as they can. It’s not like Tesla has access to super robots or super workers. \n\nIf you had two plants with the same line equipment and the same model and everything else being equal they would in theory be able to produce the same volume. So there is definitely going to be differences on line speed based in demand, investment, supply chain, r&d, skills and abilities, etc. Tesla doesn’t have any special advantage in these areas, and arguably disadvantages in some. \n\nYou and another guy keep saying “retooling doesn’t work”. I’m honestly wondering how the fuck you think it works because factories are retooled all the time. Almost every product launch comes with some kind of line adaption or an entire plant wide tear out and rebuild. Retooling doesn’t mean “some modifications”. It means rip everything out down to the concrete floor and rebuild it. Production lines are highly modular in the grand scope of construction or large projects. The equipment is sub assembled in a machine manufacturing facility, transported to the auto manufacturing facility and bolted to the ground. The difficult part is tying the machines in together. But all in all a very streamlined process. \n\nGoing to your “sub par” factory comment, again what the fuck are you on about? You rebuild the factory to suit your needs. Blank canvas. It doesnt matter what was there before. \n\n“Ice cars used as collateral for debt” - what? Are you suggesting manufacturers have taken out debt and used unsold cars in inventory as collateral?\n\n“Vehicle sales are down” yes for everyone. Which is why tsla slashed their msrps today isn’t it? \n\n“Tesla building factories for less money” yea no shit, everyone is building factories for a fraction of what they used to. There have been massive advancements in the process and automation construction. Much cheaper to build a paint shop than it used to be even 10 years ago. Probably 1/3 to 1/4 of the price. \n\n“Not even the oems think that”. No one thinks that, it’s a [fact.](https://amp.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/09/electric-cars-will-be-cheaper-to-produce-than-fossil-fuel-vehicles-by-2027)\n\n“Single piece casting” I’ll introduce you to the unibody platform. \n\nMercedes already adapted ai integration to their new plant as announced at CES today. \n\nWe’re you also the guy who was saying teslas biggest advantage was their charging network? Because Mercedes just secured a deal to build a 1bn network in USA as of today. \n\nOems are not far behind. They’re probably much farther ahead just manufacturing a different type of car. Again refer to established logistics infrastructure, supply chains, supplier relationships, etc. Tesla struggled through a lot of speed bumps learning how to manufacture cars and it’s pretty evident they haven’t come close to manufacturing cars as good as big 3. Exhibit a, their shit quality. Not only is their control bad but they can’t even get it right in the first place. \n\nI think you’re getting a little to into the idea that Tesla is able to do things that no one else can. We all live in the same world have the same access to parts, materials, technology, workforce. They vary from region region of course but it’s not like Mexico’s robots can work faster than the ones in Europe. Im not saying Tesla has no advantages over any other manufacturer.

If anything, that runs counter to your belief that EV market share increases. I.e if supply of ICE cars is cut, depreciation would be less not more. See last two years for auto supply price dynamics.\n\nThe difference there is that demand for cars didn't change (except for during Q2 2020), while the supply went down. In the rest of the decade, demand for EVs will come at the expense of demand for ICE, since people only buy one car. So it's not necessarily the supply that will decrease, but the demand that will force automakers to cut supply.\n\nThen on top of that, the same will happen in the second hand market, where there will be a shortage of EVs and a surplus of ICE cars because it takes 3-10 years for a new car to hit the second hand market. This will only be exacerbated by the fact that EVs are cheaper to own than ICE cars, which creates an incentive to get rid of your ICE car ASAP to save money.\n\n> The world will not be full EV in 5-10 years.

Trucks are a massive part of the auto market and the physics don’t work well for EVs in that application. Third, the infrastructure is still pathetic in the vast majority of the USA, let alone countries with less EV market share.\n\nI think it will. By 2030 EVs will be anywhere between 10-30% cheaper to purchase than a new ICE car, and they're already 30-50% cheaper to own. You have to be crazy or crazy rich by that point to still purchase a new ICE car.\n\nAs for trucks, I think EVs will work just fine there and even if they don't, they're just a tiny fraction of the global market (less than 5%).\n\nAs for the infrastructure, that always follows demand, not vice versa.

TSLA has most recently shown diminishing growth, so continuing to value it based on PEG is going to result in losses as we've seen over the last few months. Divide PE by 40 because of 40% growth and it looks really attractive because that's a good growth rate in a vacuum. But if that's part if a larger picture where the growth rate is halved every year, as seems the case here, that analysis doesn't really work.

There's some merit to that and I don't expect their growth to diminish to 1.25% over the next 5 years as the geometric hypothesis suggests either. \n\nThe truth is likely somewhere in the middle, and that's where uncertainty typically gets priced out of a stock.

Neither Berlin or Austin hit their 5k per week targets by year-end, but in the grand scheme of things who cares? They’ll be there in a couple months. \n\nThe markets are a mess and nobody is trading this hellscape, so deliveries be damned - let’s focus on what actually matters. Tesla telegraphed the unwinding of the end of quarter wave, production is more important.\n\nAs it stands they still haven’t built up enough inventory to smooth the wave. We know they hit a logistics limit for quarter-end in multiple markets, but they still haven’t got enough inventory to smooth that yet. The discrepancy between these numbers will continue for several more quarters. This will lead to more doom-mongering because suddenly Telsa has inventory available, but speaking from personal experience of this quarters delivery wave, not much has changed in the past few years. I traded my Tesla for a fresh one on the 22nd December, there were multiple trucks unloading while I was there and talking to the team they were doing over 100 deliveries per day from that location, but they’d run out of vehicles and had nothing available a week earlier.

This year was considerably better as I was up 10.8% while the SP500TR was down 18.3%.\n\nThese returns are after all transaction costs (only option contract fees) and account for a 15% tax rate on qualified dividends and a 40% tax rate on option premium.  \n\n3.8% of the outperformance came from dividends, 4% from option premium, and the rest from appreciation of the underlyings that formed the core portfolio (heavily buoyed by a 35% healthcare and 13% oil allocation).\n\nThe underlyings in the core portfolio were:\n\nSymbol & Percent Of Account\n\nABBV  6.61% \n\nBEN  0.72% \n\nBMY  8.82% \n\nBTI  1.63% \n\nCAH  2.09% \n\nGILD  2.34% \n\nHPQ  1.83% \n\nIGGHY  0.13% \n\nJPM  3.65% \n\nLEG  1.76% \n\nMMM  4.90% \n\nMO  6.23% \n\nMRK  9.07% \n\nNTDOY  0.71% \n\nOGN  0.11% \n\nPEP  2.46% \n\nPFE  6.98% \n\nPM  9.65% \n\nSLV  0.60% \n\nSWBI  1.18% \n\nT  2.51% \n\nUNM  1.12% \n\nVTRS  1.06% \n\nVZ  4.83% \n\nWBA  4.07% \n\nWBD  0.44% \n\nWU  1.88% \n\nXLE  5.96% \n\nXOM  7.51%\n\nThe majority of the premium came from selling 10 to 20 delta strangles or wide iron condors on SPY, IWM, QQQ, TLT, GLD, and XOP with SPY representing the overwhelming majority of premium followed by TLT and GLD with IWM/QQQ/XOP barely making a difference because I did not end up using these for most of the year other than a little at the beginning.\n\nI adapted Tasty strategies to meet my needs for simplicity and spreading risk across time.  \n\nI sold options at 42 DTE (not 45) , managed at 40% profit or 21 DTE and I spread my buying power across 3 weeks.\n\nFor example, let's say I had enough buying power to sell 9 SPY strangles, 3 TLT strangles, and 3 GLD strangles.  Here is what I did:\n\nWeek 1: sell 3 SPY strangles, 1 TLT strangle, 1 GLD strangle all at 42 DTE, and enter a GTC order to buy back at 40% profit\n\nWeek 2: sell 3 SPY strangles, 1 TLT strangle, 1 GLD strangle all at 42 DTE, and enter a GTC order to buy back at 40% profit\n\nWeek 3: sell 3 SPY strangles, 1 TLT strangle, 1 GLD strangle all at 42 DTE, and enter a GTC order to buy back at 40% profit\n\nWeek 4: manage any of the strangles still left from week 1 and sell another set of the same strangles 42 DTE\n\nWeek 5: manage any of the strangles still left from week 2 and sell another set of the same strangles 42 DTE\n\nWeek 6: manage any of the strangles still left from week 3 and sell another set of the same strangles 42 DTE\n\nWeek 7: manage any of the strangles still left from week 4 and sell another set of the same strangles 42 DTE, etc...\n\nThis became a very simple way of keeping these trades going and took very minimal effort.\n\nThere were many times in the year when I thought the market would take a large move one way or the other and so I switched to selling wide iron condors ($5-10 wide wings in TLT/GLD and $10-20 wide wings in SPY).  Prior to the election and through almost all of December I took all options off because I was convinced there was going to be a tremendous downward move in the market.\n\nBoth of these decisions (switching to iron condors and pausing selling options for about 2 months toward the end of the year) cost me because I wasn't even close to being right and my strategy would have continued to be profitable.  If I had just kept going I probably would have had an additional 20% option premium gains.\n\nThere were a few times my condor wings were tested to the upside and I ended up managing them by rolling or switching from one $10 wide to two $5 wide.  I didn't enjoy this at all and it probably would have been much easier for me to manage these if they were just strangles. \n\nI have portfolio margin on my account but I used a tiny fraction of my buying power, never exceeding a notional value of shares controlled via options higher than 1x my portfolio and being way under that for most of the time. \n\n**What went right:**\n\n* My strategy was very simple to implement and didn't take much time (a few minutes every Friday)\n* I collected 6%+ in option premium (4% after taxes) which makes the efforts of the past 3 years worth it since I believe I have done so in a way I can replicate in the future using a fraction of the time it has taken me in the past\n* My underlyings really helped me finish out the year with a gain and were responsible for most of my outperformance compared to the S&P 500\n\n**What went wrong:**\n\n* Every time I de-risked by switching to iron condors or stopped selling altogether because I was certain the market was going to crash, I was wrong and I lost out on a significant amount of premium because of this - I estimate premium collected would have been closer to 5% instead of 4%\n* My option premium collected would have been about 4.5% instead of 4% it wasn't for all the contract fees\n* Losing iron condors are much harder to manage than losing strangles\n* I wanted to do some tax-loss harvesting to offset premium gains but I ended up chickening out because I don't want to be out of the market and have one of my stocks jump on an earnings release or something.  I would have had to have sold 25% of my total portfolio just to come up with enough losses to offset my premium gains.\n\n **What is next:** \n\n* I feel like I have a fairly refined system now and I don't need to make major changes going forward. I'd like to use a bit more of my buying power and be a little more disciplined about sticking to the strategy despite my opinions of market direction.  I know that naked strangles are far easier to manage than iron condors but this is tough for me because I still feel like the market has the potential for a large drop that would blow past a 20 delta put.  Right now the best I can think of is that if I am going to change the way I act based on this opinion instead of iron condors I either sell fewer strangles each week and/or sell at closer to 10 delta than 20 delta.  \n* I am looking into a more commission friendly way to sell premium but I really don't want to switch brokers to RH or WeBull for this.  I may just see how much I save by not doing iron condors and see if that makes a difference.\n\nMy list of those to thank is the same as in my 2021 post so I won't repeat that here.
