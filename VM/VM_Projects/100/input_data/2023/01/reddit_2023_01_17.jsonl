Others probably sold at that point for a profit and then whoever bought it next is buying it thinking the market might break above that resistance too (just like me). Unfortunately, they would not have done so hot this afternoon with that option. Just think of each option contract as 100 shares of intrinsic value (minus daily theta burn and other factors) once the equity price is past the strike mark for the option in play. In the case above, once qqq went above and beyond 383, my option should theoretically have an intrinsic value of the difference between my strike price (383) and the current price (lets say $384) - so would have a intrinsic value of 1$X100 shares = 100$ + premium (the further away from exp the larger the value of the time premium associated with the option). I hope this helps.

Ignoring that it’s a waste of money, what do they even do? The whole culture war bullshit crusade against “wokeness” is also stupid af though, especially considering 99% of talking points about “wokeness” (Fucking despise that word) are completely made up, not happening, or twisted so far out of context that it doesn’t represent the reality of the situation. You know what else is dumb as fuck? The phrase “go woke go broke”. What happened to the free market? Ya know the foundation of capitalism? Why is the gov stepping in and punishing corporations for how they operate their businesses? Wtf does woke even mean in this context? Defucktis punishing Disney because they didn’t support his assault on teachers over some shit that is straight up manufactured and not happening is straight outta a fascist playbook, and the idiocracy cherry on top is that it’s costing Florida taxpayers $2.7 billion and an additional $105 million annually. So who the fuck is actually going broke here? If I operated a corporation I sure as shit wouldn’t take my business to Florida, or any other state looking to participate in this dumb shit crusade. Puts on Florida.\n\nThat being said, yeah some of this shit on the other side is just going too far. Diversity coordinator? Stupid. Pronouns? I mean, really, who cares and why is it such a big deal? If a full grown ass adult wants be called they? Ok cool whatever. No skin off my back, but I don’t really understand it, honestly not really a fan of a plural pronoun being used to describe a singular person, but it’s not the end of the world like Fucker Carlson would like you to believe. But that goes both ways, if I accidentally call you wrong don’t jump all over me like I committed some heinous crime. Also don’t come at me shoving it down my throat and telling me I have to like it, I’m all for acceptance and letting people do whatever they want when it concerns their own body, even if I don’t understand it. Why is the “party of small government” pushing for way more government restrictions on everything related to sex? Fuckers wanna take my condoms?! What is my wife gonna do when her boyfriend knocks her up? Can’t even get an abortion anymore,  I though this was America. I can’t afford to raise their kid, I lost all my dad’s life savings on gourd futures for fucks sake! That being said, there’s no such thing as “pronoun pushers” and “woke departments” get that shit outta here. \n\nCan we all just give it a fucking rest? I’m so sick or hearing about all this bullshit, especially here, the trans thing especially, I mean we’re making a huge deal over something that affects what, less than 1% of the population but the ways it’s covered you’d think the government wants to chop off all of our dicks and forcibly sew them on your wife’s boyfriend’s girlfriend.\n\nEdit: I got too political I know, sry.
