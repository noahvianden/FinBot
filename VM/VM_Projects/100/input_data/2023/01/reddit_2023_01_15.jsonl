I written on this a few times in past posts. (this is the third time I went in hard on a crash) Oil companies are not going anywhere soon and oil is still in huge demand. IE. We are nearly hitting near record highs again. My main purchase was VET at a about 4.50 a share CAD. I sold them multiple times but overall sold them at 34 a share (equivalence) in about 18 months. I have recently bought a big share in them at 25 and change and down a bit at the moment as they are around 21 CAD. I likely will be fully out of oil sometime this summer and then my portfolio will likely be more finance oriented. Banks typically. That could change on market sentiment. \n\nOil and gas will eventually be a much smaller market but people are way overestimating the downfall of that industry and thus you are buying fantastic bargains. IE P/E rations of 3 and this after they have done 1000% returns. I also fully believe for world security, supporting and producing as much oil and gas in Western nations takes markets away from countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia. I have no moral qualms with that industry locally. We should be operating like Norway in that we produce high and export but encourage EV and green energy usage while making our countries wealthy. Making Western countries wealthy is critical to ensure countries like Russia do no have expansion interests. I did make truly millions on my investments in the last two years and did sell when I felt they were reaching peak. My tax bill this year will be significant. I do not feel any real attachments to the companies I invest in and do not invest based on feelings or what I hope will happen.

If through some bizarre twist of fate, enough of the increased wealth created by those additional goods and services does not end up in the hands of those former students so they can repay their loans, then it makes sense to forgive those loans and in effect everyone helps with the repayment.\n\nHowever, if that additional wealth never gets created in the first place, then it is fair to expect those students to have the opportunity to repay their loans when that additional wealth does get created at some point in the future.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Your explanation here is EXACTLY why I prefer Canada's method of helping students over Biden's student loan forgiveness plan.\n\nThey permanently set all federal student loans to 0% interest with a fairly low monthly payment, only requiring that the full amount be paid back within 15 years of university/college graduation.", "score": 18, "replies": []}, {"body": "So you are advocating that student loan be abolished and ISA used instead.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The bs around alllll of this is simply lawmakers allowed this to happen.

If the entire $1 Trillion was paid within 5 years (that's an awfully short timespan for most repayment plans), it would mean $200 billion redirected dollars each year, which is a very low amount compared to the total economy (less than 1% of GDP and about 4% of 2022 Federal tax revenue). So, while debt repayment would be very significant in the lives of many, the actual economic ramifications would be low. This is NOT an argument for debt forgives, since a similar argument could be made for almost anything (which is why we have ballooning Federal deficits and indebtedness, in general.) It's just me saying that the impact of student loan repayments will not likely make a significant contribution to a 2023-2024 recession either way.\n\nOn the individual level, yes, not paying will show up on credit reports and wreck one's credit, thereby hurting the ability to get a mortgage or car loan or whatever. But again, on a macro scale, it just means more young persons would need cosigners to get rental housing until the debt is re-paid. It sucks for the individual, but it wouldn't be a disaster for those not directly affected (it might even help everyone else, since the world is competitive). National debt forgiveness which must be repaid through taxation of everyone would be a disaster, in my opinion, since it would further shelter individuals from taking personal responsibility of choices and do nothing good to improve the true costs of our entitled \"non-profit\" educational system (third-party payer systems always inflate costs to catastrophic levels).", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "My only point of contention with what you said that I always bring up regarding student loans is why there isn’t more dialogue about the predatory nature of them. Sure, borrowers made the choice to take out a loan, but most of these borrowers are 18-19 year olds fresh out of high school facing intense societal pressure to “get an education”. I know for at least myself I was certainly not mature enough at that age to think about the ramifications for the future that a large amount of debt like that entails. I don’t think many kids do have that kind of maturity. Not to mention the fact that these schools are not held accountable for charging high tuition costs for degrees that will never pay out what they cost to earn. The TLDR version of my rant is higher ed is predatory in nature and should be held at minimum partially accountable for the student debt crisis we are in.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that social and even familial pressure is high and unfair. Jobs should screen candidates for skills, not diplomas, and many other things about the social -economic landscape should change. But ultimately, who should pay for bad mistakes? And I don't mean small mistakes, but huge ones. Like electing to do chemotherapy when the doctors pressure you into it even though statistically it doesn't help survival but causes tons of painful if not deadly effects; or buying a house that had terrible pipe damage that wasn't properly disclosed but is still beyond legal reproach; or losing all your life savings because you were told by an \"expert\" on TV or at your bank that a particular investment strategy was the safest; or for teens, being pushed into orthodontic treatment that destroys your face and teeth. There are many more examples. \n\nI agree with you that the entire system of \"higher learning\" is predatory and screws people as a business model. At the moment, the government loan system is effectively subsidizing their existence. I would argue the same thing for the allopathic medical system. What should be done about it? Practically, how can we make a college or the lenders pay for their part in the bad choices? Making them pay will increase costs of doing business, which will increase costs to everyone else. Forgiving debt in this time to these select persons, and making those who came before and come after pay for it, seems wholly unfair. I think the problem is the third party payer system, which removes accountability and inflates costs. But if we stopped third party school loans and third party medical insurance programs, the masses would call that unfair for other reasons.\n\nUltimately, in a world where every decision we make is influenced by and in turn influences everyone else, who should have the responsibility to deal with the consequences of actions? It must be the actor. No matter how many swindling salesmen or unfair consequences there are, the actor must be responsible. We have this in every other type of law, including rape (I can't just say \"she dressed too provocatively\"), murder (I can't just say \"my God made me do it\"), and theft (I can't just say \"I'm too poor to pay\"). Some would emotionally or even ideologically sympathize with some of these persons, but the law must draw a line, and the line has rightly been one of agency. \n\nSaid another way, students should repay their debt.

{"title": "Costco Wholesale Corporation. (COST) Stock Review 01/15/2023", "selftext": "As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advice. Always do you own due diligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions and hope to have a civil discussion.\n\n· **Company Description**\n\no ELI5 the company’s business model\n\n§ Costco is a vertically integrated wholesale club store and ecommerce site. To access the store, you must be a member which comes with an annual fee.\n\n· **Company Soundness**\n\no How does the company collect revenue? \n\n§ The company collects revenue through selling goods and services as well as its membership fee.\n\no Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or at a regular interval?\n\n§ As a staple retailer their goods are purchased very frequently and across all economic environments. Their core merchandise categories are Food and Sundries, Non-foods and Fresh Foods.\n\no Do they operate with significant leverage?\n\n§ No. They have an interest coverage ratio of 50x and operate with $0.42 of debt for every $1.00 of equity.\n\no Is their balance sheet well suited for a downturn and why?\n\n§ Yes. They consistently have positive operating cash flow and are in a staple business. Additionally, they have \\~$11 billion in cash as of last quarter. They operate with a Cash Conversion ratio that ranges between -2 and 6 days indicating their highly liquid inventory and cash management.\n\no Are there any large deviations in Operating Income and Operating Cash Flow and if so, why?\n\n§ No, OI and OCF margins are nearly identical over short- and long-term averages.\n\no Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?\n\n§ Yes. Despite having relatively low debt, they have stunningly high ROEs. They averaged 27% whereas the consumer staples industry overall is at 7.8%. This occurs while they are still able to grow revenue at nearly a 10% clip over the past few years.\n\no Are there major company specific risks?\n\n§ None that I am aware of.\n\n· **Can the company be replicated?**\n\no What is the competitive advantage?\n\n§ Costco has industry leading scale, vertical integration and a no-frills model leading to a low-cost provider position.\n\n§ Scale: Costco has far fewer products in their store compared to other retailers but is one of the largest volume stores. This gives them enormous pricing power. If you are big laundry, would you want Costco to drop you?\n\n§ Their vertical integration is probably the least understood advantage of Costco. For example, Costco orders directly from the manufacturer and meets their orders at docks or has them directly dropped off at their stores. Additionally, Costco Wholesale Industries, a division of the Company, operates manufacturing businesses, including special food packaging, optical laboratories, meat processing and jewelry distribution. These businesses have a common goal of providing members with high quality products at substantially lower prices. This also allows them to avoid markups that other retailers pay as they don’t have these investments. \n\n§ By owning the production and having a strong store brand in the form of Kirkland Signature, they have additional leverage to squeeze excess costs from other product providers. In other words, Kirkland is preferred to many name brands meaning Costco can pass if they don’t feel terms are agreeable. \n\n§ According to Craig Jelinek, the Company's CEO and director, \"Costco is able to offer lower prices and better values by eliminating virtually all the frills and costs historically associated with conventional wholesalers and retailers, including salespeople, fancy buildings, delivery, billing and accounts receivable. We run a tight operation with extremely low overhead which enables us to pass dramatic savings to our members.\"\n\n§ Putting it all together Costco operates with a gross margin of 12%, a net margin of 2.5% with ROEs of 27%. The staples industry has a 30.7% gross margin, 4.3% net margin and ROEs of 7.8%. \n\n§ All this value is enabled by their membership fee. You could think of the operating business as a massive non-profit but the membership as pure profit. Roughly 90% of their profits can be attributed to revenue from the membership fee. Given the tremendous value of the membership, they have significant pricing power to raise it. Especially with \\~92% retention rate, this implies the average customer stays with them for 12.5 years.\n\no Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?\n\n§ Costco got its start in 1983 and since then has only continued to gobble up market share. In an industry that has almost no switching costs and has been upset by the internet, Costco remains a pillar of financial strength.\n\n§ Above I made the argument that Costco is the low-cost provider. The obvious challenger to this is Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart by comparison operates with a 25% gross margin (double Costco) and ROEs have averaged around 16% over the past 5 years (little less than half of Costco). Walmart’s higher margins are not being borne out with higher returns on equity. Costco really is king!\n\no Is technology likely to serve or harm the company?\n\n§ I don’t believe so. Costco’s strengths are really being the low-cost provider. It does seem that Costco is lagging in ecommerce and delivery to homes. Having said that, low-cost provider is a timeless trait (assuming it upkept).\n\no Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?\n\n§ Absolutely not. Costco has about $20 billion of equity on the books. Costco offers a unique blend of low profit margins and high returns on capital. For a would-be new entrant, the low margins without scale are likely to be a fairly difficult hurdle.\n\no Are there structural reasons why the supply of new competition is likely to be limited?\n\n§ No, there is nothing unique about the industry that would stop competition. While I just argued that competing with Costco on price is likely to be a losing battle, there are many other ways retailers can offer value to customers, such as convenience or service.\n\no Are there structural reasons why customers are likely to stay with the company?\n\n§ Yes. Costco has cemented itself as the low-cost provider. As mentioned above, this has enabled customers to on average stay with the company for 12.5 years.\n\no Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?\n\n§ Most of the model is based on the combination of simple businesses at scale with a willingness to adhere to a no-frills model.\n\no Are there competitive threats on the horizon?\n\n§ Retail has always been a blood bath of changing industry leaders. Having said that, I don’t see any obvious challengers to disrupting their low-cost provider position. They seem to be outcompeting Walmart as Walmart has focused its efforts on convenience to take Amazon on in ecommerce. \n\n· **Growth**\n\no Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?\n\n§ Yes, revenue has gone up every year in the last 10 and earnings have nearly gone up every year in the last 10.\n\no Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?\n\n§ It will likely be close. In recent years, growth has been well more than 7%, but prior to covid, growth was mixed around the 7% figure. Costco is well loved in China and expanding there giving them a long runway.\n\n· **Watch List Decision**\n\no Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision? \n\n§ Yes\n\no Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?\n\n§ Yes\n\n· **Valuation**\n\no Value the company\n\n§ Costco currently pays a dividend of $3.60 per share. I will assume a $3.80 dividend going forward for the next 3 years.\n\n§ Share dilution has been minimal. I will assume a 0 to 0.25% increase in shares over the next 3 years.\n\n§ Analysts estimate that revenue ending 08/31/2026 is expected to be $297.9 billion. Given the steadiness and predictability of their model I will assume revenues will be 5% above and below in the bull/bear case.\n\n§ Costco’s FCF margins have been around 2.25% over the last decade. I will assume a 2 to 3% bear and bull margin for a midpoint of 2.5%.\n\n§ FCF Yields have historically been around 1.8% to 3.8%. I will assume the same.\n\n§ Putting the above together we get an estimated value of $629 in August of 2026.\n\no Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?\n\n§ A company with the consistency of Costco isn’t likely to need a high a discount rate to warrant purchase. For me, an investment in Costco should be expected to yield 8% or more. Given its current price of $485, this implies an annual return of 8.15% per year. To that end, per my assumptions it seems that Costco is fairly valued.\n\nSources:\n\nAggregated Data: [https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:COST](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGS:COST)\n\nInvestor Data: [https://investor.costco.com/overview/default.aspx](https://investor.costco.com/overview/default.aspx)", "id": "10cl5i5", "created_utc": 1673792819.0, "score": 445, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 172, "comments": [{"body": "Everything you said makes makes sense and is all technically sound, but 2 things that need to be said about Costco are:\n\n• Brand affinity & love: Costco has earned consumer trust through many years and deliberate strategy.

But Costco has been stagnant in feature growing their tech side(app,  online shopping,  scan and go, order pickup, managing their delivery and associated features online etc).

Sam's club is more consistent while Costco is more sporadic by design.

Don't know anything about BJs.\n\nScan and go is really different than self check out. Covid also made order pickup an expectation and Costco won't manage that. Along with online shopping which is terrible on Costco I think there is more room for sams club to grow than you are indicating. Sam's club is also cheaper than Costco on the product side. \n\nThat said, they appeal to 2 different demographics and Costco may keep that upper middle class market that keeps their profitability higher. The average income for members is feels pretty different as well. Costco also has a bigger international market from what I can tell(china,  Japan,  NZ etc) where sams club doesn't really have a market. Costco used to be separated by their quality of treatment of employees and their wages being higher than a lot of minimum wages. Their wages are stagnant now and the current CEO is less employee friendly.

Your last sentence shows your investment is more emotional than purely data based which is fine, but explains why your valuation is so wildly different from mine.\n\nAn important thing to consider about FSD and any automotive tech they develop first. They can keep that tech proprietary to Tesla to improve sales, at which point they do not deserve valuation as a tech company. Or they can sell FSD too all manufacturers, justifying argument they are tech company, but undercutting their automotive business by removing what makes them special. Tesla cant have it both ways. If they keep FSD proprietary (which would be foolish), others are not too far behind and that would only help them for a couple years. Thus I argue they should be valued as an automotive company until they can become a viable tech company. Right now their only marketable products are automobiles so arguing they are a tech company has always seemed kinda silly to me. Generally speaking Tech companies have some sort of viable product when they go public and get huge valuation when their tech achieves broad adoption and scale. Tesla was operating as a car company, then people began treating them like a tech company when they announced their tech idea, without proving viability in any meaningful way.\n\nIn fact, I read today a former Tesla engineer just stated under oath in court that they faked their 2016 self driving video, which has gotten me convinced FSD was always a pump and dump scheme.

The issue for the rest of the country is that their minimum wages have not kept up with inflation and costs - workers here make $31k per year at minimum wage, and with no state taxes on that little income. They literally have around $2,200 a month to spend on expenses after taking out mandatory payroll taxes. Rent is affordable at those prices in many places in California. Maybe not Santa Monica, but places further inland that are still within short (less than 1 hour) drives to the beach, mountains, Disneyland, whatever are easily affordable including the cost of utilities and food.  Now, you can’t eat out really on minimum wage. Or buy nice things. I’ll give you that.  But within the state, you can live.  And that’s the point of minimum wage - to provide a minimum standard of living.

There’s a reason why California’s real estate overall has been the best real estate investment of any other state in the last two decades. There’s a reason why Silicon Valley exists.

It's why the State of California once had a $3 bill.\n\nA financial crisis happened, which set Congress to consider a Unified Central Bank for the whole nation, and in 1913 the Federal Reserve, a non-governmental banking entity was established. The Federal Reserve was supposed to set Monetary Policies for the Government and Nation, while being constrained by the Gold Standard.\n\nAfter WW2 and through Legislative policies created by Franklin Roosevelt America began it trip into practicing variable degrees of Socialism.\n\nAs the American Dollar became the world's Reserve Currency, and the Nations of the world sent America their Gold for safe keeping, the Federal Reserve began to print more Goldbacked US Dollars. Eventually the other nations of the world wanted to trade their US Dollars back for the Gold America was storing, but America didn't have the required amount of Gold on-hand to meet the demand. That's when Richard Nixon committed his greatest crime, not just to Americans but to the entire world. He ended the convertiblity of the US Dollar into Gold, effectively defaulting on the agreement.\n\nAt this point the US Dollar was completely Fiat Currency, and in of being direct claims to wealth in the form of Gold, the US Dollar was a symbol of value which in quantity of existence dictates how much objects of true value cost.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has been inflating the currency supply for over 50 years now, debasing the currency, and manipulating markets with purchasing assets with the newly created currency.\n\nThat is how the Federal Reserve controls interest rates.

{"title": "Is TSLA a buy?", "selftext": "Two years ago, it was pretty clear that Tesla was overvalued. Its P/E ratio was significantly higher than its competitors. In fact, the company was worth more than General Motors, Ford, and Toyota combined. Tesla seemed poised to eventually compete with the established automakers but investors seemed to think that Tesla would eventually become a monopoly. Tesla did better than expected in 2020 but it seemed like investors overshot the new reality. And it seems like I was right to be fearful when investors were greedy on TSLA.\n\nFrom two years ago, the stock has gone down by 58.27%. The P/E ratio is now 37.78. The thing to note about Tesla is that it's really a tech stock and it should be treated as such. Tech stocks tend to have higher P/E ratios because investors anticipate higher revenue growth. Another thing worth noting is that while the stock price has fallen, earnings have gone up. In 2020, Tesla made roughly $31.5 billion with $6.6 billion in gross profit and just under $2 billion in operating income. Over the past 12 months, Tesla has made $74.8 billion in revenue, $19.9 in gross profit, and $12.5 billion in operating income. The P/E ratio is much higher in Tesla than its competitors which is 2-10. However, compared to other tech companies, Tesla is rather tame. Amazon is at 89.2. Even its competitor, Walmart, is at 44.7.\n\nTesla has much higher growth potential than its competitors, being a first mover in electric vehicles. Its competitors are largely well established and are not growing as quickly as Tesla. Tesla has already established itself as an EV brand. The question is whether its competitors can make the switch towards electric vehicles to hold their own against Tesla.", "id": "10cwyst", "created_utc": 1673821611.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 225, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Tesla is a tech stock and should be compared to other tech stocks.
