{"title": "We are going up this week! $SPY", "selftext": " Up, down, sideways?! \n\nGood afternoon fellow traders!!! A pretty noneventful week last week IMO overall market wise as we were in a range most of it till an exciting Friday to bring us home!!!\n\nI‚Äôm going to share my analysis of the SPY for the coming week to see which way we may go.\n\nTo start us off let‚Äôs remember Thursday the 12th we have CPI reports, this will likely bring some type of reaction either way from the SPY, so keep that in the back of our minds.\n\nStarting with the micro let's analyze the price action of the last week. Below is a 6M day chart. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sx7akppevaa1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=351c682035d461c629e16c21bac253dfb1f338ca\n\n \n\nThe action Friday really shakes things up here. An above avg range day on above avg volume, with a strong daily candle close. \n\nTechnically speaking this 380 level has been a line in the sand for the last 9 months. Let‚Äôs look at the chart below and see its importance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5n74l3uevaa1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=443671ec76095e99b92bc96eb234fb9777989d05\n\n This 380 level, as well as 410, have been my two key levels in play for the last 9 months. As you can see 380 support was first set back in May of 2022, offering a sharp reversal back to 410 before retesting the support area of 380 once again. \n\nEach subsequent time we‚Äôve come down to this support area we‚Äôve had the same outcome. A reversal to the upside. The main difference between the prior times we‚Äôve spent down in this demand zone is how long until a reversal? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/16zek28zevaa1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e95aad0c4694ae3f8c262ac5c519e93ac366bc9\n\n The next key level we are coming into is 390. This is going to be in my opinion the place to watch whether we will go higher or lower in the coming weeks. At the very least this week I expect to test the 390 level pretty early on in the week. Either Monday or Tuesday. Depending on the price action at 390 this will give us more information on the next move. If we see some topping signs here and a failure to hold 390 then I am expecting a move such as this. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jiv3n5k4fvaa1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=0808f981db0fa6abf172a970c03697079942e46e\n\n \n\nHowever, if we can break and hold 390. Then I‚Äôll be expecting a move similar to the last few times we reclaimed 390 as support back in July as well November. If we can get a move like this then I‚Äôd expect at a minimum to test the descending trend line I‚Äôve had drawn for quite some time, at around 400. At max, a retest of the 410 area and hopefully our first higher high.\n\nLastly, let us look at some higher time frame weekly charts to see exactly what in my opinion may or may not be a good time for all of this to turn itself around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/it4ojh57fvaa1.png?width=883&format=png&auto=webp&s=1499670999ebcd376a81ba406de78eefb929900c\n\n \n\nSo as we can see in this weekly chart. I‚Äôve tried to portray via colors the significance of the swing highs and lows that have been set the last year. In red we have bearish trends, lower highs, and lower lows. Green ovals are our attempts of reversing this trend with either a higher high or higher low. The sole gray oval is neutral as it is yet not validated as a higher high or lower high until we see what the next attempt at it is. \n\nAs of now, we are in the first position since last year to possibly rotate this trend and create a reversal. If we can break and hold 410 to the upside and then set a higher low to 380 after it pulls in then we will for the first time since 2021 be making higher lows and higher highs once more. What happens after that we do not know!\n\nTo wrap this up, In my opinion, I think we have some upside in the SPY earlier on in the week good for at least 2% to the 395 area. What we do after that will be key to whether or not we head higher to 400+ or see 370‚Äôs. So I will be watching mainly if we can flip and hold the 390 support once more and that will dictate my bias. \n\nLastly, remember CPI numbers report Thursday which are bound to create some type of reaction in the markets. Again, in my opinion, if we come in under estimates I believe markets should rip off of that report, showing that even at Christmas time inflation can still start to fix itself and give participants hope the next Fed meeting will be good news. However, the odds of that happening may be pretty low so watch for the flip scenario to happen.\n\nGood luck and happy trading!!!", "id": "106ruxu", "created_utc": 1673206190.0, "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|4 days ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: I think we have some upside in the SPY earlier on in the week good for at least 2% to the 395 area.
