Schwab is suggesting that I try Cash-Secured Equity Puts because that's essentially what I'm already doing but not receiving the trade premium income ... or something like that\n\nIMO, they are misleading you, by a lot.\n\nI'm constantly trying to warn people that a CSP equity put **does not act like a limit order to buy shares at a discount!!** Which is what your original strategy without options is about, right?\n\nHere's why. Let's start with your scheme as it stands today.\n\nIf the stock gradually falls to 80 over the course of the next 20 days lets say, your 95 limit would trigger when the price is just below 95, and you'd get the stock at 95ish. Then the 90 would trigger, then the 85 would trigger. So you'd have three lots of lets say 100 shares each for simplicity. The first lot (95) would have a -15/share unrealized loss, vs. the current 80. The second lot (90) would have a -10/share unrealized loss, and the final lot (85) would have a -5/share unrealized loss. With me so far?\n\nCompare to using the CSP scheme. Backgrounder: A CSP is a short sale of a put contract. Short puts become assignable when the spot price is below the strike price of the put. Assignment means the contract is exercised and you, the short seller, are responsible for paying 100 x strike price in cash and will receive 100 shares in exchange. Thus the similarity to a limit order to buy to open 100 shares.\n\nFirst, your replace the 95, 90, and 85 limit orders with CSPs at those strike prices. You obtain $3, $2 and $1 (per share) of cash credit, respectively, for each of those sell-to-open CSP positions. That's the \"premium income\" they were referring to. You'd sell to open puts with 60 days to expiration. \n\nNow let's say that in the next 20 days, the stock gradually falls to 80, like we did with your limit order scheme. Guess what happens next?\n\nNothing.\n\n**Just because a stock goes below the strike price of a CSP doesn't mean anything happens, particularly with 40ish days to expiration.** Puts are rarely assigned early, which means that unless the stock price is in the assignment zone right around expiration, your put doesn't do anything but sit there.\n\nBut even if they are assigned early, you **still** book an unrealized loss, because just like the limit orders, if you are paying 95/share for something that is only worth 80/share, you have a -15/share loss. The only difference is that the $3/share of premium you collected offsets that loss a little.\n\nWhere the CSP scheme pays off is if the stock *only goes up*. Your limit orders do absolutely nothing for you in that case, while the CSP scheme pays you $6/share of cash total that you get to keep after the 60 day expiration. But if you are expecting the stock to only go up, why set limit orders so low in the first place?\n\nSo that's why the CSP scheme is not a replacement for your limit order scheme. It would be different if you were setting your limit orders for a much narrower time frame, like 1 or 2 days. Then CSPs, with only 2 days to expiration, might behave more closely to limit orders. But 60 days? Not even close.\n\nTo say nothing of the opportunity cost. Opening a CSP costs 100% of the assignment value (strike price x 100 per option) up front. A limit order costs you nothing.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This makes sense, thank you.

Aliens land and they’re like, “What’s up, Neanderthals?” and the Neanderthals are all like, “Whoa, aliens!” And then they get into a fight, it’s crazy, man! But then, like, in the midst of all the chaos, some of the aliens and Neanderthals start breakdancing, it’s like, whoa, what a turn of events!
