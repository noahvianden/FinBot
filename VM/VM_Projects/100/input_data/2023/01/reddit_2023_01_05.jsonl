But the new year will likely be the one of “recovery”, a D.A. Davidson analyst said in a note this morning.\n\nMicrosoft stock could climb to $270\n\nOn Thursday, Gil Luria recommended that investors buy Microsoft stock at the current discount as it has upside to $270, which translates to a more than 20% increase from here.\n\nHe’s bullish primarily on the tech behemoth’s $1.0 billion investment in OpenAI – an artificial intelligence research lab that operates “ChatGPT”.   \n\nMicrosoft’s investment in OpenAI will translate to significant underappreciated upside. Longer-term, incorporating ChatGPT into Bing may provide MSFT with a once-a-decade opportunity to unseat Google’s Search dominance.\n\nA day earlier, “The Information” said Microsoft was working with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT into its flagship search engine.\n\nOpenAI investment to benefit Azure as well\n\nInterestingly, the D.A. Davidson analyst doesn’t expect OpenAI to benefit “Bing” only. In fact, Azure – its cloud platform stands to benefit just as much from the said investment. His note reads:\n\nWe’ve heard estimates between $250 million to $1.0 billion annual run rate of expenses at OpenAI, much of which is being spent on Azure. We expect those levels to increase significantly with the introduction of GPT 4.0 later this year and the many product offshoots that’ll link to OpenAI via APIs.\n\nIn just over a month of its launch, ChatGPT has surpassed 1.0 million in terms of user count. Luria is also convinced that the multinational is well-positioned to weather an economic downturn (find out more).\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed firm is set to report its Q2 results later this month.

Elon has shown very poor judgment over the past few months in terms of communication regarding Tesla, and defending Tesla's business reputation.  He cannot continue to go unchecked. \n\nI haven't entirely made up my mind about whether he should stay as CEO.  No doubt that his vision and persistence was a critical factor in Tesla's survival as a startup company.  But the skills needed to keep a startup alive, and the skills necessary to go from mid-stage to mature, are not always the same. \n\nI am skeptical that Tesla's brand can be un-tarnished as long as Elon is the face of the company.  \n\nIf Elon is to stay as CEO (and that is a big if, from me), I would want:\n\n* strong, written reporting from the board as to Tesla's organizational structure, \n* a statement from them that Elon's personal political views do not reflect those of Tesla as a corporation.  \n* The company should conduct a study to determine the impact of Elon's political statements, if any, and whether he can effectively be CEO if he wants to continue antagonizing a large segment of the consumer base.  \n* Also, there needs to be some kind of explanation of how Elon's responsibilities at Tesla are not impacted by his activities at Twitter.  \n* Finally, I'd want to see some rules on share sales.  No other CEO dumps stock like this at random, for vanity purchases.  \n\nI have no objection to Elon staying in a role at Tesla as \"Technoking and Chief Product Architect\".  \n\nIn conclusion: the undisciplined horseshit has to stop.  In a vacuum, I might find Elon's antics funny, but in the context of a successful, growing business, it's no longer acceptable.  Tesla has a mission.

Not sure if he has what it takes to get his focus and obsession back to tesla, as it seems like one of the farthest things from his mind. \n\nBest case scenario is probably him as ceo in name only.

And that the warranty liability isn't going to be too bad.  You have to realize if you are car maker and making a million of certain vehicle, it doesn't take that much to create a massive headache.  Like take an extreme example: the Ford Pinto debacle.  Of the 1.5 million vehicles that were recalled, there was like 30 where death was attributable to the design of the fuel tank.  Rightly so there was a huge uproar.

Lastly, the low P/E is due to **low margins**. Low margins means that you only make money if something doesn't go wrong. When you have high margins (like Tesla), you have a TON of wiggle room, so you get a higher P/E for all the reasons I just mentioned, but the most obvious one is growth vs. decline. \n\nAnother sidepoint about recalls - every single Ford recall was significantly more expensive than Tesla's. They have a real problem with warranty costs. Every recall requires customers to bring cars back to the dealer. The vast majority of 'recalls' for Tesla is done with over-the-air updates.

But more importantly, Ford will be selling that Lightning at a loss for years, whereas Tesla will be selling the Cybertruck for a very high margin. Long term that is a very difficult thing for Ford to contend with. The best they can hope is to slowly burn cash while they improve their costs and vertically integrate over the next 5 years, and hope that for some reason Tesla doesn't improve that much over the same period of time.
