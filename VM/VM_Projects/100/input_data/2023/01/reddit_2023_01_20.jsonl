The stock market doesn’t move on absolutes. It moves on expectations. For Ally analysts were expecting an EPS of 0.98 and revenue of 2.06 and so their stock was priced accordingly.

The idea that every new piece of information reprices on a purely relative basis to the previous price is false. The implication of believing this is that you also believe prices are always rational and so if a piece of news comes out, it's reasonable for the stock to move up or down purely on the impact of that news. This is what they teach you in intro level economics classes in school. That the market is a perfect discounting mechanism, etc.\n\nOf course, we know this wrong. Assets of all types are frequently mispriced. You have only to look at the tech space over the past year to see it. Valuations haven't collapsed in line with changing fundamentals. Valuations have collapsed because people looked around and said, you know what, none of these companies are worth what they are trading for. For many of them, not even close.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No I’m not talking about relative pricing. I’m talking about fundamentals. Ally, or any stock, will have an estimated intrinsic value based on EPS/revenue growth (set by the company and analysts). If that amount of growth changes then this estimated intrinsic value will also change. The price will swing based on this intrinsic value change - often it will under and overshoot and that is where mispricing occurs that retail can take advantage of.\n\nYou can see this with numerous stocks that once grew and then stalled - Tesla and Meta for example. Tesla grew rapidly so its intrinsic value also grew, but its stock price way overshot. So now, even though growth is still decent, the price is coming down due to missed expectations. Meta has now over-corrected and is priced for zero growth. \n\nWith Ally it was at a very cheap valuation pre-earnings and even post-earnings it is still under book value. Any positive surprise is going to swing price towards its actual value (which, in this case, is up).\n\nI can’t tell you the timeframe, but generally price will converge with value eventually.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thus we should look at guidance and not the earnings themselves.

If you look at forward curves for thermal or met coal pricing into 2023/2024, they are still very high.

{"title": "Google Cutting 12,000 Jobs in 6% Slash to Global Workforce", "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-20/google-cutting-12-000-jobs-in-6-slash-to-global-workforce\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet Inc. said it will cut about 12,000 jobs, more than 6% of its global workforce, becoming the latest tech giant to retrench after years of abundant growth and hiring.\n\nThe cuts will affect jobs globally and across the entire company, Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai told employees in an email on Friday, writing that he takes “full responsibility for the decisions that led us here.”\n\nWith the layoffs, Google joins a host of other tech giants that have drastically scaled back operations amid a faltering global economy and soaring inflation. Meta Platforms Inc., Twitter Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have all slashed their ranks. Thanks to a resilient search business, Google has been one of the longest tech holdouts avoiding major workforce reductions. But the company is dealing with a slowdown in digital advertising and its cloud-computing division continues to trail Amazon and Microsoft Corp. \n\n“These are important moments to sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base, and direct our talent and capital to our highest priorities,” Pichai wrote in the email. \n\nHe said the company has a “substantial opportunity in front of us” with artificial intelligence, a key investment area where Google is facing a surge in recent competition. \n\nIn October, the company reported earnings and revenue that missed analyst expectations. Profit declined 27% to $13.9 billion compared to the prior year. At the time, Pichai said Google would curb its expenses and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the number of new jobs would fall by more than half in the fourth quarter from the previous period.\n\nGoogle’s reduction in headcount follows investor pressure to adopt a more aggressive strategy to curb spending. In November, TCI Fund Management Ltd. urged the internet search giant in an open letter to publicly set a target for profit margins, increase share buybacks and reduce losses in its portfolio of Other Bets, Alphabet’s moonshot division. “The company has too many employees and the cost per employee is too high,” TCI Managing Director Chris Hohn said, noting that Alphabet’s headcount had swelled 20% per year since 2017.\n\nAccording to the human-resources consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., the most job cuts in 2022 were in the tech sector — 97,171 for the year, up 649% compared to the previous year.\n\nGoogle has made a series of cost-cutting moves in recent months, canceling the next generation of its Pixelbook laptop and permanently shuttering Stadia, its cloud gaming service. Earlier in January, Verily, a biotech unit of Alphabet, said it was cutting 15% of its staff. \n\nPichai said Alphabet would be paying affected employees 16 weeks of severance and six months worth of health benefits in the US, with other regions receiving packages based on local laws and practices.", "id": "10gtnwd", "created_utc": 1674210870.0, "score": 2124, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 594, "comments": [{"body": "One of my friends in NYC told me his entire graphic design team got invited to a last minute meeting Friday morning.

Even Sundar low key acknowledged that there was a culture of being 'rested and vested'.\n\nBullish news for the company IMO", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "The original culture at Google was not to be shareholder focused. That's why they used to not give guidance and the quarterly earnings call always had this tone of \"this is what we're doing, get on board or go somewhere else.\" It's also why Larry, Sergey, and Eric retained majority control of the company. And this served Google well for many years.\n\nPeople complain that Google lost it's spark about 8-10 years ago and this is true. What happened was that it started moving from an employee focused company to a financial one. It really came to a head when the focus shifted to profitability and cutting costs. Many innovative products that were in incubation internally were cut. Profit chasing top down direction started to become the norm (G+). And, they hired Ruth, who soon became the CEO behind the scenes because the board liked her (her background is finance). Within 2 years of Ruth starting, all of the execs changed their tone. Urs, for example was always a jerk, but he was usually right and his arguments were focused on the tech. Now, he was still a jerk, but the focus was \"efficiency.\" Whether a solution was right technically didn't carry as much weight as it used to. He himself seemed uncomfortable with this new environment...\n\nWhile Google did a great job of retaining it's charm with the free lunches, nice offices, and such, the innovation was gone. It became impossible to get good ideas off the ground and once the shift started, word got out and soon the company became known by the best in the business as a way to get your feet under you, then leverage that experience to create a start up. Google, once famous for employing the likes of Guido Van Rossum, Ken Thompson, and Vint Cerf was no longer interested in retaining and supporting this sort of talent. So many amazing teams and engineers came and went, frustrated that they couldn't get the support they needed.\n\nWhere has this led Google? Well, look no further than OpenAI, a serious threat to their search business, founded by former Googlers who left because they got fed up with the company. These guys are smart. VERY SMART. Like you have no idea how good they are at what they do. To have a team like that leave in frustration is just unacceptable, but the internal struggles between old school Google search and the new ML solutions were real, so the team left.\n\nThis is all moot now, but there was no reason for the board to push the company in the way they did. The changes that were made over the past decade or so have sucked the life out of the company and it all started when things were going very well. But that wasn't good enough. Despite Google's success, investors were frustrated. Google didn't lay people off in 2008 and in fact they did the opposite and hired more people and built out more aggressively. HOW DARE THEY?! WHY DON'T THEY LISTEN TO THE BOARD?! So here we are, another great company potentially ruined by corporate greed.\n\nLook, there's more at play here than Google and other corporations. These boom/bust cycles are very profitable for certain folks. They must see these corporations fall in line and to have large companies buck the trend is NOT OK. So, they tear it down. It was fun while it lasted, I guess. There was a time where working for Google was a badge of honor. They stuck it to the man and focused on what was right for the individuals. A true meritocracy ran by people who were themselves engineers and industry experts. Not so much these days. Now they have a puppet CEO with a banker pulling the strings behind the scenes. Guess, I'll go back to responding to my friends on chat who just found out they don't have a job. Oh, and they can't find one either b/c everyone in tech froze hiring, but let's all pretend like this isn't a ploy to suppress wages just like all those D&I efforts weren't either...\n\nBut at least we may get stock buybacks, I guess.

Had it continued to gap down for a few weeks, I think that would have been the bottom.\n\n We've seen a forward PE of about 15 at sp500, using consensus forward PE at the time (the consensus 12 month forward operating earnings have dropped by around 2% since then). This also happened in June, but of course June's forward earnings consensus was higher than in Oct. This is slightly cheap, but definitely not fire sale level. No one knows the trough of forward earnings, but sp500 will generally bottom before earnings reach its trough. Historically sp500 have bottomed at ranges between  8-15 (too lazy to check the actual range). I will pick consensus forward PE of around 14 to be conservative and not miss the bottom. If you use a guesstimate of where the forward operating earnings will bottom at, I think you will have to use a higher PE multiple, at least 16+. So while the valuation got slightly cheap, I don't think it was enticing enough to truly be at the bottom. \n\nWith all this said, if you believe the US will not enter an economic recession, it's conceivable that 3500 sp500 was the bottom. Though not super compelling, 3500 sp500 could be a reasonable valuation for a flat earnings growth year. Also, even if you don't enter an economic recession but profit margins compress significantly, which is what fed Brainard wants, you could also see sub 3500 sp500 at the bottom. But if you believe the US will enter a recession, even a mild one, 3500 was way too high of a valuation to be the bottom. I'd say at the highest 3400, and much more likely to be quite lower.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Most of what you describe has happened already, just not the the absolut extreme you \"predict\". The big difference to the GFC is that today, a) ETFs make up a significant portion of the market and b) there are much more people in the market. This props up the multiple of all equities by some, hence it makes no sense to state that we need to return to below shiller PE to hit bottom. The shiller PE rises over the decades as more people are onboarded. Shiller PE mean is therefore lifted substantially. Almost everything except many consumer staple value stocks are cheap right now. It is the exact same situation as always, stuff is cheap but people want it cheaper and they come up with x reasons why it is going to get cheaper. Maybe it is and your return will be greater, maybe its not and your return will be smaller.\n\nI think it doesnt make sense to look at historic indicators of bear markets because the entire market is different today. Even macro is different. One would have to look back more than 40 years to find a remotely similar situation, even though a lot of factors are still different today. In 10, 20, 30 years does it really matter if you bought at 3800, 3600 or 3400?

Shiller PE is a hugely backward looking and should never be used when the economy is transitioning between cycles. Furthermore, because there was so much demand brought forward during COVID, and that is a fact, using any backward looking metric is guaranteed to look \"cheap\". It's only cheap if you assume things will keep going the way it went, which is clearly not the case. We've already seen tech companies hugely guide down their forward earnings. Everyone assumed they could keep growing rapidly like they did during COVID, although slightly lower. \n\nI said consensus forward operating earnings PE. And I'm only using PE because I dont want to go over dcf valuation on Reddit, but the DCF valuation also says more or less the same, although I'd never use dcf to predict a bottom, because everyone knows the bottom always overshoot fair value. Using multiples is a very lazy way of masking all the underlying factors in valuation that have changed in the last 15 years. And why are you bringing in only GFC? All of your reasons were regurgitated in 2022 by everyone on Reddit, saying stocks usually rise when fed hike rate and such, but at the end of the day valuation matters. If the risk free rate goes up by 3% in 8 months, there's gonna be a huge repricing. In fact, a large portion of the drop in 2022 was purely caused by the repricing of 10 year rate. \n\nBtw, before you say no one can predict the future, any sort of valuation you do on companies or sp500 requires you to predict the future in some way, either on future earnings, growth rate, etc. CEO, big banks must constantly try to predict the economic future and manage their risks accordingly. \n\nDoes it matter if you bought in at 30-40 percent discount? Sure it does if you have decades of savings. Using your argument, I actually wouldn't have cash right now since I never would have sold at 4800, so it's kinda pointless. It doesn't matter if you're 23 and have basically 0 savings, but not everyone is like that despite the very common assumptions by all redditors. Also, everyone says this time is different before every recession. What's different? How does that difference impact my prediction? I can use that same argument to say maybe sp500 won't go up. Maybe it'll stay stagnant for decades, or even go down, since this time is different right? After all, the assumption that sp500 will go up are all based on historical trends, and if you're assuming valuation doesn't matter, and this time is different, there's really not a reason to why sp500 should go up.\n\nYou're saying the increase of passive investing causes the market to be more overvalued (propped up multiples) than historical trend. Doesn't that negate the core beliefs of passive investing, which is for the most part the market is efficient and fairly priced, and there's very little edge active investing can gain?  By the way, I've taken that into account, which is why all my numbers were much more conservative and less bad than what I'd normally expect in a typical recession.", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "It seems like with all the money on the sidelines we may be stuck in this phase for years.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The money on the sidelines will be spent up by the middle of this year, especially if the layoffs accelerate.

Regardless of what Musk wanted to do, it's entirely possible for the deal to fall through even under the best circumstances. Investors can't take an intention to make a deal as the same thing as a deal being guarenteed and sue for losses if it doesn't happen\n* Musk wasn't the only factor affecting the stock price and/or option prices. If there are other things influencing whether the stock price goes up or down, at least as much as Musk's tweets, then it wouldn't seem like blaming Musk for 100% of the losses would make sense\n* Musk said other things during this time besides \"funding secured\" and those things might have moved the stock more than claiming \"funding secured\". Even if we assume Musk was lying about the funding, if he really was considering taking Tesla private, then it seems rational to assume that that could have a huge impact on the stock and options prices\n\nI believe most experts expect Musk's lawyers to go after the last one. It seems pretty reasonable that even if Musk had never tweeted \"funding secured\" and had just said he was considering taking Tesla private, that there would've been a lot of movement in the stock and options market.

{"title": "Cathie Wood says she’s as bullish on Tesla as she’s ever been, sees stock up fivefold in 5 years", "selftext": "Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood said her conviction in Tesla remains strong as ever as she kept buying the dip in the electric vehicle company.\n\n“Just from electric vehicles there could be... it is almost a fivefold increase in this stock during the next five years,” Wood said during an investor webinar on Thursday. “And if you believe autonomous at all, it’s closer to 13 times during the next five years. So we are as bullish about Tesla as we have ever been.”\n\nWood previously predicted that the shift to electric vehicles will be drastic, resulting in 60 million EVs sold in five years. The innovation investor has been a longtime Tesla bull, seeing shares hitting a split-adjusted level above $1,500 by 2026. Shares of Tesla are up about 3% this year, ending Thursday’s session at $127.17.\n\nElon Musk’s company has experienced a slew of bad news as of late. Tesla’s December sales of China-made cars fell to the lowest level in five months amid the country’s Covid outbreak. Musk’s rocky $44 billion Twitter takeover might have also contributed to the decline as he sold tens of billions of dollars of his Tesla shares last year to help finance the buyout.\n\n“Tesla moved down in the fourth quarter, had a dramatic rerating as the capitulation in the growth strategies was highlighted,” Wood said. “The disappointments in China were well telegraphed.”\n\nTesla dropped 53% in the fourth quarter, bringing its 2022 losses to 65%.\n\nThe widely followed fund manager has been buying the beaten down carmaker for a few months during the sell-off. Wood revealed Thursday that she took some profits in Exact Sciences and put much of those profits into Tesla.\n\nTesla has made big price cuts on its vehicles, first in China and then, on Jan. 13, in the U.S. and Europe. Wood said the aggressive price reductions will help the company stay competitive.\n\n“Tesla is going to be very aggressive in pricing,” Wood said. “Tesla can afford to do this. It’s got the lowest cost structure and is innovating we believe the most aggressively. The other auto manufacturers are going to compete.
