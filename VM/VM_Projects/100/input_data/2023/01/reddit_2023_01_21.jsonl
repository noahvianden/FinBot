The tension between him and democrats was building ever since opening the California Tesla factory after the first set of covid lockdowns(around the time when Texas and Florida were opening up, but California and New York were going draconian). In parallel to that, there was some tension over him being anti union. This led to things like Biden not inviting Tesla to the EV summit, which Elon disliked and publicly called out. Tesla put self driving in people’s minds, and Elon overpromised FSD delivery date, and eventually was the first to release the beta to the average person. To absolutely no one’s surprise, every single crash was highly publicized(and will continue to, even long after self driving is safer than humans), which made Tesla look irresponsible, despite most cases being due to distracted drivers.\n\nIt’s not clear what exactly went down between him and politicians, but all the aforementioned clearly led to a lot of nastiness. Government probably fucked with him with investigations, regulatory reviews, dragging out permits, etc. and he kept poking the politicians. Media being heavily with democrats, always reported on this in a bad light, and Elon in turn kept hitting back. This eventually culminated to Elon saying democrats are very nasty and he’s done supporting them or doing things in democrat controlled states.\n\nThis is about where attacks on him went into overdrive. Then Twitter purchase happened and the overdrive went into overdrive. Nonstop hit pieces were/are a regular thing, and the Twitter purchase is certainly cannon fodder.

{"title": "Apple's business is simply an earnings machine. ROC comparison: Apple (23.7%) vs. Alphabet (12.3%) vs. Amazon (5.7%)", "selftext": "Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity\n\nOver the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.\n\nThe reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.\n\nInvestors, however, don't seem to have believed him.\n\nFrom worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buying opportunity.\n\nThe China Worry\n\nApple has faced down a multitude of investor worries regarding its relationship with China. Apple has been accused of being too cozy with China, of making secret deals with China, of having its supply chain being too exposed to China, and of being cowardly when it comes to China.\n\nWhile the veracity of these claims are better left to other authors, we don't think we're overstepping by saying that China has been made into a bogeyman for Apple investors. Apple has arguably done better than almost any other American corporation at walking the fine line that western companies must navigate in order to successfully do business in China.\n\nThe current top-of-mind China worries for Apple investors, however, are supply-chain issues and questions surrounding lockdowns and China's notorious zero-COVID policy. As long as the country is locking up millions of its citizens in forced isolation, things will be difficult for Apple.\n\nInvestors were delivered good news recently, then, when Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials were scaling back COVID lockdowns, potentially re-opening the economy at a much faster pace than expected. Importantly, Vice Premier Hiu Le told an audience at Davos that Beijing's focus this year would be on \"boosting domestic demand.\"\n\nIn other words, we believe that Chinese leadership's struggles with large scale problems such as population decline and slumping economic growth make it less likely to rock the boat with Apple, at least in the near term.\n\nAll of this bodes well for Apple's business in China, which beat analyst estimates last quarter with $15.6 billion in revenue. Apple further stands to gain in the near term from the collapse of the U.S. dollar's 2022 rally.\n\nA strong dollar reduces a company's international sales because when revenues are recorded in dollars (as Apple's are), they must be converted. When one Yuan converts to fewer and fewer dollars, the effects on the income statement quickly mount. Thus, the dollar's recent decline is good news for Apple and American companies conducting business overseas in general. The easing of FX headwinds should give Apple's international sales--and Chinese sales in particular--a welcome boost.\n\nA Robust Product Pipeline\n\nSteve Jobs is rumored to have said at one point that Tim Cook wasn't \"a product guy.\" The long line of releases that Apple has in store for 2023 would probably beg to differ.\n\nOnly three weeks into the new year, Apple has already re-launched its HomePod product as well as a slew of new Mac variations. A full list of potential releases can be found here, but amidst the rumors of an Apple Car, something else very interesting has emerged--an Apple VR headset, reportedly ready for launch this year.\n\nThis is the product that, we think, should keep Mark Zuckerberg awake at night. Meta (META) has been at the forefront of the VR headset realm for some time since it purchased Oculus in 2014. Widespread adoption of the technology, however, has been a bit slow to catch on, which could have something to do with the fact that Meta is not principally a hardware company.\n\nApple, of course doesn't have this problem. If the product does in fact launch in 2023, we expect that it will be maniacally engineered and deliver a user experience unmatched by current technology. Combine this with Apple's dedicated user base and app ecosystem, as well as Apple's influence with developers, and it's quite possible to envision Apple launching VR adoption into the mainstream.\n\nHistory is on our side with this claim. At its launch the iPad was met with a notorious level of criticism. Many companies had attempted to create a tablet in previous years (including Apple--remember the Newton?), but just couldn't quite pull it off. The Apple Watch, too, was met with similar skepticism.\n\nIn short, if anyone can pull off a VR coup, we believe Apple can.\n\nA Compelling Valuation\n\nOver the past five years, Apple's stock has maintained a fairly consistent relationship to forward EBITDA.\n\nOverlaid against each other, the stock has consistently tracked above forward EBITDA estimates. In 2022, estimates began to flatten as inflation took hold and recession fears set in and the relationship reversed, with the stock price falling beneath forward EBITDA. We believe that the current inversion of this historical relationship presents an attractive opportunity for investors. This reflects our belief that Apple's stock won't be stuck in the doldrums forever.\n\nAnalysts, too, believe that Apple has better days ahead.\n\nOf the 45 analysts estimates tracked, the average price target is $168.82. With its current price of $135, Apple has an almost 25% upside to its consensus target.\n\nNormally we take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but an interesting pattern seems to emerge in the lower pane of the above chart--each time Apple's stock price slumps causing the distance between price and target price to exceed 20%, the stock tends to respond to the upside.\n\nSome investors may agree up to this point but wonder--why, in the face of rising interest rates, does Apple continue to deserve such a premium valuation? Shouldn't Apple, at some point, be affected by the same gravity that has pulled down the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) in the last year?\n\nWe're glad you asked, because a piece of the Apple puzzle that we believe is under-reported is the company's sheer efficiency. Apple's business is simply an earnings machine, reporting world-class returns on capital quarter after quarter.\n\n\nIn the last 10 years, Apple has averaged an eye-popping 23.7% quarterly return on capital, and performance over the past two years has been even stronger. For reference, we prefer return on capital over other metrics such as return on equity since ROC can be directly compared to a company's estimated cost of capital. Comparing those two figures is helpful in inferring the profitability and sustainability of a business.\n\nNow, just for kicks, let's compare Apple's reported ROC with Alphabet and Amazon.\n\nIt isn't even close. Compared with Apple's 23.7% ROC, Alphabet's average quarterly ROC over 10 years was 12.3% (the bars in white), while Amazon's was 5.7% (the bars in red).\n\nApple really is that good.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIn sum, we believe that Apple shares present a highly compelling opportunity for investors.\n\nApple's business is world-class, with best-in-industry returns on capital that continue to justify a premium valuation.\n\nFears about China--including FX headwinds--may dissipate or prove less impactful than feared.\nApple continues to innovate and is expected to bring fresh products to market in 2023.\n\nThere currently exists a price-EBITDA discrepancy which could present a compelling entry or position building point.\n\nWe believe a price of $165 for Apple is a fair target. That price represents a 24x multiple on estimated 2024 earnings, which is well within the stock's historical multiple trading range. We believe the premium multiple is justified for the reasons outlined above.", "id": "10hueqy", "created_utc": 1674316790.0, "score": 1201, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 204, "comments": [{"body": "The market cap is just so huge takes a lot to move now.", "score": 258, "replies": [{"body": "Also, my several year old iPad works just fine for surfing Reddit.", "score": 82, "replies": [{"body": "I don't like Apple in many aspects, but they absolutely nailed the iPad Pro. \n\nThat thing is worth every cent and more.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Until they reinstate software CPU throttling.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Fr or software battery life nuking", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "It continues to grow double digits.

{"title": "Google is panicking! Google Calls In Help From Larry Page and Sergey Brin for A.I. Fight", "selftext": "A rival chatbot has shaken Google out of its routine, with the founders who left three years ago re-engaging and more than 20 A.I. projects in the works.\n\nLast month, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s founders, held several meetings with company executives. The topic: a rival’s new chatbot, a clever A.I. product that looked as if it could be the first notable threat in decades to Google’s $149 billion search business.\n\nMr. Page and Mr. Brin, who had not spent much time at Google since they left their daily roles with the company in 2019, reviewed Google’s artificial intelligence product strategy, according to two people with knowledge of the meetings who were not allowed to discuss them. They approved plans and pitched ideas to put more chatbot features into Google’s search engine. And they offered advice to company leaders, who have put A.I. front and center in their plans.\n\nThe re-engagement of Google’s founders, at the invitation of the company’s current chief executive, Sundar Pichai, emphasized the urgency felt among many Google executives about artificial intelligence and that chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nThe bot, which was released by the small San Francisco company OpenAI two months ago, amazed users by simply explaining complex concepts and generating ideas from scratch. More important to Google, it looked as if it could offer a new way to search for information on the internet.\n\nThe new A.I. technology has shaken Google out of its routine. Mr. Pichai declared a “code red,” upending existing plans and jump-starting A.I. development. Google now intends to unveil more than 20 new products and demonstrate a version of its search engine with chatbot features this year, according to a slide presentation reviewed by The New York Times and two people with knowledge of the plans who were not authorized to discuss them.\n\nAt the same time, Alphabet is scaling back its work force. On Friday, the company said it would cut about 12,000 jobs after a hiring spree during the pandemic and amid concerns of a slowing economy. The layoffs were designed “to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company,” Mr. Pichai wrote in a note to employees.\n\nThis is a moment of significant vulnerability for Google,” said D. Sivakumar, a former Google research director who helped found a start-up called Tonita, which makes search technology for e-commerce companies. “ChatGPT has put a stake in the ground, saying, ‘Here’s what a compelling new search experience could look like.’” Mr. Sivakumar added that Google had overcome previous challenges and could deploy its arsenal of A.I. to stay competitive.\n\nSince stepping back from day-to-day duties, Mr. Page and Mr. Brin have taken a laissez-faire approach to Google, two people familiar with the matter said. They have let Mr. Pichai run the company and its parent company, Alphabet, while they have pursued other projects, such as flying car start-ups and disaster relief efforts.\n\nTheir visits to the company’s Silicon Valley offices in the last few years have mostly been to check in on the so-called moonshot projects that Alphabet calls “Other Bets,” one person said. Until recently, they have not been very involved with the search engine.\n\nBut they have long been keen on bringing A.I. into Google’s products. Vic Gundotra, a former senior vice president at Google, recounted that he gave Mr. Page a demonstration of a new Gmail feature around 2008. But Mr. Page was unimpressed by the effort, asking, “Why can’t it automatically write that email for you?” In 2014, Google also acquired DeepMind, a leading A.I. research lab based in London.\n\nBut several new companies, including You.com and Perplexity.ai, are already offering online search engines that let you ask questions through an online chatbot, much like ChatGPT. Microsoft is also working on a new version of its Bing search engine that would include similar technology, according to a report from The Information.\n\nGoogle Calls In Help From Larry Page and Sergey Brin for A.I.

I sold mostly SPY, TSLA, QQQ, and few AMC, TQQQ, and GME.  The majority of the puts that I sold expired worthless.  However, during the period from May to early July, many of the puts sold were actually exercised and I had to purchase numerous shares of SPY and TSLA.  Overall, in the year, I made $17069.  I would typically sell options about two months out and collecting lower premiums so that the chance of the options exercising are lower.  I sold a few AMC options that were about one year out with a strike price of only 50 cents, which netted about $600 utilizing about $10,000 of leverage.  Although, these strategies could backfire, I am wondering why more people are not selling options for premium?  In contrast, I had a rental property that was in a rough area and decided to sell it for a 1031 exchange in a nicer area.  The replacement property has less headaches, but with the higher interest rates, I am not breaking even and in fact losing about $300 a month.

I’ve been trading on and off for about 15 years and used to work in financial technology (quantitative trading). \n\n2020 were insane returns because VIX was so high: about 60% with hundreds of profitable trades. \n\n2021 were smaller returns because of the bull market: about 8% (didn’t beat the market, but sharpe ratio was high.)  \n\n2022, I didn’t trade much. \n\n2023, I’m back in the market and anticipating something like a 20-30% return this year. \n\nWhile I like my strategy and it performs really well in higher VIX environments, I constantly think about putting time into building out a significant RE portfolio. \n\nBenefits to RE when things work:\n\n1. Cash flow\n2. Depreciation (can be hugely important depending on your income streams and if you can do accelerated depreciation against other liquidity events)\n3. Appreciation \n4. Equity - tenants paying down mortgage \n\nOn paper, and when you have other income streams for depreciation, I think total realized/unrealized returns for a moderately successful RE investment could be more like 25% when you combine all of those things together. \n\nThe reason why I haven’t done it, though, and why I’m really interested in this post is because of the real life experiences of being a RE landlord.

What I am about to share comes from various sources which are unconfirmed and just random ass people and my tying them all together. If the lack of anything definitive and unsubstantiated rumors bothers you, stop reading. \n\nSure, there’s a big chance all of this is fake but I believe parts of it will happen, if not all of it. It makes too much sense. \n\nI started writing this at 3am and it doesn’t flow as nicely as I’d like but I’m just trying to dump some info. \n\n**My theory: In Q2, Tesla will announce LR and P (Ludicrous) versions of 3 (and maybe Y but prob just 3,) will now have 400-miles of range and likely some other upgrades.** \n\nPrices for those will go back up. This is the reason tesla mostly stopped selling LR3. They know that if they introduced a new, 400-mile 3 one day that all the recent buyers would be angry. This way, the people buying 3s now won’t be able to be as angry because they got smoking deals with the current price cuts and the new ones will be more expensive. \n\nHere is a rumor from one of the megapack gigachads - [https://twitter.com/jpsartre\\_noexit/status/1616967623664885760?s=46&t=W9v2axE24K\\_IyIX5w\\_L-Rg](https://twitter.com/jpsartre_noexit/status/1616967623664885760?s=46&t=W9v2axE24K_IyIX5w_L-Rg) \n\n*“But the standard range will be likely same as current long range, software delineated* \n\n*My guess is the Standard range will be current “long range mileage” @ $53k*\n\n*The new long range will get to almost 400miles & MYP”*\n\nWe know Highland 3 is coming. When pics of that first leaked, a random Reddit commenter who in other comments says he’s an employee and he shares a lot of info that leads me to believe he is an employee said, “Finally! It’s been gonna be ludicrous when it comes out,” which corroborates the idea that higher tier 3s are coming. \n\nEmployee comment about Ludicrous 3: [https://reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/zcblt9/\\_/iywqny8/?context=1](https://reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/zcblt9/_/iywqny8/?context=1) \n\nOther comments about 3 from him: \n\n[https://reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/z743aa/\\_/iy6i92u/?context=1](https://reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/z743aa/_/iy6i92u/?context=1) \n\n[https://reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/z7187w/\\_/iy6iwby/?context=1](https://reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/comments/z7187w/_/iy6iwby/?context=1) \n\nDiscussing working for Elon: \n\n[https://reddit.com/r/SpaceXMasterrace/comments/ys3ldv/\\_/ivyr5zt/?context=1](https://reddit.com/r/SpaceXMasterrace/comments/ys3ldv/_/ivyr5zt/?context=1) \n\nDiscussing working for multiple Elon companies:\n\n[https://reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/yiq2fr/\\_/iulhtes/?context=1](https://reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/yiq2fr/_/iulhtes/?context=1) \n\nCould that reddit user be fake? Sure, but for the sake of my DD, I want to be leaf.\n\nA refreshed, ludicrous 3 and LR 3 with near 400-miles of range and faster charging due to 4680s would allow Tesla to bring back higher prices for those variants and then they could play around with the other tiers that sit below it. The BMW I4 M50 has better high end speed than a P3D and has beaten it in the quarter mile. This is not ok and Tesla will reclaim the spot atop fastest EV in its class with a refreshed, Ludicrous 3. \n\nJP (megapack brah) also said his source tells him something “big” is coming for 3. This would be something big and it lines up with some of the reddit comments by the alleged employee. We’ve seen the sales data. We hear the reports that competition, especially in China is compelling enough that Tesla needs to improve the 3 to ensure the value proposition separates Tesla from everyone else.\n\nThis could allow SR vehicles with 275 - 300 miles of range to retain current prices or allow them to drop prices even more on a RWD 3. \n\nA new lineup with a 400-mile-range LR and P 3, plus SR versions with killer prices (maybe lower than where we are now) and close to 300-mile range would help keep margins high, help keep interest in the 3 and would help units fly.\n\nRumor recently that a retail store employee told someone that the “old prices” would be coming back at the end of the quarter. Can’t find the tweet but I know the lounge talked about it recently. This could easily be the new 400-mile range LR and P variants and tesla keeps these current lower prices for SR vehicles. \n\nRumor that Tesla has been stockpiling 4680 packs. I think Joe Tegmeyer (spelling?) has footage of stacks of 4680 structural packs recently. I’d assume these would be needed for the 400-mile-range 3s.\n\nEveryone has been very confused as to why Tesla hasn’t said more about how it will handle the tax credit. This theory would explain it all. Tesla can’t come out and say all this ish; otherwise, it’d cannibalize sales. JP also said his source tells him they want to get a 3 down to low 30s after tax credit with giga castings/structural pack.\n\nBy introducing a higher range, refreshed 3, tesla could likely have the 3 price start at like $38,000 before tax credit for RWD SR and then price the new ludicrous version perhaps back up over $70,000. \n\nThis new lineup would basically shit all over competition. Entry level 3s would be better than some of the highest tier cars from the competition for a massively lower price. They could price the LR and P variants much higher to keep demand in check knowing that 4680 packs, if these use 4680s, are not coming out as fast as they’d like. Meanwhile, they continue to push as many units as possible of the lesser trims. \n\nTesla could even decrease the range of the SR vehicles to be like 250 miles or maybe even a bit less to help we the resale value of current LR and P owners. The brand new ones would have longer range and other new things, current gen LR and P who saw their resale value dive  with the price cuts could sit above the lower-range SR vehicles to create a new “middle” price range between the LR and P 3 and the lower range SR vehicles. \n\n**TLDR: Tesla may have a 400-mile-range LR and Ludicrous 3 coming. Entry level, gigacasted and structural pack 3 targeted for low $30,000s after tax credit. STONKY GONNA BE HAPPY!**\n\n**Perhaps, the Gen 3 platform is actually this refreshed 3 and the Robotaxi is technically Gen 4.** This would explain the investor meeting March 1st. They would introduce new vehicles and change pricing structure which would line up with the rumors of prices changing at end of the quarter.\n\nThe other thing I didn’t bring up is the Tom Zhu factor. My guess is Elon told him he needs him to ramp the refreshed 3 like he ramped Shanghai initially. \n\nThis also might also explain why Elon has been quiet about Tesla despite all the complaining from investors. He knows the hammer is about to be dropped. He \"won't let us down.\"\n\nDisclaimer: I know parts of this could be wrong or all of it. Maybe they aren’t using 4680s for the structural pack 3s, maybe it’s all fake, but a wise man once told me if there’s smoke, there’s likely fire and all these little clues has me thinking a few Chevy bolts parked nearby…\n\nEDIT: The new 9,000 ton gigapress that was shipped to “Asia” could be front and rear or single casting for Model 3.

The only problem is that it might steal sales from the Model S if it's \"too good\"\n* A much higher volume Model 3. If they can redesign the 3 to be cheaper to make, for example maybe with castings and the structural pack?

I haven’t, and it seems like a really big opportunity if they will, since in all likelihood, basically no other vehicles would qualify for $7500 which will give Tesla at least another $3750 price advantage vs other EVs.\n\nThe delayed Treasury guidance details requirements that make $3,750 contingent on at least 40% of the value of the critical minerals in the battery having been extracted or processed in the United States or a country with a U.S. free-trade agreement, or recycled in North America.\n\nThe other $3,750 requires that at least 50% of battery components were manufactured or assembled in North America. Both percentages rise annually. Many countries are pressing Washington for a broad definition of a free-trade deal and other foreign automakers and countries want other interpretations.\n\nGM says they can meet the 40% but not the battery components requirements so they would only be eligible for $3750.\n\nThe battery component requirement should be in the bag for Tesla given the batteries and packs are made in the US.\n\nThe batteries in the Model Y and 3 have very little cobalt in them relative to most other EV batteries. They can get the nickel from Australia and Canada which would make up most of the battery. Lithium is a very small percentage of the battery but could also probably be from a source that qualifies under the credit rules. I believe other companies like VW get a lot of Nickel from Indonesia.\n\nTesla is also the largest customer for battery materials, is the most flexible in terms of making rapid change, and has the ability to pay the highest price. So inevitably tesla will get first pick for their raw materials supply chain.\n\nTesla could also theoretically shift around what materials are used in what batteries for what vehicles if they needed to. They could put batteries with materials from countries that don’t qualify in their S, X, and Model Y performance vehicles since they are ineligible for the credits anyway. They can also ship all modele of 3s and Ys with batteries that have unqualifying materials to other countries besides the US (like Canada).\n\nY is also higher margin and higher volume for them than the 3 so it seems most likely they would prioritize making sure it gets the full credits over any other vehicles they make.\n\nSo basically, my analysis is that if tesla is not eligible for the battery materials requirement once it goes into effect, then likely literally no vehicles would be eligible by any maker for the full credit.\n\nIs there something I’m missing on this? Has anyone seen anything else to confirm my thoughts? It seems likely that if anything the treasury will save to pressure from other OEMs and make it easier to qualify vs find a way to make Tesla not qualify.\n\nI’m also interested in this for people that are on the bubble about if their 3 or Y will be delivered by March or not and are worried about getting the full tax credit.\n\nHere’s a transcript from the Q3 2022 earnings call.\n\n“Thank you very much. And let's go first to the shareholder questions. The first shareholder question is given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla's ability to meet those thresholds in each of 2023, 2024, and 2025 through your existing and planned supply chain?”\n\nElon Musk -- Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect Well, yeah, I mean I think just at a high level, I'd say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA's requirements. Do you want to add?  Zachary\n\nKirkhorn -- Chief Financial Officer Yeah. We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act, there's a significant boost toward accelerating automation, while also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States. We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year. Until such time, it's difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well-positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1vyc4yy5zoda1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2852f8a5b941129e08ddc1b7fca4f15299b090ed", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": ">Is there something I’m missing on this?\n\nOnly thing I can see is Tesla gets screwed somehow.

The Big Five fit closely with the needs of AirLand battle by enhancing the Army’s ability to exploit seams in Soviet ground force deployments.\"\n\nThe entire point was to rapidly close the gap created by combined arms warfare, specifically penetrating air power, which is why the incredibly fast and powerful Abrams tank is complimentary. \n\nProblem with Ukraine is they can't project forward air power outside of very select drone operations.  Even with artillery, they're limited to mostly short(ish) range engagements.  For most intents and purposes they're a 2D fighting force and they have to slog through combat, mostly fighting from fixed defensive positions and occasionally using short range, artillery supported mechanized assaults.  This means armored units have to assault slowly under infantry support rather than armored units advancing rapidly into the gaps created by combined air and artillery power.  In other words, at the speed of a foot soldier VS at rapidly into the black hole created by AH-64s and air assault units", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm not necessarily saying it would be a poor performer overall, just that there are better options given the situation.  The gun is fantastic and it's speed is renowned.  Problem is, battle implements aren't designed to just deploy by themselves.  They come with a whole train of logistics and support. \n\nAt the time when a Russian invasion through the Fulda gap was a real possibility, they were designed to fight from strong points in western Germany that garrisoned hundreds of thousands of soldiers and airmen. \n\nOne of the reasons the marines got rid of the Abrams was because it isn't particularly good at advancing well ahead of supply lines and keeping nimble.  The turbine engine is complex and requires skilled maintenance technicians that, even in the US military, aren't usually forward deployed.  Plus, the thing just eats fuel.  It's also an incredibly expensive platform, and to just let them go get eaten alive by Russian artillery is a mistake.  The main area where the Abrams excels is with its incredible speed and weapons package including the tremendous designer ammo versatility.  It isn't designed to slog it out over months and months in relative static positions without reliable logistical support.    \n\nYou have to remember the entire US Army is a 3D combined arms rolling ball of knives.  The big 5 platforms were all designed with that in mind and to be deployed in division level combat formations, later scaled down to brigade combat teams during OIF, but still with the same concepts only slightly more nimble. \n\nI served in armored units for years and deployed multiple times so I'm not talking out of my ass", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Good points.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Any BS Elon said on trial?", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "Because he once said stock price too high and stock didn't go down for long, this is definitive proof his tweets dont affect the stock price and he is now allowed to tweet anything he wants.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Makes sense tho", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Does it", "score": -2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "7", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It would be funny if megapack gang turns out to be completely wrong.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}

Because you can't get rid of oil and you can't get rid of electric. So, if they have a hybrid that fuels up with gas + charges = best milage than any vehicle can provide. All electric vehicles take almost all day to charge and are only good for about 200 miles. Gasoline vehicles are usually good for about 250 miles. Difference, is it only takes 5 - 10 minutes to fill up your gas tank vs. multiple hours to charge your vehicle. If you have a hybrid, they typically get the same mileage as a diesel. If not, more. Lucid hasn't made anything that is a need, want, or must have. Their business is failing due to lack of products sold vs. products held. Financials are shit and the company itself is failing.
