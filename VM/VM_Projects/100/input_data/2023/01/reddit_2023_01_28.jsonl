{"title": "Microsoft is beating Google at its own game", "selftext": "Microsoft appears to be on the cusp of being something it hasn’t been in a long time: cutting-edge. It’s a label the company lost a long time ago after a series of small startups grew to become Microsoft’s biggest competitors. Google, for example, started out as a nimble, innovative upstart and eventually bested Microsoft in browsers, email, and mobile operating systems. But now Microsoft might be the nimble, innovative company that bests Google in artificial intelligence. And it’s all thanks to OpenAI.\n\nOpenAI is the hottest AI lab out there with one of the buzziest and most exciting products: ChatGPT. And Microsoft is its very good friend. On Monday, the two companies announced that Microsoft was investing $10 billion into OpenAI (that’s on top of the $3 billion Microsoft has given OpenAI since 2019), and Microsoft is rumored to be adding ChatGPT to its Bing search engine. Yeah, that’s right: The much-maligned, little-used Bing might finally become a real competitor to Google’s search.\n\nFollowing the news of Microsoft’s $10 billion investment, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote that ChatGPT is a “potential game changer” for Microsoft, and that the company was “not going to repeat the same mistakes” of missing out on social and mobile that it made two decades ago. Microsoft “is clearly being aggressive on this front and not going to be left behind,” Ives wrote.\n\nThere are parallels here, at least on the surface. Microsoft was once the dominant player in computer technology, with its Windows operating system being used by the vast majority of personal computers and its Internet Explorer browser being used by the vast majority of web surfers. And then it got in trouble with the US government, which sued Microsoft for using its dominant position to unfairly drive out competition and take over the then-nascent browser market by bundling Internet Explorer with Windows. The lawsuit tied up Microsoft for years. In that environment, companies like Google emerged, putting out better products that people preferred in an exponentially growing market.\n\nMicrosoft still did just fine — it remains one of the most valuable companies in the world and is still more valuable than Google — but it doesn’t have the same consumer-facing cachet it did before. Its enterprise clients drive the vast majority of its revenue, through products like Microsoft 365 and Azure. Google, by contrast, is very visible to and much-used by the general consumer, owning everything from Chrome to Gmail to YouTube. Its main revenue source is the digital ads that consumers see as they navigate the internet, and the majority of them are using Google services while they do it.\n\nBut now Google is the company that’s having antitrust issues, facing multiple lawsuits from the federal government and almost every state and territory in the country that target core parts of its business, including one that was filed just yesterday. Those may well clear the way for Microsoft to be the leader in a burgeoning industry with a ton of potential: AI. Companies like OpenAI have made significant advancements in the technology and are now showing it off to the general public, while Google’s competing products are practically nowhere to be found beyond updates on Google’s blog. (Microsoft isn’t entirely in the clear, as the Federal Trade Commission is currently trying to block its massive merger with the gaming company Activision Blizzard, but it’s in a much better position, antitrust-wise.)\n\nThat’s not to say that Google doesn’t recognize AI’s potential and increasing importance. It’s been working on AI offerings for years, and has some of the best ones. It acquired the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014, before OpenAI even existed. And it developed the Transformer technology that ChatGPT is built on (GPT stands for Generative Prediction Transformer).\n\nBut Google has held back on giving them the kind of public demonstration that OpenAI has, saying it wants to ensure that its products are responsible and safe before unleashing them. Not helping matters was a claim from a (now-former) engineer that Google’s chatbot technology, LaMDA, had become sentient. That’s been widely dismissed (and denied by Google), but it underlined how advanced the technology has become. And it showed the risks not of the technology becoming sentient, but of it being so good that people would think it was and start to treat it as such.\n\nNow that ChatGPT is out there, Google has to play catch-up and figure out how it wants to integrate its AI technology into its own offerings. It’s even, reportedly, brought back founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin to help out. The company also recently published a paper outlining its approach to AI and how important it is for that approach to be responsible (or Google’s definition of responsible, given the lack of government regulations).\n\n“Google is, I think, justified and correct in taking this seriously and taking Microsoft’s bid to use this tech to seriously compete with them in advertising, search engines, and other products,” said Derek Leben, a professor at Carnegie Mellon’s business school who focuses on AI ethics. “I think this is a very brilliant move from [Microsoft CEO] Satya Nadella. This is something that is definitely going to position Microsoft very well.”\n\nBut, Leben warned, there remains the question of whether the benefits of these products outweigh their risks — and if rushing them to market to compete will enhance those risks.\n\n“That is indeed the problem with arms races,” he said. “They tend to motivate actors in them to move faster, and accept risks that they otherwise would not have accepted.”\n\nMaybe OpenAI’s technology is a game changer. Maybe it’s just a party trick. Either way, Microsoft’s got it, and a lot of people think it’s amazing. That perception is important. Google now finds itself in a similar position that it helped put Microsoft in two decades ago: hoping it can release something better before it gets passed by.\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/recode/2023/1/26/23571710/microsoft-open-ai-chatgpt-google", "id": "10n347x", "created_utc": 1674871341.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "A common mistake investors make is mistaking a Good Product = Monetizable.

{"title": "Peak Recession is over. The Bulls Have It in 2023—and Last Year’s Losers Are Winners", "selftext": "The stock market has flipped the script for 2023.\n\nIt was widely expected that stocks would falter in the first half of the year as the Federal Reserve continued to boost rates and then rally after midyear when the Fed finally stopped tightening.\n\nBut stocks have surged in January, with the S&P 500 indexSPX +0.25% up 6% after a 2.5% rise this past week. The Nasdaq CompositeCOMP +0.95% has risen 11% so far in 2023, following a 4.3% increase in the past five sessions. The S&P 500 rose above its 200-day moving average, an impressive technical indicator. The index has regularly advanced in intraday trading, including every session this past week, another bullish sign.\n\n**The S&P 500’s Key Level**\n\nIt has been a risk-on rally led by some of the harder-hit sectors of 2022—technology, banks, entertainment, and commodities. Defensive groups that held up well in 2022 when the S&P 500 declined over 20%—consumer staples, healthcare, and utilities—all are down about 2% in 2023.\n\nWithin the winning groups, the most speculative stocks are leading. Warner Bros. Discovery WBD –0.60% (ticker; WBD), the debt-heavy media company, is the top stock in the S&P 500 this year, with a gain of 57%, after falling 63% in 2022.\n\nTesla TSLA +11.00% (TSLA) is No. 2 in the index. It’s up 44%, to $178, including a 33% rise this past week as CEO Elon Musk offered bullish comments on demand for the company’s electric vehicles. Unfortunately for Tesla investors, the stock will have to hit $352 to get back to where it started 2022.\n\nWhy the move in the market? Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, one of the most bullish strategists coming into 2023, felt that inflation peaked in mid-2022 and that the Fed would “need to course correct” this year, leading to a 20% gain in 2023.\n\n“The incoming data for the past few weeks is supportive of our view, and hence, equities are showing far more resilience than the consensus narrative,” he wrote on Friday. The consumer price index, for instance, has risen at just a 2% rate in the past six months.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to boost the key federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point this coming week to a range of 4.5%-4.75%, and a similar-size interest-rate hike is expected in March. That could finish the tightening move that has taken short-term rates up from near zero.\n\nThen the easing is expected to begin, though its pace is the subject of considerable debate. The bond market is discounting one rate cut late this year and many actions in 2024 that would take short-term rates down to 3%. Stock investors think the easing pace will come more quickly.\n\n“Valuation isn’t a headwind,” says Hank Smith, head of investment strategy at Haverford Trust. “The S&P 500 isn’t egregious at 18 times forward earnings with inflation coming down.”\n\nS&P 500 earnings are expected to be up just 4% this year. That could prove conservative. Smith points to several bullish factors for profits, including a weaker dollar, the reopening in China, lean inventories, and cost-cutting moves.\n\nIt’s rare, also, to see back-to-back yearly declines in the S&P 500. It has happened just twice since the end of World War II—in 1973-74 and for three years from 2000 through 2002.\n\nTreasury inflation-linked savings bonds are likely to see lower yields because of the drop in inflation in recent months.\n\nThe rate on Treasury series I bonds is reset every six months, and the new rate in May probably will be lower than the current 6.89%. The May reset will be based on the change in the consumer price index from September 2022 to March 2023.\n\nSo far, three months of data are in, and there has been no change in the index. Assume 0.3-percentage-point monthly increases from January through March, and the new rate in May is likely to be about 2%.Investors swamped the Treasury’s website in October to get a 9.6% rate, which had prevailed for six months before the setting of the current rate in early November. October issuance totaled almost $7 billion, a monthly record, and fell to about $1 billion in both November and December.\n\nEven with a lower rate, I bonds have some advantages. They offer investors protection against inflation, carry a current real rate of 0.4% on top of the inflation adjustment, and come with tax benefits. Investors can defer paying taxes on the interest income until maturity in 30 years, giving them an IRA-like quality. Interest is exempt from state and local taxes but subject to federal income taxes.\n\nThe drawback: Individuals can buy just $10,000 of the bonds annually.", "id": "10nne9k", "created_utc": 1674934411.0, "score": 243, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 336, "comments": [{"body": "These threads are so pointless it’s just people with positions saying the recession is over and people with cash saying it’s coming and both of them are just using feelings", "score": 1006, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.
