He selected 3% fcf for the bear end and 5% for base. This is why Amazon is so hard. You have to seperate out the core business.  The reason I think these numbers were chosen because Amazon's recent free cash flow margins have been around 3% but you need context. One reason Amazon's margins have been so high is because they have for decades aggressively building their ecommerce infrastructure. This capex accelerated in 2020-2021 which increased operating costs. However, Amazon now knows their capacity is too high and I suspect in 2023 we will begin to see either a decline or leveling off of capex while they continue to grow operating cash flow.\n\nAWS is going to have margins in the 30-40% range most likely. E-commerce section will absolutely be low margins. I would say bear case margins 2%, base 3%, bull 5%. We don't know Amazons Advertising margins but we can make some reasonable assumptions. Meta and Google, whic are ad businesses, have margins around 35%. And unlike Meta and Google, Amazon already has a seperate mature business that it can build its ad business into which will increase margins. I would say bear case 30%, base case 35%, and bull case 40%.  Let's look at each segment. I'm not going to make a long projection and DCA it back for simplicity but instead a reasonable 2023 assumption and choose relatively reasonable PEs.

Yes, other companies are doing things like geofencing and such to make sure they don't get regular disengagements. However, this should not be discounted as user experience, user sentiment, and government regulation are extremely important here.\n\n> Cruise/Waymo are definitely more capable in what they do.

Getting HD maps in place is more of a regulatory and financial thing than it is capabilities. They are just being meticulous in their approach. Waymo's threat is automaker adoption. I don't think they want to be in the automaker business.\n\n> In 5 years, will those companies also be so dominate that if Tesla releases FSD for real that they wouldn’t instantly take the crown?\n\nI do not think Tesla will \"release FSD for real\" and most industry experts agree. I've not seen any data suggesting that they have the ability to implement FSD with their current AI models and sensor arrays. But let's ignore that... Even if they do land somewhere, this ignores the bigger issue that Tesla is an automaker, not a tech company. No matter how much others wish this wasn't the case, it's simply not true that they are in the tech business. Tesla doesn't license their tech and even if they tried to, I'm not sure the other automakers would be looking to buy it.

They’ll open the service up to the public but then people can’t get off the waitlists. They’re doing incredible work but it’s just an incredibly hard problem. I also don’t buy that HD maps are already automated. I’m sure there are many steps that are but if they didn’t need significant manual review I’m sure they would have scaled more already. \n\nAs far as FSD, the beta *is really* working everywhere. Working doesn’t mean flawlessly working. In fact, it’s very flawed at times. They have also overfit to specific areas like California.

You’re right that [new] original content is going to attract more people to keep growing. \n\nI strongly disagree that losing the Office/Friends does zero for two reasons:\n\nHaving programs like the Office/Friends gives less pressure to churn out new commercially successful content, because people will be satisfied with watching reruns while waiting for the next big blockbuster to come out. There is way less pressure to cancel subscriptions. People will opt for quality over quantity because they prefer familiarity, so losing key quality content will definitely put strains on retention rates (lowers the future subscription floor).\n\nThe other is more streaming services being added. Those people that love the Office reruns are more inclined to now subscribe to peacock for $5/mo. for that one show (quality > quantity preference). Now that people are splitting their money on various streaming services, it makes it way harder for Netflix to raise prices. Admittedly I don’t have the behavioral Econ data on this - I would be willing to bet that enough people would tolerate paying $20/mo. for Netflix if the Office/Friends was still on there, and the only streaming service to offer it. Losing that monopoly is going to significantly dent future growth. Also that doesn’t account for those companies to generate blockbuster content that causes people to unsub Netflix and jump ship. AppleTV with Ted Lasso is a good example of the potential for Netflix to cede market share. \n\nBetween those two points, the probability of significant growth for Netflix moving forward takes a big hit.\n\nEdit: I think the bullish case on Netflix still is India from what I’ve heard.

Their additions to the respective services moved the needle none to negligible; just look at their sub numbers. As you mentioned really no way to truly know with the information we have.\n\nNetflix India numbers suck but so does the ARPU; it’s like 2 dollars. Japan, and South Korea are much better and good sub adds which is an area along with India Netflix has focused on. \n\nUltimately I’m not overly bullish I think Netflix is probably fairly priced now and will continue to grow enough to increase their earnings per share at a decent clip because their business model scales nicely and offer a decent return. \n\nHow they continue to try to reinvent themselves ie gaming or anything else to try to reaccelerate massive revenue/cash flow growth will be interesting.

They've built amazing APIs, their service is/was the best content delivery service in the industry.\n\nHowever today it's easier than it's ever been for companies to catch up and do what Netflix is doing. Early in the space Netflix had an advantage of having a library that was deep and extensive and provided a service that it's suppliers didn't want to spend the time investing in. However as Netflix took off the suppliers saw the immediate gold mine and realized that Netflix was inherently a middle man.\n\nMiddle man oriented businesses have been a backbone of many industries but I have a feeling that a lot of these companies will start to see a decline over the next few decades because consumers are more empowered than ever via the convenience of the internet to find their own goods and solutions directly. Like in order to exist in the future a company HAS to be providing it's own unique products and services on top of being a middle man to thrive. This is not really new stuff either, we've already seen this in retail and grocery for example. Costco would not be nearly as successful if Kirkland didn't have a reputation of being a very solid brand on it's own which provided consumers an incentive to come to their stores beyond just looking for products from other suppliers. Virtually every grocer in America has it's own generic store brand. Amazon has also gone down this route with their own Amazon Basics brand along with the other subsidiaries for it's own built products.\n\nNetflix has gone down this path but is competing in one of the toughest spaces to do this. Tie this in with the general decline of how movies and television are perceived today. In the media space there is one thing that trumps all and it's live audience viewing for exclusive unique events. This is why sports are the most valuable thing in the media space, you cannot replicate the level of urgency people feel to see a unique sports match live as it happens, it's the single most valuable asset. Netflix's service is actually the reverse of what sports offers. Sports is a one time unique live event that forces the viewer to watch at that time. Netflix is based off convenience, a show has the entire season released at once and the viewer is able to binge it and move on, a movie is released on the platform and it stays forever (typically). However Netflix DOESN'T have to adhere to this model. I typically think about when Game of Thrones was it at it's peak. The episodes released weekly, one at a time, on streaming and this became an event in itself. \n\nI think Netflix has gone all in on the wrong concept for media, they have not built their brand around big events like how Amazon is attempting to do so with Twitch and Football, they've built it around convenience and in media what keeps the consumers coming back is this feeling of exclusivity, of a rare experience.

They are not direct competitors. Google is not in the SVOD industry, Netflix is. At this point, Google is very far behind to try and steal market share as a pure SVOD play (high fixed costs). It would take a while for them to enter the market and do damage. So they are unlikely to spend a lot on content. The reason why Google has more upside potential is because they are dependent on ad revenue which is more sensitive to recessions so there stock fell more. Netflix is relatively less resilient to recessions (cheap form of entertainment)\n\nAlso, Netflix has high content spend but they also have high content amortization. This is content they own which can be licensed or used in the future to attract new subscribers (lowering content spend per user).\n\nTheir gross profit for 2022 is gonna be around $12 billion. That is AFTER content amortization is baked in (around $13 billion). As the SVOD market in places like APAC become saturated, their content spend to content amortization ratio will be close to 1 and their will be much higher amounts of FCF. \n\nTLDR: Netflix is building a content empire with a lot of value, Google isn't.

On a month-over-month basis, headline and core inflation are expected to be -0.1% and 0.3%, respectively.  \n\n The most likely scenario with a 65% chance of happening, according to JPMorgan, is the December CPI report revealing headline inflation of between 6.4% and 6.6%, year-over-year. In that scenario, JPMorgan expects a bullish move from the S&P 500 with a gain of between 1.5% and 2%. \n\n\"This is a bullish outcome and think this outcome produces a decline in vol asset classes, finds support from both bonds and the US dollar,\" JPMorgan said. The bank added that any initial surge higher in the S&P 500 is likely to be faded throughout the day.\n\nThe next most likely scenario with a 20% chance of happening is the CPI report printing headline inflation below 6.4%. That scenario would signal to investors that inflation is decidedly moving in the right direction, and JPMorgan expects a S&P 500 bounce of between 3% and 3.5%. The gains could get even larger if the CPI print is below 6.2%, as it would trigger a tail event with increased volatility.\n\nIncreased market volatility stemming from CPI reports is nothing new to investors.

{"title": "CPI Prediction and Analysis…. 1-11-23 SPY and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Twas the eve of CPI markets put in a nice low volume green day to day. Roughly its standard $4 +/- move. \n\nLets take a look at my predictions for CPI. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4w0xsbxizhba1.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cfc36747f832ad3e779c90fff2ed9b8ae0ce3b1\n\nCurrently I expected a bear on everything but CORE MoM. The one oddity going into this CPI is that the Cleveland fed has an oddly high MoM CPI/ CORE estimate. They are estimating about 0.5% for each. Which for CPI MoM is about 0.5% higher than Bloomberg and consensus and for CORE MoM is 0.2% higher than its estimates. The standard variance is about 0.2% however we have seen a few 0.3 to 0.5% variance outlier this year. \n\nIn my opinion main focus is going to be on CORE YoY. As long as CORE YoY comes in lower I expect a decent green 2-2.5% green open. However, IF CORE was to come in unchanged especially with a miss on CORE MoM I would brace for a 2.5-3% red open. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oy162ntkzhba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b820821a2f15e12b039ed79beaaac087982bd31\n\nInterestingly JPM is calling for a green day (85% probability) IF CPI YoY comes in below 6.6%. Currently per my estimates we have a 66% chance of CPI YoY being 6.5 to 6.6% and a 33% chance of it being 6.7%. \n\nJPM has weighted their probability correctly (granted their reactions usually are 100% wrong) correctly the last 3 or 4 CPIs. Will be interested to see if they are correct today. They are pricing in a much lower reaction than the least 2-3 CPIs. \n\nFor instance December CPI their “game plan” had a 70% chance of a beat with 50% chance of a 2-3% rally and 15% chance of a 4-5% rally. In November they had waited a 65% chance of a green day with 40% chance of a 1% to 1.5% rally and a 20% chance of a 2.5% to 3.5% rally. ( I tried to find their October prediction but cant). \n\nThis is the highest percent probability of a green reaction that JPM has given spy. The most interesting thing about tomorrow is looking at overall IV and options premiums for similar positions I played last time everything is very “cheap.” Granted last CPI we were faced with back to back CPI/ FOMC so everything was really jacked up but even compared to November a similar position for tomorrow that one would have played for Decembers is about 50-60% cheaper. IV is also about 20-30% lower than previous. The way I see it markets are NOT pricing in a huge reaction like the last few CPIs. Which is honestly surprising being that the last four CPIs average a +/- 2.6% open and all the CPIs from this year average a 1.8% +/- open. \n\nWe are either being set up for a huge let down like May which opened at -0.02% or options are going to pay out extremely well at open tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31kawdalzhba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bae450370433ff7a834864880222451fe6335df1\n\nGonna keep this brief as we are gonna most likely see some sort of 2-4% +/- move and we will pick up where the dust settles tomorrow. The biggest thing to note on the daily is that we have the daily 8 and 20ema crossover which is extremely bullish going forward (regardless of CPI). In addition we broke through the possible channel resistance and with a beautiful cup and handle forming, closing back within the previous 393 to 402 channel I would not be surprised to see us close well within the 400s tomorrow. My key targets are 402.3 (+1.7%) -> 405.2 (+2.4%) -> 410.3 (+3.7%). With a great market reaction to CPI tomorrow we might actually retest the resistance that markets established last CPI. The “bear market resistance” line sits at 401.5 if we break through and close over that tomorrow I would officially say the downtrend is confirmed over and that we are in either a very long consolidation (which most bear markets do see) or we are starting a VERY slow up trend (not to be confused with a bull market returning). \n\nSpeaking of bear/ bull markets… tomorrow (or later this week/ next week) IF spy breaks back over 417.73 (5.6%+) or SPX breaks back over 4189 that effectively ends the current bear market per definition (its considered a “bull market” when the ticker moves up by more than 20%). \n\nWhile I remain fairly bullish for tomorrow and I really do think we are going to have a pretty impressive green day tomorrow (3-4%) I am cautious that we may have been led out to pasture with this one. If we were to react negatively to MoM or something else for CPI tomorrow the reaction is going to be extremely bearish. I would not be surprised to see -4 to -5% red day tomorrow if ALGOs choose to go that way. Key support I would watch at 390.1 (-1.4%) -> 382.6 (-3.3%) -> 378 (-4.5%).\n\n381.4 is the current red bull channel support that I am watching if we do get a huge red day but hold that support we could still end up on a bigger bull move. \n\nThe other pending question for tomorrow is can the markets actually find the strength to hold a rally intraday and after CPI? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pain8stlzhba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc81f0b637a60cf4905f97e9e21beb845cec600f\n\nTesla remains an unknown. While when it broke through 123 that was extreme bullish the fact that it loss that momentum and actually ended up closed effectively on the channel resistance is not as bullish. I am relatively bullish on Tesla regardless of the market. This is the first time we have had 3 back to back closes over the daily 8ema since the beginning of December. We have not had 4 closes over the daily 8ema since the last week of October. \n\nCurrent momentum gives Tesla a push to test resistance at the daily 20ema and the broad blue bear channel support at 134.4 tomorrow (+9%). However, if we get a bad CPI it will lose this black bull channel and the daily 8ema again I would not hesitate to open some next Friday DTE puts on tesla with the likely hood we see it break $100 early next week. \n\nThe way I see it looking at most tickers is that everyone is absolutely on an edge and tomorrow we might FINALLY get a push off or from the edge. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9i8dg7pzhba1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f3c41f095aef28793c98777b276a7e0103d6938\n\nRelatively speaking a 2.43% green day on the VIX is pretty minimal going into CPI. The day before December CPI had a 9.6% spike for reference, however, Novembers barely spiked 2% also. The fact the VIX remained low despite an important and volatile day tomorrow is one of the main reasons we have such cheap premiums. \n\nI still think with algos catching onto good data the call side will pay out very well tomorrow, however if we get a deep red open and a really negative algo reaction with the VIX at 21 we should expected an easy 15-20% spike on that which is going to rocket premiums and the payouts are going to be pretty incredible. \n\nI will be tuned in to the charts at 830am to see what the markets bring us! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/srn3px8nzhba1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=48fd98ae3f4f22ed042407c5f25050eb7a09f6e4\n\nSomething else to note is that we have Harker speaking who is a voting member but is considered neutral to dovish speaking at 730am before. We also have bullard who is currently seen as the most hawkish FOMC member (but non voting) speaking at 1130am and at 1240 we get Barkin who is also hawkish but non voting. \n\nWe also get more jobless data at 830am also. There is a lot of data for algos to unpack at 830am . I still favor a bullish reaction especially if we actually do get a negative or 0% MoM CPI. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pxqzcpmnzhba1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=f378a541c5084cc8d876ba4d3dbb5f921dda4f04\n\nToday was a total crap shoot of trading. The premiums for 1, 2 and 6dte were so inflated cause of CPI that it took such an incredibly large move up to net any real profits. For instance a 2dte that I watched and held partially had a total $1.2 move and only saw 11% gains max. That should have been a pretty easy 25-30% win. \n\nThe trend was also so slow and for most of the day we traded within a $2 range that we weren’t able to get the big moves we needed to spike premiums.
