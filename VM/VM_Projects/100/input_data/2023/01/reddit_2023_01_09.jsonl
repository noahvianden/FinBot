This business has a lot of jargon so it can be confusing.\n\nIt sounds like you bought a call on SPY at price X.  Since then SPY is above X however your contract isn’t worth more than you paid for it.  If this is what you are saying you just had your first lesson in extrinsic value.\n\nThe price of your contract has 2 major components:  intrinsic value and extrinsic value.  If SPY is above your strike price it has intrinsic value.  But that’s only part of the story. If SPY is also higher than when you purchased your call then your contract also has a rise in intrinsic value which is good for your trade.    \nHowever there is extrinsic value that is primarily time and implied volatility.  The more time left on your contract the more extrinsic value.  But time always moves forward so your time is always decaying.  How much depends on how close you are to expiration.  A contract with 2 days left decays faster than one with 2 weeks left, which is faster than 2 months left.  So you don’t just need a move in the right direction, you need that move as soon as possible because as time goes on you need more of a move to be profitable.\n\nThen there is implied volatility.  Think of this as speed, especially downside speed.  It is a reflection of the risk of price movement.  So around big events IV can be higher since that event could move the stock.  That risk can come out once the move is done.  A recent example for SPY this week was the CPI print.  If you bought before it came out, you may have paid more due to higher volatility.  Then when the news came out so did a chunk of that risk because the news is known.  So if IV dropped like it did yesterday, your call may have lost extrinsic value which lowered the price.  \n\nNow I can’t know your situation for sure as there’s not enough detail however my best guess is that the biggest reason is that your extrinsic value dropped more than your intrinsic value gained.\n\nHope this helps.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your response I appreciate it.

Let's say that XYZ stock has a 0 DTE expected move of +/-$1 (68% chance the expiration price is in that range). So if the ATM price of XYZ is $100, all call strikes above $101 are worthless and all call strikes below $99 are 100 delta with no extrinsic value. Let's say the $101 call costs $.10. If XYZ moves up just $2, that $101 call will be worth at least $1.00 and moves dollar for dollar with the stock price further up. That is a 1000% gain on the call, minimum.\n\nOf course, if the stock price moves down an equal amount, or even just stays within the expected move, the $101 call becomes worthless.\n\nA brief example of how max theta plays work. Let's say instead of a $101 call you short a $99 put for $.25. Since theta is max on 0 DTE, you will be able to keep all of that $.25 of credit by the end of the day (as long as XYZ stays above $99). That doesn't seem like much of a profit vs. the $99/share it cost you in collateral, but for a leveraged short put where you only have to pay 25% collateral, that is a 1% return on your money, which is pretty good for less than 1 day hold.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Gamma works in both directions.

XYZ stock is $100 and you want to buy it for $90, so you sell a $90 put for $1 and pat yourself on the back for that $1 of free money you get vs. a limit order to buy at $90.\n\nThen the stock drops to $69 and you are assigned, being forced to pay $90/share for something that is only worth $69/share. That $1 of \"free money\" is not going to make you feel very good for being $21/share in the hole.\n\nTL;DR - the short put strategy for buying shares cheap underestimates the downside risk.\n\nFor the covered call, people just have tunnel vision there. They only look at the value of the call, not the net value of the entire position. Sure, your XYZ $90 strike call that paid you $11 credit is going to make you feel great if XYZ falls from $100 to $99.50, but if it falls to $69, again, that $11 of credit is not going to make you feel better for bag holding a huge loss on the shares.\n\nThey counter with, it's better than bag holding a $21/share loss if I just had XYZ shares with no covered call, and that argument seems persuasive, but ignores the upside part of the story. What happens when XYZ *doesn't* fall to $69, but instead rises to $120?

Commonly seen in deep ITM calls ahead of an ex-dividend date, this type of activity creates large blocks of open interest that are immediately assigned by another party. The net effect is that early assignment on original short positions is avoided based on the percentage pro-rata allocation method used by OCC. Another effect is a sharp spike in the equity put/call ratio that is nondirectional and unrelated to typical option use cases.\n\nAlso, I've seen statements on how when large put/call sweeps are noticed in the market, you can kind of guess the bullish/bearish sentiment based on how it transacted with bid/ask:\n\n- calls at the ask    = bullish\n- calls above the ask = moar bullish\n- calls at the bid    = bearish\n- calls below the bid = moar bearish\n\n- puts at the ask     = bearish\n- puts above the ask  = moar bearish\n- puts at the bid     = bullish\n- puts below the bid  = moar bullish", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Right.

So this tells us that the rate of change of the option's sensitivity to the price increases, i.e., if the price increases, the sensitivity of the option price to the stock price could explode.\n\n**Background:** Suppose investors bought a lot of 0DTE call options on a high gamma stock. The options expire on that day, and the investors profit if the stock price increases over the strike price. The market maker has thus sold a lot of call options to the investors, and if the call options increase in value due to the stock price increasing, the market maker is now net short. \n\n**Scenario**: The stock price increases in value, causing the call options to be in the money.\n\n**Response**: But a market maker must stay neutral to minimize risk. Therefore, it buys a lot of the asset just to hedge its risk. (Net short in options + net long in the asset = neutral)\n\n**Complication**: This is usually not a problem, but if the option has high gamma, a small increase in the asset price can cause the call options to explode in value (as the delta increases). This means the market maker must really go long on the asset, i.e. buy a lot of the stock.\n\n**Conclusion**: Thus, a small change in the asset price has a ripple effect that causes the market maker to go long on the underlying asset and causes an artificial increase in valuation with no fundamental change. The same thing can happen on expiration dates for options that expire on the middle/end of months.\n\n**Followup-Questions**: Does the same thing happen for high-delta stocks?

They’re obviously price gouging because they can get away with it. Meanwhile, as an individual, I have no choice but to buy gas, pay rent and purchase food staples at whatever prices I’m given—I need to work, I need a roof, and I need to eat, so these aren’t discretionary purchases. But the prices keep rising anyway. I would argue this is an indication the economy has become too monopolized and capital too concentrated. \n\nI’m not saying that’s always the case. I’m saying this issue is complex and making it reductive to the individual is such a tired neoliberal cliché.\n\nPutting it charitably, raising rates is a really lousy policy tool for combating inflation not only from the standpoint of long term economic viability but also just in terms of fairness plain and simple. Because ultimately the wealthy will inevitably find a way to make a profit no matter which side of the market cycle they’re on. Recessions are a buyer’s market. But it also damages the middle class and widens the gulf between rich and poor. \n\nThis can only go on for so long before you see things such as capitol insurrections and insane populist political candidates begin to dominate the headlines.

Higher minimum wage can lead to increased consumer spending, as workers have more disposable income to spend on goods and services. This can in turn stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\n\nHowever, some argue that increasing minimum wage can also lead to negative consequences, such as price inflation and job loss. Businesses may respond to higher labor costs by raising prices, which can lead to overall higher costs of living. In addition, businesses may decide to reduce their workforce or automate jobs in order to offset the higher labor costs.\n\nOn the other hand, increasing interest rates can be used as a tool to address inflation and maintain price stability. Higher interest rates can discourage borrowing and encourage saving, which can help to reduce demand and slow down price increases. Increasing interest rates can also lead to a stronger currency, which can make exports more competitive and attract foreign investment.\n\nHowever, increasing interest rates can also have negative consequences, such as slowing economic growth and increasing the burden of debt for borrowers. Higher interest rates can make borrowing more expensive and discourage investment, which can lead to slower economic growth. In addition, individuals and businesses with existing debt may struggle to afford the higher loan payments that come with higher interest rates.\n\nIn conclusion, both increasing minimum wage and increasing interest rates can have both positive and negative effects on an economy.

{"title": "Wayfair Can Only Kick the Can For So Long", "selftext": "TLDR: I think Wayfair is going to run out of cash in the next 18 months.  With no assets, it’ll have difficulty refinancing the 2025 debt leading to either insolvency or unfavorable terms.  I’m selling call credit spreads.\n\nAfter BBBY announced near term ongoing concerns despite debt not being due until 2024, I wanted to see who’s next.  Wayfair’s income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows are as bad as I’ve ever seen.  \n\nI’m posting my due diligence to a public forum to encourage discussion and see if I’m missing anything in my investment thesis that Wayfair’s common stock goes into the low teens in the next 18 months.  Wayfair will run out of cash or have large equity dilution due to negative cash flow from operations and the requirement to refinance the 2025 debt.\n\nMost of the numbers I’m quoting come from Wayfair’s 10Q and investor presentation linked below.\n[10Q](https://s24.q4cdn.com/589059658/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/82b3ed5d-3592-48d4-8ecc-86ec6d90e1b2.pdf#page3)\n\n[Investor Presention](https://s24.q4cdn.com/589059658/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/Q3'22-Investor-Presentation.pdf#page3)\n\nCash flows:  Wayfair burned through $1.1 billion in cash and short term investments in the 9 months ending September 30th.  Wayfair has $1.28 billion in cash and short term investments remaining on hand.  If the next 12 months are as bad as the last 9 months, Wayfair will need to raise cash.  My opinion is that the housing market will see a slow down in transactions in 2022.  The rise in mortgage rates has reduced home affordability, while home sellers stubbornly refuse to lower prices leading to less houses selling.  Wayfair’s revenue should be correlated with housing transactions as furniture sales are largely correlated.\n\nCurrent Ratio: Wayfair has cash now, but current liabilities completely offset resulting in a 1.0 current ratio. $1 billion in accounts payable is $670 million larger than accounts receivable.  The low current ratio will lead to low liquidity if negative cash flow continues.  An asset-light business model is ideal for profitable companies with manageable debt levels.  With Wayfair, there will be very few assets to secure additional loans after it burns through the existing cash.\n\nLiabilities:  Wayfair’s bond holders give Wayfair an exceptionally low interest rate in exchange for a conversion option.  Some have referred to it as free money.  It might have minimal impact on cash flow today, but it’s transferring ownership of the company from the shareholders to the bond holders.  The notes are essentially a call option that pays dividends.  Page 11 of the 10Q has the details.  $3.1 billion in notes with $200 million due in 2024 and $1.28 billion in 2025.  The coupon rates are below inflation with 2024 at 1.12% and 2025 at  0.625%.  If the bond holders weren’t getting the conversion option, I think interest expense would increase $300 million annually.  \n\nAs 2025 approaches, I think the conversion price will have to be significantly reduced and the interest rate significantly increased, both a negative to an investor buying common stock at today’s prices.  If the 2025 note holders play hardball, I think they can force extremely unfavorable terms to the point that they will own the company rendering the common stock worthless.  I think as cash depletes and EPS remains negative, Wayfair will be in violation of covenants, but I got lost in the SEC files before I could prove this out. \n\nStock buybacks:  The statement of cash flows lists $75 million spent on stock buybacks this year. Those shares were repurchased between $136 and $305 per share. Management is wasting cash. A company with negative shareholder equity should not be buying back shares.\n\nEquity based compensation:  Wayfair paid $355 million in stock to its employees in the first 9 months of this year. The market cap is only $4 billion.  If that continues for another year it’s 10% dilution.  Cash flow is being propped up by paying employees in stock.  10% of market cap is about as high as I’ve seen for equity based compensation.  There’s only 6 million remaining shares authorized for compensation.  Either employee compensation will have to decrease or Wayfair will have to pay a larger percentage of compensation as cash.\n\nAnalysts Estimates:  Analyst estimates have 2023 EPS at -$4.56 on flat revenue.  The original path to profitability required Wayfair to scale up to a level that was sending truckloads of merchandise to each major city.  \n\nFlat revenue isn’t going to allow Wayfair to grow to profitability.  Cutting back to profitability is the only option.  I’ve seen the argument that Wayfair’s loss is less than advertising suggesting that Wayfair could cut its paid advertising and rely on organic sales.  Wayfair is already touting a high % of sales are coming from repeat customers.  That’s management’s spin on the inability to acquire new customers despite spending $353 million on advertising in Q3.  At that ad spend, active customer count is down 22% YOY.  If Wayfair cuts ad spend, revenue will decrease leading to lower gross margin dollars.\n\nMy position: My argument isn’t unique.  33% of the float is short.  The stock is down almost 90% from all time highs.  However, it is up 35% off it’s lows.  I have a 2/17 $45/$60 call credit spread that expires just before earnings.  I intend to roll this out 45-60 days for the next 18 months.\n\nFeel free to poke holes in the investment thesis.  Or better yet, make suggestions on how to improve my credit spread.

How should we understand the motivation and logic behind the price adjustment? , Tao Lin gave her own complete interpretation.\n\n\n\nTao Lin: The price adjustment of a product is actually a forecast of the company's cost changes in the next period of time.\n\n\n\nThe biggest difference between 2023 and last year is that the epidemic has basically passed. We believe that the supply chain has returned to normal to a large extent, and there will be no such unpredictable shortages of materials as in previous years, which will bring cost uncertainty.\n\n\n\nI personally think that the price adjustment reflects our better planning for the supply chain in a sense, and what level the vehicle cost will be, and then we make such adjustments according to this estimate.\n\n\n\nSome consumers may also say that I bought it yesterday, and you cannot suddenly change the cost overnight, but the fact is that any company does not calculate the cost every day, but calculates it according to a time period .\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the price of industrial products cannot be immediately reflected in the end products. Some raw materials may still be used in contracts signed a few months ago, so in fact, there will be a certain lag. \n\n\n\nImage\nThe several relatively large price adjustments in Tesla’s history were all due to external factors that had a certain impact on the cost. For example, if we become a domestic car, the price will definitely drop compared to pure imports, at least 15% of tariffs will be saved. , For example, after our supply chain is stabilized, it will definitely be lower than when it was shipped from abroad.\n\n\n\nTesla's current supply chain localization rate is already 95%, and theoretically speaking, there is not much room for improvement, so I think after this price adjustment, it should be said (price) is relatively stable.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the logic of the Tesla company is very simple. When the calculated cost changes, such as the replacement of raw materials and other price adjustments, we will immediately increase or decrease.\n\n\n\nCompared with last month, consumers seem to think that we have lowered the price by a large margin, but in fact, the price last month has increased, and compared with the price before the price increase, there is not much difference. \n\n\n\nNO.2\n[ About feelings: I hope everyone can understand this pricing logic ]\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the weekend after Tesla announced the price adjustment, car owners' rights protection broke out in some Tesla stores and delivery centers across the country, and the demands of these car owners were very simple, that is, to demand compensation.\n\n\n\nBehind every price adjustment, car companies have their considerations, and consumers have their demands. So can a balance be found between the two? Automobile Production and Economics threw this question to Tao Lin.\n\n\n\nTao Lin: Tesla has adopted some relatively new concepts, such as the direct sales model, such as price adjustment strategies, and we hope to gradually make everyone feel that these concepts are feasible.\n\n\n\nUnder the direct sales model, the prices are completely open and transparent, without discounts or price increases, and everyone is the same at the same time.\n\n\n\nFor example, for a traditional car, everyone buys it at a different price at a dealer, so you actually don’t know whether the price you bought is the lowest or not, and you don’t know what price other people are buying. Is it fair to consumers?\n\n\n\nI think many consumers may not be too used to the current completely transparent approach, but I personally think that as everyone gradually understands why Tesla does this, they may gradually get used to it .\n\n\n\nNO.3\n[ About the order: there are fluctuations because of the large volume ]\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to media statistics, since July last year, Tesla's global orders have declined, so there are also voices that Tesla's price reduction is because the growth rate of orders on hand can no longer keep up with the ramp-up speed of production capacity.\n\n\n\nHowever, after the price cut, the delivery cycle of the Model Y model has changed from the previous 1-4 weeks to 2-5 weeks. Does this mean that orders have started to increase again?\n\n\n\n\nTao Lin: Some media said that we lowered the price because we couldn’t sell anymore. I think it’s really nonsense.\n\n\n\nCompared with other companies with this dealership model, Tesla’s inventory is very transparent. You may see that there are some differences between our current production and sales, mainly because of the large volume, such as some cars. on the way of transportation.\n\n\n\nI think this is very normal and within the healthy range.\n\n\n\nThe delivery cycle also has a certain relationship with the effective working hours. For example, the Spring Festival is a holiday, so there are only about two weeks in January, and it is unlikely to reach full production. It will definitely be full production every day compared to October. When the output is not the same, the corresponding lead time will be different.\n\n\n\n(Note: In addition to the domestic market, the current capacity supply of the Tesla Shanghai factory also includes Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and other countries)\n\n\n\nNO.4\n[ About industry competition: Tesla only focuses on products ]\n\n\n\n\nFrom January 1 this year, my country canceled the new energy vehicle subsidy policy that had lasted for more than 10 years.\n\n\n\nThis also means that every new energy vehicle OEM that sells a new energy vehicle now loses nearly 10,000 yuan in profit. In order to hedge this part of the loss, brands including BYD, Chery, Changan, Leapao, etc. have carried out different levels of investment. price increase. \n\n\n\nAt this time, Tesla, who chose to cut the price, instantly became the most maverick person, and was even labeled as not talking about martial arts. Some people say that Tesla's price butcher directly aggravates the internal friction between electric vehicles.\n\n\n\nTao Lin: When a consumer chooses an electric car, he first decides to buy a fuel car or an electric car, and then chooses which car among the electric cars. When he decides to buy an electric car, the choice is actually not that much.\n\n\n\nTherefore, we have never regarded these other electric vehicle companies as competitors . We must work together to make the products more extreme, and then meet the needs of customers in different market segments.\n\n\nTesla currently produces only two domestically-produced cars. In fact, ordinary people still have many various needs, which may not be met by our two cars. We also hope that there will be a variety of cars in the market. Electric vehicles can satisfy everyone's needs.\n\n\n\nFrom another perspective, I think China's new energy market is far from reaching the state of a zero-sum game.\n\n\n\nIn this sense, if any other electric car brand can produce a product that is much better than Tesla, and everyone rushes to buy their car, we also think it is very good, then we will hurry to improve our products . I think the current market size is not enough to buy yours, so I have to sell one less, and it is far from that time.\n\n\n\nNO.5\n[  about a few rumors ] \n\n\n\nTesla makes cell phones,\n\nTesla Model 2,\n\nTesla's second factory in China,\n\nZhu Xiaotong was promoted to Tesla's second in command,\n\n\n\nTao Lin said that the above rumors are not true.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "subsequent naughty axiomatic sort safe threatening crush seemly obtainable ad hoc\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "> From January 1 this year, my country canceled the new energy vehicle subsidy policy that had lasted for more than 10 years.\n\nIs this why Buffett has been truncating his position since early 2022", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "thanks!", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good spin.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "> Zhu Xiaotong was promoted to Tesla's second in command,  \n> Tao Lin said that the above rumors are not true.\n\nwhoa, wait a sec.  what exactly was she denying here", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Much concern", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "![gif](giphy|QYMBvtszJiY787LSkJ|downsized)", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Did you ever end up doing a Jan 2025 YOLO?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not yet", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "✌🏻", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm ready", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "My body", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Crypto futing, Futes futing, 🚀🚀🚀", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Pre market bumping 🚀", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Sad!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/svvytrdr/status/1612452493316837377?s=46&t=-mnjGP5-8gNKRQNxeAVQ2g", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "homeless poor somber hateful plough longing slim selective piquant literate -- mass edited with redact.dev", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "[Tweet](https://twitter.com/svvytrdr/status/1612452493316837377) from [@svvytrdr](https://twitter.com/svvytrdr): Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway $BRK.B filed today for its sale of 1.058 Million shares of BYD at an average price of $24.52 per share - Reuters", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "At what price did he buy in?", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buffet knows something 😏", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Has a list of selling-the-bottom- clowns been compiled so we can dunk on them once we go back to $200 by end of Feb?", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "how many awards will we get if we goes 20% in a day", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Zero from me.

Tesla does not make model cars on a yearly basis, nor do they feel the need to make up a new car to fit the change of the season. If they want to change a vehicle, the update the platform as a whole. Many Tesla models have been updated to fit advances in engineering within Tesla - it's just Tesla doesn't brag about this. The other companies don't do this because they are more focused on perpetuating a consumerist mentality of getting the latest and greatest. Also, Tesla has a vehicle for almost every class of vehicle (and every vehicle comes with several options), that is not indicative of a small catalogue\n\nTesla does dabble in hobbies, but if you think self driving is a hobby then you are delusional. If you think solar walls are a hobby, you are delusional. Until they are proven out, I will accept that solar panels and robots are more of a hobby, but even still, the switch to profitability within a given segment can happen over night. Tesla proves this with their car sales\n\nElon does not have a fake resume, and aside from that, CEOs are not required to have a \"resume\". Elon has a bachelor's degree in physics and economics - decidedly more education that Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, or Steve Jobs. Elon also has a plethora of companies under his belt, most notably the advances in aerospace that Space X has generated. Does he have flops, yes, in fact we all do. We are measured by our failures and our successes - and also what we do in the face of failure, and how we rise to overcome it\n\nI have never stated that legacy automotive companies have not revolutionized their industry, obviously they did at some point, and that is why they are as large as they are. What I am stating, is that their pace or revolution has been put to shame by Tesla's. Material Science - Tesla has some of the most robust battery packs in the industry, Tesla created one of the most advanced computer chips for their vehicles, Tesla created Dojo to train their neural network on a massive data set that legacy companies dream off. Protection / safety: Tesla uses Dojo to train Teslas to face thousands of potential car crashes using smart technology that legacy companies don't have, Tesla batteries are (despite popular misconception) safer on average. If every time a Ford blew up we had an article about it, there would be an article every couple of hours... Funny how much attention having Elon as a CEO unjustly gives your battery packs... Revolutionary Manufacturing: Tesla created their vehicles with fewer casts than legacy companies, in fact, they are on track to reduce this to two casts. Sure, there have been manufacturer issues that occur at a much higher pace than legacy companies, but this is the cost of growing your company at a +50% rate annualized. These things are being accounted for and reeled in\n\nAnd yes, I'm very aware of Boston Dynamics, and I'm aware that their robotics department is phenomenal. I'm also aware of the fact that all of their robots have an astronomical cost when compared to Tesla's robot. Tesla wants to make a robot for 40k, they don't want to make one for 500k. Just like how Space X revolutionized the cost of rockets. Sure, NASA has great rockets, but Space X caught up and surpassed then - while spending less per rocket\n\nCheck your facts before you call me delusional, nice to see you'd rather attack my character than come to terms with some actual research.

Formal education is an imperfect indicator of intellect, talent, capability. What I do care about in a CEO is honesty. Nobody is perfectly honest all the time. But Elon is a habitual liar. He’s been dishonest about his family’s background in Apartheid times, his achievements, product launch times, his intention to sell shares, his plans to take Tesla private, … \n\nHeck, he’s even been strong-arming his way into „co-founder“ status more than once. https://www.motorbiscuit.com/elon-musk-wanted-tesla-co-founder-badly-took-lawsuit-make-legal-paper/\n\nIt’s a pattern with him that there is always more claim than substance. \n\nFollowing that pattern, he’s managed to always dangle some hyped-up idea in front of investors‘ faces whenever the share price needed a boost.

For Pete‘s sake, some people thought it was reasonable for Tesla to have a P/E of 190 in 2021, or close to 1000 in 2020. \n\nMeanwhile, *real* tech stocks typcially have a P/E slightly below 20. \n\nAnd a company like Honda, which designs, develops and builds everything from scooters to jet planes, and which has proven time and again that it can compete in new markets, gets a P/E of under 8. \n\nBy the way, Tesla gets about 150 to 250 patents granted per year. Honda gets about 500 - *per quarter*. \n\nThe claim that Tesla is a tech company and deserves an astronomical P/E, while the rest of the automotive industry is not, is utter nonsense.

Any company making announcements like “we’ve partnered with AMD/Nvidia/intel to get GPUs” is openly stating they aren’t trying to even compete. \n\nSolving self driving is going to add $1 trillion+ to SOME company’s stock price, probably way more over time. Any ‘partner’ that could solve this is already working on it themselves and won’t give that value over to the carmaker. \n\n\nLong way to say, Mercedes announcement is marketing speak based on SAE levels.

I expected maybe a year later.\n\nThe pandemic set many things back a year. They didn’t predict that. So now let’s update their hope for end of 2021 to hope for end of 2022, and my expectation end of 2023. It looks like they will make that.\n\nI wonder if one of the big differences between how people think about it is just time. Some thinking if it doesn’t deliver in 1-2 years then that confirms it sucks. I’m looking at 10-20 years+. Certainly they could fail. Elon could probably end up in sleep deprived insanity. But if they don’t fail I expect they’ll be much more valuable.\n\nSpaceX has made great progress with their rocket improvements and starlink is amazing. \nIMO you can’t really fake and hype your way into successful space missions.\n\nI wish I could invest in SpaceX but they aren’t public.

As in I'm glad they don't have a dealer network as cutting middle men out would be awesome but the benefit to me is I'd expect to pay less and have a streamlined experience but I still pay just as much because Tesla takes the profits.\n\nUnions I see as a good thing if a company is abusing it's workforce but yes technically a consumer might benefit from less overhead if the auto maker passes on the costs savings  of no union. Tesla doesn't and abuses it's workforce.\n\nData is only useful if what you are collecting is valuable. Turns out 2D images aren't that useful compared to the 3D data of Lidar. \n\nAll the app stuff while neat I can do on all my tablets. I'd find it a hindrance and distraction  as a driver with someone messing with my console screen for extended periods of time. There is also the downside of no physical knobs which might turn a few off.\n\nThe charging network is nice but only if you cannot put a charger in your home. Most don't need a charger network unless you travel long distances. The charging at home is huge for me as I'd save let's say 30 minutes a month / 6 hours of my life per year avoiding fueling but I can get this from any EV. I know the importance of this for those worries about range or the need for a fill up but for me it doesn't benefit me as I rarely travel long distances.\n\nI connect to zoom on my phone. It seems good enough that no one cares that my car does it.\n\nI'm not one that likes to be spied on via telematics. Maybe could benefit from cost savings but if history teaches me anything the price drop would only be temporary until we are all tracked in our cars and cannot drive without it.\n\nI don't see myself spying on my car much but no doubt it's useful like all cameras are in a car when things go wrong. Mostly I use insurance for that though. Pet mode is useful too for somr but I have no pets. The light stuff is a bit flashy and not useful to me. I'd try it once and forget about it. I do like interior lights for a luxury feel but it's a nice to have that many auto makers offer.\n\nTesla's FSD just isn't there yet and I suspect it will take much longer than Musk wants everyone to believe. I suspect it sells well because many believed Musk would deliver but still not there yet.\n\nI do like the self updating but only if they don't brick my car. It's not enough of a selling point for me though to buy it. \n\nIn the end realistically they should be able to offer a cheaper car for less because they are out manufacturing other car manufacturers with new techniques but that all went out the window with the pandemic and them ratcheting prices up aggressively.

Tesla actually has pretty poor quality for its price range, and it’s trying the Apple method of locking down the ecosystem and limiting options/customizability. Maybe it’ll work for them, but I don’t think it will with their quality issues and options range. \n\nMarket share - Tesla has a huge chunk of EV market share. That makes it exponentially harder to increase market share, while making it very easy to lose market share. Now it is absolutely true that the EV market is rapidly expanding so even decreased market share will still bring greatly expanding sales and income - but again, this is also the case for all the competitors in the field so valuation will still settle down to be within the realm of other EV/car manufacturers. \n\nTesla can only keep it’s unreasonable valuation if it unendingly continues to create market disruptions with new successful tech and new breakthroughs - an almost impossible task to keep up ad finem. Unless they can pull that off, their valuation will settle down to PE levels of others in the industry, with just a little wiggle room based on their quality, brand, patents, etc. \n\nAnd, of course, this isn’t even getting into the subject of the brand image being guided by Elon…\n\nThey’ve done world changing things to personal transportation and have had fantastic success, but it’s just not sustainable to keep their PE and valuation anywhere near where it currently is.

{"title": "BlackRock says we’re all doomed. It’s being optimistic. The world’s largest asset manager has forecast systemic economic chaos. The reality", "selftext": "https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/blackrock-asset-management-economy-prediction-inflation-recession/\n\nThe working assumption, for governments and central banks across the world, is that at some point soon everything will get back to ‘normal’ – our economies will return to either pre-pandemic or, sometimes, even pre-2008 crash levels.\n\nThese beliefs are reinforced by media economics commentary and across political parties.\n\nBut what if they’re wrong? The world’s largest asset manager, overseeing $10trn in assets across the globe, thinks we are, instead, entering a period of increased risk and uncertainty, defined by unavoidable recession and much higher inflation.\n\nBlackRock – a well-connected, influential and hugely profitable pillar of global capitalism – made the predictions in its ‘2023 Global Investment Outlook’ report.\n\nIt states: “The Great Moderation, the four-decade period of largely stable activity and inflation, is behind us.”\n\nInstead, BlackRock forecasts a new regime with a “brutal trade-off” – falling living standards for the many becoming profits for the few.\n\nThis reality, of a world undergoing fundamental transformations and disrupting our settled modes of existence, has so far barely entered the economic mainstream.\n\nFor BlackRock to break with this consensus might, potentially, be one of the first signs of a broader shift in how major institutions in the Western economies view the world.\nSystemic chaos\n\nAnnual food inflation in the UK rose to 13.3% – an all-time high – last month, according to trade body the British Retail Consortium, ahead of the official government figures out later this month.\n\nThis situation – though slightly worse in the UK due to a flawed Brexit deal and the falling value of the pound (critical as a major food importer) – is common across the globe. Even as wholesale energy prices have dropped from their summer 2022 peak, the price of food everywhere is soaring. United Nations’ forecasts show a major risk of widespread famine in the Global South over the next year, with harvests continuing to underperform.\n\nThis global spike in prices over the past 18 months was initially described by the economic establishment as “transitory”. Then, as inflation continued remorselessly upwards, familiar explanations reappeared: notably, excessive worker power (but real wages in the Global North are still falling) and excessive printing of money through quantitative easing (but we’ve been running QE since 2009).\n\n\n\nThe economic profession as a whole, and institutions such as the major central banks, have typically written down the obvious evidence of global instability as temporary factors, rather than something more systemic.\n\nThis means we’re trapped with central banks that still think pushing up interest rates to induce a recession is a smart way to bring down inflation. We have governments committed to holding down wages and salaries while allowing profits to explode.\n\nBut BlackRock believes the world is now “shaped by supply that involves brutal trade-offs” – in other words, the world economy is less effective at supplying goods and services than it was.\n\nThe after-effects of the pandemic have caused supply chain problems, as we all know, but they also think an ageing population means fewer workers, pushing up the cost of labour; that “geopolitical tensions” will disrupt global supply chains; and that the shift to net-zero carbon emissions will involve “demand and supply mismatches”.\n\nPut all this together, and BlackRock thinks inflation will come down to the 2% level we’ve been used to only if central banks are prepared to ‘crush’ their economies into a severe recession. Since that’s unlikely, inflation will stay much higher than we are used to – combined with a miserable recession over the next year or so.\nMassive profits for the lucky few\n\nBut BlackRock’s predictions don’t cover everything.\n\nIts report misses the longer-term effects of Covid – both in terms of the impact on healthcare and, as we’re currently seeing, continuing waves of infection.\n\n\n\n\nIt also misses, critically, the wider ecological impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss and resource depletion.\n\nIt is possible to imagine a world where peace returns rapidly to Ukraine, and the subsequent disruptions to global food and fertiliser trade are reduced. It is not possible to imagine a world where climate change and ecological destruction are thrown into reverse – indeed, some of the effects felt today, notably, biodiversity loss, are irreversible.\n\nThis twofold combination has led ecologist Nicholas Beuret to describe a “climate supercycle” of food shortages and rising prices running well into the future. (A recent episode of my podcast ‘Macrodose’ examines the coming food shortages for UK farmers.)\n\nAnd, finally, BlackRock misses the extreme profits that shortages over the last year have generated for a select few multinationals, such as those supplying oil and gas.\n\nIt's the last part that’s critical. A more unstable world affects everyone, but it will affect everyone differently.\n\nFor most of us, on the wrong side of food price hikes and extreme weather, the future is not great. But for the lucky few, shortages have been turned, through price rises, into massive profits.", "id": "107c8t3", "created_utc": 1673264071.0, "score": 1066, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 425, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|901|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "And I bet BlackRock has the right fund you can invest in to protect and hedge against this economic collapse.", "score": 1705, "replies": [{"body": "Better yet, sell all your stocks so BlackRock can buy them on the cheap.", "score": 505, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 407, "replies": [{"body": "About one third of all American pensions are managed by BlackRock", "score": 110, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 136, "replies": [{"body": "I'm gonna use it so much from now on.\nThank you kind and funny stranger.", "score": 47, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "RACIST!!!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What did they say?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Double play!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not Blues nor Rock neither 🎸", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "An immoral company that serves a whole generation of Americans.

The big airplane, space and defence contractor who’s actually doing pretty well the last couple of weeks compared to the overall decline in the markets. \n\nIn my simple mind this raised a red flag. I once learned that in any recession climate never invest in airplane or construction companies because they are the first ones to lose big.\n\n*“If there's an S&P 500 stock that might surprise investors with its demonstrated poor track record in recent recessions, it's aircraft maker Boeing.*\n\n*Shares of the company that's part of a near oligopoly for commercial airplanes is a dud in recessions. Shares have dropped an average 40.1% in the past five recessions. That's the worst showing of any S&P 500 stock in that time. It's surprising, too, as Boeing typically carries a big backlog of plane orders.”*\n\n\\[source: [https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-avoid-stocks-like-the-plague-when-the-recession-starts/](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-avoid-stocks-like-the-plague-when-the-recession-starts/) \\]\n\nAllright, so we have a down streak of 5/5 for every past 5 recessions. \n\nSo how is Boeing doing at the moment?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wfneukc9j0ba1.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ba1162e4f33e06a34cc3b6cd1fb174a708afe57\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvrctjncj0ba1.png?width=943&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7cfc732597b40d9da375bb336a65b7a17759371\n\nAs you can see they are climbing out of the recession hole on a steep incline. \n\nBut it doesn't make sense.

It had little redundancy protection, and the several crashes could have been completely avoided if Boeing had of either tested and fully thought through the MCAS system, put a bit of money into developing a better more modern flight control, or even just telling airlines about the MCAS system, and explaining MCAS in the planes manual. Pilots had no idea MCAS even existed, and Boeing tried to keep MCAS a secret because it was such a poorly thought out system, then had to embarrassingly admit that they intentionally left MCAS out of the manuals.\n\nFor that, I think they’re a sleezy company, and I don’t trust them in their future engineering. If they could let MCAS slide (when insider staff had already voiced their concerns about it, but were effectively told to shut up), I really can’t trust that Boeing won’t cut corners with another poorly thought out system.\n\nAlso, the 737 Max was just a poorly designed plane, that was rushed and desperately put in production, to try and rival airbus’ A320 Neo. Like the 737 was awfully thought out compared to the a320 neo, it’s actually comedic.\n\nAirbus wanted to improve upon the a320, their short haul airline option. They completely redesigned the fuselage, to make it bigger, it could carry more fuel, fit more passengers onboard and go faster, and to accompany all of this they had bigger, better engines.\n\nBoeing’s answer to this was to take the 737 (their short haul airline option), change absolutely nothing, not even alter the fuselage, and just stick some bigger engines on it, but to fit the bigger engines under the wings, they just moved the engines forward instead of altering the wing design to house the engine, this was a terrible mistake because it shifted the weight balance wayyy forward, which was a big contributor to the pilots not being able to save the planes when MCAS failed, because the plane naturally wants to nosedive due to the poor weight balance of the plane\n\nMCAS was essentially speaking, the poor flight control system designed to counter this fact that the plane constantly wants to nosedive due to the weight imbalance, so when the badly designed flight control system was slapped on the plane to allow the badly designed engine mounting to even work, it was a recipe for disaster\n\nHow on earth can you trust this company to not cut corners in the future, and not even just cut corners, but do so without even thinking it through?\n\nWhat this shows is that airbus once again, proved themselves to be better. The A320 Neo is better on every stretch of the imagination compared to the 737-Max, especially considering airbus was the first to make the jump on improving their a320, and prioritising passenger safety over cutting. Airbus has been better for years. Boeing isn’t innovative at all, their only saving grace is that their name is the biggest, and it’s ‘MURICAN! so naturally the US government will try to keep them afloat regardless, because Boeing is an American national pride and it would be incredibly embarrassing for congress if Boeing fell out of popularity and airbus, a European manufacturer, ruled supreme in america.\n\nAirbus > Boeing on every stretch of the imagination.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Another Max will crash.
