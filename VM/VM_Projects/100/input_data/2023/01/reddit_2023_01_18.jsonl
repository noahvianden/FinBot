When trying to show the Model X could park itself with no driver, a test car crashed into a fence in Tesla’s parking lot, he said.\n\n“The intent of the video was not to accurately portray what was available for customers in 2016. It was to portray what was possible to build into the system,” Tesla's lawyer said, according to a transcript of his testimony seen by Reuters.\n\nWhen Tesla released the video, Musk tweeted, “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway to streets, then finds a parking spot.”\n\nTesla faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny over its driver assistance systems.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice began a criminal investigation into Tesla’s claims that its electric vehicles can drive themselves in 2021, after a number of crashes, some of them fatal, involving Autopilot, Reuters has reported.\n\nThe New York Times reported in 2021 that Tesla engineers had created the 2016 video to promote Autopilot without disclosing that the route had been mapped in advance or that a car had crashed in trying to complete the shoot, citing anonymous sources.\n\nWhen asked if the 2016 video showed the performance of the Tesla Autopilot system available in a production car at the time, Elluswamy said, \"It does not.\"\n\nElluswamy was deposed in a lawsuit against Tesla over a 2018 crash in Mountain View, California, that killed Apple engineer Walter Huang. \"\n\n\nWhat do you guys make of all this? Is everyone still permabullsih on Tesla or are the tides turning against them? Of course Elon is no longer chairman so doesnt have as much control as previously, however he does still have significant control of the company and bad PR for him often means bad PR for Tesla. The two are almost inextricably linked given his holdings.\n\nPersonally I don't want to touch anything this man is involved with and haven't done so for a good year now, and that seems to be working pretty well.

Look at V10 vs V11, etc.  So each version may improve slower and slower, but then they release a new version which is a step change better and that improves quickly, then slower over time.

Frankly, if I look at something like a major index fund, say SPY, and it tanks.  That's a pretty good sign.  I like looking at weighted moving average and direction indicators because they show general sentiment of the value and the momentum of change.  A year ago, big index stocks like SPY went negative.  Sentiment went negative and momentum was present.  This happened last the December before last.  And what happened since then?  It dropped and kept dropping.\n\nWhere has this shown before?\n\nWell, it happened once for the 2008 recession, it happened once for the Covid outbreak, and it happened once at the end of 2021.\n\nThis seems to be a pretty solid indicator of recessions.\n\nIs there good news?\n\nYeah, kind of.\n\nMoving average and momentum is finally transitioning back towards the zero point and we should soon be positive again.  And direction indicators have just barely crossed positive for the first time since 2021.  We're still relatively neutral though, so you aren't going to see any big run right now.  However, late February or early March might be a good time to finally move cash back into the market.  We are that close, finally.\n\nNow, this year is going to be goofy.\n\nWe're going to see three main phases over the next year.\n\nFirst, companies have set new, conservative pricing for the 2023 season.  Material costs are finally dropping back down, and what you'll see is a shift of high sell prices paired with falling material prices.  You'll see companies reap a moderate profit throughout this year.  Although, this may not be fully realized in scope until costs are reviewed next in prep for updating 2024 pricing structures.\n\nSecond, we have been in a long game of catch up due to Covid shutdowns.  There are still supply chain shortages in various areas, but many areas have ramped up and seemed to have largely met needs.  The gray area here is going to be sales numbers through 2023 if demand is now met.  2021 and 2022 were years of huge demand and lack of supply.  2023 may be an excess of supply and a decrease of demand.  We might see light sales in certain sectors.  Companies might have bought into capital equipment, personnel, etc. to meet the 2021 and 2002 demand only to find they now have excess capacity and possibly depts.  It's hard to say how this will hit markets.  I suspect this will be relatively light, but there will be some companies sitting in kind of a bad spot.\n\nThird, the big change will come in 2024.  Like I said, new pricing will be reviewed and set come this fall and will go live for most companies Jan 1 of 2024.  This is a yearly cycle that a LOT of companies follow, so you kind of see this mass change.  It's also very likely why we saw the big hit late 2021.  This was the first time companies actually reviewed the years financials and went \"holy crap, our margins are terrible!\"  Companies could have seen a comfy 40% sales margin half, go to zero, or even go negative.  Material costs skyrocketed and ate all of it away.  Companies saw this in Sept-Oct of 2021, many making immediate changes right then, and others pushed price increases up through the end of 2021 and at the start of 2022.  This is exactly when the public felt the price hit for the first time.  Now back to 2024.  2024 will be the first time materials will have sufficiently dropped to warrant a sell price decrease.  You will see many companies lower prices come Jan 1 2024, and this will be market wide.  This will be the first time the public feels actual relief and will also be the first time feeling an increase in buying power in quite some time.  This will be big, and it should promote new consumerism too.  2024 is where I expect to see the big bull wave sweeping through.

Cut losses when incurred, you’ll have to decide what your risk tolerance is and where to cut em loose. For me it’s around 40%, a lot of people say 50%.\n\nAlso, can’t say enough about snowball effect. Lots of little wins are a lot better than one or two little wins plus a bunch of losses in pursuit of huge plays. Sometimes I sell too early and that sucks (me, today on MSFT puts) but honestly it’s the price you pay to continue winning consistently. Once I set rules for myself and followed them consistently, that really did a lot for me as far as staying green. For me the toughest part was making rules and sticking to them even when my emotions were going nuts. You’ll miss out on some gains being more conservative but you’ll also save yourself a lot of losses.\n\nAnyways good luck out there.

Learn how to use the TTM SQUEEZE indicator. I only day trade ODTE and I stopped trading for a while during the bear market and just started again a few weeks ago. I have turned 200$ into over 4000$. I wouldn’t be able to do that without the TTM Squeeze indicator. Let me say, I do have a really good thinkorswim scanner, however I only enter trade that fire a squeeze on the 30 minute time frame within the first 15-20 minutes of opening. Today it was tickers AI, and AXP. On Jan 27th it was AMZN and SQ. And on January 23rd I did spy calls. I can’t share my scanner publicly but if you are interested I’m willing to talk privately. Basically every Friday I get alerted a few stocks and I pick which ever one looks like it has most profit potential and load up on options within 15 minutes of opening. The 30 min squeeze as well as my scanner always gives me stocks that are straight runners for the first half of the day at least.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Which app is this?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Don’t stop", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Have you think about selling options ? 15 to 39 to 45 days out .
