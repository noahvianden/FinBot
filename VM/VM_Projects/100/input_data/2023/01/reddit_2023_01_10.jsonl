The tool is a natural language processing model, meaning it is designed to generate text that appears as though a human wrote it.\n\nThe AI model, itself a variant of the GPT-3 family of large language models, has been used for everything from developing code to writing college essays.\n\nA bet on ChatGPT could help Microsoft boost its efforts in web search, a market dominated by Google.

Brian Nowak, the bank's lead analyst on Alphabet, wrote that language models could take market share \"and disrupt Google's position as the entry point for people on the Internet.\"\n\nOpenAI, which was founded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Sam Altman in 2015, launched its ChatGPT to the public in late November.

Financial details of the Microsoft deal weren't disclosed at the time, but MIT Tech Review reported in 2020 that the $1 billion was split between cash and credits for Azure, Microsoft's cloud business.\r  \nApart from the potential huge ROI, Microsoft's deal only looks smarter as more details emerge. The Information reported that the company would integrate ChatGPT into Bing. As Insider's Emilia David writes, that will potentially end Google's two decades search dominance. Gil Luria, director of research at DA Davidson, an investment bank, wrote in a note that \"Microsoft deserves a premium valuation relative to the market\" with its \"investment in OpenAI as a source of a potential huge upside.\"\r  \n\"We believe Microsoft's investment in OpenAI will translate to significant underappreciated upside,\" Luria wrote. He added that  \"the unprecedented activity\" in ChatGPT is \"translating to incremental volumes for Azure.\" OpenAI expects $1 billion in revenue by 2024, according to Reuters. DA Davidson expects those levels to increase significantly.\r  \nIn December 2015, Sam Altman, Elon Musk, and others announced the formation of non-profit venture OpenAI. The organization stated it would \"freely collaborate\" with other institutions and researchers by making its patents and research open to the public. Musk resigned from the board in February 2018. \r  \nIn 2019, OpenAI transitioned from non-profit when Microsoft announced an investment package of US$1 billion into the company. The company distributed equity to its employees, and OpenAI then announced its intention to commercially license its technologies.\r  \n**Elon Musk slams Microsoft**\r  \nMicrosoft announced that it was exclusively licensing GPT-3, a natural language AI-powered tool made by OpenAI. Elon Musk voiced his discontent on Twitter that OpenAI — the AI research firm he helped found — is exclusively licensing its famous natural language software GPT-3 to Microsoft. Microsoft announcement was met with dismay on Twitter from users who had thought OpenAI's mission statement was to make technologies like GPT-3 widely available to the public. Elon Musk, who cofounded the company in 2015 as a non-profit AI research body, was among those who criticized the deal.\r  \n\r  \n\"This does seem like the opposite of open.

Last year, Microsoft made a major $1 billion investment in OpenAI, a deal which now involves being the exclusive licensee for GPT-3. Which raises some interesting questions about how exactly Microsoft has acquired this exclusive license. A Microsoft spokesperson tells The Verge that its exclusive license gives it unique access to the underlying code of GPT-3, which contains technical advancements it hopes to integrate into its products and services.\n\nSo, while other companies and researchers may be able to access GPT-3 through OpenAI’s API, only Microsoft will reap the profits of getting to make use of all the AI advancements that went into making it such a sophisticated program. It’s not clear what that will look like right now, but what is clear is that Microsoft sees immense value in OpenAI’s work and likely wants to be the first (and, in this case, only) company to take its largely experimental research work and translate it into real-world product advancements.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "bAIng", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lets just go back to Asking Jeeves", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bing Image search was the best for porn though.

Especially in the north east US. \n\nRealtors were forcing people to sign what’s called an “Escalation Clause” which basically is an automatic bidding war for houses. It says I am willing to increase my offer to buy this house by $2000, 3000, 5000 or even 7,000 over any additional bid up to $X figure. So I want to buy a house that’s on the market right now for $200,000 I’m willing to pay up to $270,000. The escalation clause says if someone comes in and bids $268,000 I will increase MY original bid to $270,000 or risk losing the sale. This is the inflation of the housing prices. I just spent $270,000 for a house only worth $200,000. \n\nAppraisers contributed to this problem because they would then appraise this exact same house (that probably sold 2 years prior for $180,000 mind you) for the escalated price of $270,000 therefore allowing other properties in the area to use THAT $270,000 value for a $200,000 house, to appraise like properties in the same freaking neighborhood. \n\nRealtors also turned they’re back on ANYONE who was looking for a VA, FHA or other assisted mortgage because those “took too long to close”. Which is a nice way of saying “I’m not getting my commission check fast enough”. This closed off a huge amount of potential homebuyers who needed government assistance to buy a home and made prices skyrocket to a point where they couldn’t afford them anymore. So what happens if someone can’t buy a home? They try to rent. But what if rent pricing skyrocket because it’s matching the housing market and landlords want to get paid? They end up paying more than what a mortgage would cost and then realize they can’t keep up with rent anymore. Now what? Now you have someone who’s essentially homeless because they couldn’t go to a realtor to buy a house with a government assisted mortgage (VA or FHA). \n\nI apologize for all the numbers and the long rant.

{"title": "Powell stresses need for Fed’s political independence while tackling inflation", "selftext": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday stressed the need for the central bank to be free of political influence while it tackles persistently high inflation.\n\nIn a speech delivered to Sweden’s Riksbank, Powell noted that stabilizing prices requires making tough decisions that can be unpopular politically.\n\n“Price stability is the bedrock of a healthy economy and provides the public with immeasurable benefits over time. But restoring price stability when inflation is high can require measures that are not popular in the short term as we raise interest rates to slow the economy,” the chair said in prepared remarks.\n\n“The absence of direct political control over our decisions allows us to take these necessary measures without considering short-term political factors,” he added.\n\nPowell’s remarks came at a forum to discuss central bank independence, and were to be followed by a question-and-answer session.\n\nThe speech did not contain any direct clues about where policy is ahead for a Fed that raised interest rates seven times in 2022, for a total of 4.25 percentage points, and has indicated that more increases likely are on the way this year.\n\nWhile criticism of Fed actions by elected leaders is often done in quieter tones, the Powell Fed has faced vocal opposition from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump ripped the central bank when it was raising rates during his administration, while progressive leaders such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have criticized the current round of hikes. President Joe Biden has largely resisted commenting on Fed moves while noting that it is primarily the central bank’s responsibility to tackle inflation.\n\nPowell has repeatedly stressed that political factors have not weighed on his actions.\n\nIn another part of Tuesday’s speech, he addressed calls from some lawmakers for the Fed to use its regulatory powers to address climate change. Powell noted that the Fed should “stick to our knitting and not wander off to pursue perceived social benefits that are not tightly linked to our statutory goals and authorities.”\n\nWhile the Fed has asked big banks to examine their financial readiness in case of major climate-related events such as hurricanes and floods, Powell said that’s as far as it should go.\n\n“Decisions about policies to directly address climate change should be made by the elected branches of government and thus reflect the public’s will as expressed through elections,” he said. “But without explicit congressional legislation, it would be inappropriate for us to use our monetary policy or supervisory tools to promote a greener economy or to achieve other climate-based goals. We are not, and will not be, a ‘climate policymaker.’”\n\nThe Fed this year will, however, launch a pilot program that calls for the nation’s six biggest banks to take part in a “scenario analysis” aimed at testing institutions’ stability in the event of major climate events.\n\nThe exercise will take place apart from the so-called stress tests that the Fed uses to test how banks would fare under hypothetical economic downturns. Participating institutions are Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/powell-stresses-need-for-feds-political-independence-while-tackling-inflation.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/powell-stresses-need-for-feds-political-independence-while-tackling-inflation.html)", "id": "108atgr", "created_utc": 1673360008.0, "score": 334, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 178, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|95|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Jerome Powell, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has stressed the need for the central bank to be free of political influence while it tackles persistently high inflation.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Bullish", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "🤣 no", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "So far today… bullish.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Just because SPY is up 0.4% doesn't mean what he said was bullish.
