{"title": "Worldwide smartphone shipments declined 18.3%, largest ever drop in a quarter; Apple (-14.9%), Samsung (-15.6%), and Xiaomi (-26.3%)", "selftext": "NEEDHAM, Mass., January 25, 2023 ‚Äì Worldwide smartphone shipments declined 18.3% year over year to 300.3 million units in the fourth quarter of 2022 (4Q22), according to preliminary data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. The drop marks the largest-ever decline in a single quarter and contributed to a steep 11.3% decline for the year. 2022 ended with shipments of 1.21 billion units, which represents the lowest annual shipment total since 2013 due to significantly dampened consumer demand, inflation, and economic uncertainties. This tough close to the year puts the 2.8% recovery expected for 2023 in serious jeopardy with heavy downward risk to the forecast.\n\n\"We have never seen shipments in the holiday quarter come in lower than the previous quarter. However, weakened demand and high inventory caused vendors to cut back drastically on shipments,\" said Nabila Popal, research director with IDC ' s Worldwide Tracker team. \"Heavy sales and promotions during the quarter helped deplete existing inventory rather than drive shipment growth. Vendors are increasingly cautious in their shipments and planning while realigning their focus on profitability. Even Apple, which thus far was seemingly immune, suffered a setback in its supply chain with unforeseen lockdowns at its key factories in China. What this holiday quarter tells us is that rising inflation and growing macro concerns continue to stunt consumer spending even more than expected and push out any possible recovery to the very end of 2023.\"\n\n\"We continue to witness consumer demand dwindle as refresh rates climb past 40 months in most major markets,\" said Anthony Scarsella, research director with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. \"With 2022 declining more than 11% for the year, 2023 is set up to be a year of caution as vendors will rethink their portfolio of devices while channels will think twice before taking on excess inventory. However, on a positive note, consumers may find even more generous trade-in offers and promotions continuing well into 2023 as the market will think of new methods to drive upgrades and sell more devices, specifically high-end models.\"\n\nTop 5 Companies, Worldwide Smartphone Shipments, Market Share, and Year-Over-Year Growth, Q4 2022 (Preliminary results, shipments in millions of units)\n\nCompany\n\n4Q22 Shipment Volumes*\n\n4Q22 Market Share*\n\n4Q21 Shipment Volumes\n\n4Q21 Market Share\n\nYear-Over-Year Change*\n\n1.\tApple\n\n72.3\n\n24.1%\n\n85.0\n\n23.1%\n\n-14.9%\n\n2.\tSamsung\n\n58.2\n\n19.4%\n\n69.0\n\n18.8%\n\n-15.6%\n\n3.\tXiaomi\n\n33.2\n\n11.0%\n\n45.0\n\n12.2%\n\n-26.3%\n\n4.\tOPPO\n\n25.3\n\n8.4%\n\n30.1\n\n8.2%\n\n-15.9%\n\n5.\tvivo\n\n22.9\n\n7.6%\n\n28.3\n\n7.7%\n\n-18.9%\n\nOthers\n\n88.3\n\n29.4%\n\n110.2\n\n30.0%\n\n-19.8%\n\nTotal\n\n300.3\n\n100.0%\n\n367.6\n\n100.0%\n\n-18.3%\n\nSource: IDC Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, January 25, 2023\n\nTop 5 Companies, Worldwide Smartphone Shipments, Market Share, and Year-Over-Year Growth, CY2022 (Preliminary results, shipments in millions of units)\n\nCompany\n\n2022 Shipment Volumes*\n\n2022 Market Share*\n\n2021 Shipment Volumes\n\n2021 Market Share\n\nYear-Over-Year Change*\n\nSamsung\n\n260.9\n\n21.6%\n\n272.1\n\n20.0%\n\n-4.1%\n\nApple\n\n226.4\n\n18.8%\n\n235.8\n\n17.3%\n\n-4.0%\n\nXiaomi\n\n153.1\n\n12.7%\n\n191.0\n\n14.0%\n\n-19.8%\n\nOPPO\n\n103.3\n\n8.6%\n\n133.6\n\n9.8%\n\n-22.7%\n\nvivo\n\n99.0\n\n8.2%\n\n128.3\n\n9.4%\n\n-22.8%\n\nOthers\n\n362.7\n\n30.1%\n\n399.1\n\n29.3%\n\n-9.1%\n\nTotal\n\n1205.5\n\n100.0%\n\n1359.8\n\n100.0%\n\n-11.3%\n\nSource: IDC Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, January 25, 2023\n\nNotes:\n\n‚Ä¢ Data are preliminary and subject to change.\n\nCompany shipments are branded device shipments and exclude OEM sales for all vendors.\n\nThe \"Company\" represents the current parent company (or holding company) for all brands owned and operated as a subsidiary.\n\nFigures represent new shipments only and exclude refurbished units.", "id": "10lvspw", "created_utc": 1674750399.0, "score": 229, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "Not too surprising.

The executive estimated losses will total about $3 billion this year after the streamer took a $978 million hit in the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of $559 million the same quarter last year.\n\n\"We spend quite a bit of money creating content so migrating some of that content as eyeballs move to a more streaming universe ‚Äî we like what we're doing,\" Cavanagh added. \"We think Peacock is absolutely the right strategy for our company.\"\n\nComcast reported fourth quarter earnings that beat on both the top and bottom lines amid greater strength in its broadband and wireless business, in addition to higher advertising and studio unit revenues.\n\nRevenue for the quarter grew to $30.55 billion versus the estimated $30.33 billion, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $0.82 versus the expected $0.77, according to data from Bloomberg.\n\nYet Peacock's mounting losses overshadowed an otherwise upbeat report as adjusted EBITDA for NBCUniversal ‚Äî which includes its TV and film studios, theme parks, and streaming divisions ‚Äî decreased 36.3% to $817 million as a result.\n\nWe wouldn't be investing in Peacock if we didn't think it would return the segment to growth over time...Jeff Shell, NBCUniversal CEO\n\nAfter a challenging 2022 for the industry, investors have zeroed in on how difficult it has been for media giants to reach streaming profitability.\n\nDisney's (DIS) direct-to-consumer division lost a whopping $4 billion-plus in its fiscal 2022, which ended on Oct. 1. Meanwhile Paramount (PARA) told investors streaming losses would total about $1.8 billion in 2022 ‚Äî higher than Wall Street expectations.\n\nWarner Bros.

More likely scenario is Tesla continues to rise and all the legacy manufacturers go down significantly. \n\n> You could then making the assumption that this trend will continue and that it is a good investment. But is that a safe assumption?\n\nThe numbers are pretty basic. There isn't a case for them to make LESS profit. You can argue that margins might drop to 17%, 18% etc. There is flexibility there. We don't know what their margins will be for the year, but they stated over 20% still. \n\nTesla is a good invest long term. Anything can happen this year, even if they are making more money.

They are losing money on ever EV - and that loss is going to increase if they have to decrease prices to compete with Tesla. They are going to be losing ICE sales - not even accounting for macro - but because of EV adoption. On top of that, they have tons of debt. Recession means more defaults on car loans. This hurts Ford/GM/Toyota/others significantly more than Tesla. They also have much smaller margins, which means they have little flexibility with pricing. It is highly likely that Ford and others actually start losing money every quarter, whereas Tesla will just make $20b instead of $30b this year. \n\n> Do you really think Tesla has such a high chance at mainting and Bearing fruit on this so called ‚Äúcompetitive advantage‚Äù that you are willing to pay Almost 10x more for Tesla for every dollar of profit it is making per share than you would for ford?\n\n100%. Ford and all the other guys are too far behind in ramping production in EVs. If Ford was making 1M+ EVs a year today, I think that might be a slightly different story. Ford's P/E will go up as their earnings go down probably faster than their stock price. Ford has no competitive advantage when it comes to making EVs. They have less vertical integration, less experience with scaling EVs, less experience in battery technology, less flexibility when it comes to battery options, etc. The only real advantage someone like Ford has is they have brand loyalty. There will always be people who want a Ford whatever. But they will not be able to keep up with Tesla's cost of production and scale, which means Ford and others will have to become lower volume manufacturers making a few models that people really like at a premium over Tesla. \n\nCEO of Ford himself said they need to vertically integrate like Tesla if they have any chance of competing going forward. By their own statements, Ford won't make money on EVs until 2025. I'm guessing they screwed that estimate up too, as they likely are not accounting for Tesla dropping prices as much as they did and will - so that probably means Ford is going to lose money on every single EV for the next 5 years. \n\nAnd let's not forget Tesla Energy - which is easier to scale than their cars, and has a higher profit margin, and doesn't require big designs. They just need to scale their existing product as-is to make billions per year. \n\nI've said this many times on this sub: Tesla Energy will be worth more than Ford within 12-18 months.

(No one is saying profit won't grow, but the PE will also compress. Cause why pay more for earnings that are at lower margins, slowing revenue, slowing earnings, slowing delivery growth)\n\nAlso.

Their backlog is backup again. From what Musk says... Demand is twice the production in January due to cuts. For this year at least, I don't think they'll have a problem with volume.\n\nAlso, production costs goes down as they make manufacturing more efficient. It's an ever ongoing process to reduce operating costs. If other Chinese companies can sell EVs for 10k... You can bet there's room to be more efficient in that area. There's always room to be cheap..\n\nFor margin, Indeed the cars might not make much margin even with volume increase. I don't think it'll be a loss but it'll be squeezed assuming that they aren't able to make things more efficient and reduce costs. That's only referring to the physical car. However, it's the software that they'll sell alongside it, the FSD, that'll balance that part out. When you buy a Tesla, it doesn't come with FSD. You need to spend an extra 10-20k to enable that download. That's pure margin. How many Tesla owners buy that option on-top of the car will determine margin in upcoming quarters.\n\nThey'll probably still lead EV. Unless they really give up their early advantage, it'll be hard not to lead. Mainly because of FSD, charging stations, well-secured supply chain, etc... Like in a price war, Tesla can't lose in NA. In Europe where there's Chinese cars, they can but not in NA. This combined with rising interest rate... Yeah I don't see em having much of a problem with the demand.\n\nOther companies developing FSD might be better but they'll also be more expensive. Also, a lot of the other cars that have FSD only have it in premapped areas whereas Tesla has for everywhere at your own risk. Their AI seems ahead of the game in terms of cost.\n\nLike the Tesla business strategy is literally to sell a shitty car at cost so that you'll end up getting baited to buy their expensive software.
