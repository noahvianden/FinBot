{"title": "Is ChatGPT a threat to Google? Yahoo refusal to acquire Google give us some hints on what may be on the horizon.", "selftext": "Google is an interesting company. It has strong competitive advantage, is basically a monopoly on the search engine market, with the word \"Google\" that became a verb. Google is soo dominant in its position (Bing is a joke, Firefox is basically financed by Google), is the default search engine on both android, that they own, and ios. The search engine is the centre of Google's eco-system, (Drive, G-mail, Google account, to a smaller extent YouTUube), that make competing with them almost impossible. Even in a \"bad\" year like 2022, made over 60bln in net profits. Nothing to worry about right?\n\nI think chatgpt can be a treat for Google's business model. It is developing very fast, is infinately scalable and is backed by Microsoft. Of course Google is working on it's AI technology, and I am sure what they developed is impressive, I have no doubt that they can become a juggernout in the chatbot/AI space.\n\nHowever we should not confuse CAN with WILL. Embracing this technology would require Google to revolutionise its business model, and find new ways of monetizing its data. Back in the days, Yahoo lost everything for the same reason. They could have acquired Google, a new powerful search engine that delivers search results quickly (for only 1 mln dollars), but they decided to dismiss the better more efficinet solution, that they had no finacial incentive to adopt. They instead decided to make people spend more time on their website where they can be bombarded by ads. Sounds familiar, right?\n\nYahoo still exists, but is nothing like before. Google used to say, \"competition is always one click away\". Maybe they are right.

As you can see in the screenshot, a month ago, the odds were at 35.1%, a week ago it was at 62.6%, yesterday it was at 76.7%, and today, once we received the inflation report, that number has flown to 92%.\n\nSo with that being said, even though we haven't heard anything concrete from the Fed as to whether they'll go for a 25 or a 50 hike, it looks like the market has made up its mind.\n\nThe risk here is obvious. If Powell does decide to go with another 50bps, then there would be a massive sell-off.\n\nAs a side note, the bond market continues to price in a fair chance of rate cuts in the later half of this year. There is only a 10% chance being priced in that the Fed rate is >5% by EOY. This is at a big contrast to what Powell has been saying which is a) No rate cuts in 2023 b) Plan to stay at 5.25% for some extended time.\n\nIn other words, the bond market doesn't believe in what Powell is dishing out, and the market believes that Powell is bluffing.\n\nSource: [https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html)\n\nEdit: Adding more numbers\n\nFor the March 2023 Fed meeting, the market is pricing in a 18% chance that there will be no rate hike. Meaning that the bond market sees a 18% chance of there being a 25bp hike in Feb, and that will be the last hike. But there is a 80.2% chance of there being a 25bp rate hike in Feb and another one in March. If we see the market trend higher over the coming weeks, I would expect to see that 0bp hike in March rising higher than 18%.", "id": "10a624f", "created_utc": 1673546436.0, "score": 516, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 264, "comments": [{"body": "Sounds like a good set up for JPOW to tackle a rally with a 50 basis point hike.", "score": 480, "replies": [{"body": "My cash reserves are waiting for the bloodbath", "score": 128, "replies": [{"body": "Dude same but my fomo is getting out of control", "score": 43, "replies": []}, {"body": "You should start buying best of breed dividend companies", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "My portfolio is 80% divi stocks and my monthly contributions all go towards those", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Care to share any favorites?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "MSFT, O, ARCC, MO, CSCO, PFE, AEP, INTC, UNP, WPC are my top holdings.

It also provided access to the startup’s founder, [Charlie Javice](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/awards/40-under-40-2019-charlie-javice), who joined the New York-based bank as part of the acquisition.\n\nMonths after the transaction closed, JPMorgan said it learned the truth after sending out marketing emails to a batch of 400,000 Frank customers. About 70% of the emails bounced back, the bank said in a [lawsuit filed last month](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-11/jpmorgan-says-it-was-defrauded-in-175-million-frank-acquisition) in federal court.\n\nJavice, who had approached JPMorgan in mid-2021 about a potential sale, lied to the bank about her startup’s scale, the bank alleged. Specifically, after being pressed for confirmation of Frank’s customer base during the due diligence process, Javice used a data scientist to invent millions of fake accounts, according to JPMorgan.\n\n“To cash in, Javice decided to lie, including lying about Frank’s success, Frank’s size, and the depth of Frank’s market penetration in order to induce JPMC to purchase Frank for $175 million,” the bank said. “Javice represented in documents placed in the acquisition data room, in pitch materials, and through verbal presentations \\[that\\] more than 4.25 million students had created Frank accounts.”\n\nInstead of gaining a business with 4.25 million students, JPMorgan had one with “fewer than 300,000 customers,” JPMorgan said in the suit.\n\n## Frank emails\n\nIn the suit, JPMorgan alleged that Javice first asked her engineering chief to create “fake customer details” using algorithms. When he refused, she found a data science professor at a New York-area college to create the accounts, the lender said.\n\nThe bank included incriminating emails between the unnamed professor and Javice in its suit.\n\nFor instance, Javice had allegedly asked the professor, “Will the fake emails look real with an eye check or better to use unique ID?” \n\nJPMorgan had access to the emails because it had acquired Frank’s technology systems as part of the acquisition, according to a person with knowledge of the situation.\n\n## Javice’s defense\n\nA lawyer for Javice told The Wall Street Journal that JPMorgan had “manufactured” reasons to fire her late last year to avoid paying millions of dollars owed to her. Javice has sued JPMorgan, saying the bank should front legal bills she incurred during its internal investigations.\n\n“After JPM rushed to acquire Charlie’s rocketship business, JPM realized they couldn’t work around existing student privacy laws, committed misconduct and then tried to retrade the deal,” attorney Alex Spiro [told the Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-bought-college-financial-aid-platform-for-175-millionand-now-says-most-of-its-users-were-fake-11673470572). “Charlie blew the whistle and then sued.”\n\nSpiro, a partner at Quinn Emanuel, didn’t immediately return a call from CNBC.\n\nJPMorgan spokesman Pablo Rodriguez had this response:\n\n“Our legal claims against Ms. Javice and Mr. Amar are set out in our complaint, along with the key facts,” he said. “Ms. Javice was not and is not a whistleblower. Any dispute will be resolved through the legal process.”\n\n## ‘Pinch me’\n\nThe alleged fraud perpetrated by Javice and one of her executives “materially damaged JPMC in an amount to be proven at trial, but not less than $175 million,” JPMorgan said in its suit.\n\nRegardless of the outcome of this legal scuffle, this is an embarrassing episode for JPMorgan and its CEO, [Jamie Dimon.](https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/) In a bid to fend off encroaching competitors, JPMorgan has gone on a [buying spree of fintech companies in recent years](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/jpmorgan-jpm-fintech-deal-to-acquire-renovite-to-battle-stripe-and-block.html), and Dimon has repeatedly defended his technology investments as necessary ones that will yield good returns.\n\nThe fact that a [young founder](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/awards/40-under-40-2019-charlie-javice) in an industry [known for shaky metrics](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/fintech-startups-2022-2023-a-reckoning-is-upon-us-heres-what-to-expect.html) and a “fake it ’til you make it” ethos managed to allegedly dupe JPMorgan calls into question how stringent the bank’s due diligence process is.\n\nIn an interview at the time of the deal, Javice marveled at how far she had come in just a few years leading her startup.\n\n“Today is my first day employed by someone else, ever,” Javice told CNBC. “I mean it still feels very much like, pinch me, did this really happen?”\n\nAs a result of the legal scuffle, JPMorgan shut down Frank early Thursday morning.\n\n“Frank is no longer available” the website now reads. “To file your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), visit StudentAid.gov.”", "id": "10a82sk", "created_utc": 1673551269.0, "score": 1350, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 214, "comments": [{"body": "If you're going to create fake customers, at least use real emails.", "score": 404, "replies": [{"body": "How's that gonna help when the SSNs are fake ?

I have trouble remembering people's names, never mind their pronouns.

They shouldn't be out in public!\n\nHow is pronouns a threat to humanity and not a pet peeve? I asked for real world problems, mild discomfort isn't a real world problem, it's a mild discomfort at best. How is it threatening to humanity at all?\n\nSay ten years ago, if you repeatedly used a female pronoun for a male, that could be conceived as bullying and not acceptable, with possible consequences depending on the context. The idea you are now forced, in a way that's different from before and super unfair, to say things you would prefer not to, is dumb. You weren't allowed to intentionally insult people before without consequence, the bar has changed because society has become more inclusive leaving less groups to be bullied without consequence. The culture has shifted and people get more freedom, an attempt to include minorities, while those in the majority complain they can't be inconsiderate anymore without consequence which isn't really a net loss of freedom. (I read freedom as the freedom to live your live as you want, not the ability to harass others as you see fit.)\n\nIf everything someone doesn't like is a problem to humanity, then humanity is fucked no matter what. Don't you see that you can't give one real world example of real problems, things that are a threat to humanity?\n\nLook at suicide and depression prevalence in the LGBTQ+ community vs others, I don't think your discomfort is a a problem for humanity, the xenophobia that leads to depression and suicide would tip the scale as being a real problem for humanity and if a society that uses pronouns is more inclusive I would say it's the opposite of a problem, it's a solution to a real world problem.\n\nI don't like how movies are woke, most of the media lately annoys me. I don't like people going to the extreme in the other direction, but I prefer to live in a world were we try to be respectful and don't think it's okay to rape women and beat up gays. I know people who are consumed by being woke, I don't see them unless when I can't avoid them, but the same is true for every type of person I prefer to not spend time with. If your personal preference is perceived as a threat to humanity, then you're not thinking rationally at all.\n\nPeople have to work with all sorts of people at their jobs or when they use services, saying you can't avoid them is insane, think of all the horrible people you are forced to interact with. I don't like people with crooked teeth or that smell bad, so what, I'm not going to say my discomfort is a problem, much less a threat to humanity, it seems an objectively dumb thing to claim.\n\nIf you compare the discomfort people experience using pronouns vs all the harassment the people who want to use pronouns have faced before and are still facing, I think it's quite clear which side has the best case. In one scenario people in minorities aren't consistently reminded they are unlike the others and will be treated differently, which leads to depression and suicide and on the other side a bunch of people feel some discomfort.\n\nMost of this anti-wokeness comes from bigots, the same people who voted for Trump in the USA and spread bullshit in the UK about Brexit.

That's a price hike, caused by inflation.\n\nInflation is by definition the devaluation of a currency, typically by printing too much of it. Too much money chasing too few goods. When a currency is worth less and every one posseses an abundance of it suddenly goods are worth more. Record profits happens all the time during inflation and for that matter BEFORE inflation hit hard so it can hardly be considered the main issue. When there is that much money going around it's going to happen.\n\nAre corporate price hikes completely blameless? No, but most economists believe it's only a minor part of it and the majority bulk comes from printing money at the same time the entire economy shut down and couldn't produce goods. Add in the price of oil going sky high and you can see exactly what happened.\n\nThis idea that companies needed covid as an excuse to be greedy is ridiculous. The government enabled this to happen by printing money out the ass and killing thousands of small businesses. Now companies have inflation as an excuse and less of a competive market to keep them in check.\n\nThe simple fact is the government way overestimated the stimulus, and simultaneously shut down the economy, what was supposed to happen there? Maybe corporations took advantage of it but it's obvious they didn't start this because they literally don't have the power to.\n\n\n\nEdit: Im no economic genius but heres a thought experiment for people who dont understand the concept of supply and demand.\n\nImagine you start a game of monopoly with 6000 dollars instead of 2000 and all the prices remain the same. Sounds like an ideal world right? Suddenly you can buy the most expensive property for 1/15th of your starting cash instead of  1/5th.\n\nSO why not buy everything? You have the cash now, everyone does. Why not buy 15 boardwalks? 400 dollars is chump change that you find laying around. Great redistribution of the wealth! Now everyone owns a home and everyone is rich and has a mansion and owns boardwalk!\n\nPretty good idea right? Except there arent 15 boardwalks, there is only 1. And there are only 28 properties you can buy in total, with their combined cost being slightly less than your starting total in cash.\n\nAnd now remember, your playing this game with other people, most ALL of them had the same idea you did. You arent some kind of genius for figuring out you can buy everything for cheap now. Now imagine what someone could do if instead of starting with 6000 dollars they started with 600,000 dollars. Whats the point of that money when you could virtually own the world? So, it takes about two minutes for the entire board to be bought up, everything is owned, primarily by the the person who started with the most money and you still have cash.\n\nSo what do you do with that cash? Its almost like its become.... worth less? Like Boardwalk should be worth more? It seems it would be foolish not to increase the price of properties?\n\nAnd thus you've found the problem. If their arent price hikes when inflation hits than everyone can buy everything. The problem being that everything is finite. When you begin to apply this logic to real world problems instead of monopoly you can see the diaster it would cause if suddenly supermarkets were ransacked by people who had way too much money and bought as much stuff as possible.\n\nThen imagine the rich, who have an abundance of assets and wealth suddenly no longer want anything to do with the U.S dollar and pump in liquid wealth, plus a lot of assets, into the economy, so they can buy an absolute shit load of whatever the hell they want. Land, Gold, Guns, Food, toilet paper. Whatever. Well now there is even more being flooded into the peoples hands, and corporations still havent budged on the prices.\n\nPretty soon farms, shops, factories, workshops are all overwhelmed from the demand and now there is nothing for people to buy with their insane wealth. People die, literally burning their dollars to stay warm, starved to death with only some paper to survive.\n\nThis is what happened to Venezuela when they imposed price controls and printed out the ass.

Wonder what changed?\n\nCorporations didn't just flick a magic wand and say \"today's the day!\" All at the same time. There isn't some giant conspiracy going around every company lmao.

Why not just sell it instead of let it ruin? Again, raising prices isn't always the most profitable method.

Heres a thought experiment for people who dont understand how supply and demand works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine you start a game of monopoly with 6000 dollars instead of 2000 and all the prices remain the same. Sounds like an ideal world right? Suddenly you can buy the most expensive property for 1/15th of your starting cash instead of 1/5th.\n\nSO why not buy everything? You have the cash now, everyone does. Why not buy 15 boardwalks? 400 dollars is chump change that you find laying around. Great redistribution of the wealth! Now everyone owns a home and everyone is rich and has a mansion and owns boardwalk!\n\nPretty good idea right? Except there arent 15 boardwalks, there is only 1. And there are only 28 properties you can buy in total, with their combined cost being slightly less than your starting total in cash.\n\nAnd now remember, your playing this game with other people, most ALL of them had the same idea you did. You arent some kind of genius for figuring out you can buy everything for cheap now. Now imagine what someone could do if instead of starting with 6000 dollars they started with 600,000 dollars. Whats the point of that money when you could virtually own the world? So, it takes about two minutes for the entire board to be bought up, everything is owned, primarily by the the person who started with the most money and you still have cash.\n\nSo what do you do with that cash? Its almost like its become.... worth less? Like Boardwalk should be worth more? It seems it would be foolish not to increase the price of properties?\n\nAnd thus you've found the problem. If their arent price hikes when inflation hits than everyone can buy everything. The problem being that everything is finite. When you begin to apply this logic to real world problems instead of monopoly you can see the disaster it would cause if suddenly supermarkets were ransacked by people who had way too much money and bought as much stuff as possible.\n\nThen imagine the rich, who have an abundance of assets and wealth suddenly no longer want anything to do with the U.S dollar and pump in liquid wealth, plus a lot of assets, into the economy, so they can buy an absolute shit load of whatever the hell they want. Land, Gold, Guns, Food, toilet paper. Whatever. Well now there is even more being flooded into the peoples hands, and corporations still havent budged on the prices.\n\nPretty soon farms, shops, factories, workshops are all overwhelmed from the demand and now there is nothing for people to buy with their insane wealth. People die, literally burning their dollars to stay warm, starved to death with only some paper to survive.\n\nThis is what happened to Venezuela when they imposed price controls and printed out the ass.

Only if they didn't have leverage, did they either accepted lower profits or closed shop.\n\nIn general, the Federal Reserve in the US is tasked to maintain low inflation. But their primary tool to fight is to set the interest rate. Which is what they are doing. What happens is because interest rates are high, people do less stuff like buying a new house. Fewer people buying new homes means less need for construction workers (thus they have to take a pay cut or move to another profession), less need for materials like timber (and then the lumberjacks and mill workers need to take a paycut or find a different job), and thus inflation will lower, hopefully breaking the inflationary spiral.\n\nOther methods to fight inflation would be to decrease the demands of government on the economy by decreasing government spending, decreasing the costs of basic or improved goods by decreasing input costs (such as encouraging exploitation of natural resources or decreasing the cost of regulatory compliance), or hoping that other members of the International Community increase production and lower the costs of their goods.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Inflation is caused when there is too much money and too few goods to buy with it.\n\nLow interest rates, coupled with depressed supply from COVID's impact on supply chains is probably what did it.\n\nInjecting a shitload of cash, allowing people to skip paying rent also probably a factor.
