Ended last year with about 188,000 employees. Announced cuts of 12,000 recently. Leaves them at 175,000. Still more headcount than they had in 2021. \n\n- Microsoft. Ended last year with about 221,000 employees. Announced cuts of 10,000 recently. Leaves them at roughly 211,000. Comfortably more headcount than they had in 2021. \n\n- Facebook / Meta. Ended last year with about 87,000 employees. Announced cuts of 11,000 recently. Leaves them at 76,000. Still more headcount than they had in 2021. \n\nSo my takeaways are:\n- The headlines of ‚Äòwoah 10,000 jobs cut‚Äô sound like a lot. And they obviously are and each of those jobs is a person who now is out of work, not minimising that. But in % terms they‚Äôre not that big a reduction when you see the context of how big these workforces are.\n\n- All these companies are still comfortably larger in terms of headcount than they were just 2 years ago. Facebook is double the headcount it was in 2018. Google and Microsoft aren‚Äôt quite 2x as big but aren‚Äôt far off.\n\n- Revenue and profit haven‚Äôt fallen at these giant co‚Äôs yet but they seem to be cutting in advance of that happening based on their own forecasts or expectations. \n\n- Obviously there‚Äôs plenty more tech companies out there that have announced cuts but these are a decent proxy for the sector cause of their size and cause we can compare where they were 5 years ago to now (cause they‚Äôve been around for a while).\n\nDo you think there‚Äôs more layoffs to come?
