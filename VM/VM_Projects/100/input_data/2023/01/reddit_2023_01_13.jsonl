{"title": "Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation cuts by 40% in 2023", "selftext": "Apple is cutting Tim Cook’s compensation by over 40% to $49 million in 2023. This $49 million pay consists of $3 million base salary, $6 million bonus, and $40 million stock awards. Within that $40 million stock awards, $30 million will be dependent on AAPL share performance. If AAPL share hits performance thresholds, the $30 million will be doubled to at least $60 million. Therefore, in the best scenario, Cook could get over $79 million pay in 2023.\n\nDespite the poor performance of AAPL, the compensation Cook received in 2022 was $99.4 million which includes $3 million base salary and over $83 million stock awards and bonus. The pay in 2022 was higher than the $98.7 million pay in 2021.\n\nComparing with other executives, Cook’s compensation is way higher. CFO Luca Maestri, General Counsel Kate Adams, retail chief Deidre O’Brien and COO Jeff Williams are all paid about $27 million total in 2022.\n\nThis is incredible, why Cook could get such a high pay even after AAPL sucked for the whole year, plunged 25% compare with one year before. Apple should have added that stock performance requirements on Cook’s stock awards earlier. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dyk5hz8mdrba1.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&s=216f9d9a93166ac6ee0e10d17478ec7a71fbe435", "id": "10anw1a", "created_utc": 1673592990.0, "score": 626, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 198, "comments": [{"body": "Tim, dude, sorry.

Plenty of good ones out there. But if Tim Cook leaves, there’s a very good chance his replacement will run Apple to the ground, like the CEOs before Steve Jobs did. \n\nYou seem to valuing an employee’s contributions with the “labor theory of value” model which is a very outdated and Marxist model. People’s value is not based on labor hours spent on building a thing, it’s about how rare their skills are and how much value it brings.\n\nThink of it like this. A person in the marketing team can easily be replaced. The new person will get trained by the systems and culture of the existing team. On the other hand, Tim Cook hires the person who hires the people who hire the marketing team. One single decision of his impacts hundreds of people. If it’s a bad decision, the whole marketing department goes to shit and possibly runs the company to the ground. A single bad decision by one marketing person can easily be corrected and won’t be noticed. \n\n>\tNo amount of work is worth $250,000 a month IMO, especially when your job can be easily automated. But that’s just my opinion.\n\nHe’s hiring the people who in turn hire people who do the work, and under his watch company went from making 4 billion a month to 8 billion a month. Leadership is hard. Companies don’t magically grow. We’ve already seen how CEOs can run Apple to the ground. CEOs job is not to make things by hand, it’s to make decisions that affects thousands of people. You can’t value them with the same mental model of someone designing or building one thing, as they are a very small part of the machine.

That’s where we disagree.\n\nA CEOs job is immensely more difficult and complex than an engineer or designer. There’s literally millions of engineers and designers in the US. There’s probably less than 10 people in the whole world qualified enough to run Apple.\n\nI think a very common misconception with people like you who don’t have much experience with corporate things, especially management, assume CEOs job is easy. From your perspective they’re just ordering people around (have power) but no complexity. In reality all they do is read many thousands of pages of internal studies, reports, data, interpret all of it, discuss it, come up with plans, make decisions with a lot of uncertainty, handle issues, etc. it is a very difficult job. \n\n>\tIf a decision-maker costs a company $100 million dollars a year, the smart business decision would be to automate their job.

For several years, Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, had been putting the pieces in place for this moment.\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, the tiny San Francisco company that designed ChatGPT. And in the years since, it has quietly invested another $2 billion, according to two people familiar with the investment who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with the media.\n\nThe $3 billion paid for the huge amounts of computing power that OpenAI needed to build the chatbot. And it meant that Microsoft could rapidly build and deploy new products based on the technology.\n\n____\n\n\nIt has already been a home run partly because Satya was prescient enough to make the bet three years ago, and because all applications will be generative in the future,” said Matt McIlwain, a managing partner at Seattle’s Madrona Venture Group.\n\n_____\n\nMSFT technology:\n\nA year later, Microsoft invested $1 billion in the company and committed to building the supercomputer technologies OpenAI’s enormous models would demand while becoming its “preferred partner for commercializing” its technologies.

Been at this all day. Thanks for the time. Just thought you should know.\n\nsome updates 5/4/2023\n\nIf anyone doubts anything just ask for the link or file and I'll send it. The largest part of this thesis is that one or two activist investors with reputations on the line are in the play and won't screw shareholders. This is mostly the back story here. May update and add/remove more if this post catches interest again.\n\nIf you're visiting here, - also worth checking out AJ's comments on the recent otc listing [https://youtu.be/1BeumQk2o0Q?t=2245](https://youtu.be/1BeumQk2o0Q?t=2245)\n\njan updates-trimmed some other areas i reached the text cap lol\n\nrelevant updates: u/Whoopass2rb found a change of control occurred triggering the abl default with jpm.  was related to their inventory levels.  jpm understands would break the change of control in the original abl, or board changes are significant enough. and/or. look at the 8 board members shuffling around recently, probably a clue there. cash out, removal, then readd to board back with shares, minus  Edelman.\n\nI think whoops theory is probably the most sound - deal set to occur in Jan, but some banks with market maker activities postponed it, via a false \"ftc concern\" - i added that part in, because they were over leveraged short, like TD Canada, who is the largest shorted bank on the market.\n\nStill waiting on form 25 to give us 10 days to the official \"delisting\" although we're suspended and trading otc until then. Puts us at least to the previous reverse stock split vote that was cancelled, and timing of the NT 10K drop, happening at latest if on time, a day after IEP Icahn's company changed earnings from May 3rd, to May 10, that just got heavily short attacked from the 50s to the 30s the last two days.    Jan 19 on paperwork filing, day of suspension, we see Ryan Cohen is an interested party along with Cerberus who was the other known interested party in Baby. Pitchbook shows LBO rumor deal in Jan, as well as the PIPE with Cohen tracing back to March when he received funding from Catterton through Dragonfly.\n\nThe 3.02 filed late Jan is for offering unregistered securities i.e. similar to the bond exchange offers for shares -- but no unregistered offering was done. We later saw that. Basically an easter egg (drink kool aid here). HBC acted as a proxy it seemed for a \"institutional investor with the early Feb set up of the subsidiary. The shares done in the offering were fairly minimal by some estimates for failing the price minimums. Different theories here.\n\nPersonally I'm waiting for auction process on June 2 - stalking horse bid May 22, and bids in by late May. Sales process June 7th. Some kind of LBO with private equity Catterton involved, imo a share exchange of some sort, reverse triangular merger with GME perhaps (GME created a new sub in Florida May 29 2022 (Gamestop Texas Corp) that may be used for this (Same date, May 29, Cohen sold Chewy to Petsmart btw fwiw.\n\nGove ceo and Patty Wu president of Baby have a ton of RSU's which would be worthless in BK fyi, along with David Kastin. All star M and A experience across the board with people currently there, not just specialized in bk.\n\nthe 11/16 dates mentioned below was also when Cheng of Volition capital who sits on the board with Cohen on 2 companies did a Form D 650 million dollar unregistered security offering - not yet sold....also he tweeted within 40 min of the 10q drop and said 2023 and beyond\" in the tweet\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResearch we've gathered and verified over the past several months.\n\nSmall update: All there offerings have warned of the potential of a short squeeze in several places. The latest chapter 11 events also possibly enable share recalls from previous offerings. Dragonfly board members have stepped down from their posts, along with Brett Icahn at Newell after scheduled to stay. Possible FTC conglomerate concerns? Chapter 11 will reduce the debt considerably and the valuation is low from Cohen's estimates, and he's listed as an interested party.\n\nWhy are institutions long on this stock right now if they're in such trouble?  \" **88.7% of all institutions invested believe the price will go up and are only betting on that\"** (u/whoopass2rb post). - that was from several months ago, not aware of current standing.\n\nEarnings doc highlights -\n\nWelcome Rewards membership surpasses 16 million, increasing from approximately 6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, reflecting predominantly new members.\n\nPotential to save an additional 80 to 100 million in shipping receiving etc. How would they do that?

A going concern sale from the court transcripts is what the court is trying to make happen. Viewing the brand presidents Linked in, she says she's optimistic.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLate filings can be associated with major corporate actions. Some noteworthy ones\n\nCohen's 13 d/a and Form 4 - Over 3 months late (event date listed - April 21, BBBY's 10 k at the time when share count was declared from buy backs over several months making Cohen's ownership move from 9.8 to 11.8 %. Why so late in filing? The form 144 he filed by the way is signed showing that there was nothing wrong with \"the books\" as some have suggested.\n\nHis form 4 shows a financial interest despite having no shares at the time.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822844/000092189522002498/xslF345X03/form413351002\\_08182022.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1822844/000092189522002498/xslF345X03/form413351002_08182022.xml)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/22gmz9uk30ea1.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=f31f0d9d397fb5857828ebeaa817b78a8ac38794\n\nDec 6 and Dec 19  S4 forms for bond extensions there- NOT FILED BY BBBY yet, at least not to the public. All the other bond extensions had these forms. BTW the new bonds gave second tier lein status. The old notes are unsecured - So who wouldn't exchange them to get a better status in the event of a bk? People convinced the bk is not happening - as well as an acquirer that could wipe out the debt holding them. They only received around a 14% participation rate overall among the three types of unsecured notes.\n\nThere are confidentiality options when you're doing M&A. An all cash buyout specific option would not appear to need an S4 according to a professional I referenced although I haven't verified this personally on the SEC website. A share exchange, merger acquisition would need one but they could be filed late. Good finds here by  [u/Dan23DJR](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dan23DJR/)\n\nThe N10 Q form filed is also often associated with M&A activity. Their 10 Q was \"planned to be filed by BBBY by Jan 10\" when this was filed on Jan 5. It still has not shown up. The penalties are modest, only severe penalties for late filing after 6 months. The fine is around 25k in this instance. So why the late filing?\n\nIf you look at a Tesla example their 10q from 2018 had a EX (exhibit ) 10.1 missing when they acquired a company. This form mentioning this wasn't public until 2022.\n\nNow it's been noted Tesla is the acquirer here and how could BBBY be an acquirer? Worth mentioning, In the share offerings by BBBY they mention the ability to use funds to acquire a company. Good buy Gear - or a reverse merger - perhaps? Just FYI - another company Cohen is on the board of, a private company Dragonfly on Feb 24th increased authorized share count to 123 million shares close to a 1 to 1 with BBBY- A day after the HSR act adjusted brackets for pre merger companies - In a reverse merger a private company goes through a pre existing public company instead of a traditional IPO.\n\n11/16 could be a significant date. Before 11/16 on the SEC Edgar search for BBBY it only showed the main branch but now shows BBBY, BBByCF LLC, BBBYTF LLC, BBB Canada Ltd., BBB Canada LP Inc., and BBBY Management Corp. Although this seems its just related to the 11/16 doc that was finalized on 11/21 this occurred after the first bond extension which could support support findings BBBY has been adding in legalese among the bond offers that makes a major corporate action available.\n\nThe form D's for the private bond conversions from 11/14 and 11/16 were also late 7 and 5 days respectively. The 11/16 Form D represents just under 10% of the total BBBY share count and was filed a day after institutional filing cutoffs for 13F's, which means any institutions that manage over 100 million dollars and received this exchange, wouldn't be viewable until this February.\n\n BBBY showed broken up and 6 subsidiaries listed as of 11/16 on the SEC Edgar search. Possibility of some kind of pooled investments, under 5% reporting limit each, although very rare. Judge wants to see holders of 4.5% or above, perhaps so BBBY maintains less than 49% of shares outstanding under one entity to maintain up to 1.6bil in tax credits through chapter 11. \n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent marketcap\n\nRC Ventures letter to the board written March 6th, put the value of Buy Buy Baby  above the entire marketcap of BBBY at the time of 1.28 bil vs current .429 bil. Or 2.56 billion next day when it ran to $30 lol.\n\n[March 7, 2022 when letter filed on SEC site $19 - $30 candle from $16 day previous](https://preview.redd.it/ttwcmwlu40ca1.png?width=161&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf5a8e414375b106ef21b7e43da75c01635b418d)\n\nBTW in 2015 for example, BBBY had 174 million shares and reached 79 dollars a share a 14.6 b marketcap . It reached an almost 17 bil mktcap in 2013.\n\nWe're currently trading below 1992 marketcap  factoring in inflation (u/n3rdacalypso) [https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/zsybmx/bbby\\_historical\\_market\\_cap\\_total\\_shares/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/zsybmx/bbby_historical_market_cap_total_shares/)\n\nSycamore supposedly made an offer for Gamestonk in 2018 too btw, nothing burger/distraction.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOther options for acquirers of BBBY - private bond conversions- amount done and known of -14.5 mil cumulatively.   Outstanding share count btw is 117.3 mil\n\nThe bond deal didn't get adjusted really on extensions after the first deadline of Nov 15th - just small modifications. Which means they didn't really care if people converted the bonds to new notes- most likely (speculation here) because an acquirer can gather \\*bonds at was has been mostly 1/5th of their full value over the past year. Now even cheaper, wiping out debt cheaply.\n\nSpeculation part - [u/1nceAgainTip](https://www.reddit.com/u/1nceAgainTip/) Brought up a really interesting scenario. Imagine BBBY files the form that panics many.  After the filing, the limited partner approaches (Icahn ) with the majority of the notes - They convert to shares at the current share price like what was done in the other form D private exchange but post Jan 2. Cohen and Icahn get majority ownership above what Cohen had already done through the M&A with the S4's in December being finalized. Brining collectively their share count in the company from 19.9% cap under the standstill running through Jan 2, to 50? 70%? including what they picked up on the open market.\n\nFood for thought - dates around the bonds (speculate amongst yourselves section) 9-28 Icahn buys 10 mil shares of IEP 86% ownership one day before BBBY earnings on the 9/29. 10-17 Icahn / Cohen pic tweet\\*. 10-18 bond offering of BBBY.  11/14 and 11/16 bond private conversions. 11-16 first extension filing of bonds to 11-18. 11-19 first teddy (LLC bank holding company related ) tweet \\*. 11-20 date of Cohen interview...\\*(see my interpretation post) 11-21 IEP original ask of 1.2 bil in July adds 400 mil on 424b5. 11-21 bond offering extended to 12/5. 12-6 late filings of form D's private conversions.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**Their ATM offerings have all included the option for private sales.**\n\nAlso in Game stonks most recent call- they talked about being able to acquire companies \"at the right \" price. Specifically they mentioned in the used market - Good Buy Gear is in partnership with Buy Buy Baby and Good Buy's Ceo talks of massive opportunity and big things coming on her Linked in.\n\nCohen sold at time BBBY needed its FILO deal done. 375 million Filo - Cohen's proceeds of 189 million represent 50.4% of that. u/whoopass2rb and I found that Six street has been known to also do Mezzanine loans.- What if someone /some entity could acquire the ABL debt and or FILO, and get better terms due to their better credit rating? Specifically with the FILO- it could be converted to Mezzanine debt in the form of shares, or warrants convertible on X date if X price is met for example. If someone were acquiring the company- that could be a quick way for them to get majority ownership. The share counts, along with preferred, warrants etc. is extremely hazy and complicated and designed to be that way. The 4.5% will remain private with the court. AST as well as Computershares were both recently down at the same time. AST, BBBY's direct registration was down for over a week online.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGame stonks basically , depending on where you start did a 26x (2600% increase) over 14 days including non trading days.\n\nAt the time I posted this - (trimming down some sections hitting text limit) i mentioned the ttm pro looked like a powder keg- We did the run in February up to a fast 7 the same day (also the day of a filing though for the PIPE which was not used in large effect ultimately.\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\nTeam representing BBBY\n\nUnder the standstill agreement that ran through Jan 2 BBBY had from Cleary Gottlieb\n\n2 time deal maker of the year Paul Shim. And someone who did over 4 acquisitions for Google. I would call that a heavy hitter team. David Lopez is there as well, and has extensive experience with IPOs.\n\nIf you do a search on Cleary Gottlieb's wikipedia - you can see a number of major M&A deals they've done over the years with US public companies.\n\nHere's some examples -\n\nIn 2018, represented the Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox on antitrust matters related to Disney’s $71.3 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets.[\\[22\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleary_Gottlieb_Steen_%26_Hamilton#cite_note-22)\n\nIn 2018, advised on the $146 Billion Sprint T-Mobile merger.[\\[23\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleary_Gottlieb_Steen_%26_Hamilton#cite_note-23)\n\nBBBY switched from Berkeley Research Group (where a board member of Dragonfly used to be ) to Alix partners recently. CEO of Icahn Enterprises IEP was a head over there prior to being with Icahn.\n\nThe fud you'll hear is that how they work with bankruptcies. Just like when BBBY was reported (but never verified) to be in talks with Kirkland and Ellis. Even though Kirkland and Ellis was named 2023 M&A firm of the year. As well as in 2021 and 2020.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------\n\nGMEDD interview and Cohen speculation\n\nGME flush with cash after the sneeze, bought back their bonds that would have prevented a merger (on Super somewhere , have to find it but it's in the bond terms). GME of course has short term treasuries earning interest right now (283 million worth) they could use quickly.\n\n(speculative) - With treasury notes you can only have 50 in your cart at a time according to govt website.\n\nFirst remember the timing of \"At least her cart is full\" tweet on Aug 12 , 4 days before his sales on 8/16 and 8/17 - is this dude gonna lose his whole future of activist investing he started with Game stonks, or have changed his mind on the company within 4 days of tweeting a signal like that?\n\nAnd actually, if you see how he worded things he mentioned  he was critical of the buy backs and the cash burn of the company at the time of his letter in March. He goes on to say, when i saw that, and I saw \"the results\" he sold. The thing people often attribute his sales to is the situation he walked into knowingly.\n\nHis sales at the time represented 50.4% of the Filo in late Aug that BBBY was looking to get. Among other things - If he is on the board of his holding company he formed in July 2021 Teddy Holdings, on the Dragonfly board, Game stonks, and to have ownership of BBBY at the same time where he crossed the 10% threshold to mark on the form 4- Just consider Elon's drawn out legal battle involving Solar City (picking up a company his shareholders say amounted to a bailout) and what happened at Oracle with Ellison. As a matter of fact - Teddy being a bank/ holding company has restrictions on executives being across boards.\n\nTeddy and his kids book is more than that. The privacy terms talk of merger and acquisitions. Looking through the terms it is not boiler plate at all.  There are links to the intellectual property trademarks for teddy dot com, filed through his law firm at Olshan - and the rest of the trademarks for an array of products including linens, toys, shower curtains etc. And a lot of the same categories of Gmerica's trademark which was approved for use as of Aug 23rd .\n\nSpeculation - Is it likely RC would create a competitor? I don't think so. In his interview he mentioned he's not interested in starting something up from scratch again like Chewy. In Game stonks history though, a holding company was formed and the former chairman of Babbages ended up being the chairman of the new holding company.  \"The merger was structured as a [stock swap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_swap), where shareholders of Babbage's and Software Etc. received shares of NeoStar, a newly formed [holding company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company). Babbage's and Software Etc. continued to operate as independent subsidiaries of NeoStar and retained their respective senior management teams.[\\[9\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop#cite_note-SoftwarePeers-9) Babbage's founder and chairman James McCurry became chairman of NeoStar.\n\nA share swap is considered a vastly harder position for shorts to be in. You can read more about that elsewhere.\n\nRC has also removed Game stonks from his twitter profile. Replaced it with the Book King, then removed that as well. Game stop Inc out of Minnesota is interesting. It holds all the IP rights of Game stop. Recently Liberty Procurement , a subsidiary of BBBY set up shop there ( u/hollyberryness found). Liberty only has a handful of branches in other states, the last happening in 2012. Why setup in Minnesota?? BBBY holds their IP rights under this Liberty subsidiary.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nForm 4 Cohen files after sales in Aug- pecuniary interest listed (financial interest). Letter to board referenced \"financial sponsors interests\" -\n\nJan 3- standstill of 19.9% cap ownership of shares among affiliates of Cohen removed. Standstill ran from March 25 through Jan 2. - Any statement - including the one released by BBBY about partnership after his sales had to be approved by both parties (Cohen and BBBY).\n\nYou can check the supplemental forms by BBBY (as mentioned as relevant in the standstill and their bylaws) to confirm the Jan 2 date is the end of the standstill.\n\nCohen can buy again now as of Jan 3 whereas before he was restricted. Check his twitter post about the jewel if you want some tin along with Icahn talks about a jewel on CNBC interview. Tinfoil aside....\n\n10 days after being over 5% share ownership then you have to report on a 13d. Which could be as early as Tue.\n\nCurrent share count 117.3 million BBBY - The standstill would have allowed 23 million shares owned.\n\nNow a filing in Oct is really interesting- the way BBBY worded things. You can check my post titled \"BBBY share count discrepancy....\" It's not really a discrepancy. But basically...\n\nOct 25 and or Oct 26 there were 4 million + shares issued as part of their initial 12 million share offering. We had the biggest one day move UP on Oct 25 compared to the previous (over) 45 days of trading. Would that have happened if it wasn't for private sales? Decide for yourself.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**New hires and removals**\n\nDavid Kastin comes on Dec 12\\* (great catch  @ adropot  on twitter) .Ben Rosenzweig, an activist investor from Privet steps down from the strategic committee exploring options for Buy Buy Baby on Dec 20. So Ben out, David is in the since Dec 12. Check David Kastin's track record? lol Guy has never joined a company going bankrupt in his whole career. And has a track record of being at companies in  merger /acquisition situations (u/n3rdacalypso).\n\n[https://www.vanguardlawmag.com/case-studies/david-kastin-the-vitamin-shoppe/](https://www.vanguardlawmag.com/case-studies/david-kastin-the-vitamin-shoppe/)\n\nWho has been axed? - Here's a few. Triton former CEO earlier in summer\n\nAs of late Aug call- Melnick and Hartman removed as well. Hartman was heading Baby\\* with Wu under him. Wu gets new role Buy Buy Baby president.\n\nBBBY recently switched their backend to handle more traffic to their website and fired their former tech head and replaced him. This was reported past few weeks. Would you bother to do so if you're going under?\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nspeculation -M&A language on phone calls and BBBY materials\n\nListen to the calls over the past several months, look at the letter to the board from March 7, and look at the materials. \"Unlock has been used repeatedly. Do a google search unlock M&A. it's code word for  sale of an asset, spin off, or merger (I did a whole post on this). RC himself put Buy Buy worth \"several billion\" in the right hands.\n\n\\---------------------------------\n\nInsider purchases\n\nYou can see insider purchases here- some is outdated- but focus on the new hires. Why would they be buying with their own money? It's common in Wall St not to be invested in your own company. Why would they invest in a company with their own money. Some of these listed are stock grants.\n\n[https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/886158.htm](https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/886158.htm)\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------\n\nPatty Wu background and Baby president role\n\nFormerly at Mattel COO of Baby division at Honest Company (recently branched out to China). I have my speculation on Baby getting big and a true \"ultimate destination\" for babies, but her late Aug call spelled out how Baby will travel with the parents for the life of the parent- similar to how Chewy (Cohen founded company) approached pet ownership and was able to take on Amazon. Although the value brand line didn't work at BBBY - it works in 2nd tier cities in China across the 200k stores there where you'd get your product in as opposed to opening up your own store. I don't think you can compare the baby segment to bed bath as far as a strategy will go anyway, but there's one example and how Pampers also did the same with their gold line of diapers.\n\nHer new president role as spelled out in BBBY docs includes specifically \"unlocking value\"\n\nFurther in a late summer call (end of Aug update or Sept earnings) they mention they're on track to unlock value at end of year.\n\nAs far as BBBY end of Aug update saying they weren't selling baby, they said \"at this time\" specifically. One thing mentioned in the March letter is a spinoff of Baby. Legally you can't spin off baby until you are solvent, and it requires a shareholder vote within 10 days of announcement. Due to BBBY's financials they couldn't spin off at the time, if they wanted to, so if a spin off was indeed what they are going for, then of course it would make sense for them to phrase it as such.\n\nIn the latest earnings call they mention and emphasis exploring \"ALL\" strategic options. Baby sale or spin off is known as the strategic board that Cohen formed and placed people there. I believe exploring all options was a bit of misdirection.\n\nIn their filings they change the wording slightly removing partnerships for example in their forward looking statement as a possibility (from u/squaredenis post).\n\nIf you already have a partner, then a partner wouldn't be part of a future possibility, it's already done for example. The wording also is ambiguous enough to still include all potentials from previous wordings including aquation, merger, sale of Baby etc.\n\nDuring the standstill by the way that ran through Jan 2-or Marc 16-  He was allowed open communication with the board at all times.\n\n\\-------------------------------------\n\nSpeculation section - Babies rus website updated on Oct 31 for the first time in 2 years (check the waybackmachine if you dont believe me). Nov 1, two new Dragonfly filings and Catterton - who gave the 500 mil for M&A gets added to the Dragonfly board. May or may not be relevant.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the letter sent in March\n\nReducing exorbitant executive salaries. Cutting expenses, launch new offerings (Mighty Goods at baby) and satisfy customer demand (a refocus of national brands outlined in late Aug call).\n\nModernizing supply chain (80-100 mll savings as noted in Jan earnings call) improving tech stack (done in Dec).\n\nSome fud you will hear is that they gave their plans away and thus weren't following the closely held moves Game stonks does. But if you actually see the letter he was criticizing Tritons 200 page picture book detailing every single move they would make.\n\nThe letter talks about the most value packed option is spinning of Baby shares to shareholders but also includes a sale option to a well capitalized acquirer. For a true spin off several things have to be in place. But also ones outside the box thinking wise. The letter also mentions a partial sale of Baby which may allow additional maneuvering around bond covenants.\n\n\\-(Speculation) The letter mentions selling the core business to BBBY to a well capitalized acquirer as well. Icahn IEP his company where he owns over 85% of shares has billions on the sidelines and West Point Home does a lot of business with BBBY - they make sheets and stuff. He talks about a jewel as well (cue latest tweet tinfoil by Cohen and pic of Cohen with Icahn in Oct on twitter).\n\n\\--------------------------------------\n\nThe Ultimate Destination.\n\nChewy was described as the Ultimate Destination for Pets in the March letter to the board. Gamestop was written as the Ultimate Destination for Gamers when Cohen wrote to the board  before becoming chairman. He describes Buy Buy Baby as being the Ultimate Destination for babies. To me this screams he's getting it and not letting go. Can you imagine him mentioning the Ultimate Destination for x, every time he approached a company ? If you watch his interviews I think he sees its a business he can scale in a segment with a fanatical customer base. And if you find the little that's written about his long time business partner Blake Day, you'll see the guy is too ambitious to just be part of a full buy out team for Catterton.  Since  the market is not valuing Buy Buy fairly, others won't go as high as what he's offering.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBBBY is closing unprofitable stores. Increased from earlier estimates drastically and focused in as per Cohen's letter by first removing Harmon branches.\n\nGame stonks was set to close about 500 stores in 2020. When Cohen became chairman they moved that number closer to 1000. Perhaps we will see more mentioned soon.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------\n\nTiming of purchases and Catterton connection\n\nCatterton wrote a paper on the maternity and childcare market opportunities in China who recently went from a 2 child up to 3 child policy. [https://www.lcatterton.com/pdf/2021-LC-Crisis\\_or\\_Opportunity.pdf](https://www.lcatterton.com/pdf/2021-LC-Crisis_or_Opportunity.pdf) found by (u/Movingday1)\n\nCatterton gave Cohen's private company Dragonfly 500 mill for M&A. A day after announced, Cohen buys last of BBBY shares, and makes his call purchases days before public announcement.\n\nCatterton has backed companies including Honest Company (Jessica Alba who just entered China) where Patty Wu - new and current Baby president as of late Aug,  was at Honest Company during the time Catterton funded a round for Honest. The China paper was release Oct 6, 2021. Cohen begins his BBBY purchases on Jan 13th, 2022. With his first purchase at 14.769 lol\n\nOlshan , Ryan's law firm has been making changes to BBBY's board, helping current CEO Gove  arrive there in 2019 as well as board member Kirwan. and Schechter, directors still on the board.\n\nDragonfly total listed acquisitions (full buyouts their specialty listed on Crunchbase as of today only total around 30 million, and that's if you account for them doing all of the funding. Which means if the 500 million was specifically for Buy Buy Baby- Well over 450 million may be available to help that. Catterton moves big money around is regularly over subscribed to their funding rounds.\n\nEdit: Found the link, they were hoping to raise 7.8 billion [https://www.wsj.com/articles/l-catterton-seeks-nearly-7-8-billion-for-new-funds-11638914599](https://www.wsj.com/articles/l-catterton-seeks-nearly-7-8-billion-for-new-funds-11638914599) \\- And if you look at Catterton's acquisitions as of late, in 2022, they are modest so far.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------\n\nDragonfly speculation section\n\nDragonfly added a new branch and a new officer for the first time in 2 years - from Catterton - a big funding wing related to LVMH (an over 50 billion dollar stock that includes Louis Vutton among others. The Catterton guy has a track record of being focused on companies in the 2 to 3 billion dollar market cap range.\n\nWhether or not Dragonfly is directly involved where Larry Cheng of Gamestop, and Blake Day a long time business partner of Cohen is  up for speculation only. One of the oddest things I've seen is that Dragonfly's outstanding (not authorized) common stock changed by 2 total shares this year out of over 9 million (which seems to point to the \"Ryan Cohen by day, Warren Icahn by night\" tweet, but I digress).  Dragonfly is an E commerce focused buyout company for Catterton, and their head of M&A started a furniture LLC in Texas with paperwork signed days before the standstill started. It was later confirmed to be directly related to Dragonfly. He also picked up a warehouse through another LLC in Virginia where Good buy Gear paperwork is (a business partner of Buy Buy Baby). And a new branch of Dragonfly opened in Rhode Island which is for some reason associated with real estate via the NAICS codes. - RI is where kids2 expanded out of all places from their initial location in Atlanta. They have several products Buy Buy could sell including educational toys like baby Einstein. The warehouse, Rhode Island branch, and the new member of Dragonfly were recorded in filings from early November 2022.\n\nThe China market is hot with tutors and the government is trying to get people to have more babies. If they further crack down on tutoring as can be seen in china tutoring companies stocks, the next logical place is educational toys for them to turn to? When Wu was at Mattel, I believe she worked on this angle as well from a Linked in Post. Also Good Buy gear (if you check my furniture post) said big things ahead. Their paperwork for an LLC is not standard and  mentions options for current shareholders in the event of a buy out. Most LLC's don't have such detailed paperwork. To make the ultimate destination for babies, it seems this would be a good company to add, rather than just giving customers gift cards for their gently used baby gear and then reselling to Good Buy Gear which Buy Buy currently does.\n\nAs of December Games stonk cobranded with Cybercrew whose other work has several other brands highlighted. I'm sure if there was an issue Louis Vutton and Nike and Apple and others shown in their NFT's would be filed against in a suit and they'd be removed) (credit u[/edwinbarnesc](https://www.reddit.com/user/edwinbarnesc) ) but that has not happened. There was also a big fuss about Kagy leaving Gamestop but he left and has a role as head of Cybercrew and Protocol Gemini, which is working on metaverse pads and experiences. Dragonfly has branches in each state  corresponding with the states shown in the main Gmerica nft's (5 shown so far).\n\nOk, im getting off topic. going to go back through and add more solid DD that should be known...\n\nFYI a ton of people not mentioned collectively all found this. I'm just putting it together here.\n\nJust a small piece of tin - The Bulid Buck BunnY (BBBY) store is next to Game stonk in this Gmerica NFT (a double decker bus obscures the view in the gif / nft, you have to paste it together). And the hidden secrets txt from the game stonk nft website from this last July has BBB (Buy Buy Baby) and BBBY in the skull as the only letters on those rows.

They're not moving from 2 years of data to 1 year of data... they're changing the **WEIGHTING** of the data categories from 2 years to 1 year of data.\n\nYoY CPI always uses 1 year of data.  That was true last year. It's true this year.\n\nFrom the BLS site:\n\n>Starting with January 2023 data, the BLS plans to update weights annually for the Consumer Price Index based on a single calendar year of data, using consumer expenditure data from 2021. This reflects a change from prior practice of updating weights biennially using two years of expenditure data.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/cpi/notices/2022/methodology-changes-2022.htm](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/notices/2022/methodology-changes-2022.htm)\n\nWhat they're changing is how the impact of a sector is calculated, I.e. the weight. If, say (this is a fictitious example to demonstrate the point), used cars are a major part of economic activity in 2021, but in 2022 they reduced as a segment of the economy, keeping an elevated weight is wrong.\n\nWhat's changed in the post-pandemic economy is that consumer purchasing cycles have compressed because of the post-pandemic demand whipsaw cycle. It used to be that consumer cycles went along 2-3 year rotations, more or less. Now they're compressed because people are filling demand quickly and moving to another sector.\n\nWhat changing to 1 year of weighting data does is align the 1 year CPI number more to the 1 year consumer cycle.\n\nGoing back to used cars, with the older system excess demand in 2021 influenced how the 2022 YoY calculations were weighted in that number... but if consumers  were buying fewer used cars in 2022 the effect of the price difference on consumer wallets mattered less than it did the previous year.\n\nIf consumer demand cycles didn't change, the number of the weight doesn't change. If there is a change, the impact is agnostic.\n\nIf you have a category that was in high demand in 2021 but lower demand in 2022, and that price collapsed, the impact of the older method would be to weight that higher than other categories which had more consumer cycle impact. In other words, the old method could be hiding inflationary impact, just as much as it could be hiding deflationary impact. So the claims that this would somehow make inflation seem better than they were are bullshit based on a fundamental lack of understanding regarding how data works.\n\nEdit to add: Even with the new methodology, there's a lag in the consumer data, because it takes time to report that data... so we could still quibble about how much CPI reflects consumer trends, but this reduces the distance of that lag in the data, which makes it more accurate.\n\nTo further explain, because this is complex, the YoY inflation number is a comparison. So numbers from this month are basically comparing numbers from the beginning of 2022. Consumer patterns from 2021 have a lag to the latest data, but are the closest to the comp from a year ago. The old system could comp trends from 2020 to late 2021/early 2022... which would be bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile we're on the topic of people spreading bullshit they don't understand, a number of people have repeated the empty-headed claim that some sites out there calculate \"CPI like they did in the 1980s\" referring to Shadowstats' faked data.\n\nNO ONE calculates inflation like they did in the 1980s because no one collects the basket data they used anymore. It's literally impossible to do. What those sites do is take an index the BLS maintains which shows a projected difference in CPI calculation over 20 years and then apply it today. This is invalid, first of all... second, the sites that do this all cite Shadowstats or other sites that use a similar methodology and what his methodology does is incorrectly compound the BLS' index 20 year divergence over the past 20 years, which amplifies the impact by many magnitudes in what can only be described as an elementary-school level failure to understand basic math.\n\nThe guy who does this no longer even works as an economist... he just makes money selling consulting and speaking fees based on this fake data. The \"1980s\" inflation data people are citing is a con job driven by someone inventing a consulting space for themselves on bad data, not actual 1980s inflation data, which is impossible to calculate in the same way because the source data just doesn't exist.\n\nPeople need to stop just believing what they read in random tweets and do some research before they accept things that feel right as facts.

{"title": "I've been trading for almost 2 years now and lost everything 4 times.", "selftext": "Hi guys! I decided to share my story with you because none of my friends irl trade or invest their money so they don't understand how it is possible to lose it so fast. (I didn't lose big numbers because I'm from Poland)\n\n**RUN I**\n\nSo my first what I like to call a \"RUN\" started 2 years ago when I was in high school. I worked through the summer of 2020 and made a couple of grand. As a rational 16 y/o I decided that mere consumptionism is beneath me for I am more ambitious that the rest of the society, oh how wrong I was. I started with trading what I thought were stock (CFDs) with fixed 20x leverage. As you could predict after 2 months of trading I lost everything and got depressed, completely neglected school and made the worst decision of my life, got into crypto.\n\n**RUN II**\n\nSo in 2021 I bought a gaming laptop with rtx3060 and heard you can make some money by mining crypto. At the time I thought crypto was I scam, but hey, who says no to free money right? So after mining it I thought that it is such a waste for it to just sit in my wallet and started trading with it (don't fucking do it). I got rugged in crypto more time than I can count. Every single project that I got into was a scam, tried some airdrop hunting but all I got from it was 2 USDT and 1 coin that I decided to hold and it went from $100 to $0.05. Lost everything again.\n\n**RUN III**\n\nSo we fast forward to 2022, my 18th birthday so I get a lot of money from my family and friends. And as a young and ambitious man I decided that mere consumptionism is beneath me (again!) and put 50% of my life savings into a certain crypto ponzi called Time Wonderland. And of course as a young and ambitious man I decided that mere spot holding is beneath and used leverage (please don't do this). After 3 days there was a massive liquidation of founder of the said ponzi and I got liquidated. Lost half of the money I got for my birthday in 3 just 3 fucking days. After that I decided to quit crypto and went back to trading CFDs. Longed the shit out of DAX 2 days before Russia attacked Ukraine and lost the other half of the money.\n\n**RUN IV (the last one so far)**\n\nSo I live in Poland and we border Russia and after the war in Ukraine started, our government started a REALLY good marketing campaign of the military forces. So after finishing high school and being a broke degenerate I decided to join the army. Fast forward next month I get my first military salary and go back to trading. After losing everything in crypto 2 times I decided that the lessons were learnt and it's time to make it all back. Summer 2022 Ethereum goes up from $1000 to $2000 due to the merge narrative. Shorted the shit out of it at the beginning of September with 20x leverage and made like $10k (more than the average yearly salary in my country). That's actually the only time when I made a lot of money. Than shorted another coin (don't even remember the name, just dumb fucking luck) and made another $10k, all in the span of one week. And after making what a the time for me was a life changing money I decided to yolo it all trading altcoins with high leverage, lost almost everything by the and of September 2022. Lost my last pennies in FTX crash trying to long their token, I know it's really fucking stupid, I also longed LUNA during the crash, I'm just really bad at trading.\n\n**RUN V, when ??**\n\nSo right now I study Computer Science and accumulate money to make it all turbo back trading, I know I don't learn any lessons I'm a gambler. I really love trading and want to do this for the rest of my life but feel like I'm addicted to it. Sometimes when I was about to get liquidated I would stare at the charts an literally pray (even though I'm atheist) not to get to.\n\nWhat do I do? Should I stop or keep grinding and just hope to get lucky?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE I:**\n\nThe fifth run is going to happen sooner than later, I think I will start with $1k and (hopefully) get to $10k. If not than I will have some loses to flex!\n\nWill cover it on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbos6pEFBmkObxAqFwwlvcw)\n\n**UPDATE II:**\n\nI'm currently long $LINK, you may want to countertrade me, I'm very bad at it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/66srnhnt4uba1.jpg?width=1859&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44e29bce51cc9d8cf13d56f297d1903b91019ea4", "id": "10aybvg", "created_utc": 1673626360.0, "score": 401, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 530, "comments": [{"body": "5th times the charm, stop complaining", "score": 180, "replies": [{"body": "Gonna make it the 5th time, for real, for real.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Bro- just go to krakow.

I would only use leverage if your a pro trader or have a really good idea what your doing. Another big tip any pro will tell you , do not be greedy , greediness will end up in losses or blowing your account. Do not trade with emotion, this will always end up in losses. It will cause you to make stupid decisions. Never trade with money your afraid to lose. When you made the 20k or 10k you should of kept it in your account and bought different coins or not trade with all of it at once. Never use your whole account  balance in one grade. This will end up in disaster. Most of the pros say don’t Risk more than one percent of your account per trade. This is the safest way and is true however if your account balance is a few thousand it will take forever to get it up. \n\nI’m pretty proud of myself for turning a 5k Ameritrade account into 27k. None of this was luck. None of it was yoloing, it was all analysis with my set stop loss and take profits. Obviously I would tweak those sometimes depending on how the trade was going. And I admit I took a few risker trades but never risked my whole account. And was not trading with margin at all. And the few times I used 80 percent of my account balance on a trade it was on very slow moving stocks and worst that would happen is I would be down 2 percent.

One time I got my 2k account to 20k in two days then said screw it and took all my money out of the account. Margin trading is fun and can make you rich, but I just don’t recommend using it tbh. Sadly it’s part of the game that these brokers know most people can’t just deposit 100k into an account so they allow you to trade with money you don’t have leaving you under ridiculous restrictions. One wrong move you get liquidated. By all means there’s many successful people using margin and make tons of money consistently. I just don’t recommend it. Unless your a pro it’s too risky. I mean I almost blew my forex account because of a random drop that was not supposed to happen then it went up to where I predicted it to go.

My  failed LUNA long cost me 1% of my account.\n\nI'm going to place a primer on leverage here, as the majority of people on reddit and YouTube explain it incorrectly.\n\nHere's the correct way:\n\n2 traders have $1000 accounts. They place a trade for 1 lot, one has 50x leverage and the other 5x leverage\n\nThe 5x guy would get liquidated WAY BEFORE the 50x guy. Why? Because higher leverage means less margin requirements. It's the CONTRACT SIZE that matters. You should ALWAYS calculate your stops / risk using the contract size.\n\nWhen you hear people saying \"I went all in 50X\", the comment is meaningless, because he could have traded 0.0015 lots. Another guy could have gone \"all in 5x\" but had his contract size set to 10 lot. Again, the 5x guy would be liquidated first and would have made / lost loads more money.\n\nPeople get REKT because they lower their leverage (as told by youtubers) and then use massive contract sizes.\n\nDon't take offense to this reply.
