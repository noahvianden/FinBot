I'm honestly still not sure what the best way to speak of this game is, because it's one of those things where if you're a longtime fan of Harry Potter it's going to be different for you than if you have never heard of Harry Potter in your life.\n\nI'm a longtime fan, I went through high school and college reading the books as they were written and released. So I'm going to be talking about this game as a really old fan who hasn't really interacted with the franchise much for a decade or more.\n\nIf you are a fan, this game is probably the longest and most heartfelt love letter to the franchise you will ever experience. The castle this game is named after is carefully and lovingly rendered to the last room, I spent hours just wandering around inside Hogwarts itself and looking for things from the books and solving puzzles and finding secrets. The developers showed their love in every brick of the castle, and then they also made a very nice Hogsmeade too while they were at it.\n\nThe rest of the game is fairly straightforward to play through. It's not trying to be particularly unique in the open world, there's no reason to invent the wheel again after so many other open world franchises have shown the way. Away from Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, the game feels like a mashup of Assassin's Creed, The Witcher 3, and Elden Ring, and that's just fine. The open world is functional and does the job it's supposed to.\n\nThe main story arc hits all the expected high notes, connects very intimately to the Wizarding World, has appropriate set pieces with giant boss battles, and is generally inoffensive. You are the MYSTERIOUS OUTSIDER who wields MYSTERIOUS ANCIENT MAGIC with which you must SAVE THE WORLD. It's not exactly a very creative script, but boy are these dungeons pretty and shiny. Especially when you enable the ray tracing.\n\nNo game is perfect, and I'm not going to pretend this one is. After the 694th time I open up the annoying copied from Destiny gear screen to swap out pieces and then reapply my transmogs to each piece one after another I wanted to Avada Kedavra a mother fucker. Give us a fucking transmog gear screen and gear sets already! \n\nThe combat is also a bit sketchy, with a really wonky and unreliable targeting system which always manages to select the enemy I wasn't wanting to attack every single time like the game is doing it on purpose. This is not fun when the game is repeatedly locking you into an arena and having you fight 8 enemies at once and you can't even consistently target who you want to kill.\n\nUltimately, Hogwarts Legacy is a genuinely amazing game. It sets a new bar for how good licensed content video games can be. It's a completely competent if not particularly unique open world action RPG outside of the HP license, but the way the game integrates the license and the Wizarding World is what elevates the game to GOTY contender tier. It's just that good, despite the fact that you'll count a million tiny and less tiny flaws which illustrate how this is clearly developer Avalanche Software's first open world and also first game of this sheer scale.\n\nOn a scale of 0 to \"You're A Wizard, Harry,\" I rate this game \"You're A Wizard, Harry.\" Highly recommended to fans.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "You’re a wizard, unknown soldier", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yeah I agree.

It's one of the only bear arguments that actually holds up for now, 2017-2022 has been basically every year Elon promising this year FSD will be done.\n\nThat's why the street doesn't really bake in any of that currently, and if Robotaxi will be the only cheaper product announced on March 1 then yeah I expect a massive sell off. It doesn't matter whether we believe in the product, short to mid term price action is controlled by current funds sentiment.\n\nPersonally though, I doubt that's the route they'll choose to go at this time; a giant price reduction to Model 3 costs to make it a 30k model would be my best guess.

I don't believe Tesla will just stop ramping production because they bet on Robotaxis if FSD isn't ready in time. Instead, I think they would just ramp another product, whether existing, unannounced or not existing yet, and start ramping the Robotaxi as soon as FSD is ready.

A lot of this “strong consumer spending” the market is pointing to is going on high-interest credit cards. 50% of the country has month-to-month carried balances with an average balance of $7.5k. Consumer spending is going to hit a wall this year as defaults rise (they are) and interest payments balloon in size. The irony here is that credit card spending is help keeping inflation up, which the fed will fight by hiking interest rates more, which in turn adds to the record consumer debt levels we have on the books. At some point, that cycle breaks down, consumer spending falls, and that impacts quarterly profit reporting and markets slump. Markets are in for a wakeup call this year even beyond being wrong on where the terminal fed rate was heading.

Interest rolls over here in Canada if you miss min pays, but you can file for hardship and the government will \"pay\" the interest on your behalf and adjust your minimum payments on a sliding scale. If you are unemployed with no income they pause your payments, if you are disabled they make the min payments for you as well based on a 10 year amortization.

And, for me, I never felt really hindered by the payments I had to make, not significantly. There was always a way to reduce/stop payments when I didn't have a good job and low income, and the min pays were always reasonable. I always had the option of going fixed but the fixed rate was prime +2 forever and until recently the variable rate was always sub 5%.\n\nPlus a 15% tax deduction based on interest amount paid too reducing practical interest by a couple points.\n\n0% interest is nicer but our system never felt oppressive.
