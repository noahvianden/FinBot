For older generations, there is a relatively even split between ‌iPhone‌ and Android users. The ramifications of this shift toward Apple devices among younger people extends beyond iPhones, with these users being much more likely to purchase AirPods, Apple Watches, and Macs.\n\nFor every 100 iPhones Apple sells around the world, it also sells 26 iPads, 17 Apple Watches, and 35 pairs of AirPods, according to research by Canalys. For Samsung, every 100 smartphone sales leads to fewer than 11 tablets, six smartwatches, and six pairs of wireless earbuds being sold. This is in spite of the fact that the average selling price of an ‌iPhone‌ is almost three times that of an Android device.\n\nResearchers who advise companies about the preferences of Gen Z consumers told the *Financial Times* that these customers are the most online of any age group, spending up to six hours a day on their smartphones. As a result, Apple's ecosystem is shaping social decision-making, with particular emphasis on the importance of iMessage as a social signal, necessitated by inferior experiences messaging and using group chats via SMS.\n\nIn Europe, where iMessage is less prevalent and Android has a bigger market share, the same trend is similarly visible. Canalys research indicates that 83 percent of Apple users in western Europe under 25 years old plan to keep using an ‌iPhone‌. As Gen Z gets older, this trend is likely to grow and further entrench Apple's market share, making it increasingly difficult for rival companies to capture new customers and make inroads.", "id": "118kbj0", "created_utc": 1677026804.0, "score": 616, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 601, "comments": [{"body": ">According to the report, younger consumers are concerned about being socially ostracised for not having an iPhone \n\nThe most American thing I've read in a while", "score": 462, "replies": [{"body": "Gen Z: “Android gives me the ick”", "score": 146, "replies": [{"body": "You joke but 95%+ of gen z girls say this lol", "score": 131, "replies": [{"body": "My girlfriend reminds me of this everytime I go on my phone.

Looking at S&P fwd multiple of 18 is quite high in an interest rate environment of near 5% which is still rising and Fed has said they will maintain for longer.  Historically fwd pe is near 15.5 which is about 15% away from current fwd multiple.  \n\nThat said tech advances so quickly not creating efficiencies in the economy faster than at any time in history.  Is part of the reason it has taken so long for inflation to rear its ugly head despite money supply increasing since 2008.   So you could be right that we don’t get to near a fwd pe of 16. \n\nBut have we seen the consumer pressured yet?  I say no.  They are still spending but savings are going lower and debt higher, but yet to hit tipping point where consumer spend drops precipitously.   Fed still raising. Will hurt more.  \n\nThe ball has started its roll but without momentum.  Again the question is WHEN and in your case possibly IF the ball gains momentum and crushes what is in its path. Right now we can sidestep.  But IF/WHEN the consumer spend drops, earnings decline, layoffs increase, spend drops further, earnings decline more.  \n\nAny recession has been pushed out and may not occur. But if spend drops as in above scenario the S&P will not keep an 18fwd pe and it will be on a lower base which could push below 3600.  \n\nI think it is very possible.  Somewhere between possible and probable.  The resiliency of consumers has been awesome.  But as you can see I dont know where we go, just I can see a reasonable scenario where market declines.  We are getting closer to that path, but have not yet taken it.  \n\nSo that is why I am positioned how I am. If it does not go to 3600 or lower then my 70% plays well.  If it does go lower then my 30% plays extremely well to achieve alpha and long term I am good with the 70% being fine as we recover.   But I am protecting my capital which as I noted is priority one.  \n\nEvery investor has to look at their risk tolerance. I have low risk tolerance as I am 59, retired for almost 6 years, and my expenses are paid via my passive income.  \n\nI am just managing my portfolio that allows for safety and getting great sleep.

I think these are all reasonable but calling this the bottom and full porting seems really risky to me.\n\n I personally think tech is in a bit of a bubble particularly after listening to the Nvidia earning call last night and the price pumping 8% because it beat earnings prediction s by 8.5% They are banking on ai and data centre growth at the moment and barely mentioned graphics cards sales which were abysmal and what they are known for. Their revenue is down like 21% y/y I think and the price is comparable to a year ago with gpu revenue plummeting y/y and no one mining crypto. I don't see consumers being keen to jump into buying top of the line GPUs in a recession despite gaming doing well as a bang for buck entertainment source.\n\nEdit: [link to discussion about the NVDA earnings call in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/119f9u0/nvidia_announces_financial_results_for_fourth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you have a years salary saved, no debt, you max out a Roth IRA, you max out a 401k, and you still have money left over every month to invest after paying your bills then yes.

Another reference is that the Han is around the same price as a Model 3 (non LR) grey import\n\nDealer people were nice but nothing amazing, specially with the above, yeah, I won’t buy it and it’s completely out of my budget, but still Test drive was just a few blocks, so I could only floor once or twice\n\nDriving: it’s the first fully electric full scale car I’ve ever driven, so the usual, fast response, tons of torque even at \\~200 hp (can’t even imagine what a Plaid feels like) Suspension was comfortable but a bit boat like, way softer than my Jeep, and not in a good way\n\nInterior: Materials looked really high quality but design was a bit too much and disconnected between parts of the interior and way too much buttons, dials and so on Rotating screen is a total gimmick\n\nSoftware: Played just a few minutes with it. Smooth, miles ahead of any car system I played in that regard. But the overall feeling wasn’t great, let me explain, you know those tablets what there is 200 different icons on the home screen and none are useful? Exactly like that. Couldn’t open navigation due to some error, and honestly not much I could do to test it, because there isn’t anything useful to do Weirdest parts is that it behaves like a phone or tablet OS, you minimize apps, can force close then and so on, I don’t know if they are running some mobile OS as backend, but it sure looks like it\n\nOverall, hard to have an opinion with a few minutes, but if they offered them for like half of a Tesla I might take it\n\nAnother important note is that they are in a weird place here, like in China BYD is the cheap EV, here the cheapest ones it’s 5 to 8 times the price of the everyday folk new car\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/at96ldynauja1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=483e448a89730135a7e61807082ca555c830e42e", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "BYD like polestar.

You  can sit here in your safe space on reddit and say wild shit to ppl all day and night but you will endure consequences throughout your short stay here on earth which will be everlasting. So think about what you're doing g and saying at all times. You have no idea who I am. You dont know who you're typing to. You've never seen me, You've never heard me, you've never felt me.

The drop will bounce off the surface of the water and fly back up into the air! Then it will start to lose potential energy and eventually come to rest after some oscillations. The point you undoubtedly missed is that that longitudinal wave we call a ripple is going to come back to the origin or 0 point eventually but at an undefined/unknown time and place which IS predetermined by the external factors such as liquid viscosity, container dimension ect. So now, if you were worth your weight in salt, you'd ask yourself how do my interactions interact with this pool of life and what way will the ripples from my actions affect me? \n\nI dont think you have the capacity for that train of thought so I'll just ask you or beg you rather to just teach your child this idea so they don't end up like one of their two mothers... you.

As the price of one share of the stock (Underlying) you hold the option on moves in the direction of your option the premium will increase. In the case of a Call option you want the Underlying to go up, because if you bought 100 shares(Exercise) at the strike price of $50 and the stock was at $70 that’s immediately $2,000 of value.  With a Put you want the Underlying to go down in value because then you could sell 100 shares of the stock at say $50 while it’s trading at $30.  Now as the underlying stock increases or decrease in value your contract’s premium will increase or decrease. You could choose to exercise the contract or just sell it at the new premium amount.  The amount the premium increases or decreases with each change of $1 in the price of the underlying is called Delta.

While it's certainly a bold move to invest your entire life savings in Tesla, let's hope Elon Musk's vision for the future of electric cars lives up to the hype. Who needs diversification when you can ride a rocket to the moon? Best of luck on your high-risk, high-reward investment strategy!\"\n\nAlso ChatGPT:\n\n>Certainly! Here are a few reasons why putting your life savings into an out of the money option that expires soon is not advisable:\n\n> High Risk: Options trading is a high-risk investment strategy, and investing your life savings in it can expose you to significant financial losses. Out of the money options that expire soon have a low probability of being profitable, and the potential losses can outweigh any gains.\n\n> Lack of Diversification: Putting all your money into a single investment can be risky, especially if that investment is a speculative one. It's important to diversify your portfolio across different asset classes to spread out your risk and reduce the impact of any one investment's performance on your overall portfolio.\n\n> Short-term Nature: Out of the money options that expire soon are designed for short-term trading, and require quick and accurate decision-making. If you're not experienced with options trading, it can be difficult to make informed decisions about when to buy and sell, which can lead to costly mistakes.\n\n> In summary, investing your life savings in a high-risk, speculative investment like an out of the money option that expires soon is generally not advisable.
