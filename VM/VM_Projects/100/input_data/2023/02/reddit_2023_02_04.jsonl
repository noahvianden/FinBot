Maybe Peter has been wrong for a decade and is about to be right. Also maybe gold is going to zero. If Elon musk manages to bring an asteroid full of gold back to earth that is exactly where the price will go so I'm not a buy and hold forever gold bug.

As such I don't pay attention to Mr Schiff very much. To be fair to him though GLD went from 113 to 189 over the course of a year and a half, from 2018-20 so I bet he made a lot of people a lot of money. Also the price of GLD in 2010 was 135 and it is currently 173 so it's not like he lost his followers money.\n\nAlso I do not agree with his prognosis about the US dollar. USD will continue to approach zero asymptotically as it always has throughout its entire history. We may see that process happen faster or slower depending on countless factors within the economy but no, USD is never hitting zero. ever.

It was actually my finance professor in college who taught us this technique as something they used in some of the portfolios he managed at Motorist insurance.   \n\nI took $5500 *(equivalent to about 100 shares of SPY at the time)* and put it in a \"just for fun\" account to execute the strategy we had been shown and that I had written my final thesis for the class on.  Turns out it was essentially the wheel.   Since I wasn't really that familiar with the greeks and they weren't something that was readily easy to find or see back then with the brokers I was using I did most of my strike price determination by % discount/increase to the underlying stock price.  And decided the length of expiration by when to  enter the trade, as there weren't nearly as many stocks with weekly expirations *(most were still end of the third week each month).*  \n\nAs for advice.  I personally follow these things.  \n\n* Don't use margin to cover the cost of uying 100 shares\n* In general I only sell premium on top fortune 100 or blue chip companies that are usually top 5 leaders in their respective market segments.  \n* Spread out and run the strategy on multiple lower prices undlyings rather than one higher priced one.   As mentioned above try to keep trade using 10% or less of total account balance\n* Once an underlying stock price rises above what would equal 10% of my balance I stop and switch to a new one.  For example I've stopped and started on NVDA countless times since 2016.  \n* Ladder the exprations from2-6 weeks, especially for same ticker.  Rather than writing 2 contracts on one stock with same exp I write two sperate ones with different expirations and strikes \n* I aim for between 0.75% - 1.5% return per month.  This usually equates to around a 0.15 delta or less (*approx 5-10% discount or more to the underlying stock price)* for a two week expiration.  \n* My entire option wheeling account is only a part of my larger portfolio and it compliments my buy and hold and dividend investing strategies by letting me sell CSPs on stocks I already own or would like to possibly own.  f get assigned I have the choice of selling CCs or maybe just transferring the shares over to the buy and hold and then sell something from that account that I want to trim back on and send the equivalent cash back to the options account.   Gives me added flexibility across my larger investing picture while helping to diversify not the holdings but strategies as each can excel in different types of markets thus helping to create a more consistent overall return year after year.     \n\nDid I gamble and turn 10k in 450k in a year?  Nope.   But I did turn that $5500 into just under 190k now in 27yrs.  All the while continuing to work and save money into my buy and hold accounts (about 500-1000 per month) and that has sent my net worth into the seven figure range and I've never had six figure income.   I'm still only in my mid 40s and have plenty of years left to add even more to it.    \n\nSo my additional advice is to remember that slow and steady with patience and discipline will indeed win this financial race.

The idea is that various treasury bonds with different timeframes have a relationship to how the market is placing bets on bonds.\n\nWhen the relationship is above 0, it means that things are normal, when below it should mean a recession is coming and trading has changed to reflect reduced sentiments.\n\nThere's also a relationship to how banks in the past made money by trading against bond spreads in a process called bond arbitrage as a method of expanding capital liquidity, but that stopped mattering since the 2008 crash and we've spent most of the time in QE. We'll come back to that.\n\nBasically, not only would the yield curve inversion represent broad investor sentiment and positioning, but also could cause liquidity problems for banks in the past.\n\nOne fun fact is that the economist who created this indicators thinks there's a chance that it could be sending a false signal.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bond-market-recession-indicator-may-be-flashing-false-signal-says-pioneering-yield-curve-researcher-11671560339](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bond-market-recession-indicator-may-be-flashing-false-signal-says-pioneering-yield-curve-researcher-11671560339)\n\nHe describes the method basically being that the creation of the signal has changed behavior, reinforcing and creating self-fulfilling prophecies, and that you don't necessarily get from there to a serious recession.\n\nI also think that QE/QT are a factor. The Fed buying up and now letting bonds roll off/not buying more is influencing the yield, because yield is in part a product of the supply of bonds influencing the auction. Basically, by changing the patterns of the bond market, the Fed has created a circumstance where you can't know if investor sentiment is changing and as such influencing the yield for different bonds at auction, or if it's fluctuation from QE/QT changing the dynamics of the underlying market.\n\nWhere the bank liquidity situation comes in, is that the Fed is doing QT expressly because banks are flush with cash. Bond arbitrage is no longer necessary for banks to remain cash flush, the Fed is serving that purpose now. So one possibly recessionary cause tied to the relationship may no longer matter as much. \n\nThe next question is whether that creates a full recession on its own, or not. No one really knows the answer to that. Truth is we'll only know if a recession doesn't materialize. If one does materialize, the oscillator will continue to be called 100% accurate regardless of whether it was the dog wagging the tail or the tail wagging the dog.\n\nIt is, however, an effective tool for detecting market pullback risk, though, just maybe not a recession or a crash.\n\nBy the way, other yield curve relationships don't test out as well.
