So even if Google still controls say 70% of the search market a few years from now they'll have already lost a ton of users and traffic, even though Bing will still be firmly in second place by a wide margin.\n\n* Google search is the big money maker for Google, bringing in like 60% of it's revenue. And AI queries are both much more expensive to run then search queries (because they use way more resources per query), and harder to monitize (there is no convenient area to stuff in some links to advertiser products).\n\n* I've seen speculation that Microsoft's real goal with adding ChatGPT isn't to win search, but to harm Google Cloud. Google is currently losing money on Google Cloud in order to try to capture more market share, which Microsoft (being the #2 player in the space with Azure) doesn't like.

We are seeing more investment in the sector as well with PlayStation VR2 coming out soon, apple coming out with a headset soon and valve working on new headset as well. VR provides a fully unique gaming experience but so far has failed to branch out into other areas. Oculus was always marketed as a gaming headset and only tried to become something more because of the greed of Facebook/Meta. Leading to them overselling it’s capabilities.

How costly it is for banks to get more money. This is a simplified way of explaining it. But when money costs more, Banks are more likely to hold onto it. And what do banks do with their money? They loan it out. When this happens, getting any type of loan is harder for companies, people and sometimes government.\n\nWhich takes us back to what commenter above got wrong. When it’s harder to get money, do you spend more money??? No, you spend less money. And yes certain things get more expensive, but that’s also the point in a way. Loans get expensive so people don’t buy houses, cars, etc. Loans get expensive so businesses are less likely to expand themselves. All of this makes the actual items being bought cheaper, because nobody has the money to buy and suppliers still want to sell. \n\nLess things being bought/sold means less money is chasing more goods.

Airbnb reported $319 million in net income for the quarter, up from $55 million a year earlier, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of $506 million, surpassing the $432 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n\nIn its shareholder letter, Airbnb said it’s seeing continued strong demand at the start of 2023. The company said revenue in first quarter will be between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, above the $1.69 billion expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.\n\nAirbnb said it made difficult choices to cut spending during the pandemic but has modestly increased its headcount over the past two years. The company said it expects to “continue hiring at a judicious pace in 2023,” and that, compared to 2019, its headcount is down 5% while revenue is up 75%.\n\nGross booking value, which Airbnb uses to track host earnings, service fees, cleaning fees and taxes, totaled $13.5 billion in the fourth quarter. The company reported 88.2 million nights and experiences booked in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year, but below the 89.7 million expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.\n\nAirbnb said in the investor letter that travelers are returning to major cities, which has historically been one of the “strongest areas” of its business. The company said domestic and short-distance travel continued to be strong, but it saw “even further improvement” in longer-distance and cross-border travel during the quarter.\n\nAirbnb said guest demand and supply growth remained strong throughout 2022.\n\nAverage daily rates decreased by 1% from a year ago to $153 in the fourth quarter. The company ended 2022 with 6.6 million active listings, which reflects an increase of over 900,000, or 16%, compared to 2021.\n\nAirbnb said it’s “particularly encouraged” by market share gains in Latin America, continued recovery within Asia Pacific and European travelers that are booking summer vacations early.\n\nThe company will hold its quarterly call with investors at 4:30 P.M.

Yeah. Why else would \"data labelers\" be working at a plant meant for production? The only reason why they were hired there was to kick the hiring quota problem down the line and because it was low-level labor that literally anybody could do. It's not meant to be a career, and it's only valuable to the company for those reasons. \n\nThe problem is that people treat EVERY job like everything is meant to be a career with long-term benefits and ever-increasing pay, but some jobs are temporary and meant to be commodities. Companies enter agreements with employees at their willingness to pay, and employees should agree at prices and conditions they find reasonable and acceptable. \n\nI am somewhat more sympathetic to Amazon warehouse employees since that's physical labor in some truly grueling conditions that's materially adding to Amazon's business model with a decent amount of required training, but Tesla's data labeling team does not contribute in the same way. Not saying it's insignificant, but Tesla has EVERY incentive to, I don't know, move it all to Ohio or somewhere else with a really low cost of living. \n\nOutside of that, I think we have to truly start looking at how college is affecting life in America. If I had to guess, a lot of these emergent unions at places like Starbucks and this plant have to do with companies needing low-skilled, low-paying labor and ending up hiring a college-educated population with zero marketable skills and high debt. These people need money, have a little too much pride to work at a warehouse, and end up working slightly sexier jobs, but they get really resentful and feel like they need to get a \"living wage\" that pays for their decision to live in HCOL areas, supports an excessive lifestyle that they've become accustomed to from spending endlessly in college, and more than covers hundreds of thousands of dollars of college debt from degrees in non-useful fields.\n\nCompanies continue to need low-cost labor who does not come pre-saddled with extreme debt, but increasingly there are no Americans who fit that criteria because the US government has been telling kids to go to college regardless of future plans or how helpful their actual courses may be.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": ">but they get really resentful and feel like they need to get a \"living wage\" that pays for their decision to live in HCOL areas\n\nI don't think there are as many people moving to HCOL with the intention of working as a Starbucks barista as you're suggesting.

However, the more literal definition is that humans are composed of mostly water, with the human body being mostly composed of around 70% of water (U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2007). This idea of humans as water-based organisms, rather than mass-based ones, offers an interesting perspective on the human experience.\n\nThe scientific answer to the question of why humans are water-based beings is simple: water molecules, thanks to high levels of cohesion, transport, and thermal conductivity, provide the substance that cells need to survive, grow, and replicate (Oxford Academic, 2020). In this way, it is a fact that humans are flavored water, as the cells are composed of mostly water and exist in a protective, saline environment.\n\nIn a more literal sense, humans can be viewed as flavored water. This is because the blood, whose composition is approximately 90% water and 10% electrolytes, is the transport medium which carries the various flavors of life throughout the body (Armstrong, 2019). This means that, rather than merely providing basic sustenance, water within the human body is made to deliver much more than just hydration, such as essential nutrients, vitamins, and hormones. In this sense, even the simplest and most basic of bodily functions, such as breathing and being able to feel sensation, is made possible by the delivery of these flavors, as these are all key components of the body’s normal operations.\n\nTherefore, from a scientific and a literal perspective, it can be seen that humans are truly just flavored water. This idea can be used to further our understanding of the body’s purposes and, more generally, our influences on the environment. It is a reminder to appreciate the complexities and interconnectedness of our bodies, which can only be perceived on a cellular level.\n\nReferences\n\nArmstrong, C. (2019).

However, most NEWater is currently used for non-drinking purposes, mostly by industries with production requirements for high purity water.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Tea", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You should read the ingredients", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Diluted corn syrup and flavouring, basically.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Cancer and diabetes", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Maybe you should take a look at the ingredients list on the can then.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/xwr0892tbbia1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d125124058d65c12a8dc6a960a377db0e2fbd7c9\n\nHere’s your answer, used to work at one of the factories.
