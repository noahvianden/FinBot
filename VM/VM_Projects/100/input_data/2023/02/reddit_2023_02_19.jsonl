So under the Obama administration, as the FED performed \"shock therapy\" through monetary policy and spending, it was a mixture of controlling the narrative/sentiment that allowed for a \"faster or slower recovery\"?\n2. When the recession was announced, this didn't reflect the value of assets and equities. If the real economy was in terrible conditions, it did not mean that asset values reflected that.\n3. Indicies that we used to measure the health of an economy, consumer health, and overall societal well being has changed and is constantly changing. This allows for better control over the sentiment/narrative. Sort of like putting a frog in cool water and turning it to a slow boil versus throwing a frog into boiling water. The frog may jump out of the boiling water but won't easily understand its situation when the waters temerpature changes gradually.\n\nHistory tends to repeat itself especially if the system and conditions remain somewhat similar.
