As somebody else mentioned, HSAs basically have triple tax advantage if you leave the money until retirement. A lot of people don’t know you can use HSA funds for things other than medical once you hit 65, with no penalties. I would recommend paying any medical expenses with cash and let your HSA grow, if you can. Whatever is left I would either put in an ETF or setup a T-Bill ladder.

It's not a risk. Your literally losing money by just keeping it in a bank account. 20k with inflation of 5% will be worth 10k after 10 years. That's dramatic. Better to buy luxury items right now, like a watch, than keeping it in low interest bank account. The watch will gain value, or keep its value at least. \n\nBut from an investment perspective, you should divide that amount by 10 and invest it in the next 10 months and not all at once (keeping everything else in a high interest saving account giving around 4% these days). 2023 is gonna be a wild ride. \n\nThen you have to decide if you want growth on the long term or high dividends to get income right now but less growth. If you have decades in front of you, growth is the way to go (you can still get good dividends with growth). But maybe you really want to have a monthky income right now, so that would be another strategy to look at. \n\nIf you're going for growth (which is what most people would recommend), since you don't know much about stocks (and even those who are specialists), it's very risky to pick individual stocks. So you should invest in broad ETFs, that have low fees. You just need 3 if you want to keep things simple. The majority of your money in the US (VTI is my recommendation, it contains every single US stock available and the 500 biggest corporations take up to 80% of the ETFs. Can't go wrong). Then you need one for the other rich countries (Developped countries excluding US like Germany, Australia, Japan) and another one in smaller proportion for the Emerging markets (like China, India, South Africa). You could also just buy one ETFs that has all 3 but the management fees will be higher and I don't think buying 3 ETFs is that more complicated than just one. \n\nThose 3 ETFs should be your base, in proportion something like 70% US, 20% Developped and 10% Emerging (that's debatable). After a while you'll learn things about yourself and about investing and you'll realize if you want to keep it simple like this, or if you want to start buying other ETFs/stocks.

Elon later made an unannounced appearance on a Twitter Spaces conference to say that he hadn't missed any work at Tesla or SpaceX due to his activities at Twitter, but the damage was done by that point.\n\nThe overall impression that myself and some others (both here and at TMC -- Tesla Motors Club forums) got was that neither Elon nor Tesla's board cared about the effect this was having on small shareholders.  I'm sure there were more than a few people who weren't on margin or options who also got tripped up by Elon.  At TMC there was one story of a Tesla employee who was forced to sell a lot more TSLA stock than they expected due to an unforeseen family emergency when the stock price was really down.\n\nI've been a TSLA shareholder since 2011.  Late 2022 was the first time I can remember where I felt like the Tesla board just didn't give a shit about the shareholders they work for.  Both Elon and Robyn Denholm (Tesla's chair) are up for board re-election this year, and at the moment I am planning to vote against both of them.

He issued his grim outlook for US growth stocks during a fourth-quarter earnings call on Friday, according to a transcript provided by Sentieo/AlphaSense.\n\nThe value investor said on the call that his company's stock holdings remain deeply undervalued, but he expects that to change. He noted that Fairfax's portfolio doubled in value between 2000 and 2002, while the major US stock indices roughly halved during that period.\n\nThe value investor also pointed out that despite the market's rally this year, Big Tech stocks like Amazon and Tesla are still down sharply from their peaks in 2021. Moreover, their smaller peers like Zoom and Shopify have regained even less ground.\n\n\"If history is any guide, there's more to come,\" Watsa said. \"I will note for you that the Nasdaq dropped 50% in 2000 and then dropped another 50% in the next 2 years.\"\n\nFairfax and Berkshire have several key holdings in common, including Bank of America, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum. Watsa also shares Buffett's love of highly concentrated bets: seven stocks including Blackberry accounted for nearly 90% of Fairfax's $4 billion portfolio at the end of December.\n\nSource:[https://africa.businessinsider.com/markets/the-canadian-warren-buffett-warns-tech-stocks-are-more-overvalued-than-during-the-dot/em7tv92](https://africa.businessinsider.com/markets/the-canadian-warren-buffett-warns-tech-stocks-are-more-overvalued-than-during-the-dot/em7tv92)\n\nThe 'Canadian Warren Buffett,’ Prem Watsa, warns tech stocks are more overvalued than during the dot-com bubble - and predicts a painful selloff.\n\nIs he right?", "id": "118846m", "created_utc": 1676996266.0, "score": 130, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|105|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Yes, there is a risk that growth stocks could tumble if the economy normalizes and value stocks come back into favor.
