Median Home Price - $428,700\n5. \\*Interest Rate - 6.5% (thats 2023, 2022 ave was actually 4%)\n\n**Without adjusting for SQFT and Interest:**  \n6x for households and 8x for individuals\n\n**Adjusting for SQFT ($278k for similar size house):**  \n3.8x for households and 5.1x for individuals\n\n**Monthly payment with adjusted SQFT and 30 year fixed:**  \n$2,272/mo\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1980**\n\n1. Median Home Size - \\~1595 sqft\n2. Median Individual Income - $9,365\n3. Median Household Income - $21,020\n4. Median Home Price - \\~$65,000\n5. Interest Rate - 13.74%\n\n**3x for households and 7x for individuals**\n\n**Monthly payment with 30 year fixed:**   \n$930/mo\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo as you can see, housing prices havent really changed all that much compared to income. Its actually become easier for individuals (5.1x vs 7x in 1980) though slightly harder for households (3.8x vs 3x in 1980) due to decline in household income vs individual income.\n\nNone of this factors interest rate... obviously things look much worse when you include loans as you can see above. The monthly payment was $930/mo in 1980. Today its $2,300 for a similar size home. So its a little more than double... but incomes have climbed 5.5x for individuals and 3.5x for families.

This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.\n\nThis investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with Mexico receiving its highest foreign direct investment inflows for years in 2022, it's clear that the country's lower-cost and skilled workforce is making it a global center for the car industry.\n\nWe don't know all the details just yet, but Lopez Obrador said Tesla will likely give us more information tomorrow. It's all happening during Musk's \"Investor Day,\" where he'll outline his \"Master Plan Part Three.\"  (source: [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mexican-president-says-tesla-build-143052963.html))\n\nNot sure whether to buy calls or puts on Musk?

Other earlier movers (like VW and Volvo and Hyundai) will start expanding sales in the mid-late 2020s but face increasing competitive pressures, and the big war will be in the early 2030s.

All you need to run is some very basic software that 'listens' to the network for new transactions. That software also runs very basic checks to make sure that these transactions are valid. And it batches up these new transactions into potential blocks to be added to the blockchain. \n\nThe difference between mining and staking is that they have different processes for determining how new blocks of verified transactions get added to the blockchain (where they are ultimately finalized and recorded).\n\nWith mining, miners are competing against one another over who gets to add the block of transactions they've processed to the blockchain. They are all racing to solve these computational 'puzzles', and the first person to solve the puzzle wins. This is where the computational effort comes in, using lots and lots of GPUs or even ASICs. The winner--the person who gets to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain--receives a 'prize' in the form of new coins being minted. So this is how new issuance happens.\n\nIn staking, there's no competition to solve computational puzzles, hence the ~99.9% reduction in energy usage. Instead, it's basically a lottery system, where every 10 seconds (for Ethereum) the protocol randomly chooses a staker who wins the right to post a new block of transactions to the blockchain (and receives the 'prize' of newly minted coins). The more coins you're posting as collateral for staking, the higher probability you have of winning this lottery. Think of it like buying more raffle tickets.\n\nTo answer your second question, there is still a cryptographic hash when staking. The hash is created when the lottery winner adds their block of transactions to the blockchain.\n\nThe difference between mining and staking boils down to differences in the protocol rules for determining who gets to add their block of new transactions to the blockchain.

Whereas the Gold Standard was controlled by physical scarcity of gold, which is beyond the control of human will, this system you're describing is again relying our self-control, which is subject to corruption.\n\nWell for one, I hope I conveyed in my last comment that you can't go willy nilly changing the code against the will of the users. Especially for well-established projects like BTC and ETH, even the developers/maintainers of the source code can’t unilaterally change the rules of the network unless the userbase agrees to those changes and decides to run the updated software.\n\nSure, on some level there is fundamentally a human element. Software is developed and run by humans. People are free to fork an existing network, or create an entirely new network. And if other people see value in that new implementation, then they are free to go use it. But it’s not an either/or decision. If people don’t agree to the changes, then no one can stop them from using the original implementation. \n\nYou should also realize that there’s strong incentive NOT to change the rules. For one, it provides stability. For example, the Bitcoin protocol has always had a hard cap of 21 million Bitcoin. This results in a known, predictable ‘monetary policy’. In that sense, Bitcoin is actually more predictably scarce than gold, since we know with certainty that there will only ever be 21 million BTC, while gold’s supply will increase indefinitely at an unknown pace as new deposits are found. \n\nCould someone implement a hard fork that changes that 21 million hard cap, e.g. increasing it by a factor of 10 and paying out the new coins to themselves? Sure, but like… why would anyone else agree to run that version? Nobody would, and Bitcoin would chug along undeterred. In fact, the Bitcoin community (moreso than other cryptos) are quite dogmatic about the 21 million cap. If that hardness feature of a currency is something that is important to you, then you would align well ideologically with the BTC community. \n\n\n> What's to prevent this system from being hacked, if it incorporates control logic?\n\nSo let's compare typical physical/cyber security with the way it works in crypto:\n\n- Traditional security paradigm: imagine a sort of bullseye. At the very center is the thing (e.g. sensitive information, a vault full of gold, whatever) that you're guarding. Only your most trusted circle has access to this innermost layer. From there, you keep intruders out by creating layers of security, clearance, secrecy, and obfuscation. This type of security relies on how well you can keep secrets secret, how well you can obfuscate. But of course, we know that these types of setups are not immune to failure; and in particular, they are especially prone to inside jobs.\n\n- Crypto paradigm: any reputable crypto has open-source code that can be reviewed and scrutinized by anyone at all times, including hackers. It's like the world's greatest honeypot. If you could hack BTC, you'd be able to mint yourself a fortune. And yet we’re going on ~14 years now and nobody has successfully hacked it.\n\nIt's a totally different approach to security. Ultimately, it comes down to how competent the developers are. There have definitely been other crypto protocols that have been hacked. And yes, many crypto *businesses* (exchanges, wallets, etc.) have been hacked, usually because they are companies using traditional security methods (and crypto is rife with inside jobs too!).\n\nBut the Bitcoin code has thus far withstood the test of time. It’s battle-hardened. So while I do have lingering points of worry for crypto, hacks at the protocol level--at least for reputable cryptos like BTC and ETH—are generally not one of them.\n\nThere’s one other interesting point here, which is that a major bug or hack doesn’t necessarily need to be fatal for a crypto protocol. In the event they occur, the community can agree to execute a hard fork to effectively roll back or unwind the effects of the bug/hack as if they hadn’t happened. \n\nThis is not always without controversy, mind you, and it does point to the human element of all this. For example, there was a notable hack that occurred to an application on top of Ethereum a few years back. It would have resulted in people losing hundreds of millions of dollars. In the end, the majority of the community agreed to a hard fork that rolled back the hack (this ‘side’ of the fork is what is today called Ethereum), while a smaller subset disagreed and continued to use the original implementation with the hack (this ‘side’ is today called Ethereum Classic).\n\n\n> One of the things I worry about with digital currencies such as crypto is that the Network Effect constraints can be seamlessly surmounted through software that incorporates currency-conversion mechanisms that operate on-the-fly. It least with a currency that is based on a physical commodity like gold, that can't be done.\n\nI'm not sure I followed this.

In fact, there's no method known to science to determine consciousness. My only objection is to the Chinese Room argument being some kind of ironclad proof that conscious machines aren't possible.

The way I summarize the Chinese room's conclusion is:\n\n* If you have a machine that isn't conscious\n* Then there's no program you can run on it to make it conscious\n\nOf course, that depends on how lose a definition of \"program\" you're willing to accept.

Also, do we *really* know babies are conscious? They emote and move their limbs and react to the environment, yes; but how come we don't remember anything from our first years on this earth? Is it possible that our consciousness wasn't fully developed?\n\n>A neocortex isn't just a pile of unconnected neurons. Our brains are never just an unstructured bunch of independent neurons waiting to be \"programmed\".\n\nThey're connected, but the connections are initially random. Not unlike a NN. Maybe some \"circuitry\" is genetically primed to specialize in a certain thing. Although we know the brain is super plastic, and almost any area can learn to compensate a damaged portion of the brain that used to carry out a completely different function. Think about it, the human genome is around 3 GB of data, much less compressed. There can't possibly be that much information there that tells the brain which neurons should be connected to which other neurons. It's just a generic, mostly random algorithm.\n\n>If you have a machine that isn't conscious - Then there's no program you can run on it to make it conscious\n\nThis seems like a Catch-22 to me. A conscious machine is one that runs a conscious program, but if you take the program away, the machine becomes unconscious. But then it cannot become conscious again, because there's no program you can run on it to make it conscious. Are you saying that a conscious machine is one that is conscious *in spite* of the software that runs on it? Just like you're saying a human is conscious before programming (which I disagree about). That makes little sense to me. Even if the machine's consciousness were \"hardwired\" to it, that's like an ASIC - an algorithm built to the metal. It's still a program whatever is giving it consciousness.\n\n>Of course, that depends on how lose a definition of \"program\" you're willing to accept.

The price at which the underlying security can be bought or sold is referred to as the exercise price or strike price. An American warrant can be exercised at any time on or before the expiration date, while European warrants can only be exercised on the expiration date. Warrants that give the right to buy a security are known as call warrants; those that give the right to sell a security are known as put warrants.  \n\nDebt Security: A debt security is a debt instrument that can be bought or sold between two parties and has basic terms defined, such as the notional amount (the amount borrowed), interest rate, and maturity and renewal date.\n\nPurchase Contract: A sales and purchase agreement (SPA) is a binding legal contract between two parties that obligates a transaction to occur between a buyer and seller. SPAs are typically used for real estate transactions, but they are found in other areas of business.
