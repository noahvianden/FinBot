Their system recognizes that you own the long call and therefore you can sell the short call.\n\n2. Will their trading software/website group those two calls together and display them as one position, a debit spread?\n\nMaybe, or maybe not, but it doesn't actually matter. Contrary to popular belief, a multi-leg option position isn't a discrete entity that actually exists. Though initially  orders for them go to the complex order book, once you open the position, under the hood so to speak, you just have a short call and a long call.

Either all or none, when it comes to conforming to regulations.\n\nNo brokers use the long leg as a \"cover\", in the regulatory sense. A short call can be secured (covered) by long shares. A short call cannot be secured by a long call.\n\nHowever, because of the structure of a vertical spread, the loss potential of a short call leg is mitigated by the long leg. When the short call loses value, the long call almost always gains value. So the overall loss potential of the vertical spread is lower than the naked short call by itself.

Does that mean there is no credit lower limit on rolling for a credit or length of time you won’t go beyond as long as you are rolling for a credit?\n2.

I've rolled for a net credit of .01 in the past, and on very rare occasions have rolled to a lower strike price and paid a very small .05 or less debit.   I try to roll out a week or two and prefer never to get past about 30ish dte.  The goal is to be able to close the position for a scratch or some profit as soon as possible.  Seeing some posts where puts are rolled out months means that stock can move back up but the position cannot be easily closed quickly.  Hopefully this makes sense. \n2. IMO stock shares locks up more capital and is inflexible so I avoid owning shares when trading the wheel as often as possible.  A covered strangle can help get rid of shares faster as long as the position is not too much risk to the account and I am prepared to take more shares if assigned.  Buying shares just to use a covered strangle is not something I do.\n3. This has been discussed many times and I still think SPY has \"single stock risk\".  I know it represents 500 stocks, but it is a single symbol and if the market tanks SPY will drop with the market.  If I am trading 20 positions I want to be well diversified across market sectors with 2 or 3 positions in many different stocks, then if the market tanks not all will drop at the same time or rate.  Some will drop, some will stay the same, and some may even move up.  Trading 20 positions of SPY will see them all drop at the same time.  Could you imagine being assigned 1,000+ shares of SPY and then holding until the market moved back up?

Because B costs 350 while A costs 300, A probably moves more as a percentage, since lower cost usually means higher rate of return for the same dollar movement, but suppose B only cost 250.

So that meant there were up to 3 other Fridays every month with no expirations at all.\n\nThen weeklies where introduced which added an expiration for *every* Friday of every month, 52 a year (barring holidays). Not all options have weeklies. A lot only have monthlies and some only have quarterlies.\n\nThat's one difference. Another, more practical difference is that weeklies usually have smaller market volume and open interest than monthlies, which means liquidity is usually worse on weeklies compared to monthlies.\n\nFinally, most weeklies are issued 6 weeks before their expiration date, while monthlies might be issued up to 4 months before their expiration date.

So just use a limit order and that can't happen. You don't give up anything on *price* by using a limit order, since you are guaranteed to get the limit *or better*. So if your target is $2, the market closed at $2.05 and you don't want anything lower than $1, set the limit at $1 and you have the best chance of getting $2 while being protected from a trash fill.\n\nFor ITM, you don't want to give up too much intrinsic value. So the floor I set is $.05 below the intrinsic value. I won't set a limit below that point, because I'd just be giving away free money if I did.\n\nThe basic rule for filling orders is you can either have them fast or you can have them for the price you want, you usually can't have both at the same time.

Since there is so much time to expiration, all kinds of bad things could happen that could force you into a margin call.

You'd only be in trouble once TSLA goes over 400.\n\nBTW, you could avoid those problems if you gave up on max profit.

I'd say most stock buybacks are good investments for companies on multiple fronts as I will get into. And while I don't have MIT credentials not do I know exactly what the MM Nobel theory is, but I have worked in the business world for 10-15 years, and have invested heavily throughout my career and I'm comfortable with my knowledge of finance.  On that note, \nReasons why buybacks are useful business tool.\n\n1) the purpose of being a publicly trade company is to have access to capital, since the capital is in a public sphere the company has to develop a relationship with investors to encourage investment. Obviously various levers are available to capitalize on the value investors put in the company. By managing the stock price and value, the company can make adjustments to liquidity and not leave investors with constant dilutions. \n\n2) sometimes stock buybacks is putting money into the best investment around, your own company. If AMC buys its own shares at 10 million shares  for $100 million and $500 million market cap. The company goes on to double in value over the next 5 years, and they raise capital through offering 10 million shares at $200 million. They doubled their money through investment. Sometimes betting on yourself is a good bet. \n\n3) Smaller cap stocks need to do buybacks just as readily as major stocks because again investor relations. Smaller caps are well known for diluting shares in order to fund growth and acquisition. But when they find any level of success in these endeavors, it's important to reward share holders that helped them finance that growth by removing dilution when possible through buybacks. \n\nLastly, I don't suggest your views are wrong categorically speaking. Just that I believe it accounts for a minority of the companies. And is only one of many of factors for most businesses. There are definitely zombie stocks out there, and even poorly managed businesses as well. But I think 25% to 35% at most are poorly managed.

That's pretty irrelevant when we're comparing dividends and buybacks, because any shareholder who would have preferred let's say a 2% dividend could just sell 2% of his holdings to simulate the same thing (and he can actually be *more* tax efficient with his sales if he chooses his lots efficiently).\n\nThat's why the buyback is advantageous to the shareholders (as that guy was saying) - because it's the best of both worlds. If you want money out, you can get money out (and even time your sales during the buyback period). If you want your money to stay in, you can leave it in.
