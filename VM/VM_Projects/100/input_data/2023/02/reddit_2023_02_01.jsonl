When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, Intel expects total depreciation expense in 2023 to reduce by roughly $4.2 billion, including an approximate $2.6 billion increase to gross profit, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses and a $1.2 billion decrease in 2023 ending inventory values. Intel’s Q1 2023 outlook includes an estimated $350 million to $500 million benefit to operating margin or $0.07 to $0.10 benefit to EPS from this change, split approximately 75% to cost of sales and 25% to operating expenses. The change in depreciable life will not be counted toward the $3 billion in cost savings in 2023 or the $8 billion to $10 billion exiting 2025 communicated at Q3 2022 earnings.”  \n \nKeep in mind this is perfectly legal but omg does this not look complete sus or what.

{"title": "Fed raises rates a quarter point, expects ‘ongoing’ increases", "selftext": "[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/fed-rate-decision-february-2023-quarter-point-hike.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/fed-rate-decision-february-2023-quarter-point-hike.html)\n\n The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point and gave little indication that it is nearing the end of this hiking cycle.  \n   \nAligning with market expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee boosted the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage point. That takes it to a target range of 4.5%-4.75%, the highest since October 2007.  \n   \nThe move marked the eighth increase in a process that began in March 2022. By itself, the funds rate sets what banks charge each other for overnight borrowing, but it also spills through to many consumer debt products.  \n\n\nThe Fed is targeting the hikes to bring down inflation that, despite recent signs of slowing, is still running near its highest level since the early 1980s.  \n\n\nThe post-meeting statement noted that inflation “has eased somewhat but remains elevated,” a tweak on previous language.  \n   \nMarkets, however, were looking to this week’s meeting for signs that the Fed would be ending the rate increases soon. But the statement provided no such signals.  \n   \nThe document included language noting that the FOMC still sees the need for “ongoing increases in the target range.” Market participants had been hoping for some softening of the phrase, but the statement, approved unanimously, kept it intact.  \n\n\nThe statement did alter one part when describing what will determine the future policy path.  \n\n\nOfficials said they would determine the “extent” of future rate increases based on factors such as the effects so far of the rate hikes, the lags in which policy has an impact, and developments in financial conditions and the economy. Previously, the statement said it would use those factors to determine the “pace” of future hikes, a possible nod that the committee sees an end to the increases somewhere, or at least a continuation of smaller moves ahead.  \n\n\nIn 2022, the Fed approved four consecutive 0.75 percentage point moves before going to a smaller 0.5 percentage point increase in December. In recent public statements, multiple officials said they think the Fed at least can scale back on the size of the increases, without signaling when they could end.  \n\n\nWhile it was raising its benchmark rate, the committee characterized economic growth as “modest” though it noted only that unemployment “has remained low.” The latest job market assessment omitted previous language that employment gains have been “robust.“  \n\n\nOtherwise, the statement remained intact from previous messages as the Fed continues its efforts to arrest inflation.  \n\n\nFed policy is thought to work on a lag – when the central bank raises rates, it takes time for the economy to adjust to tighter controls on money.  \n\n\nThis particular round of inflation started due to Covid-related factors such as clogged supply chains and surging demand for goods over services. The war in Ukraine aggravated rising gas prices, while unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus fueled rising costs across a variety of goods and services.  \n\n\nFood prices have risen more than 10% over the past year. Egg prices alone have soared 60%, butter is up more than 31% and lettuce has jumped 25%, according to Labor Department data through December. Gas prices were ticking lower towards the end of 2022 but have popped higher in recent days, hitting $3.50 a gallon nationally for an increase of about 30 cents over the past month, according to AAA.  \n\n\nFed officials have remained resolute about tackling inflation, though they have said recent numbers show pressures could be easing. The consumer price index declined 0.1% in December on a monthly basis and is up 6.4% from a year ago – down from the peak of 9% last summer but still well above where the Fed feels comfortable.  \n\n\nAlong with the rate hikes, the Fed has been reducing the holdings in its bond portfolio. That has resulted in a reduction of about $445 billion since June, as the Fed has targeted a capped level of $95 billion in maturing bonds it is allowing to roll off each month rather than reinvest.  \n\n\nThe balance sheet reduction has been the equivalent of about 2 percentage points of additional rate hikes, according to the San Francisco Fed. The balance sheet is still at more than $8.4 trillion.  \n\n\nMarkets are watching for where the Fed will finally end the increases.  \n\n\nAt the December FOMC meeting, committee members indicated they see the “terminal rate,” or point where the Fed thinks policy is sufficiently restrictive, as 5.1%. Markets are betting that number is closer to 4.75%, and they expect the Fed to start cutting rates later this year, after one more quarter-point increase in March.  \n\n\nStocks rallied to start 2023 as investors anticipated a less restrictive Fed. ", "id": "10r2wnp", "created_utc": 1675278130.0, "score": 1535, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 349, "comments": [{"body": "Really looking for unemployment numbers until it blows up like before.\n\nAmzn may have earning surprise.

Wall Street is also watching several other numbers on the report:\n\nDaily Active Users (DAUs): 1.99 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\n\n\nMonthly Active Users (MAUs):  2.98 billion expected, according to StreetAccount\n\n\nAverage Revenue per User (ARPU): $10.63 expected, according to StreetAccount\n\n\nMeta’s sales are expected to drop for a third consecutive quarter, underscoring the challenges the social media company faces as economic uncertainty leads businesses to reduce digital ad spending and pause campaigns.\n\nAnalysts expect the Facebook parent company to report a revenue decline of more than 6% for the fourth quarter, and they’re projecting one more quarterly drop before growth begins to tick back up later this year.\n\nWhile the stock market started to rebound in January from a brutal 2022, economic forecasts still show a fairly gloomy 2023, which could spell continuing trouble for the online ad market. A recent Cowen survey of 50 ad buyers found that companies are planning to increase their ad spending in 2023 by only 3.3%, which the investment bank said is “the softest ad growth outlook we’ve seen in five years.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Snap reported fourth-quarter revenue that missed estimates, sending the shares tumbling in extended trading. The company also said its “internal forecast” assumes a revenue drop in the first quarter of between 2% and 10%.\n\nWhile much smaller than Meta, Snap faces some of the same challenges, including a slowdown in online ad spending, increased competition from TikTok and weakened targeted advertising due to Apple’s 2021 iOS privacy update. Alphabet and Amazon will wrap up earnings reports from the major online ad platforms on Thursday, followed by Pinterest next week.\n\nIn November, Meta said it would lay off over 11,000 employees, or 13% of the workforce, as part of the company’s plans to reduce costs.\n\n“We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a letter to employees at the time.\n\nLast year was also marred by Zuckerberg’s costly effort to sell Wall Street on a plan to pivot the company towards the yet-to-be-developed world of the metaverse. Zuckerberg has said the metaverse, which would include virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, could represent the next major way people interact.\n\nThe big bet has frustrated investors, who worry the company is putting too much focus on a futuristic endeavor while its core ad business struggles to revive growth. Meta’s Reality Labs unit, home to the metaverse ambitions, lost nearly $9.4 billion in the first three quarters of 2022.\n\nAnalysts expect Reality Labs to show an operating loss of $4.36 billion for the fourth quarter on revenue of $715.1 million, according to StreetAccount. Meta said last quarter that “Reality Labs operating losses in 2023 will grow significantly year-over-year.”", "id": "10r6b7j", "created_utc": 1675285915.0, "score": 721, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 379, "comments": [{"body": "The narrative switching on this sub is hilarious.

In   fact, REC is the only large-scale producer of silane gas in U.S. and   Europe.\n* Two   highly strategic assets (Moses Lake, Washington and Butte, Montana) in   rapidly expanding industries (megatrends) that should benefit from   lasting political tailwinds and strong profitability outlook. The   industries being solar, semiconductors and batteries (Thus, the   three-legged reference).\n* Hydropower-based clean energy and low carbon footprint.\n* 15% ownership share of a polysilicon plant in Yulin, China.\n* Listed on the Norwegian stock exchange with ticker RECSI. Included in the OBX index which holds the 25 most liquid companies.\n* Unknown   to most U.S. retail investors, most likely because it is a Norwegian   company. Workforce are U.S. based, including management and of course   the assets.\n* Broke   their neck with the U.S. and China trade wars and their Moses Lake   plant, valued at 1.7 billion USD, had to shut down. And this is where it   gets interesting, because things have changed. The plant is now   scheduled for a restart second half this year, 2023! **So, what happened?**\n\n**Six big things happened.**\n\n1. The   world has changed, caused by geopolitical tension, and disruption in   supply chains, such as semiconductors and solar, poses a risk to   national security. More and more protectionism are introduced in both   the U.S. and Europe, and we are witnessing the importance of domestic   manufacturing and supply chains.\n2. The   Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in 2022, resulting  in  REC Silicon receiving a credit of $3 per kg polysilicon produced -   approximately 50 mUSD per year.\n3. The   Chips and Science got signed into law. Spurred by the passage of this   bill we see a huge boost in the American semiconductor industry. REC   Silicon\\`s facility in Butte, MT, has been recognized by the White House   as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of silane gas  production  ([https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/)).\n4. Senate   Bill 5849 by Judy Warnick, Moses Lake. Extending a targeted 43%   business and occupation tax cut for manufacturers of solar panels and   components another five years past the original expiration date of 2027   to 2032. In addition, the bill would allow for the construction or   improvement of existing industrial buildings.\n5. Hanwha   Group, more specific Hanwha Solutions and Hanwha Corporation, recently   became the biggest shareholders in REC Silicon, now controlling 33%.   Hanwha Q CELLS, another company under the Hanwha umbrella, is one of the   world's largest and most recognized manufacturers for its  high-quality,  high efficiency solar cells and modules. Q CELLS recently  announced the  largest investment of its kind in U.S. history, and will  invest  billions in Georgia to create a complete solar supply chain in  the  United States. Hanwha's stake in REC Silicon marks the re-birth of  U.S.  polysilicon.\n6. Silicon   anodes for better batteries are materializing. It has been the talk  the  last couple of years, but finally, it is happening. It is safe to  say  that this creates an even more solid foundation for the company. As  the  former CEO once said ***They (the battery makers) have to come to us, or go to China.***   And to directly reference their website; REC Silicon’s silane is the   material of choice for lithium-ion batteries - and REC is a global   leader in silane-based materials.\n\n**EV/Batteries**\n\nWith  REC Silicon holding this highly strategic position in the supply chain,   prominent players are setting up shop in Moses Lake, Washington. In  fact, right next door, and are becoming neighbours (See image posted   below).\n\nThere is not a whole lot   official information from the company about this situation, yet. We   believe it is just a matter of time before more information are made   available and public. Below is a curated list of what we know this far.\n\n* October 2020 - Group14 & REC Silicon announced they are teaming up to meet demand for the \"Electrification of Everything\" ([https://group14.technology/en/news/group14-rec-silicon-plan-us-factory-to-meet-demand-for-the-electrification-of-everything](https://group14.technology/en/news/group14-rec-silicon-plan-us-factory-to-meet-demand-for-the-electrification-of-everything)).\n* December   2022 - Group14 submits an application for the construction of a  factory in Moses Lake. They mean business and are coming to town (See  image  posted below). In addition to this, they closes another funding  round, representing one of top 10 largest climate tech raises in 2022.

Wafers are made into solar cells, and then  solar  panels. By using Fluidized Bed Reactor (FBR) technology, using  one-tenth  of the electricity needed for Siemens technology, affords  low-cost  material and ultra-low carbon footprint, making its solar  module value  chain more sustainable. FBR is the patented technology of  the company,  and makes it possible produce solar-grade polysilicon in a  continuous,  rather than a batch, process. This makes REC Silicon one  of the most  efficient producers of solar-grade silicon in the world,  and their  product is some of the least expensive silicon available for  solar  panels.\n\nUsing  hydropower-based  clean energy, REC Silicon produces low-carbon  polysilicon without  emitting greenhouse gases. Compared to carbon-heavy  polysilicon  manufactured overseas that often relies on coal power, REC  Silicon's  “clean polysilicon” is expected to draw more demand in the  coming years  as international scrutiny over industrial emissions and  carbon  footprints grows.\n\nA quick  recap.  REC Silicon's biggest plant shut down in 2019. Without access to  Chinese  market, their lifeline got cut off. There was no solar module  value  chain outside of China. Now, almost four years later, things are  looking  brighter. Solar module value chains are forming in both the  U.S. and  Europe. REC Silicon is teaming up with Hanwha Q CELLS, for  delivery of  solar grade polysilicon. As of this writing, they have  ongoing  negotiations with Hanwha Solutions towards reaching an offtake  agreement  for all FBR polysilicon production ([https://recsilicon.com/news-article/?slug=rec-silicon-update-of-restart-and-offtake-activities-in-moses-lake](https://recsilicon.com/news-article/?slug=rec-silicon-update-of-restart-and-offtake-activities-in-moses-lake)).   With Hanwha Q CELLS being one of the most trusted names, and ambitious   companies in the solar industry, this is of course promising.\n\nEver   since Hanwha became the largest shareholder, they have been promoting   REC Silicon as a vital part of their bigger plan. The importance of  this  newborn partnership is certainly no secret to Hanwha, and this is   highlighted by the statements below.\n\n>*This   year, Hanwha also acquired REC Silicon, a crucial step along the   company’s path to building out a full solar value chain, and expanded   its plans for its green energy businesses in the U.S. thanks to the   incentives in the groundbreaking Inflation Reduction Act.*([https://www.hanwha.com/en/news\\_and\\_media/stories/sustainability/hanwhas-year-in-review-2022.html).-----](https://www.hanwha.com/en/news_and_media/stories/sustainability/hanwhas-year-in-review-2022.html).-----)*By   investing in REC Silicon, with US plants that produce special gas for   semiconductor as well as polysilicon, we are expanding our business  into  high value–added core industrial materials.* ([https://www.hanwha.com/en/products\\_and\\_services/chemicals-materials.html).-----](https://www.hanwha.com/en/products_and_services/chemicals-materials.html).-----)*By   becoming the largest shareholder of REC Silicon, Hanwha will expand  its  renewable energy portfolio in the U.S. and help American businesses   secure raw material critical to the solar supply chain. As global   competition over clean energy sources intensifies in the coming years,   Hanwha will work towards establishing a highly efficient, low-carbon   system to boost clean energy technology.*\\-----*Hanwha   Solutions’ strategic investment in REC Silicon represents a step   towards establishing a highly efficient, low carbon solar value chain in   the US and to ensure that REC Silicon plays an integral role in these   efforts. Hanwha Solutions’ knowledge, expertise, and capabilities are   expected to enhance REC Silicon’s ability to take advantage of   opportunities and developing markets in the solar, semiconductor, and   battery industries.* ([https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/18/2336964/0/en/REC-Silicon-ASA-Strategic-equity-investment-by-Hanwha-Solutions.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/11/18/2336964/0/en/REC-Silicon-ASA-Strategic-equity-investment-by-Hanwha-Solutions.html)).\n\nLets end this solar section with a statement from Joe Biden, on the Hanwha Q CELLS investment decision ([https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/11/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-hanwha-q-cells-announcement/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/01/11/statement-from-president-joe-biden-on-hanwha-q-cells-announcement/)).\n\n**Semiconductors**\n\nREC   Silicon\\`s electronic grade certified polysilicon businesses provide a   variety of form factors for uses in high-tech energy and electronics   industries. From motor control and power conversion processes for hybrid   and electric vehicles, wind energy, and high voltage transmission, 5G   communications, high-speed trains, IoT (internet of things), and big   data to manufacturing of 12’ semiconductor wafers used in memory   processors, optics, and micro electromechanical systems (MEMS).\n\nThe   Chips and Science got signed into law. Spurred by the passage of this   bill we are expecting to see a huge boost in the American semiconductor   industry. REC Silicon's facility in Butte, MT, has been recognized by   the White House as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of  silane gas production ([https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/](https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/aug/14/what-chips-act-means-montana/)).\n\nWhile   the company is not set to benefit directly from this specific Chips  and  Science act (unlike the IRA),  this will nevertheless create  conditions  that are intended to boost demand for REC's electronic-grade  silicon.  The Chips and Science Act is intended to expand domestic  production of  semiconductor chips, which are made out of  electronic-grade silicon that  the company produces at its facility in  Butte, Montana.\n\n**Stock price and valuation**\n\n**Ticker  RECSI**, Norwegian Stock Exchange. Included in the OBX index which holds   the 25 most liquid companies. Heavily traded and volatile. A  significant  number of retail investors owns this stock in Norway. They  have  recognized the seemingly limited downside, and huge upside. REC   Silicon\\`s foundation is stronger then ever due to recent developments in   both the political and the industrial landscape. We are slowly   identifying larger investors taking place. But the stock will continue   to be volatile and manipulated by strong traders. We have never seen   treeshakes like this, and there is a great deal of psychology in play.   But we expect the float to change when contracts are signed, and we also   expect the stock to reprice significantly.\n\n* As of this writing the stock price is NOK 14 (1.4 USD), which values the company at 586 mUSD\n* Assuming 100% capacity we are looking at an annual EBITDA range of 200-400 mUSD by 2025.\n* Moses Lake plant valued at 1.7 billion USD about to restart (valued at 0 in the company's accounts due to amortization)\n* For   a business with strategic products for the U.S. solar industry and the   lithium-ion battery markets, and the know-how and experience to  consider  avenues for deeper expansion into these rapidly growing  industries, we  believe REC could have potential to command much higher  EBITDA multiples  then what the current market valuation implies at the  time of this  writing (<3x EV/EBITDA)\n* Under   the new IRA law, REC Silicon will be eligible for a $3-per-kilogram   refundable tax credit for every kilogram of solar-grade silicon the   company sells. This will have a favorable impact of $48 million per year   at full production.\n* Potential to command a very large premium on selling silane gas to anode producers.\n* REC   is uniquely positioned with two highly strategic assets in rapidly   expanding industries that should benefit from lasting political   tailwinds, strong profitability outlook and attractive funding   opportunities\n* Needless   to say, there is upside potential for this stock. Recent investment   behaviour of several anode producers are clearly indicating that a blue   sky scenario is about to materialize for REC Silicon's. In this   scenario, Norwegian brokers have indicated a fair value of NOK 50-70   (5-7 USD).\n\n**Potential short term triggers**\n\n* Signed contract with Hanwha for delivery of solar-grade polysilicon\n* Signed contracts with anode and battery producers\n* Project Riser (More on this later)\n* Yulin IPO China (REC Silicons's 15% valued at around 180 mUSD)\n* Grant   from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the development of a   supply chain for next generation batteries (REC has been recognized by   the White House as a potential candidate for domestic expansion of   silane gas production). And REC has the past two years been a   participant in several meetings with the DOE for securing solar and   batteries in the U.S.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My position](https://preview.redd.it/elpflev4zkfa1.png?width=504&format=png&auto=webp&s=1722e7b37b70a2e27bc749f8ce75503b7bf9e4b2)\n\nThanks for reading - happy, profitable investing!", "id": "10qv0dt", "created_utc": 1675258925.0, "score": 306, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "Currently up 32% as we speak.

Maybe they put on a pair of AR glasses to shop for a new couch for their living room instead of visiting a store. Maybe they have a wire jacked into their brain so they can close their eyes and play Minecraft for an hour like they're really there.\n\nIn any case, the more types of businesses and experiences move to this type of interaction, the less time people will spend on websites, mobile apps, movie theaters, you name it.\n\nThat raises questions for existing businesses today. How will Walmart reach people who aren't going to their website as much? Or if a band want to promote its new album, how are they going to target people with ads if they're not scrolling through the Instagram app anymore?\n\nSo Facebook (now meta) took especially strong notice of that last point. They think the metaverse spells the end of the road for their existing businesses in websites and mobile apps. Maybe it's not this year, or in five years, or even 10 or more. But VR/AR/virtual spaces will be the LAST medium. What could possibly supplant a medium that completely takes over your sense of sight, sound, and touch?\n\nSo they're making a giant bet that they can be the platform on which all this other stuff gets built. Walmart doesn't to build its own virtual store platform from the ground up when Facebook can just give them the tools. And if you go to Facebook first when you go virtually shopping, well, they can sell you search ads/display ads. Or whatever else they hope the revenue model will be.\n\nMind you, Facebook isn't the only one trying to be the big platform.
