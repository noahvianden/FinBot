Places like America and Australia pay a lot better, so for countries that don't pay as good it is much more difficult even if the cost of living is lower. A lot of people have the impression that Japan is expensive (it used to be, but not anymore compared to other developed nations), so the low wages make this even worse. \n\nAnother thing that is a negative is the work culture. Working for a lot of Japanese companies sucks and even most Japanese people will admit that (although more companies are changing, so things are getting better).

You could make the argument for oil futures pricing to have some predictive power but the supply-setting power of OPEC makes it very hard to do so.\n4. Short term treasury yields merely reflect where the fed funds rate is. That's just common sense as they are competing for the same short-term liquid yield-chasing money flows. Longer-term yields, however, do appear to be pricing in a lower funds rate in the future. \n5. Gold prices highest correlation is not with inflation rate but with treasury yields. As it is a non-yielding asset, it is most attractive when real yields are exceptionally low and not so attractive when yields are high. The current weakness in gold therefore also only reflects the rise in yields.\n\n\nSo I would say, all in all theres not much conflicting information here:\nStock and gold prices reflect an orderly inverse relation to yields and oil futures and long term yields seem to be pointing towards a small economic slowdown which would result in a lowering of short term yields in the future.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "In a few years we‚Äôll be able to say, ahh, this or that was the clue we should‚Äôve seen, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the charts.
