I think youre overthinking that part...\n\nMy statement was general about how statistics are designed and used. The field of math **itself** does not \"leave out vital information to make the narrative fit\"... The presenter does. And in statistics, it's acceptable... There are so many models/functions available to use when doing analysis, and you pick the one that is most advantageous to the depiction you are attempting to create. The other part of the equation is the data you are going to collect, you are carefully selecting which data that you put in your model so that it yields the desired result..... So in that respect, yes stats will almost always have a \"narrative\"\n\nIf the news reports that 90% of Americans hate joe biden... They somehow used a method to get that factual result. They may have went to a neighborhood that has nothing but trump/pence signs in them. knocked on 10 doors and got 9 people to respond negatively... And being that this is America, there is no lie in those statistics... This is just one low hanging fruit method... If my memory serves me correctly I believe it's called \"sampling\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you look at that post... how many facts are in that picture that can tell you exactly what they used to do their analysis? Almost none... Do you even know if they only plugged in numbers strictly from EV sales???? Ford sells a lot more vehicles than Tesla... that would drop Ford's 'earnings per vehicle' drastically.  Is this sales in one country??? Is this sales in a country where Fords are barely sold or Teslas prominently sold? Why Q3, Why \"Net\", Why only those specific automakers? Every Tesla fanboy likes to throw out \"Tesla does more than sell cars\" - is that money included in the Q3 revenue and then used in this equation???\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Do you think this is an example of that? Do you consider anything math related in business to be stats?\n\nIf it is a comparison, yes... If it was just a representation of one company's data... then yes you're right, I would consider it more a report ... But if it is a comparison of reports... then methodology about the data shouldnt be ignored since it has a the ability to lie, while still being factual...\n\nI say this not to be a dick, but until you've worked through the exercises in a stats course, your mind won't be able to fathom how deeply shitty some of the methods are to paint ludicrous pictures, that are acceptable facts. It is indeed crazy. I wish I still had my lessons where we did a case study where we used 2 different models with the same data to produce completely contradictory narratives. Once I got done with that class I said I will never trust another poll, or infographic, or 'result'... **And if I am going to even remotely entertain them, I need to AT LEAST see the source data.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis book is older than everybody on this post... not saying go buy it or even read it...

Have fun paying to get it fixed eventually down the line.\n\n\"It's not safe to drive.\"\n\nLiterally one of the safest vehicles you CAN drive because there is no engine, the battery sits on the bottom meaning you have a low center of gravity, and the steel framing of the vehicle absorbs a crap ton of the damage during a crash. You may have heard the story of someone who intentionally drove their Tesla down a cliff to commit suicide with his family inside and they survived with quite minimal injuries. In fact, Tesla has probably the safest vehicle scores tested in their Model S, Y, and E.\n\n\"Their interior is cheap. That's how they are able to make high margins.\"\n\nThe interior isn't luxury but that's not what you're buying a Tesla for. You're buying it for the technology they offer, supercharging network, more reliable EV, and the fact that other EV makers just aren't capable of producing a similar EV product. When you can play Steam games, have OTA updates to improve the cameras of your vehicle without replacing them, increase the efficiency of vehicle range, etc., let me know. No one comes close to Tesla in software and tech capabilities. If the tech isn't for you, don't buy a Tesla. It's really that simple. You're wasting your money.\n\nThe reason Tesla's margins are higher has to do with lower battery costs, lack of a dealership network, way more efficient manufacturing processes, and they are a master at saving money because they worked at the company since the inception and know every part that isn't required. Current legacy automakers leadership took over when those car companies have been constructing vehicles for nearly a century. They're more concerned with the financials than the engineering within the company which is why they allowed some random guy who owned PayPal to come in and dominate the EV industry despite having no experience in vehicles. Musk was in Tesla before they even had a vehicle out so they had to start from point A and thus, everything was designed for maximum efficiency and lower cost.\n\nAgain, if the tech isn't for you, please do NOT buy a Tesla. There are better vehicles at that price you can buy. But if the tech is something that you enjoy using, it's one of the best vehicles to drive.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "With that quality are you even surprised?

MSFT has known nearly a decade of flat earnings before it reinvented itsself and earning exploded around, 2018. None of that future outcome was in any way guaranteed and in no way was that information somehow included in a P/E ratio. Ignoring your hindsight bias and going back to a snapshot of a stock screener in 2009 would likely reveal many such \"low p/e\" opportunities that you would have been more likely to select if p/e was your sole criterium with far less beneficial outcomes. Just like last year when this subreddit was advocating buying ZIM at 2 P/E which was one of the lowest ratios in the market back then. It is currently trading at 0.4\n\nP/Es are simply not comparable between companies, they are dominated by earnings cycles, company reinvestment, capital structure, company types and management decisions.\n\nThe only way to decently value a company, and include some forecast of how not only earnings, but also margins and capital structure could develop is by doing a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\n\nSo, without going into too much detail, lets look at what Amazon's P/E is hiding just for next year:\n\nProjected total net earnings are about $14 billion, while AWS alone could account for **$25bil** in profit (assuming 25% growth rate [lowest yearly growth rate in the past 5y was 29%] and 25% margins [5Y avg margins are about 28%], 2022 AWS net profit was $22.8b). So going off of net profit alone in a P/E, you're already assuming net negative margins on domestic and international revenue and by calling it \"expensive\" based on P/E, you are thus implying these things cannot ever improve, even though domestic sales averaged a 4% margin over 2017-2021.\n\nLets makes some assumptions and estimate revenue for next year per segment:\n\n- domestic sales grow 5% in the next year [avg 5Y growth rate was about 22% with 13% as the lowest in 2022] to approx $331b\n\n- international sales grow 15% [avg 5Y growth rate was about 17% with -8% as the lowest in 2022] to approx $135b (please note that due to the negative margin projections, higher growth actually means a *more* negative impact on earnings in this case)\n\n- AWS, like I said earlier, grows 25% [avg 5Y growth rate was about 38% with 29% as the lowest in 2022], to $100b\n\nWith these numbers we can arrive at the analyst consensus of $14b net earnings by assuming following margins (example):\n\n- **-1% on domestic** totalling -$3.3b net income [avg 5Y margins about 4%]\n\n- **-5% on international** totalling -$6.7b net income [avg 5Y margins about -2.5%]\n\n- **25% on AWS** totalling $25b net income [avg 5Y margins about 28.6%]\n\nDo you notice how these projections are bordering on pessimistic and likely very possible to improve? The exceptionally high sensitivity of net income to the majority of amazons revenue (due to have margins around the breakeven level) makes margin improvements have an enormous impact. So what would the next year would look like if amazon managed to return to its average margin of 4% on domestic, and just breakeven or abandon international at 0% margin? Earnings instantly would go up to $38bil, a 175% improvement and it's P/E would instantly drop to approximately 26 at current prices.

Comparing it to VW or Toyota therefore is a moot point. Comparing it to similar producers is what’s interesting.\n\nMercedes has an overall better margin as of now for its whole car line-up. BMW was close to Tesla in that. Would be interesting to know how these two compare to Tesla in E.V. only (I don’t know whether the MB or BMW margins in EVs are better or equal or worse than for the rest their fleet).\n\nI can easily point out that Ferrarri and Porsche have better margins than Tesla per car. But that is hardly surprising as they are niche upper class products. \n\nWhat I don’t understand about the Tesla hype versus hate is - why not look at it with a reasonable view? Tesla has A very decent margin even after price cuts. Tesla has some technological advantage over legacy automakers as of know, especially in terms of efficiency (I saw a very recent test comparing Tesla to others and the mileage was about 15-25% better on a Tesla).\n\nOn the other hand Tesla had to cut prices (lowering margins), is struggling in some markets (esp. China) and its once towering technological lead is melting away. MB has the arguably better or at least comparable EQS which is competing with an older Model S. MB and BMW have produced large E-SUVs that can challenge the model Y. MB is offering the first level 3 self drive (though it’s still pretty limited). Hyundai and others have produced other models that come closer and closer to Tesla.\n\nThe two main things about Teslas car business will - in my opinion - be: \n\n(1) will they keep up their technological lead and introduce renewed models (and what does R&D cost as it needs to be priced into margins). If they don’t keep a tech lead then they may soon struggle as their quality and other features are at best average. \n\n(2) will they be able to introduce models that are more mass market suited for Asian and European markets? This includes compact cars and smaller variants with lower prices. Right now the Renault Zoes, ID.3s, Hyundai Konas etc. run unopposed by Tesla as the smallest from them is a middle class Sedan. Without such models growth will be more limited in some European and Asian markets. But where are the factory capacities and models for that?\n\nNow, I’m not going into the other stuff Tesla does. There is the case of the charging infrastructure which can be a great asset. There is the talk about other tech but none of that has so far earned money (it has burned money but it could also become a real winner - that however is phantasy / possibility and not present reality). \n\nI also have some serious doubts about the Semi as it is built for a pretty specific mission and enters a much more conservative field of business. But I could be wrong there. \n\nAll in all Tesla is a good business case as of now (assuming the numbers are correct and demand keeps up or grows further). However it is still heavily valuated for a carmaker. There is lots of imagination and growth projection even in the current price. That’s all well if you believe Tesla can solve the above issues and stay ahead of the pack OR keep up their better margins while at least being comparable OR getting other projects to be money printers.

We buy at higher volumes at greater discounts from suppliers that are finding more efficient ways to make the parts.\n\nEach additional car (marginal) made today will be more profitable.
