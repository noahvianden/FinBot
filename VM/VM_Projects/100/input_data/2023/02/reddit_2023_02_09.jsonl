Their production might struggle to keep up with growth targets, their market share might decline faster or be higher than expected, you can't predict demand due to macro conditions, the self driving might fail or suddenly happen and make it the most valuable car manufacturer ever. There a so many variables that actually predicting future cash flows and when they will comes is really hard. Sure, it might grow fast, but the opposite is also possible at least and even if things pan out, will they grow by 30, 40, 50 or even 60% p.a.? \n\nAll those factors matter massively for the \"true\" value of the company. Depending on when and how high really returns to share holders will comes the justifiable valuation changes a lot, thus making it a Risky investment in my perspective. Additionally, if you are looking at volatility as a measure of risk (which i dislike) then it is certainly very Risky.\n\nAnd for the same reason (distant cash flows) the valuation should heavily rely on interest rates. With small changes in rates the discount rates changes massively, changing the present value of the cash flows. Since the expected shareholder returns are further in the future than for a lot of other stocks, this effect is stronger.\n\nThat being said, on paper they do look stronger than they used to and you will always be able to find even riskier stocks out there. But at least i can't say with certainty that tesla will be 1) still around in 10 or 20 years. So much might happen and their competitive advantage is there, but at least for me, not strong enough with rising competitions, potential flaws in their quality and so far very high margins.

You started to do the math, just follow it through!\n\n> For Q1-22, Tesla sold around 310k vehicles.\n\nCorrect.  Automotive revenues were $16.681 billion, so revenue per vehicle delivered was $53,801.35.  Costs in the segment was $11.322 billion, so cost per vehicle was $36,516.93, and gross profit per vehicle was $17,284.42.  The gross profit margin was therefore 32.1%.\n\n> Q4-22 was already up roughly 100k\n\nIt was up 95,230.  In that quarter revenue per vehicle delivered was $52,573.79 (down slightly thanks to discounts in China), cost per vehicle was $38,948.57 (input prices going way up more than offsetting cost efficiencies from ramping production), and profit per vehicle was $13,625.22 for a gross automotive margin of 25.9%.  \n\nNow, despite Tesla selling 95,230 more vehicles in Q4 than Q1, their gross profit in the automotive segment only went from $5.359 billion to $5.522 billion.  \n\n> this quarter is likely to be up another 50k.\n\nOk, so lets round up and say Tesla will deliver 475k vehicles, an increase of 69,722 over Q4.  Now lets say those huge prices cuts average out to $4k per vehicle delivered in the quarter (I think that is actually quite conservative - most people are estimating the drop is more like 10% on average or well over $5k per car).  Lets also assume Tesla manages to reduce costs by $1k per vehicle delivered as they continue to ramp production in Berlin and Austin.  \n\nUsing those figures, Tesla's gross automotive margins would \"only\" drop to 21.9% (the company seemed to guide towards 20% on the earnings call), and gross profits would be $5.047 billion, down $312 million from Q1 last year and down $475 million from Q4.\n\n> Looking specifically at last year, Q4 made more automotive profit excluding credits than in Q1 even though margins had dropped 7%.\n\nCorrect, but only because they sold 95,230 more cars.  If my assumptions are right (which again seem pretty conservative to me given the size of the price cuts), Tesla would need to sell about 115k more vehicles in Q1 to have the same amount of gross profits as they did in Q4. \n\n> This doesn't mean that Tesla will for sure have more profits this quarter, but they could with more sales, lower expense per vehicle, and better margins on other products.\n\nI agree that things like unexpectedly high regulatory credit sales or profits from the energy segment could still push profits to a record high in the quarter.

It should be the other way round. I've seen a few comments indicating that the \"compact car\" or \"model 2\" or \"3rd Gen\" will be selling at more typical margins for a smaller car. I mean, that's why Ford abandoned \"smaller\" cars right?\n\nThis [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhiQBhOT8Bk) goes into the reasons that Tesla's are so high, and how EVs are simply *different* in how they build the margins, and why Tesla is not, and *has* not, been chasing purely minimal costs at the cost of everything else.\n\nI am becoming more confident that Tesla is pushing ahead with the \"single piece cast body\" I put that in quotes because it might not be a totally accurate description. But it will be close enough that the time to build \"model 2\" will be cut in half, it will use far less robots, and less humans as well. The floor space needed/used will go down in line with those reductions and the cost. Because of all this, I expect that Tesla can build a $25,000 car at margins never seen before.

I don't know how much premium you collected, depends on when you sold them. Maybe $8 per share per contract? That would be a credit of $1,600.\n\nTesla rose to $210 so now the calls you sold are (a) ITM and (b) worth $15.65 per share per contract, which is more than when you sold them.\n\nYou have two options:\n\n1. Buy back the options you sold. You will pay $3,130, the contracts will be gone, and you'll keep your 200 Tesla shares. This is a good idea if your investment thesis has changed and you think Tesla is going to the moon and you want to take the loss on the options now to keep your shares long-term.\n2. Let the options expire ITM tomorrow. You will be assigned on the calls, and have to sell your 200 Tesla shares at $197.5, collecting $39,500. Even though that's below the going market price for TSLA, it's above what you paid for the shares, so you will make a total profit, cradle to grave, on your TSLA shares of $39,500 - $32,000 + (whatever credit you received for selling the two options) = min. $7,500. But your shares of TSLA will be gone. This is a good idea if you want to bank some cash immediately and don't want to invest in TSLA for the long term.\n\nEdit: My advice is since you clearly don't know what the hell you're doing, just do nothing and let the options expire tomorrow evening.

IMO a more accurate comparison will be tablet vs. smartphone. Even though they seem similar people generally use them for different use cases, and everyone with a tablet also has a smartphone.\n\nThe issue with things like chatGPT is that it's one interpretation/source of information. How do you know if it's correct or what you want? Get it to list its sources? Hmm... But that's just a list. Let's make it more readable, with different text sizes and colours. Oh, and a quick summary of each source maybe. Hmmm.... This is starting to look familiar.. almost like.. a regular search engine.\n\nAlso don't you usually want multiple sources? For example: shopping, news, travel/event tickets, etc.. these are all things where people specifically want to compare different sources of information (prices, options, deals, etc.). This also happens to be where most of the money is.\n\nI just don't see how people would want to rely on one AI interpretation when you can quickly sift through a bunch of good sources. Maybe for a very small subset of searches. Fundamentally it seems like the wrong tool for search in most cases (particularly the ones that make money).\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are applications for chatGPT that a search engine can't do, but my point is that a search engine is still the best way of searching for things in most cases.

{"title": "Hidden Behemoth: Palantir (PLTR)", "selftext": "Hey guys\n\nBeen awhile since I posted a thread but I personally feel this is too good to give up.  I know the talk of the town is AI, and Palantir being literally one of the top AI companies is not getting any love. For that reason I believe this is one of the best trades right now.  I will keep this short for those who can't read longer than two minutes.\n\nPros:\n-  Named top AI company in 2022 by IDC!!\n-  While everyone is cutting staff, they are expanding and hiring\n-  Continues to win serious government contracts, such as 229million dollar contract with special forces, 96million over 5 years with Department of Homeland Security \n- In bid for NHS contract in europe for 480million dollars along with other AI companies like C3.Ai, currently the NHS is running palantir software\n- Increase in commercial clients which is vital for the companies success, just partnered with Microsoft Azure, Hertz, extension of 50m with SOMPO\n- much much more\n\nCons: \n- Lots of government contracts which are seen as relatively risky as they can lose them anytime\n- Diluted shareholders over the past year but that has since slowed down, 2022 lost them a lot of money from SPACs investment, they had a -300m write down from investment but those are behind us!!  \n- very controversial CEO Daddy Karp \n\nEverything is lining up for this company in the right trajectory, earnings are coming up next Monday and options are extremely cheap as well.   All time low is 6 bucks, that's only 26.8% from today's share price, but it definitely has the potential to double up if not more.  No one knows where this is going but risk reward is just too good to give up in my opinion.\n\n\nPosition is 59974 shares at 8.36 \nOptions: 142 x 16JUN23 $11C, 49 x 19MAY23 $12C\n\nGood luck!  Hope this help somebody!\n\n\nEdit: wow this thread exploded.  So many haters, just tryna help where i can.  Even if you don't believe the turnaround story which is a fact, you have to take into account the risk vs reward.  Losing 30% of your investment vs doubling your money is a no brainer to anyone.  Their tech is definitely one of the best without a doubt or government and Microsoft won't be using them.  Comparing to Chatgpt is comparing apples to oranges.  IMO if you are bag holding, why not lower your average cost and see?

Finally they tend to have very nice termination clauses which can make more money than the actual contract in terms of profit.\n\nRather I see this as a big plus for Palantir as it provides a very stable revenue base.

I remember when we’d sell to businesses (think bars/restaurants), the service literally cost 10x or more as much per TV. So think when you had a DTV subscription at home you pay for your package (say $100 for your “base plan” service), and then $10 per each additional box so if there were 4 additional rooms with TVs in the house your bill would be $140.00 per month. Well, if you’re a sports bar/business restaurant, not only did your base plan cost at least tripe for the same pkg (so for arguments sake say, $300mo), each additional TV box would cost you about $100 per month. They justified this difference in pricing by arguing, “*More people are watching, and youre making money off of our product, so you’re going to pay for it.*” So let’s say just a small dive bar with 3-4 TVs would be paying at least a thousand bucks per month for their DirecTV bill. But a big sports bar like a Buffalo Wild Wings or ESPN Zone with 50+ TVs would be paying $5000-$10,000 or more per month for their DirecTV! And they did it because we exclusively owned the NFL Sunday Ticket so we knew we had them by the balls. \n\nSome people may think this is justified, because in this case a sports bar obviously wouldn’t have customers if they didn’t have the games on. But if you’re even just some *small business* like a doctors office, or local mechanic shop (all businesses I’d also sell too) who just want a TV in the office/lobby/break room for your staff or the 2-3 customers sitting in the lobby/waiting room watching the news or whatever you had on and I’m telling you, “*That’ll be $1,000*” it made for a hard sell at times.

If you have a better solution for monetizing movie, software, media, books, game, or music creation I'll be happy to hear it.\n\nYou know, sometimes it's just life. Rules are there, you have to follow them. We all wish we'd live in a universe where movies can be streamed like music where every movie is available on an affordable streaming service similar to Spotify. Unfortunately, movie studios decide to monetize it a different way. You don't have a say in this. They make the movies, they make the calls. If you're going to make a movie, you're free to sell it differently. But as I see it, I, myself, cannot change the way things are. Piracy will not change it either. Even if more people start pirating, it won't change things either, as movie quality will just drop with less money available (including the movies you pirate obviously). Piracy is simply a statement that you're denying the system and think you're above everyone else. You think your opinion is so unique, but at the end, everyone probably agrees with you that the system is rigged. Difference is that we don't use this to justify exploiting it. \n\nYou'll find this discussion in all kinds of topics involving copyrights and licenses. People pirate games, software, books, music, or other things. The argument is always the same: the system is rigged and big corp is making too much money anyways. This is merely a justification for saving money, usually because the subject is expensive to purchase and you think it's expensive for no reason. You also think that you're part of a bigger movement, out for changing the way things are.
