{"title": "WBD the sleeping giant waking up", "selftext": "# WBD\n\nWBD is a media entertainment giant that has had a rough last few years, but since the time I last posted the stock has reached a bottom and has started to climb up again, there are several reasons for this which I will explain on this post.\n\n# 1- Warner success in 2022\n\nAs said earlier this has been a rough year for the stock price, the company has a severe debt problem which some believe they are not going to pull through, this has led Zaslav to cut back on projects that did not have great outlook and focus on the diamonds of this company (Wizarding world, Game of Thrones, DC : Joker(2019), Batman(2022)).\n\nThis has brought great success in the form of House of Dragon, Hogwarts Legacy, The DC movies and the experiment, The Last of Us which is the latest series that is raging everywhere. In terms of numbers most of this projects broke records, House of dragon premiere broke HBO´s viewership raking up 10 million viewers, Hogwarts legacy is currently the best selling game on the major videogame selling platforms (Steam, Epic games) and The last of us has had the largest surge of viewers of any series from one week to another (22%) from 4.7 million viewers to 5.7 million.\n\nThis shows how Warner Brothers is still king of entertainment having the best quality, and it will only get better, since Zaslav has already said he would much rather have a bunch of high quality shows and franchises than to follow Disney, Netflix style of having a shit ton of shows that no one watches or are deemed lower quality. Furthermore, the success of Hogwarts legacy shows how fast wbd gaming is expanding into the broader gaming market to make place for future dlc and expansions, even thought its worth mentioning that Multiversus, a free multiplayer fighting game they released a few months back is basically dead in the water although having posted decent numbers on its release. This is also accompanied by their high revenue numbers on their cable business, the revenue will continue decreasing over the years but it is what Zaslav is using to pivot the company into new and classic ways in which warner studios and discovery can make money, be this the streaming services or the cinema releases.\n\nIn short, WBD´s sucess in 2022 in terms of their Entertainment Business, shows how they are picking up pace, and with the incoming revenue from HBO MAX, their cable business and WBD gaming accompanied by the tax write offs on poor outlook projects and layoffs they should be able to get enough revenue to pay their debt\n\n# 2- HBO MAX, Discovery+\n\nAs said earlier WBD is boasting great legacy content which keeps bringing people into their streaming services, The Wizarding world, Game of thrones, Adult Swim and all of the Discovery content keeps bringing people into the platform which are expected to grow as these new projects like The last of us get a fanbase.\n\nThe Elephant in the room in regards to HBO MAX and Discovery is how will they manage to merge into the new streaming service, this is currently unknown, but the name of the combined service is rumored to be Beam. In regards to Discovery+ , they are still unavailable in a number of regions which represents unexploited markets that sooner or later will be expanded to, this means more revenue towards subscriptions and larger audiences as a whole. The latest numbers concerning to subscribers in the platforms give 92.1 million in combination of both streaming services, they are projected to grow into the 150 million at some point in 2025.\n\n# 3- Comparison with competitors\n\nIn terms of valuation analysis via ratios and sales comparison with the competition WBD is showing some great numbers, excluding their P/E ratio.\n\nWBD\n\nP/B : 0.71\n\nP/S : 1.34\n\nP/FCF : 21.55\n\nSales Q/Q : +211.8%\n\nDIS\n\nP/B : 2.05\n\nP/S : 2.39\n\nP/FCF : 2144.73\n\nSales Q/Q: +7.8%\n\nNFLX\n\nP/B : 7.44\n\nP/S : 5.11\n\nP/FCF : 99.74\n\nSales Q/Q: +1.90%\n\nThe only company that comes close to WBD in this comparison is PARA, which even though it looks undervalued via ratios, it does not come close in regards of the growth and production of content that WBD can achieve. It has to be said that if you don´t like WBD for anything in particular, the undervalued stock you should see in this sector is PARA\n\n# Debt\n\nThis is the main issue why WBD is so undervalued in terms of their share price, their current debt levels are sky high in a macro-economic environment that does not allow for an option to refinance into a lower interest rate payment. With a debt to equity ratio of 1.03 this means that WBD has more than 30 billion dollars in debt, it has to be said than more than in average the coupons they pay for the debt are of 4% annually and the principals are of a very long maturity, more than a decade or two in some cases, this gives a lot of time for Zaslav to develop his plan of restructuring the company into a massive growth cash cow. If the rates where higher and maturity shorter this would mean a really serious issue for the company, but there is plenty of time until the main component of the debt expires to solve this issue, and Zaslav has given it a high priority and is being reduced at a fast pace.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSince the last time I posted the stock has been on a ride, surfing a harsh macroeconomic environment, getting in lows as below 9$ a share up to the point that all of its successes of the year, its growth outlook and its debt reduction have gotten it up 14.22$ a share, the current rally has helped, but this stock remains severely undervalued with price targets in the 20\\`s range.\n\nThe next earnings release for WBD is coming in a week or two, I expect it to be a beat which would send the stock into a deeper rally and some nice gains in the way, on the other hand if the stock dumps on earnings I will probably continue buying more if it gets down to the 10$ dollar range in which it sat a few months ago, considering i DCA´d from my first position at 14.37 deep into an average cost of 10.47 I have to admit I have a safe margin until the stock price starts hurting.\n\nThis is all I have to say about this Sleeping giant of a company, have a great weekend and good luck.\n\nSources:\n\nFinviz:\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBD&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WBD&p=d)\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DIS&p=d)\n\n[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NFLX&p=d)\n\nDebt:  [https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc\\_financials/2022/q2/WBD-Outstanding-Debt-as-of-June-30-2022.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/WBD-Outstanding-Debt-as-of-June-30-2022.pdf)\n\nQ3 ER: [https://wbd.com/wp-content/themes/warner-bros-discovery-corporate/pdf/WBD-3Q22-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://wbd.com/wp-content/themes/warner-bros-discovery-corporate/pdf/WBD-3Q22-Earnings-Release.pdf)", "id": "10zy3xp", "created_utc": 1676149984.0, "score": 270, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for this.\n\nHard pass though.", "score": 265, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah saying that 4% coupon payments annually on 30 billion dollars of debt isn’t much is kind of dismissive.

I wrote a whole post explaining how Hazlitt, who wrote this, got it wrong including citations from his work and reddit just fuckin' ate it.\n\nAlright, here are the bullet points:\n\n* Not only is it outdated, Hazlitt was not an economist and had no formal education or background in economics.\n* Hazlitt was a journalist who formed his political and economic thoughts based on the work of Mises and Hayek. He established his entire belief system in the Austrian school of philosophy, not solid economic theory. This was established when he wrote his first book and he never deviated from it. Most of his works are political works masquerading as economics works.\n* The reason he never deviated from his beliefs is explained in his first book *Thinking as a Science.*\n* *Thinking as a Science* is all about how people should think, and how most people, and their book learnin', just don't know how to think.\n* *Thinking as a Science* is not really a book about thinking, it's a book about his Narcissism. He wrote it at 21, and throughout the book he's basically stuck in a constant neurodivergent superiorist stream of consciousness about how only he really knows HOW to think and everyone else is lazy.\n* In the book, he tosses out the concept of rational skepticism, and instead replaces it with the idea of shallow consideration. Basically, his conclusion is that people should not spend a lot of time considering the content of others' works, effectively tossing out the body of human knowledge. Instead, since all works started with cavemen who didn't have writing, people should still read books but largely replace study with the exercise of learning to think about a topic and strongly consider it.\n* However, he concludes that too much thought might confuse people or cause them to not think at all, and therefore the only way to approach a new topic that you don't know anything about, like economics (he explicitly cites economics in this example), is to strongly consider your beliefs and presume you have an expertise as a result... otherwise you run the risk of thinking the topic so complicated you can't understand it and just replacing your own thoughts with the thought of the author you're reading.\n* On the surface, this may sound reasonable since we should all be skeptical of things we read, but he explicitly denies skepticism and instead suggests that people should filter all new information through their beliefs assuming they already have a strong understanding even if they don't.\n\nBasically, what Hazlitt lays in his first work is that people should form a bias, then check everything they take in against that bias to see if it conforms, and if they can't quickly convince themselves that their bias was wrong they should discard the new information.\n\nAnd that's what Hazlitt did for his entire career. Most economists and economic thinkers  shift between economic ideologies.  I was a libertarian when I was a teenager and early in my career. As often happens to economists who move into the practical space and apply the theory, I quickly learned that economic Libertarianism is bullshit and it doesn't matter if you think something should be a certain way, what matters is the way that it is.\n\nHazlitt had already formed his economic ideology by the time he was 21 in 1916, and Economics in One Lesson (always doubt anyone who says they can teach you all of economics in one lesson, btw) was published in 1946.\n\nThat last part's key. Keep in mind that Hazlitt rejects any writing which doesn't inherently and totally fit his bias. That's his method. And at that point, he's been a slavish devotee of the Austrian school of philosophy.\n\nWe're just out of WWII. We just got out of the Great Depression.\n\nHe's not writing about mild recessions here. He's writing about his lived experience, which he deems superior to all other thought. He's writing about his political ideology about monetary policy, which comes from the Austrian school and reinforces his limited lived experience of the 1929 crash.\n\nWhen he says that inflation always results that \"both political and economic forces will have got out of hand\" he's not talking about minor corruption, he's talking about WWII. He's talking about an actual fucking depression like he experienced.\n\nThat's evident in the rest of the paragraph where he says you can't argue for a 25% increase in price without arguing for a 50% or 100% increase because it's all the same.\n\nOf course, anyone who understand economics knows that's fucking ludicrous and prices inflate to what people are willing to pay in situations based on the supply and demand curve. If people can't afford to pay 50% plus for houses, they won't.\n\nImagine going to a fucking house sale and trying to negotiate by saying \"Oh! You want me to pay 20% more than you paid for the house 10 years ago?!? How about 50% more?!? Why not 100% more?!? I will offer you what you paid for it 10 years ago and not a penny more! You're destroying our system!\"\n\nIt's ludicrous. They'd call the cops and they'd be right to.\n\nWhat he's saying is that when prices become unanchored, they rise immediately into hyperinflation because if prices aren't always the same, they might as well just explode as conflict occurs.\n\nThis is a bedrock principle in Austrian philosophy (I will not call it economics because it isn't). And it's total bullshit that's based on fundamentally misunderstanding the dynamics of economic forces.\n\nBut think about what he's saying. He's not talking about a recession, he's talking about societal collapse, and we've seen hundreds of cases where you can have inflationary spikes (he says even modest increases cause this collapse) and they did not cause any collapse, or in most cases even a recession.\n\nBecause if wages increase, and people remain whole, and inflation slows the system can maintain.\n\nWill we have a recession this time? I don't know... but whether we do or not, it will not be based on what this guy's saying.\n\nI mean who cares if he thinks there shouldn't be intervention, which is at the heart of what he's saying... lots of people will buy $200 SPY puts based on thinking like this, and even if we have a recession in the next couple of years, those puts are still quite likely to be dead, because the market doesn't give a fuck about some dude's ideology in 1946.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.
