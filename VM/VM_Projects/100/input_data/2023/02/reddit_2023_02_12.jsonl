Even if you believe in some sort of weird scenario where Tesla ended up selling more than 50% of the cars in the world (which seems highly implausible based on current trends) they actually need to sell **more** than 100% of the cars in the world just to justify their current valuation.  \n\nAs you may be aware, that's mathematically impossible.

These shovels, however, aren't just ordinary spades, but rather glittering tools of wonder like NVIDIA's A100 GPUs, ASML's magic lithography wands, and TSMC's almighty hammer of semiconductor creation.  \n\nBut wait! The high price-to-earnings ratios and market capitalizations of these companies might seem like clouds in the sky of your financial prosperity. But fear not, for these companies have built walls as strong as a castle made of jellybeans, guarded by dragons made of cotton candy.  For instance, NVIDIA's GPUs are like the steering wheel of a spaceship navigating through the vast galaxies of data centers, autonomous vehicles, and gaming systems. The company's grip on these markets, combined with its constant innovation and R&D, make it a force to be reckoned with, like a superhero made of marshmallows.  \n\nIn the same vein, ASML's lithography machines are like the pen of a wizard, casting spells to create advanced semiconductors. The company has a monopoly as strong as a fortress made of gingerbread, in this market. TSMC, on the other hand, has positioned itself as the go-to choice for chip creation, like a genie granting wishes for companies like Apple, Qualcomm, and AMD.  \n\nAs the world advances towards the future, with AI and technology as its beacon, these companies are like rockets ready to soar, like a kite on a windy day. It's like what the Pied Piper of Hamelin said, \"The journey of AI is long, but it dances towards the future.\" And as AI continues to dance in this direction, the demand for NVIDIA's GPUs, ASML's lithography machines, and TSMC's semiconductor manufacturing capabilities will only escalate, like a party that never ends. \n\nInvesting in these companies is like taking a ride on a roller coaster of wealth, with the future as your destination. The gold miners may come and go, but the shovel sellers will always be in demand, like a song that never grows old. So, grab your shovels, put on your dancing shoes, and let's strike gold!   \n\n\n* I can neither confirm nor deny that this post was written by chatGPT\n\nOn a more serious note, what do you guys think about TSML, ASML, NVDA capturing all the investment into the GPT and LLM hype train?", "id": "110mkdo", "created_utc": 1676226476.0, "score": 979, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 178, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: These companies are like rockets ready to soar, like a kite on a windy day.

{"title": "Red Week Incoming!", "selftext": "#  SPY Analysis\n\n A lot of constructive action going on here in the higher time frames of the SPY. On the weekly chart, we can see several things which started to change the tide. We‚Äôve begun to make higher lows on the weekly chart and have set our first higher high in a long time. The week of the 12/19 candle set a new swing pivot low and the week of 1/30 took out that 410 level which we‚Äôve had trouble pushing through since April 2022.\n\nWe‚Äôve also got a bit of confluence going with a break of the 200EMA on the daily chart and the weekly downtrend. That‚Äôs three checks in our favor from a technical standpoint that look good if we can continue to hold these levels.¬†\n\nThe main thing I‚Äôd like to see here from a bit more of a macro view is any future swing low set above 380. I do think it‚Äôs possible we pull back below this 410 level as well as 200EMA etc. Any swing low set over 380 however keeps the bull thesis intact and keeps us moving in the right direction.\n\nHowever, if that scenario were to play out then our next move to support the bull thesis in a strong manner would be a a higher higher over 418 and a firm hold of this 410 level.¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwnjzc7jitha1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b36f099e6cf07e881b761b65251637aec68f6ee\n\n \n\nWe can see here on a smaller time frame how key this 410 level has been the past year. It was first held back in March 22‚Äô with authority and then saw a rally to 462 which is our current 52 week high. From there it has been macro lower highs and lower lows. Every time we have traded back to 410 we‚Äôve been met with supply. It‚Äôs not a perfect line in the sane but you can visually see where it was attempted to hold above and failed 5 times prior.¬†\n\nNow that we are back over 410 I think there‚Äôs a good chance that we see a move back to the downside and this isn‚Äôt the magical trend line break everyone must be thinking that ignites a new bull market.¬†\n\nAny pullback here into the low 390s and at the very most > 380 would be deemed constructive. I‚Äôd like to see some sort of move held around 390 - 395 and base there a bit before we make another move back to 410 with our most recent lower high in place to retest at 418.¬†\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8zf0f5lmitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb0012f6fe8a7ee27a9b05491450f133f2999e6c\n\n \n\nThe shorter term trend within the last 3 months is without a doubt up. The trend line on the 4HR chart below is set from the market rally starting in October 2022. From here we see consistent higher highs and higher lows with our only failure being in mid December at the 410 level.\n\nWe‚Äôve held higher and grinded back to that level now, not setting a lower high at 410 but assuring we got the liquidity that was set above that 414 high in December.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/huwco15pitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7bb905db0206093f8b7ee1cd97747e58aeb14a\n\n \n\nViewing the action more closely since we‚Äôve tapped that liquidity at 414 we‚Äôve been visually weaker. On Feb 2nd when pushing to 418 I started getting some texts about the ‚Äúbull market being back‚Äù so taking that as a hint on where the crowd is learning.\n\nNotice the volume surge on our push into the liquidity area as well. Since then we‚Äôve begun setting lower highs and lower lows. With a clear fail under 410 towards the end of this past week.\n\nThis has me leaning towards a further pullback sooner rather than later. I think the next move will be down and we will roll over this demand around 403-404 that was formed for the push to 410+. With that being said, if we do roll over and fail that demand zone then 395-400 will more than likely come quickly within a week of failing that zone.\n\nIt is possible that we base here for a few days and make a shot at a move higher. If that‚Äôs the case, watch closely how price reacts in the 410-415 area. If toppy and is clearly selling this would be a great area to get a short position.¬†\n\nThe real move here that can create a substantial move to the upside is a significant push through 420 on volume squeezing shorts out. The only thing is the probabilities of this given the multi-month rally, February seasonality, and topping signs in the main liquidity zone seem rather low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pk6tz3kritha1.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6d7ca7dd0cd82adc0d57dd908b826eb239eb432\n\n \n\n### Strongest Sector\n\nThe Energy sector remains visually the strongest sector at the moment. Really the only sector in a clear up trend and within striking distance of its ATH. We‚Äôre now flagging out here on the weekly chart here and getting tighter. If we see a further market rally this year then this is primed to set new ATHs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iikasluuitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcc7f0018c4a6dfa5ead271b9d190ec32321ecfb\n\nFurthering this, the financial sector in my opinion looks the most poised for money to flow into if there were to be a new favored sector. Reclaiming its neckline and setting consecutive higher lows. As long as 35.50 holds then could see some inflows. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxz72yoxitha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bcd62e8a97aae00976995e54f928d02b712391e\n\n Looking away from the charts we can see that the Tech, Utilities, and Health Care sectors have reported the least amount of earnings misses so far. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kfhv1380jtha1.png?width=435&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dbfb063fcacb61ced2ceedc4ec0ab12f7b352e8\n\n \n\n### Macro News and Themes\n\nThe current overall momentum theme sector-wise has been AI talk. We‚Äôve seen the ticker $AI running and creating momentum in the small cap space forming sympathy plays.\n\nThe theme seems to have originated from the overall hype of the ChatGPT launch or relaunch, seeing within a week of numerous shit co‚Äôs tagging ChatGPT in their headlines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmu1gvq2jtha1.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b089acd8616b5474bc9686d87d1648e47cd48e4\n\n Google Search Trend for ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nqh0ct35jtha1.png?width=884&format=png&auto=webp&s=de11542c16125fa02fd2378739baadb73bdeaf7b\n\n \n\nFurthering this in the overall markets, we‚Äôre in the middle of the Earnings Season. It seems that profits are starting to shrink amid inflation and a rough future outlook on market direction.\n\nAt a quick glance, it seems that there a lot of strong earnings gaps but the following days result in profit taking. This could be profit taking as the multi-month rally becomes toppy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykyod417jtha1.png?width=631&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e0e0c9c6badb5908d621c1bdffe49e1dd77734d\n\n Also worth noting is the seasonality this time of the year tends to bring which is a bearish tilt. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4i0dhb9jtha1.png?width=833&format=png&auto=webp&s=28dbe711368dab1284b75488c26dac476f7c3c39\n\nLastly, upcoming Economic Data. The calendar this week is pretty busy. The main watch for me is the CPI report. I feel that this will act as a catalyst for our next directional move. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i41vwyibjtha1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=1795392c71f2f738b84001540398aae8f420efdf\n\n Upcoming Earnings\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v9nyo7bejtha1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9c271575f80f8230c87cfdf7268c1420a767a0a\n\n \n\n### Big Trades Setting Up\n\nThe biggest trade going into the week is the CPI numbers and the directional trade that‚Äôs likely to come into the markets afterward. A lot of variables stacking up at the moment that is tilting towards the next move being down so will be interesting to see if CPI is the catalyst to get that done.¬†\n\nWith a busy earnings week coming up, any stocks releasing great reports + guidance are always a notable watch.\n\nAs far as momentum names setting up BBAI, AI, and SOUN are still within trend. We already had profit taking days there and temporary tops are in place but wouldn‚Äôt be the craziest thing in the world to see another leg higher. I feel if that were the case then it‚Äôd be a true hype sector move where we see multiple legs.¬†\n\nNot really seeing many Large Caps either at the moment. Seems that all the stocks which were on significant runs are now on the backside of their move. Names being CVNA, COIN, NVDA & TSLA.\n\nStay Safe & Happy Trading!", "id": "110plza", "created_utc": 1676234260.0, "score": 198, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "You had me at red.", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Damn right.
