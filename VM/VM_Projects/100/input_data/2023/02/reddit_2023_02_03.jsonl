{"title": "The most important skill you could have for trading options.", "selftext": "Feel free to add on or argue against my point here, but I've noticed a lot of tutorials on YouTube failing to include the importance of macro and micro economics with options trading. This post is really for people new to trading options, but if you don't understand how the overall economy works (macro) or how business' themselves work (micro), don't expect to get far in trading options.\n\nThere's a lot of great resources online to learn both macro and micro economics and would highly encourage anyone learning options to learn both first. Macro for example, is great for trading options on SPY, QQQ or IWM. Macro gives you an understanding of what the fed does, what inflation is, what fed rates do and how currency is removed from supply. Micro is a great for individual companies like Microsoft, Apple or smaller cap stocks however, truth be said, macro economics impacts prices more than variables associated with micro economics.\n\nI'm not sure what options traders start with if they don't understand either macro or micro, but if it's historical trend, that won't do much for you. There's limited value with statistics and forecasting unless you're buying and holding stock for several years. However, related to options, as a whole it is fairly limited because yesterday's variables impacting the market aren't always going to be today's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR:\n\nA lot of tutorials online disregard the importance of macro and micro economics. The variables impacting today's stock prices are things like inflation, how the fed handles it with rates and how supply and demand works. By understanding the basics of macro and micro economics, you'll be better equipped to forecast how markets move and why. Even though economics and options are completely separate, the fundamentals of economics are what impact on today's stock prices the most which in turn, also impact option prices. \n\nEdit:\n\n# I need to clarify a few things.\n\n1) I'm suggesting to learn the basics of both macro and micro economics. Things like inflation (CPI), fed rates and supply and demand. Not get an degree in economics. Macro and micro economics are typically year one classes for Finance and Econ majors for many US colleges. However, resources online are typically free and available to the public. \n\n2) **I'm not saying that you need to know economics in order to do options at all. I'm not saying that options is economics or economics is options.** I'm baffled that some people here think that this is what I'm saying. All I'm saying is that a basic understanding of things like inflation, fed rates, supply and demand, liquidity and so forth are all valuable tools to have in trading options. CPI, fed rates are some of (if not the greatest) variables impacting stock prices today which in turn, impact option prices.\n\n*Here's one example why understanding macro-economics is important:*\n\nImagine you see a options position on MSFT that you find to be a great play. Everything on the option side of things points to getting a large return and you buy a handful of calls on it. CPI is being announced the same day you purchase calls and you don't know what CPI is, what it's likely to look like or how it will impact prices--completely in the dark. If the data released is poor, the value of your calls can diminish significantly despite what options data originally said. You'll be completely blind sided by volatility and nothing on the options side of things will help you see it either.\n\n*Truth be said: I find it incredibly difficult to believe we have people here that are successful options traders that couldn't tell you what CPI means or what supply and demand is.*", "id": "10sq19d", "created_utc": 1675445535.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Reasons are irrelevant in the stock market.

I'm probably in the minority here but to be a successful trader trading options, you don't need to know the reasons why a stock is moving up or down.

{"title": "Sony is crushing Microsoft in gaming. Xbox hardware -13%, Services -12%, Revenue -13%, PS hardware +46%, Services +19%, Revenue +53%", "selftext": "Sony Raises Outlook on Strong PlayStation 5 Momentum - Bloomberg\n\nSony Group Corp. lifted its full-year profit outlook after record PlayStation 5 console sales helped earnings beat estimates.\nThe Tokyo-based group raised its PS5 sales forecast to 19 million units for the fiscal year ending March, after selling 7.1 million units over the holiday quarter. Momentum for building out the PS5 ecosystem is growing, Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said on a call after the earnings Thursday, waving off concerns about a demand lull for the two-year-old console.\n\nSony also hiked its operating profit forecast to ¥1.18 trillion ($9.2 billion) from ¥1.16 trillion. The key games division, aided by the tailwind of favorable exchange rates, nudged expectations higher. Sony said it now sees slightly lower revenue for the year than previously.\n\n“Given the current climate where demand is deteriorating around the world, it’s amazing that Sony’s earnings are in line with expectations,“ said Morningstar Investment Service analyst Kazunori Ito. “How long Sony can keep up this momentum depends on how much hardware they can deliver. If they can continue this virtuous software-hardware cycle, which was not possible until last year, this could be a turning point.”\n\nPlayStation 5 Sales Ticking Up\n\nSony had its best quarter of PS5 sales since launch over the holiday period\nQ1 FY21\nQ2 FY21\nQ3 FY21\nQ4 FY21\nQ1 FY22\nQ2 FY22\nQ3 FY22\n2 million\n3\n4\n2\n2\n3\n7\nSource: Sony\nThe company, which supplies camera sensors used in Apple Inc.’s iPhones, said operating profit was ¥429 billion in October-December, above the average analyst expectation of ¥369 billion. Sales were ¥3.4 trillion.\nTotoki, the veteran CFO who has led Sony’s earnings briefings for years, will oversee its global operations, taking up the positions of president and chief operating officer from April 1, the company said earlier.\n“I will focus on strengthening our existing businesses and carry out the company’s medium-term plan,” the 58-year-old Totoki said. “I’m obsessed with growth. When growth slows at the company, you fall into a negative spiral.”\n\nRead more: Sony to Promote Veteran CFO to Oversee Global Operations\nChip supply issues that had bogged down PlayStation 5 console sales since its launch in 2020 have eased, the company said earlier this week. Improving supply of the console coincides with Sony’s release of God of War Ragnarok, the latest installment of the popular franchise.\nHardware inventories grew sixfold for Sony’s gaming group — from ¥75.3 billion to ¥513 billion — as well as its image sensor group, showing some signs of the global economic downturn.\n\n“This rise could be partly explained by rising output of PS5s and potentially bloated unsold sales of PS4 consoles,” Amir Anvarzadeh of Asymmetric Advisors said, noting the weak yen has flattered Sony’s earnings through the past year. “This means that unless the yen weakens again, we have seen the last of these positive distortions.”\n\nSony lowered its sales outlook for the image sensor division, despite an improved product mix with a higher proportion of premium sensors. A sharp downturn in consumer demand, especially in China, has impacted mass-market devices, including Apple’s entry-level iPhones.\n\nInvestors are looking for signs of a rebound for the chip sector providing components for gadgets, and Sony’s Totoki pointed to the second half of the year for the beginnings of a recovery. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co. warned earlier this week that it expects the smartphone market to contract for the second year in a row.\nRead more: Samsung Sees Phone Market Shrinking Again After 2022 Woes\n— With assistance by Peter Elstrom\n\n(Updates with details from earnings call)", "id": "10s88q8", "created_utc": 1675390500.0, "score": 470, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 202, "comments": [{"body": "I don't think Microsoft really cares as much as Sony to be honest.

Machines still lack the ability to synthesize completely new information, build an understanding of the world, and even make basic inferences.\n\nThat's why SDC's have hit a massive brick wall.

And then there's the matter of computational power: we are still working on the mathematical details of getting efficient algorithms. It's a lot more than just 'how to do matrix algebra really fast.' \n\nAnother problem is we don't fully understand why neural networks work so well. It's not like formulating a simple linear regression where we want to test the effect of X on Y. So a result is we have to figure out on how to make sure our models are robust, and not spitting out garbage randomly. \n\nRelated to this, one of the coolest applications I've seen is 'adversarial learning.' Basically, a problem is that these deep neural networks we use to say classify images can be given input data that is *very slightly* perturbed in a way that it suddenly spits out completely wrong answers with high confidence. For example, a network claims an image of a gorilla is a banana if you slightly mess with the gorilla with invisible noise. This can have important applications if you're a malicious actor. So people are working on how to make neural networks robust to this without hurting performance.

Allow me to clarify.\n\n1. Murder is [defined a little more rigidly](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111) than you're implying here, requiring \"malice aforethought\". This is \"the intention to kill or harm, which is held to distinguish unlawful killing from murder\". Unless you think that his actions were specifically made with the intent to cause death/harm, and death/harm was not merely a side-effect of the intended aim, this is by definition not murder. Were Musk's statements shameful and misinformed? Yes. Is he a mass murderer? No. Get your head on straight.\n\n2. From [another comment of yours](https://old.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/10sy3ek/elon_musk_found_not_liable_in_trial_over_tweets/j75jv19/), you state that \"He is literally a mass murderer in the same sense Hitler is\". This shows a flagrant misapprehension about the intent and design of the holocaust killings, and comparing it to the COVID-19 situation is ludicrous. The utterly negligent practices of the US government during the crisis *are not comparable* to the planned and intended mass murder of discriminated peoples.\n\n3. And to then consider a private business owner's speech, or their actions of keeping factories running in contravention of health orders - that is also not the equivalent of government-sanctioned mass murder of targeted groups and individuals. To imply so is disgraceful.  \nThis is not to defend Musk - I am absolutely not a fan of his behaviour during that time and consider it horrible as well. But he isn't *Hitler*.

There is very little evidence that a recession is imminent. Doesn’t mean it can’t happen. But at this point if you called for one and it happened it would largely be a lucky call.\n\nWhat’s happening now is that you have a large group of academics and well educated people who figured fed is hiking so market must crash and a major recession must ensue because, well, it’s happened before. They weren’t satisfied with the drawdown last year and expected more and now the market is taking off again without them.\n\nThe important thing here is deceptively simple. The market is following the bond market which is front running the fed. The market is six months ahead of the fed this cycle which is confusing a lot of people who haven’t realized that. It’s not all bullish to be sure.

He’s had to completely contradict himself no less than three times in the past five years. Therefore the bond market is predicting policy not based on jpows silly statements but on fundamentals.\n\nNow why are bonds predicting cuts is anyone’s guess. Mine is that with the money supply contracting and rates hovering around 4.75%, at some point liquidity concerns and economic weakness will start to show up. But the simplest explanation is that they are predicting a rapid drop in inflation. Keep in mind rate markets aren’t predicting a massive drop in rates, it’s currently around 50 bps from the predicted peak, so basically where they were before this last hike. So if inflation starts falling dramatically it’s pretty easy to envision a scenario where a narrative develops that the fed went too far too fast and they should cut and this fed reliably follows the popular narrative.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that if the fed does cut rates 50 bps from where they’ll be at around 4.75%, that should be bullish for stocks. But because the market seems to front run the fed by six months you’d expect the market to begin pricing that in in the next few months.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "but isnt the bond market predicting cuts?   what kind of economy do we have if Powell is cutting this year?

Stocks were hugely depressed due to tax loss selling at the end of the year so that provided fuel for a bounce as well as the end of rate hikes being in the near future.\n\nCredit markets are acting fine, so in the space between the end of rate hikes and economic weakness starting to show up stocks can do really well given how depressed they were. It’s really a question of timing. All the bears really have to point to are somewhat excessive valuations and an inverted yield curve, neither all that convincing in the shorter term when the stock market has been reacting to rate hikes since November of 2021.\n\nWhen you start to see short term interest rates rising that’ll be a clue bad news is on the horizon. But stocks don’t typically just fall because they went up too far. You probably need some sign of risk rising to break the current trend. There’s also not nearly the leverage in the system there has been in prior cycles to create bank failures or widespread bankruptcies.\n\nI’m not super bullish, the best gains usually come in the first few months of a trend reversal so most were already left behind by the rally and are having to decide whether to chase or sit out.

Way too simplistic and probably comes from the oversimplifications in media articles and The Big Short. You're missing the two key components to why SOME banks had major liquidity problems:\n\n \\- There was a broken risk calculation used by the banks that had trouble that didn't take into account broader systemic risk in the larger market. That calculation assumed that a mass run on the insurance would never happen, which is part of what allowed the bad ratings to be accepted and resulted in overleverage of MBS without suitable capital and bond offsets. That made banks heavy with MBS securities for the banks that took the bait. Banks don't use that calculation anymore, and the problem that happened relating to 2008 was that they stacked risk on these MBS securities, meaning that the hedging scheme became a multi-tier leverage issue, which is not how MBS securities are risk-controlled anymore.\n\nNot all banks took the bait. Some banks, like the one I worked for as a risk regulator in 2008 where I oversaw the post-crash recover, did fine. In part because we didn't overweight MBS and did something else important that other banks failed at:\n\n \\- Banks ran their capitalization too low and overweighted MBS in holdings.\n\nI get that to someone who doesn't understand how the reserve banking system works, a general market pullback can look like 2008, but all you've described is the catalyst that started the ball rolling downhill into the crash, not the cause of the crash itself. The process you're describing started showing signs as far back as 2005. \n\nNow a market correction can (and should) happen in housing now, and while it will have an impact on bank capitalization in the abstract sense, we're entering this in the polar opposite position that banks entered 2008:\n\nIn 2008:\n\n \\- Banks had lower capitalization than they needed to offset MBS risk, and lower bond holdings. \n\n \\- Banks held the majority of MBS risk.\n\nIn 2023:\n\n \\- Banks are insanely highly capitalized right now, and the last stress test demonstrated the effects of that. They also have significant stacked longterm bond holdings which offset held MBS risk. Banks that entered 2008 like this, like the one I worked for, never saw a major liquidity problem.\n\n \\- The Fed is holding a ton of the MBS risk. In fact a major part of QT is letting that roll over as time passes, but the Fed is holding a lot of the risk after the pandemic.\n\nBasically, banks look more like they did in 2009 right now than they did in 2007... and actually, they're probably in a better position than in 2009 because only about 25% of the reserve expansion leaked out over the prior 2 years, and that means they're holding historic reserves right now.\n\nAnd that's the problem the Fed's trying to address, but the dot plot demonstrates that the Fed will NOT pull all of that out of the banks. They're leaving years of pull-forward ahead in the reserve system expressly because they understand this risk. It's in their reports and it's in the FDIC stress tests (which is why I asked if you've read them, and the answer to that question is clearly that you have not... because this is all covered in there).\n\nNow is there a chance that we're missing something key to the risk system? Maybe, but it's not in your thesis because you've only described a housing market correction, and while this one (hopefully) will be deep, it's just a correction and you're not asking the key risk questions that I laid out in the issues above about bank resilience.\n\nHousing market corrections happen all the time. They're not all 2008. In fact, the only one that was 2008... was 2008.\n\nThe \"bear crash thesis\" that this is 2008 hinges on two contradictory arguments:\n\n1. This is happening because the Fed flooded the reserve system.\n2. When it comes down, there won't be any money left in the reserve system and the Fed won't help.\n\nThis misunderstanding comes from an ideological position that ignores what the Fed's been saying. Even this last presser, JPOW said when asked about a policy mistake that they would remain data dependent. He hemmed and hawed, like he does, but in the end he explicitly said that if the economy enters a recession and if it were appropriate that they would act. Because of course they would. Because no one there wants to be responsible for crashing the economy in totality, and they've never said otherwise. \n\nPeople said \"The Fed will never step in again\" after 2008. Look what happened. On the scale of \"bad prediction\" to \"good prediction\" the argument that the Fed will just let the economy crash is demonstrated, proven horseshit.\n\nArgument #2 is thoroughly debunked by the Fed's projections, the dot plot, and the rate of balance sheet drawdown. It's not going to draw down to 2019 levels, and why should they? It's not 2019 anymore. Fed forward projects up through the meanline on the balance sheet using risk departments of banks to hold back on overlending through use of the FFR and QT is a perfectly reasonable way to keep capitalizations high while keeping money from leaking from the M2 to the M1 at too high a rate.\n\nYou are, of course, free to continue to think about this in too simplistic and too contradictory a way and not see the differences.\n\nWe can have a further decline, and it's entirely possible that there could be something that's not in the stress tests... but it won't be because of what you described above.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You are arguing that the exact circumstances of 2008 are not now repeating; and I’m not sure who here was arguing that they were 🤷‍♂️.  \n\nThe only relevant comparable from then to now is a shared dynamic of a mass loan-default liquidity crisis.

Then in March 2022, it got revised to 481K. In April 504K. So it kept getting revised up.

ADP was much lower than expected 106K vs 176K expected, but they said it was due to bad weather in the January 12 reference week, and all other reference weeks in Jan had strong job growth.\n\nSo yes this number will most likely be revised lower since there is some disconnect between ISM Services, Manufacturing employment (modest slow growth), and due to ADP's weather issue.\n\nBut I caution this report might be correct - JOLTS Job Openings and even third party job openings data from Lightcast shows Jan had around +15% ish new job openings vs 2019 January levels.

Most TA is just crap in how it's done, but it's also NOT TA in any kind of real sense.\n\nReal TA is based on statistics and probabilities and Brownian motion concepts to find risk zones and plan trades. This whole \"magic line\" bullshit? It's the product of a bunch of idiots who don't know the limitations of what they're using.\n\nAnd that can be true for any method. Lots of DD on here tries to make a fundamentals argument for the future prospects of companies that never came true, and a lot of it's actually not all that crazy. People in 2021 were making fundamentals arguments for a continuation of the bull run, and at the time they weren't crazy.\n\nAll of these methods are flawed in some way because in isolation they don't represent how people play the market, because people use all of them in one form or another.\n\nAnd good TA represents market psychology and mechanics. A cup-and-handle, for instance, is just a pattern that shows strength returning to a stock and shows where established holders of a stock didn't move. That's all it is. The handle is just confirmation that people who took profits have stopped doing so.\n\nIf you have a solid combination of chart structures proven through TA, fundamentals, and market mechanics - for instance the wonderful cup-and-handle that just played out exactly to the dollar on AMD's chart, combined with solid earnings and solid reinforcing options chain mechanics, produced amazing and easily probable price action combined with solid limited risk position planning.\n\nWhen it moved, it adhered to a series of EMAs and Smoothed Moving Averages, gapping between them as it did. \n\nIt did that because people build positions algorithmically using these tools. There's no difference between TA and fundamentals in this sense, it's just a numerical representation of how people position build and take profit... and just like fundamentals, TA can be wrong because there are conflicts.\n\nThe problem with TA is that too many people just do crap fucking TA (that isn't really TA because it doesn't adhere to the rules of TA) because it's enticing to get on youtube and watch a video where someone says \"I drew this line and so the market will follow it\" and that's a lot easier and more hopeful than analyzing debt figures or trying to decypher an options chain in a realistic way. \n\nI mean, for TA that's even boring. In real TA the most interesting moves happen when  the market breaks one of those magic lines. \n\nJust like I wouldn't throw out fundamentals because a lot of fools on here don't know how to read business disclosures, I wouldn't throw out TA just because a lot of fools on here think tracking two lines is enough to establish a direction for the market.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "This is a very good post.

Mostly because I didn't have the time necessary to really dig into TA and just used my feel on companies and their earnings to build positions.\n\nSometimes I was right, sometimes I was wrong. \n\nThere's confirmation bias here, too. People who trade on fundamentals commonly trade stocks of well known companies, like Disney, Microsoft, etc that all have specific market placements and are tied heavily to the market. That's fair, but it also creates self-fulfilling confirmation pools because everyone's just jumping into the same pool. \n\nUsually, that works... but there are plenty of fundamentals plays that go wrong. We hear about them on every earnings report, because forward guidance doesn't predict the future. \n\nLots of people in late 2021 were making predictions that INTC would rocket on fundamentals beyond $70 per share.\n\nWhere are their fundamentals plays? Not in a good place.\n\nThat's because the macro situation turned against them, but also because INTC doesn't trade like a growth stock.\n\nNow to be fair, INTC had and still has a very strong fundamentals story for the future. Buying INTC on a long-term long as a safe stock during a recovery is not a bad play, but anyone better for a rally in 2022 on the basis of fundamentals for INTC made the wrong choice, full stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> My main issue with EWT is that they try to adhere to strict rules and they think that the \"waves\" should be consistent all the way down to the minute level.  \n\nI agree.

It does happen, and sometimes stocks repeat, but sometimes you get 3 impulse waves and then 2 correction waves... sometimes 3 and 3... usually the ratios are off.\n\nThese are partly due to algorithmic conflicting trades, partly because there are natural patterns, partly because people trade them because they expect them to exist.\n\nBut Elliott Waves, like any other pattern, don't always work... it's that simple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> But like you, I don't have hard data. \n\nBut with TA, on a play I can get hard data.

In other words, it's better to buy the bottom.\n\nThe problem is calling the bottom is very hard, so why leave anything on the table?\n\n \n\n>What's ironic is that Aswath Damodaran has alluded to EWT in his writings, and he's the most fundamentals guy there is.\n\nBut why do we describe people as \"TA guy\" or \"fundamentals guy?\"\n\nThere's no war between TA and fundamentals. They're about very different things. TA is about planning a stock play based on understanding price action behavior. Fundamentals is about establishing likely directionality of a stock based on rules that fundamentals-driven organizations use to build positions combined with underlying market structure.\n\nAll of this relates back to market structures. If a P/E ratio is low compared to equivalents or historicals, institutions buy stock. \n\nIf a chart forms a bullish structure representing a change in sentiment or another macro tailwind or an underlying options dynamic, institutions buy stock.\n\nWe're just looking at different factors that get played on the market and building a case for a position, and using those factors to guess at behavior. That's it.\n\nLike I get it, it's complicated to combine all of that information. It's taken me 2 years and hundreds of hours to develop a TA methodology that works for me, after also trying lots of things that didn't work for me... but I kept going, and I learned what worked and what didn't and I stuck to filtering bad information and searching for good information... it helps that I have a background in research statistics, macroeconomics, and in processing unstructured and structured big data. I work on AI that detects financial fraud, so I'm comfortable with finding confidence intervals in complex patterns... most don't have that kind of comfort level.\n\nSo I get it, but I also wish people would try to look further into things they don't understand, because there's an actual science to TA that most people are completely missing out on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n>At the end of the day, I can't disprove TA because I haven't studied it enough.

We hear about them on every earnings report, because forward guidance doesn't predict the future. \n\nRight, but much of what you've described are issues with forecasting, not issues with fundamentals. And of course, there's going to be a scatter of actual outcomes because the future is unknowable. But that's why we operate with a margin of safety, and the more uncertainty you have in a particular outcome, the more margin of safety you should use. But in the long run, price will always be related to the future earnings potential of a company. I truly believe this. It may not always be reflected right away, but that's where opportunities are presented for the patient investor. \n\nNaturally, it's not always that simple, though. There are a lot of other moving pieces. Namely, as you mentioned, risk free rates, but also growth expectations and the risk premium that investors want in order to hold stocks over bonds. All of those can be exploited, especially in times of distress (like we saw with covid) or excess (like we saw with ARKK).\n\nFor example, [I made this call in April of 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fyx7ub/resources_to_deploy_2020_corona_virus_edition/fn8j3tc/). I really don't want this to seem like a brag, and it absolutely is confirmation bias because i probably would've forgotten all about it if the trade went the other way or took longer to play out, but I think it's a perfect example of how pricing and valuation work, especially when things go haywire. And when you truly understand how valuation works (and I've still got a long way to go), you can build a level of intuition that help you see the downwind effects of market inputs (could be policy changes, investor sentiment, or even a black swan like covid). So when everyone else was running for the hills, I was able to make a reasonable case for why we might be seeing an attractive entry point.\n\nAlso, I'm not necessarily trying to declare war on TA and telling everyone to pick a side. I only brought up Aswath Damodaran because I've never heard him once mention an RSI or moving average or a chart shape, only intrinsic value and an occasional EWT reference. \n\nLike i mentioned before, I'd just really like to see actual statistics on outcomes from the use of TA. Like you said, the data is out there and can be compiled easily enough. Someone just needs to actually go through the exercise. But yeah, actually seeing the average return and distribution of those returns (for a positive C&H, for example) would go a long way to making me a convert. Maybe that data is already out there. I haven't researched it in quite a while. \n\nMy personal issue with TA is it requires a lot of \"bobbing and weaving\" in your positioning, and the more you trade, the more prone to errors, imo. I'd much rather attempt to get very intimate with a company's operations, and hold for years (or until it reaches fair value) if I can. That's another potential edge for FA if you can devote the time to it.

If risk is high, I go neutral until I have a higher confidence, which cuts down on the position-switching effect.\n\nBut that is definitely an issue, particularly for swing and day traders who start out playing short term TA patterns. I enjoy it, but it's definitely a route to losses for many people.\n\nRight now my core is all SPY and QQQ against SPXU and SQQQ running about 50% exposure while we're in this bullish trend.

If I sold everything on Thursday it would have been 26% LOL, but I enjoy gambling some of the gravy.\n\nOne thing I've adopted to cut down on position switching is to use the 1 year chart and play longer trends. I avoid making a play until I have a solid thesis with risk definition and an escape plan. When I do this over the past year, I have a 90% win rate (got stuck to a position and leveraged into it expecting a leg down in June even though my TA was telling me to go long)... my problems have been when I was trying things out or just gambling gains LOL.

That's all they are.\n\nThe problem with what you're calling TA is... it's not TA because the people you're talking about are not applying statistical concepts to analyzing statistical metrics.\n\nFor instance:\n\n\"This stock just experienced a golden cross, so it's going to fly.\"\n\nThis is bad TA. You see it a lot, even from financial professionals and in financial media, but it's bad TA. Golden crosses fizzle all the time. You can't rely on them alone. They're not \"predictive\" in the sense that people think.\n\nWhat they represent a probability because they represent a change of prior behavior. That's it. A correct statement on what a golden cross would mean is:\n\n\"On X timeframe, a golden cross has emerged demonstrating greater bullish price action and possible accumulation.\"\n\nAt that point, you start looking for structures in the chart that confirm that you have accumulation, like your Elliott Wave example. If you have a stock that is following that pattern, which I agree with you regarding the market psychology read on EWT, then maybe I'm looking for an EMA crossover and the completion of a correction pattern that the stock has used previously.\n\nThis doesn't mean a reversal is guaranteed, it's just data that suggests a change of behavior. But algorithms and other traders trade those structures, too, and so they become self-fulfilling patterns, and reflect behavior.\n\nStatistics is about probability, not certainty... it's about measuring risk and what degree of confidence you can have in a play.\n\nRSI, for instance, is a statistical measure of how far a stock has moved beyond a standard deviation, and that's related to Bollinger Bands, as well. These are just statistical methods using calculus to try to discuss the strength of a move. Because people sell to take profit, a stock will eventually mean revert... and that's lead to a misunderstanding of how to play RSI and other oscillators.\n\nPeople say \"RSI is overbought, I'll buy puts.\" but an overbought RSI might actually be a sign of continuing strength. The inverse play sometimes works (and for share position building with DCA, often works well enough) but a stock can trend strong for a long time before reversing, depending on the timeframe.\n\nSo the youtube rules don't work there... because they depend on not understanding the statistical metric, which for RSI and BB is just measuring how strong the movement has been against statistical volatility. A stock can just go flat and correct RSI, and that's 100% within the expected behavior.\n\nAnd this is the heart of why most of these rules are wrong. They simply don't respect what these statistical metrics mean.\n\n(Continued)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">People say \"RSI is overbought, I'll buy puts.\" but an overbought RSI might actually be a sign of continuing strength.\n\nIf you can claim victory on either outcome, how is it a useful metric?\n\nAll I'm saying is that I'd like to see an exhaustive study done that actually looks at the hit-rate statistics on these metrics.

There's lots of ways to use information that don't fall into a simplistic \"I ONLY use this one thing and I use it in a binary sense.\"\n\nRSI is not directional, full stop.

I know it's about probabilities, but what are they? If you can't tell me that a set of indicators leads to positive confirmation more than 50% of the time, then your big explanation above is all for naught.\n\nI'd like to see a real study, too... but having read studies on this I'm explicitly calling out there are a lot of factors involved, but they always come out above 50% on structures like C&H and H&S. The reason why is pretty straightforward:\n\nAll a cup-and-handle is, is a pullback, an accumulation that's proven out with a run, and a higher low/higher high.\n\nIt's literally just a bottoming stair-step pattern. What makes it bullish is the higher high, higher low. It's just a  way of detecting a bull trend and establishing rules for confirmation. The same with a Head and Shoulders, which shows weakening or strengthening conditions depending on the directionality.\n\nYou could also look at these as detections for the start of Elliott Wave patterns, which is what they basically are. You agree with Elliott Waves, well C&H and H&S structures are just components in Elliott Wave reversals.\n\nA bearish head and shoulders is just a structure that shows that the market rejected a high, established a lower high, and then broke to a lower low.\n\nThese aren't magic, they just represent what bear and bull trends look like on a chart, which is why they continue because a rule of the market is that trends continue... which is also a rule that applies to playing fundamentals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're still thinking about this in the youtube way: You pick a single indicator, and play it like a coin toss. While you should apply basic strategy to trading because of the uncertainty, the very argument I'm making is that you shouldn't do this on the basis of only one stream of information.\n\nI'm arguing that you can use this information to understand the behavior of the market and build positions, not use it to do cheap-ass coin flip random gambling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that absolutely works. Even if you had the statistics you want, any study is going to look at it over 50+ years. Or at the very least 20+ years.\n\nThe rule in coin flips is that if you're using the kind of strategy you're talking about, you may end up in a cluster.\n\nIt's like slot machines. You can have a slot with a 55% win rate and sit down and lose 20 spins right off the bat because your aggregate study doesn't actually apply to smaller subsets.\n\nSo I would argue that that method of trading is somewhat problematic without using other information.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, what you're describing isn't technical analysis, it's just abusing a TA measure to turn the market into a game of flip cup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I am saying is that people should use it in mixed analysis... so no, not having 50 years of probabilities doesn't make it for naught. We can get information about the relative behavior and strength of the market to build a position and a strategy without know precise probabilities for structures, which would only make sense in the presence of other information, anyway.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "(Just want to apologize, you've given me a lot to talk about and this is going to be a little long.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I think that TA relies too much on confirmation bias to be a real tool.\n\nEverything is subject to confirmation bias, especially when you're looking at it backwards. That's true for any data, including fundamentals.\n\nThe key is whether or not you can build an intelligent position with defined risk. \n\nBoth fundamentals and TA can give you that, if you use them correctly. If you don't, or if you only rely on data that confirms your expectations and reject any competing data, you can get your position wrong. There's no difference between TA and fundamentals in this regard. Ignoring a negative chart structure or risk is as much confirmation bias as ignoring a negative earnings risk (and they always exist).\n\nBoth will also sometimes fail because there's no way to tell the future.\n\nAnd that's another problem: We need to stop thinking about these things as predictive. They're not. Neither of them are truly predictive of the future with any degree of certainty. A company can be very much in the black right now and then a pandemic can come along and totally change that. Or a bank liquidity crisis, or a political issue. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Like your cup and handle example. Sure, it may make sense that a stock is oversold, then rallies back to form a base. But is there any actual data to back that up? \n\nI've read books that have provided backtesting statistics. They trend around the 60-70% range in my experience for C&H and that's not an uncommon range of success for lots of statistical TA factors. The same is true for fundamentals plays in my experience.  This is because using any historical data to predict future movement only gives you some degree of edge over a coin toss.\n\nThe problem with these statistics in both cases is that there's a lot of variance in method and in timeframe, data set, etc. So the data the financial world uses is often fluctuating, and often cherry-picked in these kinds of cases, so I take it all with a grain of salt.\n\nBut if you're wondering how often a C&H or other type of structure/indicator plays on a particular stock's chart, you can actually go to tradingview and write Pine code to find exactly that. It's going to be different for every stock. \n\nIn my experience, IF the right rules are followed, C&H structures often play out... but you have to actually use the right rules.\n\nFor instance: \n\n>For example, if a stock falls x% then rises back to its original value and then falls (x/y)%, how often does it break above its original price vs continue falling?\n\nThese are the wrong rules.\n\nWhat you're describing isn't a C&H, it's a cup with a partially formed handle. And that's not a criticism. The structure you're describing is commonly described on sites and on youtube as a C&H.\n\nBut a real C&H require a resistance break and a fully formed handle. All of the price action happens after that.\n\nWhere this gets mixed up is that traders develop positioning rules to try to maximize capturing the movement, and then rely on basic strategy to account for failure... but the C&H isn't valid until the handle dips up, and then breaks.\n\nLet's say the trough to the top of the cup is $10. Handles can mean revert as far down as a standard deviation or two from the 0.5 Fibonacci range, which is just another way of saying that stocks typically mean revert 50% during bullish trends.\n\nAll the Fibonacci range does, in this case, is give you a way to talk about standard deviation levels around that 50% mark, because the stock market is never exact. \n\nPart of this is human nature. If a bull trend is on, not everyone will sell, so you don't get a full price reversal before the bull trend comes back. The \"handle\" is just a stair step pattern.\n\nAnother part of it is natural physics and algorithms. Computers trade these structures. They work into tactics (liquidating part of a trade to take profit on a peak against resistance, only to hold the rest in hopes of an escalation). There are concrete reasons why these structures form and they say something about behavior.\n\nIf the handle stops between 0.3 and 0.5 and reverses, I know then that I'm looking for a handle to form. Maybe I build a small starter position. Then I look for the break and if it's on a high enough timeline, I leverage into my position for the run.\n\nWhat the cup does is give me information on risk. The trough, in most cases, will be respected on the way down because those are people who held before barring the worst of news. \n\nIf it breaks 0.5 on the way down, I now know there's a high chance it's not a C&H but rather just a spike, or possibly the start of another leg down. There I start looking for an exit or to take risk off the table because it's no longer playing my plan.\n\nI supplement this play with fundamentals. I check the market. I check the options chain to see if it's friendly. I combine all of this to establish a risk level on my position... what the TA does is give me a language to talk about how to set a stoploss, and how a trade should play if it's doing what I expect. If it's not and I don't like the risk, I get out. \n\nBut the formation has to be right to make a decision, and what you described is not a valid formation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Personally, I think if it continues falling then it becomes a head and shoulders pattern... /s \n\nI know you're joking and yes, people say those things... but that wouldn't be a head-and-shoulders pattern (but it could become a variant one later, but you couldn't tell that at that point).\n\nThat is a great example of someone using bad TA... and it happens. A lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Continued)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "OK I lied, one last thing I just thought of:\n\nFundamentals valuation positioning trends are sometimes wrong. \n\nFor instance, lately there's been a lot of discussion coming from money managers relating to the CAPE ratio and P/E ratios against the S&P 500 against 2019 levels.\n\nThe presumption many fundamentals traders are making now is that stocks have to contract against the 2019 standard, because they're assuming a Fed drawdown will return capitalization and valuations back to 2019.\n\nThe problem is (and we have hard data here) that average P/E is elevating with the amount of money addressable to the market (expansion of money supply). \n\nWell, the Fed dot plot and QT strategy tells us two things:\n\n1. They have no intention of returning M2 down to 2019 levels, in fact, they intend to leave a lot in the banks that will bleed out into the market over the next couple of years, since most of the M2 expansion from the pandemic is still in bank reserves.\n2. What did get released is out, and not leaving, so even if they did draw down all reserves (which is not mathematically possible given the terminal rate and other behavior) there's still a lot of that money that made prior multiples in the market, looking for a home.\n\nThe bet many fundamentals traders are making right now is towards further multiple compression, but P/E ratios also go up before recessions are over. The reason for that is complex, but it's part market parity and partially because price often stabilizes as earnings are declining because of held capital and accumulation patterns (I.e. people begin buying the dip ahead of time).\n\nCAPE uses a median for the past 10 years, and that's less impacted than an average, but still represents a bias influenced mostly by capital supply levels from the 2010s... so assuming everything will fall back to the current CAPE ratio is probably wrong. \n\nIf the market goes down, fundamentals bears will declare victory (even if it wasn't due to multiple compression, but rather cost against the risk-free rate of return - so there's real confirmation bias at work here to be concerned with)... and if it doesn't, they'll claim the market's broken and everything's still too extended when it's doing exactly what CAPE suggests it should.\n\nSo there's still a ton of subjective uncertainty even in multiples fundamentals pricing.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "What is this \"caution\" thing you speak of?
