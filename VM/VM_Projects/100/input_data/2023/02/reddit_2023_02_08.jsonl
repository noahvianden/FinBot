(With obscure exceptions as in Penalty Logic.)  Neural depends on adjusting vectors of numbers.

Strictly mathematically, it's probably true that you cannot encode arbitrary graphs. But it's a pedantic distinction. The way I see it, dot-product attention at the core of Transformers (and by extension the GPT family), is kind of an addressing primitive. The neural net produces K (keys), V (values) and Q (queries) and receives the value associated with the provided query vector. It sounds like a good enough primitive to apply all sorts of logic.\n\n> I don't know whether advanced neural has ever been grafted onto something advanced logical/ontological like the Cyc system. (If not, I'd recommend it.)\n\nI agree, it sounds like a good direction of research. Unfortunately, one cannot try this without having $10m lying around for training these behemoths.\n\n> The problem with representing relational structures, hence common sense, doesn't seem to be quantitative. A Trillion would't fix it.\n\nDisagree. As I said, dot-product attention *is* a differentiable addressing primitive, so we have no way of knowing if it simply cannot represent knowledge with good enough fidelity because of the lack of parameters, or because of some fundamental limitation. To say that for certain, we really need to see how the performance changes once you scale this up once again. \n\nYann LeCun has a good argument on why the limitation is fundamental: https://www.noemamag.com/ai-and-the-limits-of-language/ (In short, language is limited and works for humans because we have a shared lived experience of the world, which is impossible to convey just using text).\n\n> AI summer still, if it makes money, even if not really AI.\n\nRight!
