The chief executive hopes the layoffs will prolong eBay's life and allow it to focus on areas where it can expand but has been coy about those areas. \n\nThe layoffs are the latest round of layoffs in the tech industry, with Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Meta cutting entire jobs in recent months. \n\nTwitter cut half its workforce. Meta announced 11,000 redundancies, Microsoft let 10,000 employees go and Google axed 12,000 jobs.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft can and have entered the field of AI technology, the future looks bright and will boost investor confidence.

The next generation tech that would've enabled this is EUV, made by ASML. ASML got late with their EUV systems, so Intel decided to undertake their 10nm process with greater multipatterning, which was risky and could lead to lower yield. Up until then photolithography machines, used to etch your pattern on the die. When nodes shrunk, the DUV machinery produced wasn't capable to etch the die accurately in one go. So the die would have multiple patterns overlaid one after another. This was multipatterning. Up until 10nm, they had 2-3 layers.

You don't immediately ramp up production of a new node which may have higher defects. It is standard practice still followed today. That is why a node is called mature when it is capable of entering HVM. Not getting it enough floorspace didn't cause it to get delayed.

They just didn't exist. BK's fault was not that he didn't spend money on research.

I see a lot of \"Keep yolo'ing\" and \"Don't worry, you can gamble X amount\" type of posts... and while I kind of agree with the \"it's OK to gamble X amount of winnings\" I think it's also important for people like us to acknowledge that maybe those are part of the destructive habits which can bring people down in the first place.\n\nI say this as someone who has the same revenge-trading tendencies who has reduced them in himself, but not yet to the extent where I have total control, so I see danger in \"It's OK, just another bump\" type thinking.\n\nThe trades that I plan are the ones that tend to work. When I have very high confidence and a good plan in either direction, most of the time it works out really well, especially when I have both a fundamental, technical, and mechanics position.\n\nWhere I screw myself over is on random sentiment. Most of my losses are \"I feel like this will reverse\" type thinking. We can convince ourselves that those are planned, but they're really coin tosses. We don't know whether they will reverse or not and there's more than just \"this should be higher\" at play in the market overall.\n\nWhen I look back over the past 2 years, the trades that delivered for me are the ones that:\n\n* Had a clear exit plan.\n* Had a clear expectation of the behavior of the play.\n* Planned the trade on the 1Y (daily candlesticks) chart. I've found that these are the dominant trends in the market, overall, and that daily trending patterns tend to land most frequently with the direction of the trend on the 1Y.\n* Stuck to positioning rules and didn't escalate position into the trade.\n* Traded WITH the market trend in the middle of a momentum move that has just started.\n* Took profit along the way.\n* Did not follow-up with extended plays once the trade turned against me. (This is the hardest one to break, IMO, which is why revenge-trading is so hard to stop.)\n* Were based in solid chart TA where I could plan the trade NOT predict the future.\n* Had a strong fundamentals or market mechanics thesis, confirmed with technicals.\n\nI've found that for me, that last part is the key. That's how I've slowed my emotional trading problems.\n\nMost people on here reflexively puke when they see TA thinking it's about predicting the future, completely missing that it's about trying to plan the play and determine the trend. If you can't determine the trend and are just guessing at positions, the play will eventually turn against you.\n\nThen if you don't have an exit plan, that's where the emotions kick in. That's where \"It's OK, I'll make it up on the next one\" kicks in, and those are coin flips and coin flips are streaky.\n\nThen I leverage up into the play, thinking things will reverse. Then it reverses and I wait because \"I can get more\" and FOMO kicks in because that's confirmation and things get worse. And then the market takes our money. LOL\n\nI like combining fundamentals, TA, and mechanics. For instance, I knew we were entering a bullish period into the Fed meeting last week. Instead of playing SPY, I had been doing a small play that paid off into AMD earnings where I scalped some call IV to finance a holding play past earnings. Then, as expected, IV crushed and I decided to pick up some positions betting on a bullish continuation from the Fed meeting. Of course, those options were super cheap while SPY was super expensive. I also knew that AMD had great earnings and solid momentum and was in the middle of its own Cup and Handle formation that was playing out. That played out, the market's bullish structures played out as expected... I took profits, but instead of trusting my plan, I held, and I chased, and I lost some gains playing the market. I violated my rules and paid the price.\n\nThe trades that followed the rules above were really profitable. The trades that were degenerate \"I'm just gonna buy this and see if it works!\" didn't.\n\nEveryone's different, but I've found this macro trend Cup and Handle trade always plays well for me. I just happen to be good at picking up on the accumulation phase and positioning based on it.\n\nThe purpose of the TA (all TA, really) isn't to predict the future, like the degens here who tried some youtube video strats think, but rather to plan the trade, and I find that bullish market structures give me a lot of risk definition, because they by nature have established recent support and proven accumulation.  This gives me an expectation of loss and an exit plan, as well as an expectation of behavior.\n\nI think you're right to avoid trading significantly on CPI, but if you want to go for a stock that has high market correlation, decent earnings, and just had an IV crush event like earnings. Those options will be cheaper and more likely to run with the market if it runs, like the AMD example. Look out for significant resistance, AMD hit its resistance 3 times on this run right to the cent and broke down... people say this stuff is bullshit, but it actually works if you do it right.\n\nBut the difference between just buying a SPY/QQQ strangle on CPI day and buying one with collapsed IV is that the SPY play is a pure gamble, the collapsed IV play has an actual arbitrage strategy to it.\n\nI typed all of this out because I see in your future play discussion things like \"I might buy google because I think it's moved too far recently\"... I agree with that, but it's just a gut feeling, not a strategy. I've made those trades and they often fail, even during supportive market contexts.\n\nThose are gambles.\n\nBuild a strategy. Treat it like a business.  Businesses plan for risk. I like that you took money out. I like having a stable ETF core.
