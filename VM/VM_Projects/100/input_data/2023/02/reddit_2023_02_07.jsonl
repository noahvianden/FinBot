But we also made mistakes,” Yuan said. “We didn’t take as much time as we should have to thoroughly analyze our teams or assess if we were growing sustainably, toward the highest priorities.” \n\nYuan said the cuts will impact every organization across Zoom, and employees will be offered up to 16 weeks of salary and healthcare coverage. Yuan also said he plans to reduce his own salary for the coming fiscal year by 98%, and he is also foregoing is 2023 corporate bonuses.\n\n“As the CEO and founder of Zoom, I am accountable for these mistakes and the actions we take today– and I want to show accountability not just in words but in my own actions,” he wrote in the post.\n\nThe company’s layoff announcement marks the latest round of job cuts in the tech industry, as Dell on Monday announced plans to cut 6,650 jobs. In January, Google revealed plans to lay off more than 12,000 workers, Microsoft disclosed plans to cut 10,000 employees and Salesforce announced plans to lay off 7,000 workers.", "id": "10w810w", "created_utc": 1675791893.0, "score": 2825, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 370, "comments": [{"body": "Remember when Zoom was a $160B company? lol.", "score": 597, "replies": [{"body": "From Jan 2020-October 2020 it sky rocketed up **600%** Good times.", "score": 213, "replies": [{"body": "It was the best of times.

If the federal government decides to forgive some of the student loan debt, it will add to the already ballooning deficit, which could lead to a financial crisis. On the other hand, if people are expected to repay the loans after the pause, many may not be able to or willing to do so, due to financial difficulties. This could result in a wave of defaults and cause a significant blow to the economy.\n\nFurthermore, the pause has masked the true scale of the student loan crisis, and when the pause is lifted, the issue may come to a head, leading to a recession. The student loan debt crisis affects not just the individuals with the loans but also the broader economy, as it limits the spending power of a large segment of the population. This limited spending power will coincide with already diminishing savings rates and increased credit card debt. \n\nWhen the pause ends after being on pause for a number of years, and since the Fed Is determined to cause more unemployment because the job market is too strong I do not see this ending well. \n\n“Federal student loan payments won't resume until the end of August, unless the litigation over the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan is resolved sooner.”  -CNBC", "id": "10vvilx", "created_utc": 1675753701.0, "score": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 401, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|62|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: The looming Supreme Court decision on student loans could have a disastrous effect on the economy, leading to a recession.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Whichever way it goes...", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The US govt owns the debt, defaults on loan repayment would be held with govt. its not gonna crush banks", "score": 135, "replies": [{"body": "And the US govt will guarangoddamntee collect any student loan defaults pretty much the same way they collect unpaid taxes.

That's a big loophole.  You effectively got your education by way of everyone else paying for it in that scenario.  And you're still allowed to use that degree after the fact.  No bueno.\n\nIf we're going to allow for the removal of student debts, then the student needs some skin in the game.  Repossess their diploma.

Creating a way for young people to financially screw themselves is not doing them any favors.\n\nSecond, what's really going on here is we insulated the colleges from any sort of competition. The cost of higher education was affordable until this crap started. Now it's many times what it used to be and the amount of money invested in the students doesn't even track with the price.

There is no obligation on the part of the government to give folks an education in fields that the market has priced below the cost universities have decided to charge for an education in those fields. In a free market this problem would solve itself- the universities would charge a reasonable price for an education. Instead, they've been insulated from the economics of the situation and the cost has been passed onto young people by obfuscation and to all of us in reality because those loans are never going to be paid off.

{"title": "WSJ Interview 2.0… 2-7-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Looking at this article from Bespoke you can see that incredibly of the last 13 trading days only one of those closed below its open… that means despite how red we opened or how green we opened we closed above our open. IT just shows the incredible strength and memeness of this rally. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cp0lndi4uuga1.png?width=617&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6208287415918ee33efb58500ea86348251b014\n\nI thought I had seen it all and then we have SPY who managed to pump nearly $7… drop $8 and then proceed to repump nearly $9 all within a 4 hour time period. This was the most wild amount of swinging I have seen in a very long time. This was like a FOMC meeting mixed with CPI on steroids. \n\nSo the question remains… who is in control? Where are we headed next? Unfortunately the answer is not simple and there truthfully is a case for >420 and there is a case for <405. Lets break it down…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1n6xndz4uuga1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c381f98d853c02de85fbf90f4ed02a98c2be53\n\nBull case- despite breaking support of the 7 week long bull channel at open we held the daily 8ema and once again as highlighted by the three black arrows bounced off that support and pushed higher. We broke the breakout triangle resistance that was established last week and managed to bullishly engulf yesterdays price action. Despite JPOW re-iterating his hawkishness for the rest of the year we did not see markets digest it even remotely as such. Markets are clearly running rampant and it appears that it is going to take a shock to end this momentum we have currently. Despite the daily bull channel support being broken we did maintain the weekly bull channel support. \n\nBear case- We broke through a 7 week long bull channel support. Despite the EOD pump there was a sliver of hope when we say that $8 dump after jpow stopped talking today. Now we did breakout again to the upside, however, we hard rejected and failed to continue that break out over the key 416.8 resistance area. This is where the TA has to be weighed on what is most significant. While we clearly saw SPY break through the bull channel support and breaking a 7 week long multiple point support line is a very big deal we do have to factor in the algos. Now the fact that we saw algos dump this $8 could lead to some downside to come. The first and most major resistance line comes next at 419.5 if this rally was to continue. \n\nIf you support the bull case and believe that the bounce off of 408.8 support/ daily 8ema is bullish and that markets will not digest any bearish news right now then we should be looking for a push to 419.5 and eventually 427.5. There is a case to be made for a rally into CPI. CPI very well could cause a final blow off top to the 430-450 area IF it is good. OR it very well could be the top and start a very long retracement back to that 390-400 area. \n\nIF you support the bear case and believe that a 7 week long bull channel breaking is highly significant and will significantly outweigh the bull case and shows a clear break in the momentum then we should first look for a retest of that 409 key support area and from there is we lose 405.3 it is back to 390-400 area. There is an equal weighted case to be made that markets with CPI in exactly one week from today will start to go risk off and will fear a miss (hotter than expected) CPI and that could start a very strong leg down on the market. \n\nWhats the best case here? Honestly im very indifferent. There was a sliver of hope and sensibility in this market today when we saw the retrace back to 409. However, the fact that JPOW re-iterated his hawkishness (yes I know he said disinflation and I will say this till im blue that word does NOT mean what most people thinks it means and honestly JPOW himself misquoted what disinflation was today when he said that he would stick by his word of disinflation that there is a drop in inflation) and despite all that the markets still rallied almost $9 says a lot. The algos are clearly locked in on this bull run and its really hard to see an end game on that right now. \n\nMy personal thoughts are that when we look at the WSJ interview back in November and previous FOMCs that they usually signal a local top. With CPI next week and the fact that we already pulled back and broke through the 7 week long bull channel support I do suspect we could see a pullback to test 405.3 support area. IF we break through that then I like 390-400 to be retested. However, if we continue this rally I would bet on 419.5 being the highest probability of a top a good CPI could see a blow off top much like Decembers to touch 427.5 area but the further we get from 409 the less I believe this rally will continue. \n\nHistorically speaking days like this and FOMC have generally caused massive intraday rallies and then have given it all up immediately afterwards the next day. There is a pretty strong base case and we are seeing it on a small scale right now that we pullback to that 409 to 411 support area tomorrow. \n\nKey SPY Support- 412.5 -> 411.5 -> 408.8 -> 406.5 -> 405.3\n\nKey SPY Resistance- 415.2 -> 416.9 -> 419.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7b79nyn5uuga1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c4d21615b3745689f94a28c34b033ce66cc2a15\n\nThe one thing I love about trading SPY but also watching futures closely is that they can at times paint a slightly different story. Sometimes SPY can give us hints of whats to come and sometimes futures can do that same too and at other times they can give extra confirmation. \n\nOne thing that is very important to note here is that despite SPY breaking its 7 week long bull channel futus did NOT break its… However, what we have here is a break through of that red resistance line for the breakout triangle however we found ourselves hard rejecting right at the possible double top off 4177. If we were to see futes overnight and into tomorrow hold 4177 as resistance we could be looking to come back down and retest that key 4123 to 4145 support area. \n\nThere is a true 4123 double bottom on futures though off that daily 8ema much like we see over on spy and have seen the last two times we attempted to breakdown. \n\nFutures will be very interesting to watch overnight and into tomorrow. \n\nKey Futures Support- 4145 -> 4123 -> 4095 -> 4085\n\nKey Futures Resistance- 4177 -> 4210 -> 4235\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbp3f066uuga1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0658dccf0f1e92cfb910210a5a4606c7fc3dae0\n\nAnd then there was tesla… what can I say about ole girl… So I mentioned on SPY that we broke through that 7 week long bull channel support line and that we had to weigh the overall strength and significance of that against the overall strength of this rally… Well we are seeing here on Tesla that we also have a major support line broken. Not only that we also have closed on the daily a potential reversal hanging man candle resistance perfectly at 197.1. Remember I have been saying this 197.1 level is a MAJOR resistance on tesla and not only that… this is now the 4th day in a row (the other 3 also closed in dojis or reversal down candles) that we have seen Tesla attempt to break through 197.1 resistance and fallen short. \n\nBy all means from a LOGICAL (and remember I say logical and REALLY emphasize that) standpoint… four rejections at probably one of the biggest resistance levels for Tesla, a hanging man reversal (bearish) candle closure on the daily AND breaking a major 5 week long rising wedge support line SHOULD 100% without a doubt lead to a retrace. \n\nNow with that being said… its obvious that this market is anything buy logical and despite how logical a fairly large retrace on Tesla would be for tomorrow… this could very well continue green. \n\nTesla officially closed its 6th green day in a row and has now closed green 12 out of the last 13 trading days. This is a pretty incredible run here. If we get a bigger retrace tomorrow 184 is another major support area I would watch for a bounce at. \n\nKey Tesla Support- 190.2 -> 184 -> 181.5  \n Key Tesla Resistance- 197.1 -> 200.9 -> 204.8 -> 208.7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59ip3be7uuga1.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d2b775c06e5d0787dde6436691d86caf95c9bbc\n\nNow to add to the base case confusion on what comes next lets take the VIX. Today we saw (prior to JPOW) the VIX berak through key 19.9 resistance. Effectively when it did that as you can see if broke through a trend line that dates back to the middle of October. What happened in the middle of October? Oh that’s right.. Spy put in its 52 week low (and potentially its bear market bottom). \n\nSo we have a 4 month long resistance line that was officially breached today and should 100% open up the upside for the VIX to see a return to trading back in the 20-23 range. However, as you can see as soon as we broke through that level we immediately rejected 19.99 and actually ended up closing back below the daily 8ema. WE now find the VIX trading back near that crucial support range of 18.3. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\nI used to find myself enjoying playing days like today where the volatility is stupid high and you can make 50% in 10 seconds when the candle pumps $2 out of no where. However, after getting burnt on so many days like this I decided it was best to sit it out plus we held such a tight high IV range this morning it was not worth playing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ihykult7uuga1.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f783442bbc4e54935e3d2aa918bf4296045257\n\nWhen we hard rejected my 414.3 volatility level and lose 413.58 volatility level after that pump I decided it was time to short JPOW… I am happy I did. Not too often you get to score a 25.4% win on a 31dte within 22minutes of opening it. I was planning to keep this till we retested 405/406 area. However as I ALWAYS say… secure profits and mitigate losses! Ever 5% above 20% I hit I set a stop limit sell and eventually was tagged at 25%. And by golly am I glad I have decent risk management skills because if I had held this I would be down about 12%... which honestly in all reality is NOT that bad and I had planned even if we kept pumping to average down every +$5 that would be a nearly 37% swing in P/L had i held instead of closing. \n\nThe lesson today is this… 1. We do NOT have to trade everyday. And 2. No matter how much we believe in a move or how much we believe our play will continue to gain profits…. NEVER forget to secure profits.", "id": "10whbp6", "created_utc": 1675814112.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4180|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla has rallied nearly 100% in the last few weeks.
