You had one acute phase in which your newfound options strategy that was going to make you get rich quick went against you in a big way.  You're like the light drinker who discovered shots for the first time, got really drunk, threw up in the bed, and committed to never touching alcohol again.  That wouldn't make you an alcoholic, and experiencing a loss with options the first time you use them doesn't make you a gambler. The fact that you scared yourself so much that you are going to seek treatment for gambling addiction is evidence that you burned your finger after sticking it in the fire and learned from it. So don't be too hard on yourself.  \n\nI had traded on/off for 20 years before going full time a few years ago, but even with that experience, I lost a lot of money too when I first started using options.  I quickly learned not to do stupid things with options ever again, then actually learned about options, and slowly climbed back on that horse.  I still use options, but not as a central pillar of my trading.  I use them to hedge, occasionally for income generation on long stock positions (CCs), and occasionally to trade volatility if the conditions are right.  I never go naked, and I always make sure downside is strictly limited.  \n\nSo my advice to you is not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  Options can empty your account balance very quickly if you don't know what you are doing, but they are also a great tool in your toolkit to be used where it makes sense and if you do know what you are doing.  So go back to what you were doing before options, and in the meantime, learn about how options are priced and how the options market works.  Learn how to read the market so you can identify trading opportunities, particularly volatility events (since with options, you are trading on the underlying's volatility more so than its direction).  Learn how you can use options to increase income on your long holdings (CCs), get paid while you wait for a stock price to fall to your buy zone (CSPs), hedge your portfolio against high volatility corrections, or make limited-risk directional trades on stocks with no time decay (vertical spreads).  Give that a year or two to figure out, then dip a toe back in the water.  \n\nCongratulations - you have had your one big loss. It's a rite of passage for most traders.

Lets use AMZN (Trading at 92 at time of writing) as an example, An entry strategy here might select a strike at 90 (currently 2 dollars OTM)   \nThe 90 strike returns 1k. with a 9k investment. (about 11% in a year). This premium is yours for the duration of the option. If the stock goes below 90, you are hedged all the way down to 80 (which is a pretty decent entry IMO the 3 year low is 82) you have committed your 9k, and in this down case, you would end up owning 100 shares at a cost basis of 80.  \n\n\nIn the event of up, the option expires worthless and you keep 1k. You would just keep doing this until you eventually get assigned to entry due to price flux. Generating ROI on your 9k commitment without actually owning anything. This example uses a single option, scale up to taste. Other tickers may return more in exchange for more risk. 10 options = 90k commit = 10k return.  \n\n\nThis is a bullish strategy designed to enter low in the event that you are \"wrong\" about the move. This is a Yearly strategy, you would put this trade in and simply leave it alone for the year this will allow you to be taxed at the \"long term rate\" instead of the \"short term\" rate.  \n\n\nWith this strategy theta works in your favor. As time passes the option you sold will be worth less.  \n\n\nMy recommendation to you with your capital is to simply find some stock you like, and try to use options to enter as cheaply as possible. That said it might look like you are in the red while you hold a put like this, but just remember the assignment case is essentially what you wanted anyway. (Just don't buy to close.)  \n\n\nThe exit version of this strategy is called a covered call.  \n\n\nTrade at your own risk. I hope your year goes better.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "6 figure salary?

But that's only because in a stadium of 30,000 mostly working class rowdy men, you're probably going to hear one or two racist comments... But there are people who are unable to see nuance and believe one minor act of racism means the whole game and everyone who's a fan of the game most also be a racist.\n\nA more extreme example of this might be Jordan Peterson or Joe Rogan fans. People on Reddit seem to struggle with the fact you don't have to agree or even like everything someone says to enjoy their content. Instead they take the worst thing those individuals have said or done then assume you must also hold or support that position. Eg, Jordan Peterson said \\`x\\` racist thing so you're a racist if you like him.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I noticed a difference when trump was running for office.

We as retail investors have a huge advantage over institutions and money managers because we don't lose clients or targets if we underperform the market in the short term. For example, being 100% TSLA would've been a disaster for any money manager a whole bunch of times in the last 4 years, while as a retail investor you could've just held through it all and be up 10x vs the S&P's 1.5x. Besides, owning single stocks is a lot more fun than owning an index fund, which also motivates you to not spend your money on shit you don't need and invest even more.\n\nThe only downside is that it requires a lot of work, and it will take a few years before you're knowledgeable enough to analyse companies well enough to determine which ones are worth holding long term. You will unquestionably lose money on some (or all) of them along the way, but if you enjoy it and you're willing to do the work, it'll be a huge positive in your life in the long run.

On average, stock pickers don't outperform the market, but on average stock pickers don't do anywhere near enough research before they buy a stock.\n\nI'd wager if you did some serious research into the performance of people that pick stocks and really do the work, spending hundreds of hours researching the companies they buy and not buying 10+ different companies they barely know the basics of, you'd find that they on average do outperform the market.\n\nUnfortunately, this research has never been done, and every statistic instead includes people that are just randomly buying stocks. It's like saying \"90% of people fail at New Year's resolutions\", which is probably true, but of that 90% the vast majority probably didn't really try in the first place.\n\nIt's also worthwhile to consider how ridiculous it is to expect you can just start investing and outperform the market out of the gate. Nobody expects you to start playing basketball and compete in the NBA two years later. Like you said, it takes time to become good at something, but you won't become good at investing by just dollar cost averaging into index funds.\n\nAnd even if 90% of serious investors would underperform the market, which I very much doubt, that doesn't mean you shouldn't aspire to be that 10%. We don't tell kids \"you shouldn't be playing so much basketball, only 0.1% makes it to the NBA\". If you enjoy something and you want to become good at it, go for it.

If you can have fun while making money, even if you're underperforming the market, that's arguably an even bigger positive than investing in index funds and having no fun doing so.

Berkshire initial investment is now ‚Äúworth about $8 billion or maybe $9 [billion]. That‚Äôs a pretty good rate of return,‚Äù said Warren Buffett‚Äôs longtime investment partner.\n\nBYD has been a lucrative bet for Berkshire , which first bought about 220 million shares in September 2008. The stock has jumped more than 600% in the past 10 years amid the massive growth in electric vehicles. Berkshire has actually been trimming its BYD stake in the past year as the stock has become increasingly pricey.\n\n‚ÄúAt the current price of BYD stock, little BYD is worth more than the entire Mercedes corporation. It‚Äôs not a cheap stock, but on the other hand, it‚Äôs a very remarkable company,‚Äù Munger said.\n\nMunger, Berkshire‚Äôs vice chairman and a Daily Journal board member, credited Li Lu, founder of Seattle-based asset manager Himalaya Capital, for introducing him to BYD. Munger also said BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu is unusual, calling him a genius and a workaholic.\n\nAsked if he would prefer Tesla or BYD as an investment, Munger said the answer is easy.\n\n‚ÄúTesla last year reduced its prices in China twice. BYD increased its prices. We are direct competitors. BYD is so much ahead of Tesla in China ... it‚Äôs almost ridiculous,‚Äù Munger said.\n\nBYD recently said it expects record adjusted annual profit for 2022 of 16.3 billion yuan ($2.4 billion), about 1,200% above 2021.\n\n‚ÄúBYD last year made more than $2 billion after taxes in the auto business in China. It‚Äôs incredible what‚Äôs happened,‚Äù Munger said. ‚ÄúIf you count all the manufacturing space they have in China to make cars, it would amount to a big percentage of the Manhattan island, and nobody had ever heard of them a few years ago.‚Äù\n\nThe longtime investor called Tesla CEO Elon Musk talented ‚Äî and peculiar.

What's going to use up way more charging capacity is all the cars Tesla is going to make.\n\nTesla is probably going to roughly double the number of cars sold in the US in the next couple years. So keeping the car-to-charger ratio stable will take doubling the number of superchargers. That will be a much bigger impact than non-Teslas being able to use superchargers. But again, it's mostly going to hit the places that are already busy. Most supercharger stations aren't that busy most of the time, they can easily absorb a 100% increase in usage.\n\nSo the trick will be to build a small number of locations with a huge number of chargers (and hopefully these will be mostly Tesla only? or at least near a Tesla only location).

Prices are commensurately high.  \n\nA greedy, selfish person who only cares about their own personal wealth observes this.  He realizes that he can buy coffee from another country where production of coffee is abundant and sell the coffee to people in Lalaland.  **He only cares about his profits**.

However, another greedy entrepreneur observes how he does this and attempts the exact same thing - except he simply undercuts the first greedy entrepreneur by 5%.

Not when there's others offering it for cheaper.  They have to find a way to reduce costs by being more efficient.\n\nNotice how *none* of this incentivizes greed - it assumes greed is already there and forces that greed to be aligned with positive incentives (increased supply of goods/services at lower cost for the consumer).  \n\nDoes that make sense?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You're still missing the point and you've made the classic mistake of looking around at the world under capitalism, and assuming that the way people behave is inherent instead of an effect of the material conditions they live under.  \n\nLet's say there's a magical island with a magical tree, and that tree grows magic apples.  As soon as you pick one, a new one springs fully grown to replace it meaning the supply is infinite and everyone on the island can have as many as they want.\n\nThe people on that island like apples as much as the next folk, but no one really takes them in trade when they barter because anyone can access them.  Might as well trade your chicken's eggs for a handful of sand from the beach because the apples are just as plentiful.  And so it goes for a long time, but then someone invents capitalism.  \n\nThe man who lives near the tree builds a fence around the apple tree, and now people need his permission to access it.  He charges them for the privilege.  There's been no change in supply, the tree is still magic, the only thing that has changed is access, and yet now apples have a price at the market and people get in fights over them when they are stolen from the seller's carts.\n\nThere was no inherent greed for apples, but the greed appears when the scarcity changes (even though the scarcity has not really changed).  Capitalism does this for everything because it locks access behind private ownership and money is scarce (for most people).  It creates greed by keeping most people in a perpetual state of having not quite enough money to access the otherwise plentiful resources they are surrounded with.\n\nThat's the perverse paradox of capitalism.  It's created a world where folks can starve to death while the shelves at the market are full to bursting.  It makes everything scarce because everything is accessed through money, and money is limited, thereby making everyone 'greedy'.\n\nI'm not against markets, but I am against private enclosure for the basic necessities of human life.

That's a 6-12% savings for the consumer.\n\nThose \"rich pricks\" made poor people wealthier by allowing them to buy more stuff for the same money.
