If a strong network already exists, it might limit the chances of new entrants to gain a sufficient number of users.\r\nHigh research and development costs: When firms spend huge amounts on research and development, it is often a signal to the new entrants that they have large financial reserves. In order to compete, new entrants would also have to match or exceed this level of spending.\r\nHigh set-up costs: Many of these costs are sunk costs that cannot be recovered when a firm leaves a market, such as advertising and marketing costs and other fixed costs.\r\nOwnership of key resources or raw material: Having control over scarce resources, which other firms could have used, creates a very strong barrier to entry.\" ~ [Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/barriers-to-entry/)\n\nAw man, i dunno, does an oil rig and the land to put it on count for high fixed/set up costs or ownership of scarce resources?

ExxonMobil and others had their credit ratings downgraded, and there was even talk of the Fed creating new climate change-related banking rules to make lending to oil companies even more difficult and expensive. Investors and lenders (and the public, for that matter) did not want oil companies to invest heavily in operations due to low oil prices and returns on capital that had persisted since 2015.\n\nWith negative free cash flow and nearly-frozen capital markets, how are these refinery expansions supposed to happen? There were multiple large expansions along the Gulf Coast that were in the works but put on hold or canceled altogether in 2020. This doesn’t even get into the fact that environmental permitting rules make it significantly more expensive and time-consuming to expand operations than it was 30-40 years ago.\n\nI don’t know what you’re basing your “socialize profits” assertion from, either. Oil companies didn’t get any help from the government when prices crashed in 2020 or 2015. 2022 was the first truly good year for refiners in at least two decades, and refineries have been shutting down left and right for a while now due to lack of economic viability, even before COVID - yet there has never been any public pressure for the government to subsidize refinery operations in order to keep these refineries running. \n\nOil is a cyclical commodity with inelastic supply and demand - it’s always going to have spikes and crashes.

{"title": "CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been “undershipping” chips for a while now to keep CPU, GPU prices elevated", "selftext": "AMD is ‘undershipping’ chips to keep CPU, GPU prices elevated\nLess supply to balance out demand—and keep prices high.\n\nAs the PC industry flounders, Intel suffered from such disastrous sales last quarter that it instituted pay cuts and other extreme measures going forward. AMD’s client PC sales also dropped dramatically—a whopping 51 percent year-over-year—but the company managed to eke out a small profit despite the sky falling. So why aren’t CPU and GPU prices falling too? In a call with investors Tuesday night, CEO Lisa Su confirmed that AMD has been “undershipping” chips for a while now to balance supply and demand (read: keep prices up).\n\n“We have been undershipping the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters,” Su said, as spotted by PC Gamer. “We undershipped in Q3, we undershipped in Q4. We will undership, to a lesser extent, in Q1.”\n\nWith the pandemic winding down and inflation ramping up, far fewer people are buying CPUs, GPUs, and PCs. It’s a hard, sudden reverse from just months ago, when companies like Nvidia and AMD were churning out graphic cards as quickly as possible to keep up with booming demand from cryptocurrency miners and PC gamers alike. Now that GPU mining is dead, shelves are brimming with unsold chips.\n\nDespite the painfully high price tags of new next-gen GPUs, last-gen GeForce RTX 30-series and Radeon RX 6000-series graphics cards are still selling for very high prices considering their two-year-old status. Strategic under-shipping helps companies maintain higher prices for their wares.\n\nAMD isn’t the only one doing it, either.\n\n“We’re continuing to watch each and every day in terms of the sell-through that we’re seeing,” Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said to investors in November. “So we have been undershipping. We have been undershipping gaming at this time so that we can correct that inventory that is out in the channel.”\n\nSince then, Nvidia has released the $1,200 GeForce RTX 4080 and $800 RTX 4070 Ti, two wildly overpriced graphics cards, and tried positioning them as enthusiast-grade upsells over the RTX 30-series, rather than treating them like the usual cyclical upgrades. AMD’s $900 Radeon RX 7900 XT offers similarly disappointing value and the company recently released a blog post also positioning its new GPUs as enthusiast-grade upsells.\n\nOverall gross margin is a key metric for chip companies, which burn through a ton of cash investing in R&D and cutting-edge technological processes. AMD’s market tricks helped it achieve a 51 percent non-GAAP gross margin last quarter, while Intel forecasted a terrifyingly low 34.1 percent gross margin for the upcoming quarter (hence its belt-tightening moves).\n\nThis all helps explain why street prices for standalone GPUs haven’t plummeted, even as deals on desktops and laptops have started ramping up. We expect—hope?—that as stocks dwindle down and competition ramps up, sanity will return to graphics card prices, mirroring AMD and Intel’s recent CPU price adjustments. Just this morning, Intel announced that its Arc A750 graphics card was getting a price cut to $250, instantly making it an all-too-rare tempting target for PC gamers on a budget.\n\nAuthor: Brad Chacos, Executive editor\n\nBrad Chacos spends his days digging through desktop PCs and tweeting too much.

{"title": "Amazon earnings are out — here are the numbers", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/02/amazon-amzn-earnings-q4-2022.html\n\nEarnings: 3 cents per share\n\nRevenue: $149.2 billion vs $145.42 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates\n\nIt is not immediately clear if the reported earnings are comparable to the Refinitiv analyst estimate of 18 cents per share. Wall Street is also watching several other numbers on the report:\n\nAmazon Web Services: $21.87 billion, according to StreetAccount\n\nAdvertising: $11.38 billion, according to StreetAccount\n\nAmazon likely closed out its worst year for revenue growth in its quarter century as a public company, and another quarter of single-digit sales expansion is expected, as the company grapples with waning consumer demand from inflation and a deceleration in its cloud business.\n\nThe company warned in its most recent earnings report that fourth-quarter revenue would rise just 2% to 8% from a year earlier.\n\nAmazon shares lost half their value in 2022, when higher costs tied to inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain constraints forced the company to recalibrate after its pandemic-fueled growth. Meanwhile, consumers continued their return to in-person shopping and pulled back on discretionary spending, adding to Amazon’s pain.\n\nEven the holiday season was seen as fairly lackluster. Amazon’s online stores segment is expected to show a revenue decline of 1.4% year over year, according to FactSet estimates.\n\n“While there was an expected boost to consumer spend in late November around the Cyber Five period (the Thanksgiving holiday shopping weekend was Amazon’s biggest ever), this uplift was likely short-lived, with December retail sales declining 1.1% [month over month], the steepest decrease in 2022,” Canaccord Genuity analysts wrote in a note to clients earlier this week. The firm maintains a buy rating on Amazon’s stock.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy’s efforts to reel in costs will be a major area of focus. In January, Amazon said it’s eliminating 18,000 jobs among its corporate workforce, after cutting a number of employees last November. The company has also instituted a hiring freeze in its corporate ranks, cut some projects and paused warehouse expansion in an effort to tame rising expenses.\n\nAmazon Web Services is expected to show slowing growth during the fourth quarter as businesses softened their spending in an effort to cut costs. Cloud-computing rival Microsoft\n last week reported slowing expansion in its Azure unit.\n\nAWS CEO Adam Selipsky said in an interview late last year at the company’s annual Reinvent customer conference that “we do see some customers who are doing some belt-tightening now.”\n\nOne bright spot could be Amazon’s advertising business, which is expected to post solid revenue growth during the quarter. Online advertising has come under pressure as inflation pushed some brands to recalibrate their budgets.\n\nBut Amazon’s ad business is poised to grow “at a mid-teen percentage range” in 2023, even against a tough macro backdrop, as sellers and vendors continue to buy targeted product ads, according to analysts at CFRA Research, which has a buy rating on Amazon shares.", "id": "10s0w5l", "created_utc": 1675371995.0, "score": 256, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "Initially popped 2% AH and then flipped red instead on worse than expected Q1’23 guidance.

Earlier this week, Snap reported weaker-than-expected revenue, while Facebook parent Meta topped estimates but still recorded a 4% decline in sales.\n\nIn January, Alphabet announced it was laying off 12,000 employees, or 6% of its workforce. The company told employees recently that more of them will be at risk for low performance ratings than in prior years.\n\nAlphabet also cut staff in its health sciences unit Verily by 15%, citing a restructuring that will supposedly better position the business to seek financial independence.\n\nPressure is mounting for Google in other ways.\n\nArtificial intelligence-based chatbot ChatGPT, launched late last year by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, is viewed as posing a risk to Google’s search engine. Executives teased that the company may introduce a similar product to the public at some point this year. CNBC reported this week that Google is internally experimenting with several potential products that could influence its search business.\n\nIn January, the U.S. Justice Department filed its second antitrust lawsuit against Google in just over two years, this one targeting its advertising business. It marked the first federal lawsuit against Google filed during the Biden administration.\n\nGoogle is now showing its willingness to invest heavily in live sports.

In November, Apple gave a rare warning explaining that production issues in China stemming from Covid restrictions would result in lower than anticipated shipments.\n\nThe data point caused many analysts covering the stock to slash their estimates.\n\nCustomers in many regions noticed that Apple shipping times for the high-end iPhone 14 Pro slipped past a month during the quarter, versus typical lead times of under a week, meaning that the premium iPhones were a tough Christmas present for people to get their hands on.\n\nNow investors are looking for two answers on Thursday: How much did Apple sales really slip because of the production issue, and will people who missed out on an iPhone 14 Pro in December wait until 2023 to pick one up, which would effectively push sales from the 1st quarter into the 2nd quarter?\n\nInvestors may be able to get the answer to the second question from Apple’s guidance. Apple hasn’t given guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty first caused by the pandemic. However, Apple management usually gives a few data points that give analysts a sense of how the quarter is going.\n\nAnalysts expect Apple to report $98 billion in sales in the March quarter, or slight year-over-year growth. If Apple’s data points suggest that it might come in under that figure, investors may question whether Apple can continue to outperform the market and whether waning consumer confidence may be starting to hurt its business.\n\nThe smartphone market and the PC market are both in the midst of a multiple-year slowdown, with sales falling in 2022. Analysts believe that Apple has done better than much of its competition even as shipments fall, but if consumer confidence is eroding, eventually sales of Apple’s premium-priced phones and computers will slow down.\n\nAside from hardware, Apple’s services business will be a focus after the bell. Several data points in the December quarter, including Apple’s own App Store payouts, suggest a slowdown in App Store growth.

I'd sell a shorter term 30ish delta put so like 2/10 170P or the 2/17 170P.\n\nWhat this does is gives you some more upside if the share price keeps going up.\n\nIf it goes down towards 170, then the CC should lose value much faster than the short put you sold gaining value. The downside here is now you have to manage the put side potentially. You can always roll the put down and out like how you've been rolling the CC up and out. My rule for the put side is to make sure they don't get ITM. Since we're all bullish on TSLA, sooner or later the put should expire worthless. Just have to roll and wait long enough while keeping OTM to prevent early assignment.\n\nThen with the put premium, you can buy shares/hold cash/diversify or use it to roll the short call up at a debit to get it higher faster. Like if you sell the 2/17 170P for $533ish you can then use that to roll your 9/17 170C to 180C for -$412ish.\n\nThe problem with this is if the share price tanks, you've put yourself at more risk (now short puts to manage) and used the premium/debit to roll the short call up that would potentially expire worthless anyways.\n\nEvery trade has a pro and a con and you have to figure out if the risks are worth the rewards in your particular scenario and appetite for risk.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I would suggest you decide what you want to do on your own.

The game released in the West named simply Nier is actually the Gestalt version of the game in japan, the Replicant version was never previously seen outside of Japan. Basically the difference is the main character is Yonah's big brother instead of her father and is therefore younger in appearance.\n\nAfter the surprise runaway success of it's 2017 sequel **Nier Automata**, this remaster of the original was made. Various gameplay systems have also been reworked, for example the combat is smoother and now closer to Automata. Of course the visuals have been improved, since it's a remaster, and there is now a new entire story sequence and additional boss and also an additional ending which establishes a stronger connection between this game and it's sequel. Nier Replicant is one of those games that was released to relative obscurity and many of the people who will play it now are going to be playing it after the better known sequel.\n\nLet me be perfectly clear about this game. It's still Nier. Everything about the 2010 game on PS3 which wasn't good is still not good here, especially regarding the meaningless grind and fetch x items sidequests. That being said, you kind of have to do at least some of the sidequests because they have amazing stories which are worth putting up with the nonsense for completion just to see.\n\nFor those who have dealt with Yoko Taro before, mainly players of Automata, this game isn't that much different. Everything that was refined and improved upon for the sequel exists here in prototypical form. Replicant is absolutely weirder, because it's closer to the Drakengard games that inspired it. But that is the strongest aspect of this game, the essential weirdness that was somewhat neutered in Automata is what makes Yoko Taro's world so amazing and compelling and so emotionally dense to navigate.\n\nIn many ways, I consider the story of Replicant superior to that of Automata. If you thought Automata had an amazing story (it does), and you put up with the multiple playthroughs needed to see the true ending of Automata, well you'll find yourself at home here. The game requires a total of 3 playthroughs to see everything, plus there is an additional few more hours of work put into a 4th partial playthrough of just the beginning to see the new ending that was added to this remaster. But if you commit to this, you'll be rewarded with one of the best video game stories that has ever been written. Yes, like I said, I think it's better than Automata's story.\n\nThe visuals of the game are a mixed bag, it's a remaster of a PS3 game after all and the original PS3 game was heavily criticized in it's day for looking very bad. So it's the PS4 remaster of a PS3 game which in its heyday looked like a PS2 game. It's not going to wow you, even coming from Automata which still looks better. But you'll again be able to enjoy the incredible music of Keiichi Okabe and the vocal tracks of Emi Evans. Most of the music in Automata is descended from this original game's compositions, including the well-known Song of the Ancients. You can hear the original here and see where it all began.\n\nNier Replicant is not a short game. A full completion of the game to see all 5 endings plus do some worthwhile sidequests will require you a solid 50-60 hours. There is a lot of repetition, especially if you want to be somewhat completist in the content. (Don't do the fishing minigame, you'll hate yourself.)

They can now only afford to promote the biggest acts, and artists were forced to make more of their money by touring or taking a job on The Voice.\n\nMovies used to make their money in theaters, and then make more money (or break even) through DVD sales and revenue from premium cable channels.\n\nTV shows used to be cheap to produce (sitcoms, reality shows, cop dramas, news), and would make their money from advertising and expensive cable subscriptions.\n\nNow only the biggest movies can make money in theaters (and they had better be simplistic and generic enough to translate to any language and not offend Chinese censors).\n\nThe really interesting content moved to TV, and production values soared. Every episode of Game of Thrones has a full movie budget, for example.\n\nWithout (as many) commercials or cable subscriptions, early streaming services focused on growing their subscriber bases, largely ignoring profitability as long as their stock price was increasing. Consumers got used to paying low prices and started cutting the cord. The digitizing of everything also enabled rampant piracy.\n\nCompetition from deep pockets like Apple and Amazon and locking up of content by entrants like Comcast, Disney, and Paramount, meant that Netflix suddenly had to become a content creator/exclusive content buyer. Suddenly their pricing made no sense, at the same time other streaming services were willing to lose money or break even on their pricing. Consumers no longer saw Netflix as a bargain, now that they were paying for 4 or 5 different services.\n\nThis is obviously unsustainable. Movies and TV shows don't have the option of going on tour to supplement their profits.\n\nWe will soon see the end of the golden age of content, and unskippable ads will become more prevalent. There will be more consolidation in the streaming world, and the surviving players will wield much greater pricing power.

Well, while the Fed is still raising rates, the rate of rate increases is slowing, meaning that the cost of capital is approaching a tighter known quantity, meaning it's less risky to take on margin for institutions. It also means banks can start to loosen up some of their capitalization withholding since the terminal rate is less of an unknown (though I suspect this will be a slow process).\n\nIn other words, even with the Fed doing QT, they're leaving a couple of years of pull forward in the market... so expect the current P/E ratio projections/averages (which are from 2019) to be lower than the market brings them in the future.\n\nNote that chart also implies that average P/E goes up with money supply expansion, so anyone believing money managers using 2019 numbers as \"normal\" is being bamboozled.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "The Molodovsky effect", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Why do you prefer EV/EBITDA over Price/EBITDA\n\n(Even though I’m on this sub, I’m not that regarded, I know EV is market value of equity + net debt)\n\nI just wonder why we should care about net debt when looking at valuations.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It's a better gauge of the total value of a company rather than something like market cap.

With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. \n\nFor some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. \n\nIt's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. \n\nThe plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.\n\n# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle\n\n* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. \n* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. \n* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. \n* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. New price movement may invalidate the original thesis.\n\n# FAQ - Because others have already asked.\n\n* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?\n   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.\n* Are you entering all these plays?\n   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.\n* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?\n   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.\n* Where are the crayons? I only see words. \n   * Click the links above.\n* Have you back-tested this?\n   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)\n* What is the historical performance?\n   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.82 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 58% and 79%.

That right is only worth something if it's meets certain criteria, in the case of markets a certain price.\n\nYou pay for the right to buy or sell something at a certain price. This is different from buying something and the choosing to sell it at a future price. You're given the OPTION to buy/sell at a later time. That option represents a contract you enter into to pay for the right to reserve the OPTION to buy/sell at a future price. You pay up front for that contract. If it does not reach the price you've paid for, then there is no reason to buy/sell because you'd just be losing money. However if it goes beyond the price you've paid the option to buy/sell at you can buy/sell and make the difference between the current price and the price you've agreed to in your initial contract.\n\nThese types of contracts were often used for commodities (think actual physical goods) in order to smooth out prices and help to prevent crazy price shocks (think a drought that totally destroys a wheat crop driving prices up, but you've already agreed ahead of time on a the price you have the right to buy at, effectively insulating you from the price shock). It has since been moved into financial speculation in single stocks and even in commodities often cash settled as well.\n\nThis is different from stock in that you buy at the current price and you own a stake in whatever you've bought. Its a direct ownership position that occurs instantly versus a right to buy/sell at a future date/price. The reason options make so much more money is that they are inherently leveraged due to how they're priced and what they represent. A somewhat equivalent (although not really) would be buying stock on margin (a leveraged position), the difference with option is the leverage is in the instrument itself and you pay for the leverage in the position itself versus taking a loan from someone to buy ownership.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks man, makes more sense.
