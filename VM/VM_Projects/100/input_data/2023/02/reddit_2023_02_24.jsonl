It incorporates the substitution effect and also is more \"apples to oranges\" with GDP as it simply calculates all economic activity regardless of whether people substituted or not.  It is also more comprehensive in a way since it includes things like benefits from your employer. \n From the perspective of monetary policy and growing the economy, it is logical.\n\n>**CPI:**\n\n>However, there is a reason why CPI is popular with the public and feels more accurate to the average person.  It is less flexible and responsive to substitution effects since it compares a basket of goods and services.  PCE is less volatile.  But at the same time, it then better represents our actual *feeling of diminished wealth* from rising prices.  If I love eggs everyday to help me bulk up but can't afford it anymore, I'm going to be pretty frustrated if I have to substitute.  PCE would not reflect this.\n\n>Additionally, CPI is out-of-pocket so while it may be less comprehensive it is also much more in line with how we make decisions.  We may not really notice if medicare or employer provided insurance goes up but we really notice when stuff at the super market, gas station or local stores go up.\n\nPCE (actual spending) accounts better for substitution effects, unlike CPI which compares a basket of goods.  As a result PCE tends to almost always be lower and muted relative to CPI.  But in some ways it poorly reflects reality for how people actually make decisions.

Wall Street had been expecting respective readings of 0.5% and 4.4%.\n\nIncluding the volatile food and energy components, headline inflation increased 0.6% and 5.4% respectively.\n\nMarkets fell following the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average off more than 300 points.\n\nConsumer spending also rose more than expected as prices increased, jumping 1.8% for the month vs. the estimate for 1.4%. Personal income increased 1.4%, higher than the 1.2% estimate. The personal saving rate also was up, rising to 4.7%.\n\nAll of the numbers suggest inflation accelerated to start the new year, putting the Fed in a position where it likely will continue to raise interest rates. The central bank has pushed benchmark rates up by 4.5 percentage points since March 2022 as inflation hit its highest level in some 41 years.\n\nThe Fed follows the PCE measures more closely than it does some of the other inflation metrics because the index adjusts for consumer spending habits, such as substituting lower-priced goods for more expensive ones. That provides a more accurate view of the cost of living.\n\nPolicymakers tend to focus more on core inflation as they believe it provides a better long-run view of inflation, though the Fed officially tracks headline PCE.\n\nMuch of January’s inflation surge came from a 2% rise in energy prices, according to Friday’s report. Food prices increased 0.4%. Goods and services both rose 0.6%.\n\nOn an annual basis, food prices rose 11.1%, while energy was up 9.6%.\n\nEarlier Friday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester noted in a CNBC interview that there has been some progress made but “the level of inflation is still too high.”\n\nA nonvoting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, Mester has been pushing for more aggressive increases. She said she’s not sure if she’ll again advocate for a half percentage point boost at the March FOMC meeting.\n\nIn the wake of Friday’s data, market pricing increased for the likelihood of a half-point, or 50 basis point, increase next month, to about 33%, according to CME Group data.", "id": "11asa0d", "created_utc": 1677247806.0, "score": 933, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 342, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Once people cannot substitute, PCE theoretically becomes worse and closer to CPI.\n\nI'm going to re-post an old comment of mine:\n\n>**PCE:**\n\n>It makes sense for the Fed to use PCE as a measure of inflation and calculating GDP deflators.  It incorporates the substitution effect and also is more \"apples to apples\" with GDP as it simply calculates all economic activity regardless of whether people substituted or not.  It is also more comprehensive in a way since it includes things like benefits from your employer. \n From the perspective of monetary policy and growing the economy, it is logical.\n\n>**CPI:**\n\n>However, there is a reason why CPI is popular with the public and feels more accurate to the average person.  It is less flexible and responsive to substitution effects since it compares a basket of goods and services.  PCE is less volatile.  But at the same time, it then better represents our actual *feeling of diminished wealth* from rising prices.  If I love eggs everyday to help me bulk up but can't afford it anymore, I'm going to be pretty frustrated if I have to substitute.  PCE would not reflect this.\n\n>Additionally, CPI is out-of-pocket so while it may be less comprehensive it is also much more in line with how we make decisions.  We may not really notice if medicare or employer provided insurance goes up but we really notice when stuff at the super market, gas station or local stores go up.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "As I mentioned, also out-of-pocket spending is a big difference as well.

The last film was released right into the midst of a certain global event in 2020, and most theatrical exhibitions of the film were canceled including all of the American showings. I ended up waiting almost 2 years for the Blu-ray to be released in North America. Spoiler: It was worth the wait.  \n\n\nThe various adaptations of Fate franchise properties to animation have been pretty uneven in quality. The best recent adaptation was the F/SN Unlimited Blade Works TV series, also done by ufotable, so there were certain expectations for this film trilogy. And let's not mince words here: ufotable always delivers on their animation quality. The sheer amount of action sequences crammed into the 3 films is matched only by the consistency of the amazing animation work and the dedication of the production teams which worked on them. If you're used to ufotable quality, this is pretty average for them, but compared to most other animation studios it will always be mind blowing tier production values.  \n\n\nThe breathtaking animation quality is matched by the thunderous soundtrack. It defaults to a 2-channel mix but an expanded 5.1 channel track is also available and highly recommended. Yuki Kajiura's wonderful music flows from all channels, and the surround channels are also used aggressively all the time and battles whirl all around you and slam you with deep and floor shaking bass. If you're looking for an example of a reference animated film soundtrack, you've come to the right place. Watch these movies during the day so you can turn them up and rattle your windows without making your neighbors want to kill you afterwards.  \n\n\nThere is a lot of content to cover in roughly 360 minutes of total run time. If aren't already familiar with Fate in some way, shape, or form, the pace of the story leaves no time for voluminous explanations of terminology and lore and you will be completely lost. If you're at least played FGO, well that's something. But ideally you will have watched the previously mentioned UBW TV series, which was much more leisurely paced and provides enough background which will adequately prepare you for the breathless pacing from start to finish with minimal exposition of these films.  \n\n\nHeaven's Feel is by far the bleakest of the 3 routes of F/SN, and the typical ufotable tone and mood combined with the typical Yuki Kajiura soundtrack properly fits the content being adapted here. Quite frankly, HF is really fucking dark, and that's saying a lot in Nasuverse where relentless bleakness is kind of the calling card of the entire franchise. Not much was needed to be censored here either, as it was targeted for theatrical exhibition and so the usual anime TV standards didn't apply. You are free to enjoy copious amounts of blood and gore without having to look over your shoulder at the standards committee.  \n\n\nIf you're a fan of Fate, you've already watched these films. If you're not, well you have to understand that the story will probably be incomprehensible to you unless you have at least prepared in advance with experience in FGO and ideally the UBW TV series. But really, the story isn't that complicated. Boy meets girl, girl has uh issues, something something worms, the girl and the world must be saved. Simple, really.

There's huge societal pressure to fit in and go along and act \"normal\", and basically no one is immune to that pressure. No one rationally chooses to be that different.\n\nAnd as society gets more accepting, we've gotten better at things like not making fun of people for disabilities/injuries/conditions/etc that are our of their control. \n\nMusk doesn't talk about his childhood in much detail except for a few specific ancedotes.

From the interviews I've seen, Elon and Kimbal voluntarily went to live with their dad for educational reasons.  As Mae Musk put it when interviewed by the BBC, she couldn't afford a set of Encyclopedia Britannica, and Errol Musk did have a set.  \n\nElon was relentlessly bullied both by his father and classmates at school.  In one interview, Kimbal said that Elon looked like he'd lost a boxing match after a gang shoved Elon down a flight of stairs and then kicked him repeatedly while he was unconscious.

A lot of the stories about Elon's early life come from one or two quotes, sometimes it's just outright speculation, and sometimes they're from unreliable sources. But I remember Mae saying this in the recent BBC series:\n\n> What happened was that Elon's dad had most of the money and many of the books that Elon was interested in reading.\n\nI believe I read a different account, probably in the Ashley Vance biography? That when his mom left and went to Canada she took the kids, but Musk stayed behind with his dad because even though he wanted to leave he felt bad that his dad would be all alone. Again, I'm not 100% I'm recalling that exactly correctly, but I remember reading that explanation that seemed to come from Musk directly.\n\nI'd guess that what happened is that Mae maybe didn't believe or didn't like that explanation, or had never even heard it, and the \"Errol had books\" explanation was just easier to attribute to a child, especially decades after the fact.\n\n> So it wouldn't surprise me if the bullying pushed him to be even stranger.\n\nYeah, that's not an unreasonable possibility. What really bothers me is that being \"strange\" is OK if you're a regular working joe. But if you're rich, then being strange is viewed as a problem that you should be able to fix, or at the very least you should have the resources to put on a public face that seems \"normal\".\n\nAnd then supposedly \"tolerant\" people on the left will use terms like \"emotionally stunted\" as an insult for people they don't like, like Musk. And again, I don't have any insider info, and I don't want to jump to conclusions, but let's just say there's a hypothetical where you have someone famous who did have a traumatic childhood and is emotionally stunted because of it. I don't see how anyone who's kind or empathetic would feel OK using that as an insult just because they disagreed on some topic. Like, that's a fucked up thing to say, no matter how much money someone's worth.
