You cannot \"buy\" a CC. Even if you buy the shares at the same time as you open the call (a buy-write), you still *sold to open* the call option.\n\nYou can say \"I sold to open a CC ...\" or a little more old-fashioned, \"I wrote a CC ...\".\n\nIs there a reason you are keeping the ticker symbol a secret? Describing the full trade details (quantity, ticker, strike, put or call, expiration, debit/credit at open in per-share dollars) helps people understand the trade and dig into it independently for further insights.\n\n> (own 100 shares at $305.02\n\nExcellent! This is a detail that too many people leave out of their questions, so kudos for including the cost basis of the shares.\n\n> But if call goes ITM at strike by 2/17 and shares are called away, do I profit premium and price difference of shares owned & strike price.\n\nThis isn't quite right. For European-style options, this is not a possibility until expiration. For American-style options, technically it is possible for an ITM short call to be assigned when the contract goes ITM before expiration. If we knew the ticker we could inform you whether or not it was American or European style.\n\nBut even though technically possible, it rarely happens, because early exercise almost always loses money for the exerciser. So why should they purposely lose money when they don't have to?\n\nSo you should say, \"if the call is ITM on or near expiration day 2/17\". And by near I mean the day before. The probability of early assignment falls off rapidly from 2 days or more before expiration, in most cases.\n\n> $315-305.02= $9.98 × 100 = $998 from scalp away plus premium?\n\nNot sure what you mean by \"scalp away\", but effectively yes.\n\n* Your shares are called away at 315/share. So you receive $31,500 in cash, less fees.\n\n* You keep the original 2.06/share in credit, so the $206 you already got.\n\nNote that if the shares were actually worth 320 at the time of expiration, you don't get any of the extra $5/share.

When entering a bear call spread (aka call credit spread), the credit collected is your max profit. You pointed out that if your spread expires OTM you keep the full credit which is true!

It seems like you did 1 contract so that’s $135.\n\n2. In your current state where you are thinking of closing the spread for $2.69, you would lose $0.04 on that trade. Remember you collected a credit (think of it like taking a short position in a stock) so you want to buy back the spread at a lower price, that’s what you pocket the difference. In your example of expiring OTM, that spread would be worth 0.00 so you would keep the entire credit. \n\n3. Closing that spread and opening a new spread higher, is a new trade. I think you might be referring to trying to defend this position (and not rolling it vertically) which would mean selling a bull put spread (put credit spread) to collect more credit and get a better break even. FYI if you do this, you now have risk to the downside if the stock goes lower than your break even on the put spread. \n\n4.

I bought the 17Feb 407C for 5.28 and sold 17Feb 403C for 7.93. So I got $265 credit\n\n\nThat is an unusually high net credit for a credit spread that was opened when both legs were OTM. Anything above $.50 per dollar of width is pretty near impossible. Your spread is $.66 per dollar of width!\n\nWhat was SPY at the time you opened the spread? Were both legs OTM as they should have been, or was one leg ITM? That's the only explanation I can think of for why your net credit was so high.\n\nFor example, if SPY was 405 at the time, the 403 short leg would be ITM while the 407 long leg would be OTM.\n\nFor future reference, credit spreads ought to be opened with both legs OTM, and the short leg ought to be close to 30 delta. So if SPY was 405, a more typical $4 wide call credit spread would have been 410/414c, with the 410 being the short call. The equivalent of that spread as of Friday's close paid $.93 credit total, or $.23 per dollar of width. \n\nSee the problem? If $.23 is typical, but you got $.66, something is very wrong.\n\n> I am less clear about what happens if they expire somewhere in between (let’s say 405) and how I would close the contracts.\n\nDon't let that happen! In the first place, don't hold any options to expiration, period. In the second place, if the expiration price is between the legs of your spread, you will be in deep financial trouble.\n\nIn your example, the 403 SPY short call will be assigned. You will receive $40,300 in cash and you will be short 100 shares of SPY for an unrealized loss of $2/share. If SPY continues to go up, you will have an uncapped risk of loss for as long as you hold the short shares. If SPY gaps up $10/share on the Monday after, you'll be liable for a $41,500 in cash to cover. Worse, the 407 SPY long call will expire worthless, so the insurance it was supposed to provide for the risk of being assigned on the short call will be gone.\n\nYou close the spread by buying to close the entire spread as a whole. Did you not open the spread as a whole, in a single order? That might be another explanation for the outsized credit, if you legged into the spread over time instead of opening it in a single order.\n\n> Assuming I can fill these positions, I can close these contracts for $269, four dollars more than what i paid. \n\nImpossible. You'll never get filled for those prices. And now I'm even more convinced you legged into this spread instead of opening it all at once.\n\nWhen SPY goes up, a credit spread *loses money*. Unless some kind of very unusual IV skew happens, there is no way you are going to get more money in closing after SPY goes up, if you close the spread as a whole. If you try to leg out, there is still no guarantee you can get those fill prices.\n\nWhere are you getting those prices in the first place?

The rules for binary options are completely different than for standard options, so you'd have to understand those different rules to interpret the discussion.\n\nBut lets assume for the sake of argument that these are standard puts. The 14000 strike is quite far OTM from the spot price of BTC around 21700. If the market was expecting the price of BTC to go lower, the value of 14000 puts should go higher. Now normally we'd look at the IV of a standard put, rather than the delta, to see if the market is anticipating further declines, but since IV and delta are related, there is some merit in looking at where that 14000 strike falls in delta. The delta should be higher than one might expect for such an OTM put.\n\nSo I think the point being made is that, since delta is *not* unusually high -- 14 seems about right for a put that far OTM -- the market is *not* expecting further declines.

The announcement confirms CNBC’s prior reporting. Bard will compete directly with rival ChatGPT, an AI service created by OpenAI.\n\nBard is powered by the company’s large language model LaMDA, or Language Model for Dialogue Applications. Google will open up the conversation technology to “trusted testers” ahead of making it more widely available to the public, the company said in a blog post Monday.\n\nLast week, CNBC reported that Google is testing some of these features with employees as part of a “code red” plan to respond to ChatGPT, the popular chatbot backed in part by Microsoft. Features included a chatbot called “Apprentice Bard,” as well as new search desktop designs that could be used in a question-and-answer format.\n\n“Soon, you’ll see AI-powered features in Search that distill complex information and multiple perspectives into easy-to-digest formats, so you can quickly understand the big picture and learn more from the web: whether that’s seeking out additional perspectives, like blogs from people who play both piano and guitar, or going deeper on a related topic, like steps to get started as a beginner,” wrote CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nThe company gave an example of using Bard to simplify complex topics, like explaining new discoveries from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope to a 9-year-old.\n\nThe product tests come after a recent all-hands meeting where employees raised concerns about the company’s competitive edge in AI, given the sudden popularity of ChatGPT.\n\nCNBC reported that Google’s AI chief, Jeff Dean, told employees at the time that the company has much more “reputational risk” in providing wrong information and thus is moving “more conservatively than a small startup.” However, he and Pichai teased at the time that Google may launch similar products to the public sometime this year.\n\nGoogle’s prime business is web search, and the company has long touted itself as a pioneer in AI. Leaders have been asking more employees for feedback on the efforts in recent weeks.\n\nThe company emphasized Monday that it will need rigorous testing, saying “we’ll combine external feedback with our own internal testing to make sure Bard’s responses meet a high bar for quality, safety and groundedness in real-world information.”", "id": "10vikbb", "created_utc": 1675718450.0, "score": 1680, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 461, "comments": [{"body": "Maybe we will have front row seats for the A.I. civil war?

It's their biggest profit driver by far.\n\n2) It's very easy to see how these AI's will start to cannibalize the search market in the medium to long term as their accuracy/etc. improves overtime and it becomes a better product.\n\nSo basically, even if Google wins the market and crushes ChatGPT and other competitors, they could still end up losing big overall. These factors are even worse when you consider a few other things: \n\n* It's been stated that each ChatGPT query consumes significantly more resources then a single search engine query (I've seen articles stating that it's as much 60 times the average search query), meaning it's much more expensive to run then a search engine. Odds are very good that anything Google creates will have this problem as well.\n\n* There seem to be much more limited ways of monetizing this technology. Google Search can sell ads to appear at the top of the search results for certain queries, but ChatGPT type products can't really do that so well. And for as long as the market remains competitive the players are going to be especially limited in how many ads they can try to stuff into these AI's. Because if people feel that Bard or ChatGPT are just constantly shilling advertiser's products then they'll go elsewhere.\n\nBottom line, regardless of who wins in this AI battle, it DOESN'T mean that the winner will be a good investment.

So senior mgmt kept shooting it down as the \"business case\" is not powerful enough.\n\nBut now they got massively embarrassed by a startup and have to do damage control.

I said that for some reason, Google has been unable to bring any breakthrough AI service to the masses the way ChatGpt did.\n\nThat's what they have to hide. Now you can argue that it was because their product managers could not make a sufficiently compelling business case to operationalize any of these \"AI as a service\" services, or the reason was something else or whatever.\n\nThat doesn't change the facts themselves. Which is that Google has not operationalized any AI As A Service that is highly visible to consumers and has the kind of mindshare as ChatGpt. You can make excuses like \"they wanted to verify the accuracy\" or \"they wanted to protect their reputation\" etc but those are just excuses. There are standard ways to caveat this kind of stuff - companies would normally call them experimental features or Alpha/Beta features or Google Labs features. And Jesus Christ, they've had a decade to figure this out!\n\nLike i said, i honestly think the blunt truth is that Google makes such a boatload of money from ad sales, it has probably become super difficult for them to see commercial value in any of this stuff as it doesn't give them the same shovel loads of cash right away or even in the near future.

{"title": "Alibaba LEAPS (1,500%+ Potential Return)", "selftext": "# Severe Mispricing in Alibaba Long Equity Anticipation Securities (LEAPS)\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide an argument for the purchase of LEAPS in Alibaba. I will justify this trade by demonstrating that the aforementioned tranches create an abnormally favorable risk/reward profile due to Alibaba’s unreasonably low valuation, which will be demonstrated by financial analysis, an analysis of all the major risks to the value of the underlying security, and an analysis of growth factors due to macroeconomic as well as company-specific factors. Additionally, low implied volatility further improves the risk/reward profile. In recent years, options have become tightly associated with gambling. This paper, however, will show that purchasing these LEAPS are not a gamble, but rather an investment; that is, unlike in gambling, where the expected value is almost always negative, I believe the likelihood of gain far exceeds the likelihood of loss, in spite of potential returns exceeding 1,000%, and losses being capped at 100%. This paper can be used to formulate a concentrated bet on Alibaba that mitigates risk by risking less capital than a much larger purchase in the underlying security (which would be necessary to have the same potential gains).\n\n# Thesis Distilled Into Actionable Information:\n\nA fair value estimate of Alibaba’s current share price, using conservative inputs, visualized below, yields a price of **$294.33 per share**.\n\nIn order to ameliorate the risk of this model being overly rosy, or unforeseen problems, I will discount 25% from my simplified intrinsic value calculation when choosing the strike price for LEAPS. On the flipside, contracts will only be sold when the share price reaches 25% above the fair value estimate, or otherwise held until expiration.\n\nStrike Price: \\~$220.75\n\nExit Price: \\~$367.91\n\nContract Price: $953.00\n\nContract Value at Exit Price: $15,000\n\nP/L: 1,474%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**19th Dec 2025 $220**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/capjwyuykgga1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=f940bd8aba641d449ec04e52e9fd139a6d84b7fa\n\n## \n\n# Revenue\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/utrb7w9zkgga1.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff72165e10a23b085f749a9ea353febad4765fa9\n\n# \n\nAlibaba’s revenue, visualized above, has grown dramatically over the past decade. In fact, since 2014, the year of its IPO, Alibaba’s revenue has grown from $7.7B USD annually to an impressive $125.8B USD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0bxp1kt0lgga1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e791d23238618e46be811bf607c2690b30bd2ef\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn spite of its revenue increasing 16x in this period, its stock price, which more than doubled initially, has meandered back down to a price only 2.7% above its November 2014 high. An undiscerning investor might argue that this increase in revenue, as well as the downstream improvements on earnings and other financial metrics it caused, was priced into the stock (i.e. investors expected this increase, and therefore it is sensible for the stock price to remain relatively unchanged). My refutation to this is simple–no reasonable investor could possibly expect any company to grow this much, this quickly. Instead, the enormous discrepancy in price between 2014 and 2022 says one of two things–that Alibaba was dramatically overvalued in 2014, or Alibaba is dramatically undervalued today. The first case, quite simply, is absurd. If valuations in 2014 were overvalued to the extent that a 16x increase in revenue was priced into the stock, then the 2020 highs of over $300/share would represent extreme mania. The rest of this paper is to prove that the latter case is the correct one.\n\n# Earnings\n\nIn the analysis of Alibaba’s earnings, I should first begin by examining the earnings of the past five years and create a price to earnings ratio that corresponds to the average net income in this time period. This smooths out the effect of one-off expenses or windfalls, as well as any variables that may affect earnings temporarily without affecting the overall outlook of the company.\n\nHistorical Data\n\n5 Year Average Net Income: 15.4B\n\n5 Year Average EPS (Current Share Price): $5.82\n\nP/E (Avg 5y Earnings) = 20.34\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyqfi5g3ngga1.png?width=1350&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6085f9f7c90b0df93cfc2d5686a1bb43cc4769b\n\n## Future Analysis\n\nOn average, analysts forecast that Alibaba’s EPS will be $6.32 for 2023, with the lowest EPS forecast at $5.83, and the highest EPS forecast at $6.81. On average, analysts forecast that BABA's EPS will be $7.03 for 2024, with the lowest EPS forecast at $6.60, and the highest EPS forecast at $7.47. In 2025, BABA's EPS is forecast to hit $8.56 (min: $8.13, max: $8.99).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4qrhog4lgga1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f264238d1441f85901dc18ea66c26c7e480ecc\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAlibaba total assets for the quarter ending September 30, 2022 totaled $240.746B.\n\nAlibaba total liabilities for the quarter ending September 30, 2022 totaled $89.941B.\n\nAlibaba book value = $51.01 / share\n\nAlibaba has accumulated $74.2B in cash–this could be deployed in numerous ways that are beneficial to shareholders.\n\nAlibaba Stock Buybacks:\n\n* Were Alibaba to use its entire $74.2B cash hoard in order to buyback stock, it could buy back 23.7% of the stock, reducing its P/E (Past 5 years) to 15.52, it’s P/E (Future 3y) to 12.34, and it’s P/E (2025) to 10.55\n\nAlibaba–with all its associated infrastructure, intellectual property, assets, employees, goodwill, established brands, and existing businesses, has an earning potential that is valued at its current stock price less the book value (liquidation value). In other words, Alibaba’s ability to generate profits indefinitely into the future is being valued by the market at $67.37/share x 2.65B shares =\n\n$178.34B\n\n# Benjamin Graham Formula\n\nThe Benjamin Graham Formula is a formula used for the valuation of growth stocks. Based on the study of various methods, Graham suggested the formula as a foreshortened and simple way to produce figures fairly close to those resulting from more refined mathematical calculations. The formula is as follows:\n\nV\\*=EPS (8.5+2g)\n\nWhere\n\nV\\*= the value expected from the growth formulas\n\nEPS = trailing twelve months earning per share\n\n8.5 = P/E base for a no growth company\n\ng = reasonably expected 7 to 10 year growth rate\n\nImplementing the appropriate values from Alibaba’s financials, we get\n\nV\\*=$6.32 (8.5+2(15))\n\nV\\*=$243.32 / Share\n\nAlibaba Book Value = $51.01 / Share\n\nPresent Value = V\\* + Book Value = $294.33 / Share\n\n# Risks\n\n## Delisting\n\nOne of the biggest fears surrounding Alibaba is the possibility of it being delisted from the NYSE. There are two parties that could hypothetically cause this to happen. The first party is Chinese regulators. China has forced companies to delist in the past (DIDI) due to the fear of data breaches. This shouldn’t be a major concern for shareholders of Alibaba, as delisting seems unlikely given the China-U.S. audit agreement which has already been carried out without rumor of auditing issues. Additionally, even if China did force Alibaba to delist, shares would be available OTC and on the Hong Kong exchange. As a result, options contracts can still be executed, and shares purchased at the strike price can be sold OTC or converted to Hong Kong shares at their full value.\n\nRecently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced that it had concluded its audit review of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. By all accounts, the review went well. The SEC completed its work ahead of schedule, indicating that the inspections went smoothly. Today, the PCAOB further announced that it had received good access to Chinese companies’ books after “thorough and systematic testing.” It’s impossible to say for sure that the total review went well (there’s more to audits than just \"accessing\" things), but the swift conclusion and glowing comments suggest that the SEC is about to hand investors some good news.\n\n## Regulation\n\nWhat started with Alibaba founder Jack Ma publicly criticizing Chinese regulators, turned into a year-long “tech crackdown,” or at least what the business media has portrayed as such. Between Ant’s planned IPO getting stymied and it being forced to restructure in line with the CCP agenda , to the 2.8 billion-dollar USD anti-monopoly fine Alibaba was given, Alibaba’s market cap has fallen over 60% from a high of over $800 billion USD in October 2020 to recent lows of just over $300 billion.\n\nThe goal of the crackdown is to promote common prosperity, ensure data security, and stopping monopolistic practices. Although hurting Alibaba’s bottom line (and share price) temporarily, a lot of what the CCP is doing may actually benefit the Chinese people, and ultimately may end up helping Alibaba grow long term. Moreover, Alibaba has been taking steps to try and please the CCP, including pledging $15.5 billion USD to the common prosperity goals, changing monopolistic behavior, and attempting to sell their Weibo stake to a state-owned company.\n\nThe risks from the CCP are real, and while there have been whispers that the crackdown is easing in 2023, no one can know for certain what the CCP will implement day to day. These risks are included in my valuation of Alibaba by adjusting cash flows as necessary.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe scale advantage of being the largest player in the ecommerce market has become more and more apparent in countries like the U.S. with Amazon, making ecommerce appear to be a winner takes all game. This fact can be attributed to the following reasons, among others: the platform that sells the most will almost always have the lowest price; the platform that sells the most will almost always have the lowest logistics cost; the more sales you have, the more you can invest in software; the more scale you have, the more variety of products you will have. The somewhat lopsided ecommerce market share distribution in China reflects the idea that the advantages that come along with scale results in fewer, more dominant companies- in 2021, Alibaba had a 47.1% share of the ecommerce market in China, compared to JD.com with a 16.9% share and Pinduodu have a 13.2 % share. The following table shows the top 6 companies in China, ranked by retail e-commerce sales, 2019-2022:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4w5o71p6lgga1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8cb43b622f6795379ade194bc48f7670fc2a53\n\nOfcourse, ecommerce appearing to be a winner takes all market and Alibaba’s as of yet dominant market share does not necessarily entail that Alibaba will be the monolithic giant that emerges from the Chinese ecommerce market. Rather, it reveals two important facts that are almost equally compelling to an investor: Alibaba has room to grow, and it holds significant advantages in doing so.\n\nWhere the analogy between U.S. and Chinese ecommerce markets fails is that in China, there seems to be a more democratized access to logistics platforms. Whereas in the US, Amazon does not open up these capabilities to competition, Cainiao, the Alibaba-owned smart logistics network that does more than 50% of all package deliveries in China, has opened up their logistics platform to other eCommerce players. Consequently, the investments they make into providing fast, same day or next day delivery to most Chinese cities can be leveraged by many other players. However, although Alibaba will open up their Cainiao network to other competitors, they price it, and financial analysts believe they will do so differently, thus implying that Alibaba can retain its dominance on its own terms. So, in any case, the ‘whale’ may very well pull away here too, eventually.\n\nIt’s worth going into more detail how Alibaba fairs against JD.com, its largest competitor in China. JD.com is a direct-sales retailer that uses a model similar to Amazon. In contrast to Alibaba's ecommerce model, JD.com warehouses, markets, and ships merchandise directly to Chinese consumers through its national shipping network, which includes a last-mile delivery component throughout much of the nation. With direct control over its supply chain, JD.com has developed a reputation for authentic products and reliable, fast shipping. Alibaba, on the other hand, has long battled an association with counterfeit goods among both domestic and international customers and brand owners. To address these concerns, Alibaba established a dual operation strategy by creating two platforms, Taobao and Tmall, Taobao being a platform for small vendors, and Tmall being a platform exclusively for major brands.\n\nNot only has Alibaba closed in on JD.com’s reputational advantage, but in its growth has has created various other significant edges of its own. The first is that Alibaba has significantly higher margins than JD.com. The second, Alibaba is a much more diversified company. While JD.com’s sole focus has been ecommerce, Alibaba receives significant revenue streams from Alipay, its online payment platform, and Aliyun, its cloud computing platform. The third, Alibaba has been much more successful in international markets. Alibaba’s preeminence in the cloud and international markets allows it to compensate for potentially slower growth in Chinese commerce.\n\nTo go into more detail about how the two companies square up, it's useful to look more closely at the financial indicators of both companies.

Chat GPT [Passes Medical License Exam, Bar Exam.](https://www.dailywire.com/news/chatgpt-passes-medical-license-exam-bar-exam-after-top-performance-on-wharton-mba-final) It will write papers, code, problem solve, strategize for you - you name it. 1 programmer who knows LLMs is worth 4 programmers who don't; learn to use them, or get left in the dust.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9jfmnj1bcrga1.png?width=1579&format=png&auto=webp&s=18f79ea9d35dd3cfcf76749b9893f6b8ff6fa5d6\n\nBut the most obvious, pressing issue is with “get some poor asian kid on the other side of the world to do your homework for you” Chegg. This company has not sufficiently prepared for the reckoning.\n\nI've used Chat GPT for my own Computer Organization & Architecture HW and Computer Science HW (as a learning tool \\*wink\\*). It's an amazing, versatile tool if you put sufficient details in the prompt, whiiiiiich is why it’s superior to Chegg.\n\nIt can solve problems that haven't even been added to their database yet - like concerning new assignments or material from new professors. You can also ask it to elaborate and explain certain problem-solving steps, which Chegg cannot provide if there's only one solution uploaded - you've got as much as the poor asian kid decided to write down 💀\n\n[College students](https://news.yahoo.com/millions-college-students-chegg-professors-100045093.html) are the most significant demographic of Chegg, and the competition of free vs. $15/mo for generally low cash flow customers is a no brainer.

To see why, just do the combinations 100 choose 1 + 100 choose 1+... twenty times right.  The chances of that set of numbers in the summation being in the training data goes to zero.

That is fundamentally different from e.g. calculation, as has been discussed in the context of how ChatGPT is bad at math.  It's also fundamentally different from logic and context... and that is a bit less easy to solve than bolting on Wolfram Alpha.  These models are heavily linked with their training data and face similar issues with generalizing that the computer vision models for driving do.  It will become more apparent to you as you use the models more.  You will find yourself spending more and more time checking the model outputs... to the point where it takes more time to check what the model spat out than to just do it right yourself from the start.  Sooner or later people are going to realize that this isn't changing the world, it's not going to change much of anything... maybe search just a little bit, but not even that much.

You can see that on Jason Turner's C++ Weekly where he gave it a very flattering showing.  It didn't do so hot when I asked it to use a less popular library, it was also pretty insistent on using immediate mode for OpenGL...  bizarre use of an internal library constant from htslib... I think it copied that bit out of the Rust interface code for the library.Many of the \"constraints\" are NOT restricting the model's potential, many of them effectively amount to censoring wrong outputs, which makes the model appear much more flattering.

Not that I don't have colleagues high on the hype train.  They'll come down from it eventually, they're always hyped like that over the newest models and they regularly fail to outperform old techniques in my area.  Freaking XGboost is failing to outperform simple heuristics in my field.  Not on training data, beautiful there, loss heads right for zero.  Not on validation data, you do parameter tuning and you'll find something that generalizes well to that.  But moving to from validation to real world testing in independent data... performance drops below that of the heuristic.  I'm only picking on ChatGPT this much because the hype is so high.  Several of the issues and reasons it isn't going to \"change everything\" are general to ML models, and just modeling in general.  More recent ML models also fail to outperform decades old Markov Chain models on other problems in my field.
