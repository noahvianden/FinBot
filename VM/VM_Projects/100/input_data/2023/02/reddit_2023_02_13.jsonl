The $49 costs $1.50 and the $50 costs $.50, so their breakevens are the same.\n\nIf you buy the $49 call with 30 days to expiration and on the very next day it goes up by $.50 in premium value, you made 33% on that call ($1.50 to $2.00), right?\n\nBut if you buy the $50 call with 30 days to expiration and on the very next day it also goes up by $.50 in premium value, **you just made 100% on that call ($.50 to $1.00).**\n\nIsn't 100% better than 33%? \n\nClearly, the $50 call gives you a better rate of return for the same change in premium value.

WOW THAT'S MORE THAN I MADE THIS YEAR TRADING STOCKS LET ME BUY YOUR PROGRAM.\n\nBut they're not saying 200% NET GAIN ON THEIR ACCOUNT.  They're saying 200% on a small trade.  So who cares?  You make 200% on a $100 trade on a $50,000 account.  Who cares  That's < 0.5%, which is not 200%.  I'm not saying you make these claims, btw, I'm selling option vendors do.  The massive percentage gains are nonsense because they're not TOTAL gains, they're single trade gains.\n\nAnyway back to the example, you can buy ONE $1.50 contract for $150 or you can buy THREE $0.50 contract for $150.\n\nBut that $1.50 contract has a larger delta so you're not really making 3x more.\n\nPlus, both of those contracts wouldn't go up by $0.50 on the same day.  That doesn't even make sense.  Why would different strikes profit equally?  No one would buy more expensive options then.  Why risk $150 to make $50 when you can risk $50 to make $50 BECAUSE THEY'RE PROFITING EQUALLY (but that's wrong).\n\nThe point I'm trying to make was that, if price is $50, and I think it's going to be $52, it doesn't really matter which option I buy, because they all break even at $50.50 anyway.  Yes, some are more expensive and make more money, some are cheaper and make less money, but for a fixed amount I want to spend, there's not much difference really.  You can buy the same dollar value of $1.50 calls or $0.50 calls and make similar amounts, so 100% on $50 or 33% on $1.50 are the same, because you made $50.\n\nYes, I understand \"don't hold options until expiration.\"  But they're all based on the same price anyway. TBH I'm the worst at buying options anyway.  I really only sell them to lock in gains or to build a position.  I literally don't understand the way to use options anyway, because they all seem to be based on the same price, and I'm more concerned with knowing what you can do with that price, like why is it THAT price and not a different price  Do the people who price the options know something we don't?  If the stock price is whatever and every single option has a break even of $50.50; what does that mean about $50.50?  Does that mean everyone's going to freak out if price gets to $50.50?  Does that mean a rally is coming or a dip?  Is price more or less likely to be $50.50 as opposed to something else?  My point was it sucks though if I think price is going to be something other than that price, what if price is $48 and I think it's going to become $50... but wait a second every option is breakeven at $50.50.  So $50 means no profit unless there's somehow some volatility in my favor (once I bought an option and it dipped hard but price went up because of volatility so I sold).  Now, if I think price will get to 60 then I have no opinion, I'll buy whatever, factoring how much I want to spend, so 1 of the $1.50 or 3 of the $0.50s, it's the same, the percentages are nonsense when you compare an options against the others.  100% of 50 is the same as 33% of 150 so this argument doesn't even make sense.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Plus, both of those contracts wouldn't go up by $0.50 on the same day.

Make sure you set the bottom part Chart Style to table (left icon) and the Chart Values to $ Profit/Loss.\n\nYou will see green profit numbers for prices below the breakeven of $2.25 and for several days before expiration, and if SNDL is 2.10 on Feb 26 and then goes up to 2.20 on Mar 2, the call gains $5 (0.05, from 5 to 10 in the chart). SNDL stays below breakeven but rises $.10 over a few days, so the calls gain value. Hopefully that's proof enough that theta decay can be overcome by the stock increasing in value, even though it is below the breakeven and without requiring crazy volatility.\n\nhttp://opcalc.com/QFa", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hi, yes I've used that site before.\n\nThanks for replying to all my responses.\n\nHere is another example.

But we can make it an options question by relating it to the volatility of option contracts.\n\nAn option on a high beta stock will usually also have high volatility itself. That is because the value of an option is proportional to the price of the underlying, as specified by delta.\n\nHowever, it is also possible for an option contract to have *more* volatility than the underlying. This is a consequence of how **time value** is represented in option prices.\n\nAs to what makes the underlying volatile, there could be a number of reasons, but they basically boil down to one thing: uncertainty. The more uncertainty there is about the future price of the stock, the more volatility there will be, particularly if the uncertainty translates into a wide range of future prices. If part of the market thinks XYZ (currently $200 share) will go up $100 in a month, while another part of the market thinks it will drop $100 in a month, and there are various other parts of the market that think up $69 or down $23, or up $72, or down $96, etc., etc., the more volatility the stock will have.\n\nNow compare to a boring low volatility/low beta stock like an electric utility. It's also $200 a share, but for the last 50 years, it's one year range of average prices barely goes +/- $1. For a whole year.

They may or may not apply to NVDA vs. AMD, but you be the judge:\n\n* Hype and market sentiment. That's what drives meme stock volatility, so why not tech stocks?\n\n* Where the business is on the growth curve. AMD has been around for a very long time. NVDA is like a baby in comparison. Growth companies that are in the earlier part of their growth curve will be more volatile.\n\n* AMD has more of its business in low margin/commodity tech, while NVDA has more of its business in high margin/luxury items. High margin businesses often have more volatility, if there is either an on-going threat to that business from competition or disruptors, or if they screw up and shoot their own business in the foot (I'm looking at you OG 3080 RTX and the 3090 cable connector fire risk debacle). They have more to lose, so they collect more factions of the market that bet bearish.\n\n* Dependence/sensitivity to externalities, like China fabs getting locked down. Huge source of uncertainty, and though it may hit them both, again if NVDA has a higher dependency as a percentage of the business, it will whipsaw in price more.\n\n* Interest rate sensitivity. If NVDA has more debt and more expensive debt than AMD, that could be a source of volatility. Though I'd guess AMD is likely to have more debt that NVDA, since debt tends to grow with age of the company. I could be wrong, though.\n\nYou can figure out some of these things by comparing a recent quarterly or annual report for each of them side-by-side.\n\nIn general, I think it is a mistake to think of AMD and NVDA as similar companies, just because they compete on graphics cards.

The more you spend (on delta), the higher your probability of profit, but also the more money you put at risk of loss.\n\nSo the optimal solution needs to incorporate (a) how much you can afford (available cash), (b) your risk tolerance, and (c) your desired [expected value](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result). Consideration of opportunity cost should also be incorporated.\n\n> I'd like to buy some leap puts on META, perhaps Jan or Mar 2024.\n\nTrying to capture a decline with a wide net (LEAPS put) is a very tough game to win at. Stocks in general follow a stairs up/elevator down pattern. Declines are sharp and relatively short lived, compared to, for example, the last bull market that lasted 10 years.\n\nYour win rate increases if you can narrow down the window of time for the decline to a single month.\n\nIf you can't do that, you end up paying for time value that doesn't do anything for you, except contribute to your loss. The longer the period of time between when you open and when the decline happens, the more you lose to time value, even if the daily rate is low. Losing $.30/day for 200 days is a bigger loss than losing $1.50/day for 30 days.\n\nTo cast a wide net for an expected loss, it's probably more cost effective to sell shares short. There's no expiration on a short share position and no time decay. But there is risk of a margin call if there is a rally between when you open and when the decline ultimately happens.\n\nNo solution is perfect when knowledge of the future is imperfect.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'd like to piggyback off this question with a simpler one: what are the options trading strategies if I want to make a medium term bet on the direction of a stock (say I believe that AAPL will increase 10% in the next 60 days)? In terms of risk/return, how does this options strategy compare to simply using leverage to buy the stock?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> what are the options trading strategies if I want to make a medium term bet on the direction of a stock (say I believe that AAPL will increase 10% in the next 60 days)?\n\nOne of the advantages of trading options for this kind of opportunity is that you get to pick where you want to land in various trade-offs, like cost vs. time and risk vs. reward. There are dozens of strategies that you could use to exploit that opportunity, each with slightly different risk/reward or time/cost trade-offs (among others).\n\nTo offer just four very different examples, to give you a sense for how broad the choices are:\n\n1. Buy a 90 days to expiration call ATM. The 90 days makes sure the window of time for the 10% increase is covered well before expiration becomes an issue, and ATM balances risk/reward pretty evenly. Drawback is that if the increase takes the full 60 days, you will lose some value to theta decay.\n\n1. For the same cost as #1, buy 10 calls that are 90 days to expiration that are far OTM. Going far OTM increases your leverage, 10x in this case, since you were able to buy 10 contracts for the price of one from #1. However, the trade-off is that the probability of profit for each individual call is much lower, probably more than 10x lower.\n\n1. Buy a 5 days to expiration call ATM and roll it on expiration day until you reach your 10% increase goal. The nearer expiration drastically reduces the cost of the call, and rolling lets you fine tune the timing of target price, at the cost of possibly a lot of rolls being money down the drain. Instead of paying for an extra 30 days of padding from #1 to capture the whole 60 day window, you instead incrementally sneak up on the increase until it is achieved, then exit. Assuming the timing of the increase is in the early half of the 60 day window, this could end up saving you a ton of money without giving up on any upside. However, the drawback is that if the 10% increase takes the full 60 days to realize, you could end up spending more money on rolling calls that expire worthless than if you just bought the one call from #1.\n\n1. Sell a naked short put at 30 delta OTM and 60 days to expiration. In this case, theta decay works in your favor (compared to #1), but the drawback is that your upside is capped. You can't earn more than the opening credit after AAPL goes up. However, you can lose more than you risked in #1, if AAPL goes down so much that the cost of buying back the put is greater than the cost of the call in #1.\n\nI've barely scratched the surface for possibilities. All of the above are single-legged structures. I didn't even get into multi-leg, of which there are many.\n\n> In terms of risk/return, how does this options strategy compare to simply using leverage to buy the stock?\n\nThe cost structure for leverage is different. To leverage stock, you have to take out a margin loan, which has an on-going cost of carry. To leverage with an option, you can just buy an OTM call and all of the cost is up front and fixed.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much! This is so detailed and helpful.

I believe it was Porsche that had been spearheading development of a clean synthetic fuel in the back ground. As well as talk and study of breaking down plastics into combustible fuels. Which I'd argue benefits us better than any EV could. Beyond that, EV is very harsh in several ways. The battery production alone produces harmful emissions that can be worse than what fossil fuels let out due to the acidity content. This comes from the mining process and so on. Furthermore, the electricity being used doesn't exactly come from clean energy sources either.

A small vehicle cast as a single piece may not require much in the way of batteries to get the desired range, making the range penalty for the extra weight less of a concern than the manufacturing efficiencies gained.\n2. The thermals and the reliability of the 4680's may be so good (especially as we look forward a couple of years... see the Limiting Factor videos discussing the thermal characteristics of the 4680's to better understand what I am talking about here) that perhaps you can cast the pan the batteries go in in a single piece and use very thin-walled 4680's reducing the excess weight involved.\n3. Consider also size of the vehicle may dictate that you need more and more structure to stabilize things so a small vehicle the mechanics involved might mean that there is not much of a weight penalty doing it this way.\n4. Safety wise, I would think you would cast the pan part facing downwards and then have a robot flip over the whole structure and you insert the batteries that way before flipping over to complete the build.\n5. if the whole bottom part is a single structure and is sufficiently stiff enough (with a small frame this may be possible) you may be able to build up much of the interior of the car before attaching the top part of the frame and panels enabling further manufacturing efficiencies. If this is going to be for a robo-taxi, no one will care if such a process results in larger panel gaps.\n\nUltimately I would suggest you were thinking about this from an analogous way of thinking (i.e. on battery day we were told structural packs are the future so an independent structure must therefore be assumed to be bad) then from a first principles way of thinking which says to heck with the rule we just made up a few years ago as maybe it is wrong (or at least wrong in this instance).\n\nIt is possible also that you are correct, but I am speculating that there are a lot more possibilities here where choosing the correct development path (this is where Elon makes a world of a difference as compared to pretty much everyone else) may be the difference between having the most successful vehicle in history versus wasting years on the wrong thing.\n\nPersonally I am excited for March 1rst as Tesla never fails to disappoint (at least never fails to disappoint me) in their new product announcements.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Whether or not the car is smaller, we're still talking about a 5-7 foot gap inbetween the front and rear wheel wells (between the current castings)\n\nThey already cast the front wheel well casting and the rear wheel well casting\n\nYou think making a giant 3.5x longer 20,000 ton machine instead of two 6,000 ton  machines to make one giant piece with 6 foot aluminum bars between them is going to be more economical/efficient?\n\nFirst principles thinking isn't \"draw a line from 180 parts to 2, continue the line, we arrive at 1!\" it is evaluating what makes sense from scratch without making assumptions based on what we've already seen.\n\nWhat we've already seen is reduction of parts and consolidation into large castings.\n\nContinuing down that line as far as you can go to the point of parody is not first principles thinking, that is the opposite.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Guess we will find out.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "\"C\",\"A\",\"R\" should also be possible.

Every time Tesla achieved a new milestone, such as the launch of a new electric vehicle or the opening of a new factory, the stock's value would soar, but the short sellers would try to bring it down by spreading negative news and rumors.*\n\n*Despite the short sellers' efforts, Tesla's stock continued to rise, as more and more people were realizing the potential of electric vehicles and the impact that Tesla was having on the industry. The bears were becoming increasingly frustrated as their bets against the stock were not paying off, and the bulls were enjoying their profits and the success of a company that was changing the world.*\n\n*In the end, the bulls emerged victorious, as Tesla's stock continued to reach new heights and the short sellers were forced to cover their positions and admit defeat.

So it’s definitely a combo of supply and demand. Supply shocks, corporate taxes, health insurance per employee, interest rates can raise costs for business too, but it’s not ultimately going to be sustainable price increases because demand isn’t catching up, unless supply is rapidly decreasing alongside unsustained increases in demand which can come from FX devaluation which can be spurred on by a number of factors including but not limited to nominal demand increasing in tandem with prices alongside increasing inflation expectations by businesses and workers (that are capable of acting on those expectations).", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Probably down because everyone got the stimulus already.", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Weren’t child credits paid out early?\nWas that a year ago?
