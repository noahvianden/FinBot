Tesla and Amazon have actually shown results in terms of improving their earnings while Plug (which has been around longer) has not shown any results. In fact its gotten worse. Tesla and Amazon actually grew earnings and margins in a shorter time frame while Plug has not. If you’re buying Plug out of fear of missing out you might as well buy every stock in the market cause most of them probably have better chances of being the next Tesla and Amazon then Plug. \n\n2. You’re literally using whats called Selection Bias. Tesla and Amazon were 2 of the 100s of stocks that made big while the rest failed or didn’t get as big. You can’t compare every single company to Tesla or Amazon just cause you think they have the potential of doing it. \n\nThe market is 20/20 hindsight. I could have also bought Apple in 2016 when it was trading at a valuation lower then the market and saw multi 100s of percent gains. Doesn’t mean I am going to go buy a garbage company just out of a whim that they can become another Apple. Thats not investing thats gambling and there is a difference. Use models and fundamentals to determine if that company is going to hit reasonable expectations and boost their earnings and cash flow. That can then be returned to shareholders to give you returns.\n\nPlug has zero fundamentals and zero profitability and the company has been like that for over 2 decades in the stock market and they’re showing no sign that its going to be any different over the next couple of decades. \n\nRather then focusing on coming out with a nice investor presentation to get lemming investors to buy their stock cause they have a nice story going for the company they need to actually come up with a viable business model and sell products that people actually want and make them money. They need to completely transform the business buts it’s been the same story and same results and showing no sign its going to be any different in the future. \n\nI don’t hate the company or any company but at the end of the day Plug is the worst stock that I have probably seen trade in the stock market.

A trading plan outlines how a trader will find and execute trades, including under what conditions they will buy securities, and then exit or sell those securities. A trader will also consider how large of a position they will take, how they will manage positions while in them, what securities can be traded, and other rules for when to trade and when not to. Ideally a trader should also have a watch list of around 10 securities that they are familiar with, and follow regularly.\n\nMost trading experts recommend that no capital is risked until a trading plan is made. A trading plan is based on personal stock market research that guides a trader's decisions. A trading plan is a roadmap for how to trade, and no trades should be placed without a basic plan in hand. The plan should be written down and followed. And it is not altered unless it is found not to work (make money) or the trader finds a way to improve it.\n\nTrading plans can be built in a variety of different ways. Investors will typically customize their own trading plan based on their personal goals and objectives. Trading plans can be lengthy and detailed, or as simple as one or two sentences. Active traders, especially, should have a simple written plan for day trades or swing trades. They should have very simple plans that are easy enough for a 6th grader to follow.\n\nThe trading plan outlines not only what to do to get into positions, but also states when to get out. The Active trader needs to come up with rules for exactly when they will enter a trade. This could be based on a chart pattern, the price reaching a certain level, a technical indicator signal, a statistical bias, or other factors.\n\nThe trading plan must also state how to exit positions. This includes exiting with a profit, or how and when to get out with a loss. Active traders will often utilize limit orders to take profits and stop loss orders to exit their losses. The trading plan also outlines how much capital is risked on each trade, and how position size is determined.\n\nAdditional rules may also be added which specify when it is acceptable to trade and when it isn't. A day trader, for example, may have a rule where they don't trade if volatility is extremely high. If volatility is too high, they don't trade, even if their entry criteria is triggered.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think your intuition is right while your theta is tough.
