Gensler told the Financial Times that it is \"nearly unavoidable\" that AI could cause a financial crash by the late 2020s or early 2030s. He emphasized the need for regulation that addresses both the AI models developed by tech companies and how these models are used by Wall Street banks. Gensler described the issue as a \"cross-regulatory challenge\" and noted that many financial institutions might be relying on the same underlying AI models or data aggregators.\n\n[Full article here](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/ai-could-cause-financial-crash-within-decade-sec-head-says-2023-10)", "id": "1797dzx", "created_utc": 1697466813.0, "score": 960, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 275, "comments": [{"body": "Sounds like a scapegoat to me.", "score": 497, "replies": [{"body": "You think the wallstreetbets debacle was bad, imaging what ai can do w naked shorts", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "You realize citadel has been using an AI algorithm for years?

Tesla is a bit better at exploiting some of the same programs that everyone has access to in some cases.\n\nFor example, the LG plant in Holland, Michigan was well more than 50% paid for by Federal and MI state incentives... Tesla never got a deal that good. Toyota got lots of money for the initial Prius under an earlier incentive program that Tesla did not receive. For quite some time, Tesla didn't have access to federal EV tax credits that most others did... and Ford has been a major recipient of DoE ATVM funding.\n\nNow, in terms of showing favoritism, most government programs cannot favor individual companies. So CARB ZEV, credits, CAFE GHG credits, federal EV tax credits, state level EV tax credits, IRA manufacturer EV and battery production credits, EVSE charging subsidies and so forth are all equal access as long as one adheres to the rules. Now, since Tesla has had well more than 50% of BEVs sold and no ICE vehicles, in some cases, it means more credits going to Telsa. However, when there is discretion, where someone has to pick winners of grants and subsidies, Tesla often does not get such subsidies. Ford and GM are big recipients of such. Another example is the Chinese tariffs and exemptions put in by the Trump administration and continued by the Biden administration, where the administrations can selectively put in exemptions - and Tesla has been repeatedly denied.\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/c9e5efc99b4740e6b7d2b19335a9ed1c](https://apnews.com/article/c9e5efc99b4740e6b7d2b19335a9ed1c)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Tesla go zoom , bzzz and $$$.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "It was once a juggernaut,its still decent but........more companies will be doing what they do some will do it better.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "They literally would have never existed in any other time in history except for our recent 0% interest rate environment.

Higher interest rates make debt refinancing more onerous, and new projects could also be reviewed, potentially lowering corporate investments in growth.\r  \nEarnings: Of the 69 basis points of contraction in Return on Equity (ROE) in the first half of the year, nearly half came from higher interest expenses. **Since the global financial crisis, falling interest costs and greater leverage have accounted for nearly one-fifth of an overall 8.8 percentage points increase in the ROE of S&P 500 firms**.\r  \nDebt Maturity: Some $820 billion of US and European non-financial corporate bonds are maturing in the next 12 months. While companies overall are not expected to run up against a truly devastating maturity wall before 2025 onwards, debt-ridden companies are already feeling the pain from higher rates.\r  \nProfitability: The risk of rates now being higher for longer could prevent firms from taking on more leverage, hitting long-term profitability.\r  \nHowever, it’s important to note that these impacts can vary widely depending on the specific debt circumstances of each company within the S&P 500.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "But what about war", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Think this is the top comment on pretty much every article in this sub", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Still laughing at that \"100% chance of recession in blow to Biden\" headline from Bloomberg in October 2022.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "My fave, another recent one \"worst US bond bear market in history\".
