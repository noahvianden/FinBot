When demand for a product increases, manufacturers expand capacity aggressively. However, this can lead to an oversupply if demand decreases or stabilizes.\n\nProcess Migration Glitches: The transition to new manufacturing processes can cause disruptions in the supply chain, leading to periods of oversupply or shortage.\n\nDemand Slowdowns: Changes in demand for consumer products that use semiconductors can also cause these cycles. For example, insatiable demand for a product – such as PCs in the 1980s, mobile phones in the 2000s, and smartphones in the 2010s – would lead manufacturers to aggressively expand capacity.\n\nInventory and Economic Growth: The industry cycles are also driven by inventory as well as world economic growth.\n\nHowever, some experts believe that the semiconductor industry’s boom-bust cycle might be changing due to diversified demand from various sectors like cell phones, automobiles, industrial equipment, cloud computing, and more. This diversified demand and the increasing cost of supply might lead to a steadier business going forward.\n\n**Biggest boom cycle in semiconductor industry**\n\nThe biggest boom cycle in the semiconductor industry, as per Deutsche Bank Research, began in October 2019 and has been running for 29 months, which is already above the historical average of 27.7 months. This boom cycle has been driven by various factors such as the demand for chips throughout the economy, including 5G, cloud datacenters, phones, PCs, laptops, and cars. The semiconductor industry has generally done pretty well over the last two or three years with the current chip shortage.\n\n**Will AI lead to another boom cycle for the semiconductor industry?**\n\n**AI impact on semiconductor industry**\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to lead to another boom cycle in the semiconductor industry. AI applications are everywhere, from big data analytics and military equipment to facial recognition software and self-driving cars. They bring new challenges and opportunities to the semiconductor industry every day.\n\nAI has the potential to generate huge business value for semiconductor companies at every step of their operations, from research and chip design to production through sales. However, only about 30 percent of semiconductor-device makers are already generating revenue through AI/ML.\n\nAI could allow semiconductor companies to grow in value, with storage experiencing the highest growth. The AI-spurred semiconductor market is set to grow by 18 percent over the next five years.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that while AI is creating new opportunities, it also brings challenges. For example, the amount of data processed and stored by AI applications is massive, requiring architectural improvements in semiconductors. Also, it’s costly to manufacture a specialized AI chip for every application.\n\nIn conclusion, while AI is likely to drive growth in the semiconductor industry, how this will unfold depends on various factors including how quickly companies can adapt and innovate in response to these new demands and challenges.\n\n**Would it be better to invest in INTC, NVDA or the SMH ETF?**\n\nInvesting in individual stocks or an ETF depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Here’s some information that might help you:\n\n**Intel Corporation (INTC):**\n\nThe stock closed at $35.971.\n\nThe average 12-month stock price forecast is $34.45, which predicts a decrease of -4.23%.\n\nThe earnings per share (EPS) estimate for the current year (2023) is $0.62 and for the next year (2024) is $1.741. The revenue estimate for the current year (2023) is $52.48B and for the next year (2024) is $58.66B.\n\n**NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA):**\n\nThe stock closed at $454.613. NVIDIA has received a consensus rating of Moderate Buy.\n\nIs NVIDIA stock overbought now?\n\nNVIDIA stock overbought analysis\n\nYes, according to some analysts, NVIDIA’s stock is considered overbought. The term “overbought” refers to a situation where an asset has been more aggressively bought than its fundamentals justify. Overbought conditions can last for a while, but they often precede reversals or pullbacks in the price. However, it’s important to note that being overbought doesn’t necessarily mean the price will go down immediately.\n\n**VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH):**\n\nThe ETF closed at $148.815.\n\nIt’s based on the MVIS US Listed Semiconductor 25 index, a market-cap-weighted index of 25 of the largest US-listed semiconductors companies.

This means years of losses as these companies come up to speed on how to produce cheap BEVs. This is the \"Valley of Death.\"\n\nI think a better comparison is with the Chinese EV manufacturers. Tesla's competition is more these companies, since they are producing decent cars, and have been doing this for some time, so they are also already fairly cheap. The Chinese companies are not showing good profit margins, but they are not showing losses on EVs like the western auto makers.\n\nIf Tesla were just a car company, they might be overvalued or around fair value at this point. They have been growing sales at a crazy rate, and still have a 5x to 10x unit manufacturing increase ahead of them (at lower revenue than that, because the revenue per unit is going to decrease).\n\nIt looks like they have a pretty good upcoming business in industrial scale energy storage. This is likely to be bigger than the autos eventually. This business looks like it is already scaling and working.\n\nEven bigger is the AI stuff. Cars driving themselves is advanced robotics. The knowledge domain translates well to developing the Teslabot, which is going to have some interesting implications for manufacturing automation, and then for lots of things that require people to do right now. \n\nIf you believe that the AI portion of Tesla has \"something\" that other companies do not (like data from 100,000 cars) and is moving closer to a general AI, then Tesla is significantly undervalued. \n\nIf you believe that robotaxis are going to make a lot of money, and some of that money is going to go to Tesla, and their general approach is scalable whereas region bound stuff like Waymo is not, then they are probably still undervalued. \n\nRobotaxis and Teslabot are still not proven and require solving some HARD problems. Of course, if Tesla solves them, this gives them something of a moat. So while this is a risk, it is a risk where there might be a big payoff. They appear to be years ahead of their competition, but the products are still not quite ready for the mass market. \n\nThe full self driving is looking really good though. General FSD is a very hard problem to solve, and it looks like Tesla might be the first to solve it. \n\nIf you think their advanced manufacturing techniques give them a cost advantage in building cars, then the big auto makers are not likely to catch them, ever, and the Chinese manufacturers will also have a hard time keeping up in terms of cost. Maybe fair value at this price. \n\nIf you own and hold Tesla through all these ups and downs, it is a good bet you aren't looking at it as merely another auto manufacturer.
