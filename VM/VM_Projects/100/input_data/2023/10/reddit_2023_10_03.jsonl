Regulatory restrictions have artificially kept oil production down, with pipelines and new projects being resisted.

If prices go up, producers react by increasing production. But, we have had investment into production artificially restricted in many countries for many years, due to political policies.

{"title": "Facebook wants to charge EU users $14 a month if they don't agree to personalized ads on Facebook and Instagram", "selftext": "Meta is considering introducing subscription-based, ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The move aims to comply with the EU's new ad privacy regulations. The subscription fee would start at around €10 ($10.50) for desktop users and rise to about $14 for mobile users, accounting for commissions charged by Apple and Google's app stores. The subscription model is still under review for compliance with EU laws. This comes after Meta faced a $1.3 billion fine from European regulators for data privacy violations.\n\n**Regulatory Arbitrage**:\nMeta's decision can be viewed as a form of regulatory arbitrage, aimed at circumventing the stringent data privacy laws enforced by the European Union. Given the EU's propensity for imposing substantial fines, this move could serve as a risk mitigation strategy, thereby stabilizing the company's regulatory profile.\n\n**Revenue Diversification and Financial Stability**:\nThe introduction of a subscription-based revenue model is a strategic pivot away from the increasingly volatile ad-based revenue streams. This diversification could serve to stabilize Meta's cash flows, thereby making it a more attractive and less risky investment in the long term.\n\n**Market Test for Global Scalability**:\nThe European market will act as a bellwether for the viability of this new revenue model. A successful implementation in Europe could pave the way for a global rollout, offering a significant upside potential for revenue growth and stock appreciation.\n\n**Industry Precedence and Competitive Moats**:\nBy being the first to introduce a subscription-based model in the social media landscape, Meta has the opportunity to build a competitive moat. This first-mover advantage could deter competitors from entering the space, thereby consolidating Meta's market share and potentially driving up its valuation.\n\n**User Adoption as a Leading Indicator**:\nThe rate of user adoption will serve as a leading indicator for the success of this initiative. High adoption rates could signify a paradigm shift in consumer preferences, moving away from ad-supported to subscription-based models. This could have a ripple effect on Meta's long-term revenue and profitability metrics.\n\nArticle from [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-charges-eu-users-for-ad-free-instagram-and-facebook-2023-10?utm_source=reddit.com&r=US&IR=T)", "id": "16yumhc", "created_utc": 1696346209.0, "score": 512, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 270, "comments": [{"body": "This would be the best excuse for me to delete my account, there's no way I will pay a penny for FB", "score": 523, "replies": [{"body": "Would you agree to seeing ads in order to keep FB?

Since the CFO is subordinate to the board under Tesla's bylaws, he is obligated to provide that information as soon as feasible.  \n\nAgain, there is no reason why the Tesla board, and Chairwoman Denholm and Kimbal Musk in particular, would have pressed Elon repeatedly about the issue in Dec. 2022, if they didn't have some evidence to back up their position.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, Tesla does monitor customer feedback.

Since there are more customers than products available, the customers will bid up the price of the product.  If 30 of the customers can pay more to get the product, they will pay more and outcompete the other 20 customers.\n\nThen suppose Tesla's reputation suffers and there are now only 30 potential customers for 30 units of product.  There's no bidding, and Tesla has to accept the price that the 30 potential customers will pay.  \n\n*Fewer potential buyers generally means lower prices, which means lower profits.*\n\nThis is fundamentally no different than the stock market.
