These companies that they shafted are very cash rich and capable of developing their own solutions. Basically, their decision to allocate to the start ups may have indirectly created competitors/ enemies out of these mega caps instead of having them as harmless, paying customers.\n2. The US government is trying to limit AI chips being brought into China largely for military reasons. China is building a large ambitious military force. US is worried powerful AI chips will be used in weapon systems, drones, and so on. So basically China found a workaround the export rules... with the help of NVDA.

That compares with TSMC’s guidance for third-quarter revenue between $16.7 billion and $17.5 billion.\n\nDuring the earnings call on Thursday afternoon, CEO C.C. Wei said that the firm expects excess inventories to continue to decline.\n\n“Due to the persistent weaker overall macroeconomic conditions and slow demand in China, customers remain cautious in their inventory control. That’s why we expect the inventory oversupply to continue in the fourth quarter,” said Wei.\n\nTSMC is the top producer of the world’s most advanced processors. The Taiwanese firm manufactures semiconductors for companies like Apple, and **Nvidia.**\n\n\\*\n\n**Why Is The Semiconductor Industry Prone To Boom And Bust Cycles?**\n\nThe semiconductor industry is prone to boom and bust cycles due to a variety of factors:\n\nCapital Spending Ups and Downs: The industry’s cycles are often driven by changes in capital spending. When demand for a product increases, manufacturers expand capacity aggressively. However, this can lead to an oversupply if demand decreases or stabilizes.\n\nProcess Migration Glitches: The transition to new manufacturing processes can cause disruptions in the supply chain, leading to periods of oversupply or shortage.\n\nDemand Slowdowns: Changes in demand for consumer products that use semiconductors can also cause these cycles. For example, insatiable demand for a product – such as PCs in the 1980s, mobile phones in the 2000s, and smartphones in the 2010s – would lead manufacturers to aggressively expand capacity.\n\nInventory and Economic Growth: The industry cycles are also driven by inventory as well as world economic growth.\n\nHowever, some experts believe that the semiconductor industry’s boom-bust cycle might be changing due to diversified demand from various sectors like cell phones, automobiles, industrial equipment, cloud computing, and more. This diversified demand and the increasing cost of supply might lead to a steadier business going forward.\n\n**Biggest boom cycle in semiconductor industry**\n\nThe biggest boom cycle in the semiconductor industry, as per Deutsche Bank Research, began in October 2019 and has been running for 29 months, which is already above the historical average of 27.7 months. This boom cycle has been driven by various factors such as the demand for chips throughout the economy, including 5G, cloud datacenters, phones, PCs, laptops, and cars. The semiconductor industry has generally done pretty well over the last two or three years with the current chip shortage.\n\n**Will AI lead to another boom cycle for the semiconductor industry?**\n\n**AI impact on semiconductor industry**\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to lead to another boom cycle in the semiconductor industry. AI applications are everywhere, from big data analytics and military equipment to facial recognition software and self-driving cars. They bring new challenges and opportunities to the semiconductor industry every day.\n\nAI has the potential to generate huge business value for semiconductor companies at every step of their operations, from research and chip design to production through sales. However, only about 30 percent of semiconductor-device makers are already generating revenue through AI/ML.\n\nAI could allow semiconductor companies to grow in value, with storage experiencing the highest growth. The AI-spurred semiconductor market is set to grow by 18 percent over the next five years.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that while AI is creating new opportunities, it also brings challenges. For example, the amount of data processed and stored by AI applications is massive, requiring architectural improvements in semiconductors. Also, it’s costly to manufacture a specialized AI chip for every application.\n\nIn conclusion, while AI is likely to drive growth in the semiconductor industry, how this will unfold depends on various factors including how quickly companies can adapt and innovate in response to these new demands and challenges.\n\n**Would it be better to invest in INTC, NVDA or the SMH ETF?**\n\nInvesting in individual stocks or an ETF depends on your investment goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon.

Let's start with why we think it's a bad idea first.\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/134/4/1793/5492274?login=false\n\nAs a beginning, there's a lot of evidence that offering fresh and healthy food to people doesn't actually compel them to eat better, even when attractively priced.  That's the whole idea behind solving food deserts.  But it doesn't seem like offering fresh food and produce that require a lot of cooking knowledge, prep, proper storage, cleaning is enticing to the busy low income people who just want a quick and easy meal.\n\nSecond, even if this premise were true.  There are infinitely better solutions that support the need to feed people good food that are less intrusive and create incentives for efficiency.\n\n* We can provide free or low cost transportation like shuttles to grocery and shopping centers.  It creates jobs for drivers, expands the reach of the labor force and could boost economic activity in other ways.\n* Put more money into police to patrol grocery stores or be stationed at them.\n* Create state backed loans to grocers that offer a certain minimum basket of fresh food and produce.

There is a learning curve and it always cost a big of money to get good. I'm sure 90% of the people on here that are really buying stocks have a story like yours.  I do.  I got started heavily in stocks is 2006.  Then in 2007-2008 something big happened.....  \n\n\nThink of it like this. You haven't lost any money until you sell your stock.  Its just paper profits/losses.    I don't worry because I'm long term.  I buy and hold. Selling and buying stocks as I see deals or take profits.  I loved 2020 because I got a lot of great deals. Doubled my portfolio.  I was smart enough to only keep the solid companies though. \n\nYour holdings make my cringe.  Seems like we are getting one of these post each day now.  People bought the meme/hype stocks and now are left holding the bag.  You see, the stock market is zero sum gain.  Everyone can't make money. For someone to make money someone else has to lose it.  While all the smart money was getting out of those stocks you bought in.  Filling their sell orders. \n\nThe best thing you can do now is hold.  It will take a few years, but enough of those stocks will come back up to get you back in the black.  The reason the stock market works so well for long term investors is that there is a limit on how much a stock can go down, but no limit on how much it can go up.  So all you need are a couple big winners and you will be ok. In the future try to focus on solid companies with good fundamentals.  Good PE ratios.  Those companies will have a higher value when things get bad.  Then only do a few stocks as speculations.  I'll use two of mine for an example.  CRSP and TGT.  I like the future of CRSP.  It could be a game changer as long as right wing politicians don't ban it for stupid religious reasons. I bought it at $130 and its now at $40.  I'll average down some and hold because I think its worth the risk. Just in case.  But TGT is a solid company that has great numbers.  I bought it really low  at $100 in 2020.  It then went up to 250.  Now its back down to $100.  It has a yield of 4% and a PE of 15. Its still a solid company that will be around for years to come.  It will go back up higher than ever in the future. So I'm not worried that its cheap now. Its just a better chance to buy more.    \n\nIn the future try to avoid so many stocks with crazy PEs.

During each drop, the lows become less too.\n\nThe biggest lessons I’ve learned so far is to always have a little extra cash available so you can put some of it into the market when it does go down. It’s also good to have cash reserves so you don’t worry about being forced to sell when your portfolio is down. Also, try to limit your gambles on unknown stocks and fomo opportunities. So far, my biggest losses/blunders have been gambles I made on companies I didn’t know much about but were hyped up on forums. \n\nDon’t to pay too much attention to what people say about the stock market especially on forums.

Much better to patiently lie in wait for an opportunity to sell options where you are equally comfortable w/ them expiring worthless or getting exercised\n* Earlier this year I sold leap calls against all my TSLA shares and have loved NOT dealing with shorter term options stress...am now considering buying those calls back since I can probably do better selling very low risk weeklies or monthlies at this point\n* Only sell contracts you are ok with managing (rolling out if needed) or exercising.

About 90% of my stuff is in tax advantaged accounts (Roths and Coverdells and traditional IRAs), so that makes trading more simple but it does make early retirement a bit more complex.\n\nManaging stress is super important to me...it seems very foolish to have done so well in the stock market but still be stressed and detached from the present due to normal market fluctuations. I'm still trying to figure out how best to balance generating some income w/o incurring too much stress.
