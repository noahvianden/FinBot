{"title": "We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA)", "selftext": "\\*\\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\\*\\*\n\nOver the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen\n\nDespite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3’ 2023.\n\nHowever, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla’s end-to-end autonomous driving solution.\n\nTesla’s FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla’s current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company. On the other hand, Tesla’s competitors such as Waymo, Mobileye, and Cruise have all operated in some capacity at level 3 or level 4. In particular, Mobileye has proved to be a serious threat to FSD due to its goal of integrating in Tesla’s competitors. Mobileye has outlined several technologies that are set to compete with Tesla’s current offerings as well as Tesla’s future capabilities.\n\nThe Cybertruck further highlights Tesla’s habit of misleading shareholders. The Cybertruck is Tesla’s consumer pickup truck expected to be launched in Q4 2023. In Tesla’s Q2 2023 earnings call, Musk stated that Cybertruck demand is, \"so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.” EV insider reported that this statement was likely to transfer into 1.9 million preorders. However, Tesla failed to mention that the Cybertruck’s preorder deposit was $100. In Tesla’s Q3 earnings call, Musk stated that “We dug our own grave” when referring to Cybertruck. He noted that he expects it to be 18 months before Cybertruck is cash flow positive, adding another timeline onto a timeline full of delays. Musk still sees demand surpassing one million units. However, it seems unlikely that demand will be that high, considering high interest rate environment and mere $100 commitment by prospective buyers.", "id": "17j4q1u", "created_utc": 1698591587.0, "score": 358, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 547, "comments": [{"body": "im curious how much tesla can make off their supercharger network now that they are opening to other car manufacturers. i know the government is paying them a lump sum, but imagine they start charging a small percentage for all the energy used at their supercharger sites...", "score": 337, "replies": [{"body": "Not only off of cars charging but also others buying superchargers (e.g. the 100m deal just inked with BP).

The company had bought [what is now the Tesla Factory at Fremont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Fremont_Factory) from Toyota in 2010, after Toyota and GM shut down the NUMMI joint venture they'd previously operated there.  \n\nThe broader picture you miss is that Tesla in 2011 had a lot of talent.  The efforts of talented people are more important in a startup than the factory.  It's the talent that brings the organization to life.\n\nTesla's leadership team in 2011 was excellent: CTO J.B. Straubel, Model S program director Jerome Guillen (hired from Daimler), manufacturing operations executive Gilbert Passin (hired from Toyota), VP of business development Diarmuid O'Connell, VP of worldwide retail George Blankenship (former Apple exec who had developed Apple stores), and probably several others I'm forgetting at the moment.  CEO Elon Musk, as controversial as he is today, had put together a star management team.  These people were worth investing in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> If anything, your decision to hold a company that nearly went bankrupt multiple times shows how incompetent you were. \n\nNo, this is called taking a calculated risk.  \n\nMy purchases of TSLA stock over the past 12 years represent only a small % of the total money I used to buy investments.  \n\nI've ploughed the vast majority of my savings since 1997 into boring index funds and ETFs like SPY.  \n\nIf TSLA had gone bankrupt in 2013 or 2019, my daily finances and long-term retirement plans would have been unaffected.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I went all in Tesla below $15 but that isn’t the point.

{"title": "How To Profit From War", "selftext": "**War impacts the world. When nations clash, your investments can change. Today, let's explore how stocks respond to war, helping you manage your portfolio in uneasy times.**\n\n[ © Kaulto.com](https://preview.redd.it/c1lvov29h4xb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d13c9590252ebebe690a177b0782ba15adad1401)\n\nWhen wars like the Russo-Ukrainian conflict of 2022 or the recent clashes in Israel hit the headlines, they also significantly impact the stock market. Here’s a simple breakdown of what tends to happen, when conflict breaks out.\n\n**1) Defense Stocks Go Up:**\n\n[ © Kaulto.com](https://preview.redd.it/z8n4sjfrh4xb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=100e7ffe9acb3a572db10b96a74e7d96155da5e5)\n\nCompanies that make weapons or military equipment often see their stock prices increase during wars \\[[source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/lockheed-martin-boeing-northrop-defense-stock-price-d78064b)\\].\n\nFor example, stocks of Lockheed Martin and Raytheon (RTX) went up during the Russo-Ukrainian war, and the recent Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w8nyl7q0i4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e34d76550cfff99d8adc4d9fad0cc04eee42531\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9g2zsfr3i4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=8922e726012fe37984ad67ca8e3dd2edc6f7e07a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g73130r5i4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=cded001c72e182df528b8b01bbaa7e09a101cee9\n\nThis often happens whenever major conflict occurs because the demand for defence and military equipment rises during significant conflict.\n\n**2. Prices of Oil Rise**:\n\n[ © Kaulto.com](https://preview.redd.it/qqg6gaxli4xb1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=22d69bcdfb332bc1409eaf3d5ea836eeb91217fb)\n\nWars can disrupt the supply of important resources like oil, causing prices to rise. Because demand is the same, but supply decreases. So oil’s value increases.\n\nEven if they don’t export much oil themself, countries embroiled in war, disrupt oil supply chains in surrounding territory. This often increases the stock prices of companies that produce and deal with oil. For example, BP and Shell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q81f9qxsi4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc2bc73cbd51db6b4a28329395e4166320412051\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvkuz9xui4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fcc34b4521ac9e387180dfdbf3aa9345b128fc3\n\n**3.

This means companies that provide cybersecurity services or tech gear see increased demand in war-time. For example, companies like Palo Alto Networks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qdxn9lt9j4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=8adf714025205e3ca50b232443ad23e4e6b01631\n\n**4.

Utilities companies provide essential services like electricity, gas, and water. Essential goods companies provide food, beverages and household goods. These resources tend to remain in demand regardless of the current environment \\[[source](http://which%20remain%20in%20demand%20regardless%20of%20the%20current%20environment./)\\].\n\n**5.

So, stocks of luxury goods, and travel companies usually go down. For example, LVMH (Luxury goods) & IAG (Airlines group).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qxst72s1k4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=f21c33881331ec66e8a169b8592cba0092e8665b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hc62ihj3k4xb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbec9af64fc0a5572c69f3d35d4e992ec33b2ed9\n\n**War-time Summary:**\n\n* Consider diversifying your investments in less affected stocks to reduce exposure to highly volatile industries.\n* Consider stocks of companies that deal with essential war-time resources like military, oil and cybersecurity.\n* Avoid stocks of companies that deal with non-essential resources like luxury goods and travel.\n* Stay updated on world events, and be ready to adjust your investment strategy accordingly.", "id": "17j0q80", "created_utc": 1698577983.0, "score": 249, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Great summary of all the most wellknown facts", "score": 298, "replies": [{"body": "Yet I still do not know how to profit from war", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "they key is to get in before the war. gotta time it ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "Gotta cause it", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)![img](emote|t5_2th52|27189)", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Start a war and then sell weapons to both sides.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Yet, I still do not know how to start a war. \n\nOP, is this a two parter?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Invent a religion, wars will naturally ensue, profit!", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Ok so all I have to do to capitalize here is 1) invent religion, 2) start war and 3) time start of war?\n\nIs it a 3 part play OP???", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Can I join in?
