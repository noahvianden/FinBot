{"title": "Time to start DCA", "selftext": "This is a reminder for those who still have cash to start considering dollar cost averaging (DCA) into the market. If you felt like you missed out when SP500 was up to 4500-4600, well now's your chance for that dip. Sp500 have now corrected to 4130, about 11% down from its peak of 4607. In bull markets, that's a typical correction amount that happens once a year. In bear markets, that's the typical level of correction before there's a bear market bounce of 5-7% or so. So either way, a sizable bounce is probably incoming and you should at least participate while waiting for further data.\n\nWhether you think this is a bull market or not, and it's hard to know (I don't claim to know), it's probably a good time to at least DCA right now. If you're thinking there're so much negative news coming up and you want to wait until those negative news settle down, that's not going to happen. Market's going to spike up way before the outcomes are determined. For example in Oct 2022, we had a second really terrible CPI number after the Fed got really hawkish in Sept, and market bottomed and went up 5.5% the same day as the CPI release. CPI didn't even get down to acceptable levels until December, and by then SP500 already went up 14% from its trough. Point is the best time to buy is when everything feels terrible, and it's not like you're buying at the peak here. Market has corrected a sizable amount, and if you DCA, you still have dry powder in case if you bought too early, but at least you bought some in case if this was the end of the correction.\n\n\"be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others fearful\"  - most overused Buffet quote.", "id": "17heh91", "created_utc": 1698377340.0, "score": 187, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "Jokes on you I have no money right now.", "score": 242, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah same.

Well in the past year, we had very strong worker supply from high immigration, and people are going back to work even more than prepandemic level, so we are not structurally lacking in workers that much \n\nFurthermore, we thought underlying inflation linked to the tight job market was around 4-4.5%. Turns out, it's probably around 3%, significantly less.\n\nAlso, excess consumer savings was expected to run out by this summer. Turns out, consumers still have 1.2 trillions of savings left, and now real wages is positive, so they don't have to eat into their savings to spend anymore. So even if the recession happens, consumers still have plenty of savings to weather the downturn, making the recession much more mild if it happens\n\nSo all that said, and favorable seasonal for stocks in Nov into January, I think people should at least participate in the stock market while getting further data about the economy, especially after stocks have corrected 11% back to April levels. If a recession occurs, I think it will be at least summer or late next year, and stocks can easily make new all time high by then. Are you really confident that a recession will happen and you will be guaranteed to buy higher? Some people were that confident and haven't bought back into the stock market for years. So it makes sense to participate and then gather more data to make your decision later.

It's like a line that stays super flat for most of the population then shoots up insanely when you get to the last 10% or so. That is to say, only the top echelons hold most of the wealth. How is this 1.2 Trillion distributed amongst the population? I'd imagine it's likely only the already very wealthy holding it, which makes sense. However, say, if 60% of the population still runs out of savings in this year, the economy as a whole would still be in trouble, no?\n\nHaving said this, I do agree with your sentiment that we can't really time when the bottom will be and it does look like a decent time to get started in DCA-ing now anyway.

How bad are things like this:\n\n>During the six months ended June 30, 2023, we reclassified approximately $1.2 billion of eligible consumer installment receivables from loans and interest receivable, net to loans and interest receivable, held for sale. As of June 30, 2023, the total outstanding balance in our held for sale portfolio was $1.9 billion, including loans reclassified as held for sale and loans originated as held for sale.\n\n* $33.6B in Funds receivable and customer accounts.  Of that about $10.2B represents cash or time deposits.  $16.7B represent AFS debt securities.  $6.7B funds receivable.\n* They also have $3.8B in short-term debt securities.\n* Long-term investments they have $2.1B AFS debt securities.  $2.4B strategic investments ($500M marketable securities, $1.8B non-marketable equities).\n\nAs a follow-up, the biggest question I have is \"Funds payable and amounts due to customers\" of $37.4B.  Are these like deposits at a bank that could run in a stress scenario?  What if people pull out PayPal funds en masse? \n Could it force liquidation and losses in the above categories?

{"title": "Chipotle Mexican Grill easily tops earnings estimates, as higher prices help offset food inflation", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/26/chipotle-mexican-grill-cmg-q3-2023-earnings.html\n\nHere’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\n\n-Earnings per share: $11.36 adjusted vs. $10.55 expected\n\n-Revenue: $2.47 billion, in line with expectations\n\nThe burrito chain reported third-quarter net income of $313.2 million, or $11.32 per share, up from $257.1 million, or $9.20 per share, a year earlier. Excluding corporate-restructuring costs, Chipotle earned $11.36 per share. Beef and queso costs rose this quarter, largely offsetting last year’s menu price hikes. Earlier this month, the restaurant chain raised menu prices for the first time in more than a year, citing inflation. The company had paused its aggressive price hikes earlier this year as consumers pulled back their spending. Still, executives have maintained that Chipotle has pricing power and more room to run.\n\n“I think the Chipotle value, when we haven’t raised prices in over a year until this latest action, is coming through, and people are choosing to dine at Chipotle because we are very affordable,” CFO Jack Hartung said on the company’s conference call. Customers in California can also expect to pay even more for their burritos next year. Executives said the company will pass along the higher labor costs that will come from California raising wages for fast-food workers to $20 an hour in April. About 15% of Chipotle’s restaurants are in California. “We are definitely going to pass this on, we just haven’t made a final decision on as to what level yet,” Hartung said. Chipotle’s net sales climbed 11.3% to $2.47 billion. Same-store sales rose 5%, beating StreetAccount estimates of 4.6%. The company credited higher transactions and menu prices for the quarter’s same-store sales growth. Chipotle prices were up 2.8% compared with the year-ago period, due to last year’s price hikes.\n\nCEO Brian Niccol said that traffic trends have remained strong in October, helped by the recent return of carne asada as a limited-time menu item. Chipotle opened 62 new restaurants during the quarter. All but eight of those locations featured a “Chipotlane,” a drive-thru lane reserved for picking up digital orders. Looking to 2024, the company expects that it will open 285 to 315 new restaurants. Chipotle also reiterated its forecast for 2023 same-store sales growth in the mid-to-high single digit range.", "id": "17hlsbo", "created_utc": 1698407459.0, "score": 233, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Wonder**\n\nMany of us have been gamers a long time. Do you remember why you became a gamer? I do. It was when I got my Super Nintendo and played Super Mario World for the first time. I've been playing vidya games since I was a child, but sometimes it's hard to remember why I love this hobby in 2023 because of what gaming has become in the intervening 30+ years.\n\nWhich brings me to Super Mario Bros. Wonder. It's the first traditional 2D side-scrolling Mario game in over a decade, since the New Super Mario Bros. series ended with the Wii U entry. Playing this game is like traveling back in time to my childhood. It reminds me why I became a gamer. If it were possible to distill pure joy into a cartridge, that's what this game is. \n\nNintendo has used all this intervening time to pack the game with most creativity and imagination that I have seen in a game in over 20 years. Each of the levels overflows with unique and imaginative mechanics driven by the eponymous Wonder Flowers you collect which transform the stages in wild and, uh, wonderful ways. The game itself is not particularly long, with most players able to see and do everything in 15-20 hours. But when every level is hand crafted and utterly unique like this, it's hard to complain about the length. But it's one game you wish could just never end because you don't remember the last time you were having this much fun playing a game.\n\nThe game opens with singing piranha plants and finishes with an honest to God musical rhythm game boss fight even though the Wonder developers had no idea what the movie was going to be. Everyone just assumes Bowser is a musician, I guess. Usually the frontman of a metal band, because you know Bowser really is metal as fuck, but then he just busts out with that pop ballad like it's nothing to change things up. Uh, anyways, as the ending played and the credits got started, I remembered the child playing Super Mario World for the first time and I realized that it's been 30+ years and Nintendo has still got it. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a miracle. The sheer childlike joy, creativity, and yes, wonder are a stark reminder that while the rest of gaming has changed (and in many ways for the worse), Nintendo still remembers what gaming should still be about. Gaming should be about having fun.\n\nFinal Rating: GOTY/10", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "I'll have to get it after such a glowing review.I honestly hate 3d mario games, 2d will always seem the way growing up with Mario 3 and super mario world.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dude this was an excellent write up.\n\nIf you swear this isn’t Chat GPT - I absolutely love your writing style.

By the way, tell your single male friends to stop doing that. If you swipe right on every girl, Tinder thinks you're desperate, aka unattractive, and they push your attractiveness score down.

Therefore the monogamous communities, through natural selection, will survive and be promoted.\n\nI've also seen some analysis that argued that traditionally monogamous societies are more productive and that's one of the factors that led to the industrial revolution taking place in the West and not elsewhere.\n\nAt the end of the day who knows.
