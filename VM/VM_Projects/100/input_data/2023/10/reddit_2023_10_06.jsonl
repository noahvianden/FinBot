I have been investing for a long time, and I have never heard of 2% inflation outside a blip of a recession. For the last three decades, which have been very good for the economy, we have never had sustained 2% inflation. Looking back at historical graphs, you have to go back to the 50s and 60s to find 2% inflation. Back then, huge taxes on the rich constrained the monetary supply. Trying to use high treasury rates to get inflation to 2% by reducing low-tier jobs without high taxes on the people who benefit from steadily-increasing inequality is a novel experiment.\n\nI'm now fully invested now and will keep investing through a larger correction.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just a casual 2% intraday swing in less than 3 hours", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "We could end anywhere too lolol", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Glad I kept buying VOO the last few weeks..", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "never sell.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "always buy.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just buy weekly regardless", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Wow that job report...

Will respond to the 3 replies in the first version later.\n\nMet coal prices hitting the 360s for October 2024 deliveries... holy shit. [SGX Aus. Coking Coal](https://i.imgur.com/rIiABhe.png). I keep on updating my intrinsic value for $AMR, and this takes me to about $380 per share intrinsic value. This assumes the Aussie met coal price declines gradually from $310 to $290 from 2025-2027, 15% discount rate, 0% terminal growth thereafter. If AMR realizes this met coal price for 2024 (and US seaborne prices match it), it has a forward 2.5 P/FCF or EV/FCF multiple. At a baseline, let's say that I think AMR is 50% undervalued today. If met coal prices fall substantially and we get say 300, 275, 250, then 250 per ton as the Aussie seaborne met prices the next 4 years, then it is fairly valued. If prices skyrocket to say $400 or $500, then the sky is the limit.\n\nIf $AMR trades down significantly *and* met coal prices stay high, I will be buying the dip. If met coal prices fall and $AMR falls, I'll just hold.\n\n$BTU is also compelling but to be frank not as much. My 2024 valuation shows today's prices at a 4 to 6 multiple for those same metrics. Newcastle thermal coal just isn't doing too hot lately and Aussie royalties are biting into margins. The good news is their share buyback program is aggressive nowadays (AMR had a massive headstart), but you need to see stronger FCF to get as excited as AMR (or HCC). If you want to be as bullish on BTU, you have to really think energy prices are going to spike hard in coming winters. But I don't like an investment thesis relying on an energy crisis. It looks like while they are trying to bid on BHP's assets, they probably won't get it over the others. It sucks they are trying so hard though.\n\n[BTU management be like](https://i.imgur.com/1mpiuH3.png), while AMR management [loads in wheelbarrows of cash for buybacks](https://i.imgur.com/aYr0YzW.png).\n\nDYOR, NFA, etc. (Seriously though, don't buy coal companies because of a Reddit comment)", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Responses:\n\n/u/BrobaFett_1\n\nNo I am not adding to my coal positions as AMR + BTU are now 7% of my total portfolio, which seems sufficient given the riskiness of coal. However, having made my valuations, I will consider adding more AMR should it trade down more than met coal prices imply. I am still researching HCC and should have a DCF ready in a week or two to guide my valuation.\n\n/u/absoluteunitvolcker \n\nGenerally coal companies will lock in contracts throughout the year, often well in advance. For example, halfway through the year AMR might report that 50% of its production is contracted to be sold at a known price, 40% is contracted to be sold at a to-be-determined price (maybe the spot price), and say 10% uncontracted. (I'm making that up) With met coal rising so much, now is a great opportunity to lock in some strong prices. \n\nDifferent coal companies have varying success in negotiating good prices, as it depends on logistics, production ability, etc. ARCH for example is having trouble with its production due to geological issues. BTU's horrible management locked in terrible prices in past years. AMR at this point likely is locking in contracts for delivery throughout 2024, even if not all of it is priced. Moreover, the quality of the coal matters, and to analyze these companies, you have to break down their production by the benchmark it gets priced against (for met, domestic met vs. US seaborne vs. Aussie seaborne, and for thermal, Newcastle, domestic, Rotterdam) and then what royalties / rail costs are for different segments.\n\nThose realized prices only matter for backwards looking valuations anyway, so I am more concerned with what met coal does for 2024 and I generally trust AMR management to get good prices.\n\nYou pointed out that coking coal prices are rising, if not mooning, while other commodities seem to be falling. And yep I agree, and on a side note, that's why I think the whole 'crude oil demand is down' narrative is BS. Some analyst from JPM claimed there was gasoline demand destruction (reality is there is no such thing, and EIA data is getting led astray by fluctuations in the schedule that gas stations intake new supply). Then every financial news article started parroting demand destruction about *crude*. It's just technical trading.\n\nIf you do want a bear thesis about coking coal, my biggest concern is if the high blast furnace capacity utilization by Chinese steel mills isnsustainable, and their weak economy combined with glut of steel production implies inevitable reduction in coking coal demand (and iron ore too). Then the question is if India and other countries can offset China to sustain the prices. No, I am *not* concerned whatsoever about 'green steel' or electric arc furnaces using scrap. Maybe in 2040 I will be.\n\n/u/chaos-one-010101 My pleasure.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, good shit as always on coal.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "The market literally hit my stop loss almost to the penny before rocketing up hard, I had to scramble back in at a slight loss.

In March of 2011, AT&T\nattempted to acquire T-Mobile for $39 billion. At the time, T-Mobile was a distant fourthplace competitor struggling to keep pace with AT&T and Verizon. Not long after\nannouncement, it became obvious that the government would block the deal, and the parties\nterminated. Unfortunately for AT&T and the industry, **AT&T paid the largest break-up fee\nof all time and provided T-Mobile with a seven-year roaming deal and the invaluable\nspectrum it needed to develop from a then-struggling competitor into the thriving force it\nis today. Over the following years, T-Mobile went on to introduce a number of disruptive\ninitiatives that upended the wireless industry. *In addition to the internal and external\ndistractions it caused itself, AT&T’s failed takeover capitalized a viable competitor for\nyears to come*.** \n\nDirecTV: The next large deal AT&T attempted did close, but with damaging results. In\n2014, AT&T announced the $67 billion acquisition of DirecTV, becoming the largest pay\nTV operator in the country. Notwithstanding AT&T leadership’s assertions that “Pay TV\nis a very good, durable business” when the transaction was announced, the pay TV\necosystem has been under immense pressure since the deal closed. In fact, trends are\ncontinuing to erode, with AT&T’s premium TV subscribers in rapid decline as the industry,\nparticularly satellite, struggles mightily. **Unfortunately, it has become clear that AT&T\nacquired DirecTV at the absolute peak of the linear TV market.**\n\nTime Warner: In 2016, AT&T announced its most significant bet, the $109 billion\nacquisition of Time Warner. Time Warner is a spectacular company, representing a\ncollection of some of the world’s premier media assets, and it remains a strong and valuable\nfranchise today. However, despite nearly 600 days passing between signing and closing\n(and more than a year passing since), AT&T has yet to articulate a clear strategic rationale\nfor why AT&T needs to own Time Warner.

Actual material statements made in a Twitter space for the future of the company. The thing you have to understand is that Tesla is entirely self funded. They don't need to open up new credit facilities and take on debt to do what they need to do. They have stable cash flow post revenues, and they have like 20-25Bn shored up in reserves for unanticipated headwinds that may cause them issues.\n\nAnd Elon's statements are in relation to that. He, and the leadership underneath him cares about volume. Because economies of scale ultimately means that your COGS will be exponentially less than ownership and operational costs. The more effectively and efficiently you can make something, the cheaper is. Law of large numbers guarantees this. The industry by and large don't have very many leaders who'll straight up tell you that they'll sacrifice their industry leading margins and go negative to push volume. Those kind of statements, normally, lead to such leadership getting removed from their position by the board.\n\nHere, the investor community and the board basically are in agreement that this strategy, *if push come to shove*, is an acceptable risk because the success on the other side of it, is worth the pain. Every single Tesla sold is one less car sold by the competitor in the same space. It integrates that customer into the Tesla ecosystem, and that's one less customer likely to leave it.

Other market players don't have such offerings or if they do, they aren't seamlessly integrated into the vehicle platform ecosystem--and they certainly don't augment or compliment each other.  \n\n\nSo in essence, this is Elon's strategy and why they continue to drive prices lower.

In Australia Tesla will need to develop FSD using professional/qualified test drivers as part of a strictly scoped and approved process. Well first it would need to show that it is safe to be tested on public roads.

Tesla could drop the new M3/MY next year and start at a higher price than current models and walk down the price over the next two years.

To do this would be an extremely lengthy and expensive process and the 'data' from overseas will only ever be enough to have the development/testing approved with strict conditions. If Tesla do pursue this it will likely take many years at best as they would need to also have it approved for use in each state (reflecting the different road rules, vehicle regulations, and licensing requirements of each).\n\nIm not sure I agree I am making an 'emotional' call.

Collectively, they are known as “the Greeks” because each factor is represented by a letter from the Greek alphabet.\n\nOne factor is the underlying stock price. Call options will increase in price when the underlying stock price increases.

This is known as Gamma.\n\nIf TSLA is at $300, the option price won’t increase very much when TSLA goes to $310. This is because the change, while a ~3% increase, doesn’t really increase the probability of the option being in the money. However, if TSLA goes from $810 to $820, only a 1.3% increase, the option price will increase much more dramatically, as $825 is now in sight.\n\nAnother factor that affects prices is time, known as Theta. The more time until the expiration date, the higher chance that the stock could be in the money. The option will lose value each day from Theta. \n\nVega is a measure of volatility. The more volatility, the higher the probability that the underlying stock can change value and the option could become in the money. \n\nRho is a measure of interest rates. \n\nYou have to really understand these things to invest in options.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Called it (along with many of you).\n\nGet drill team Friday crew ready!\n\nKeep tweeting into the void Elon.

Robinson, the authors discuss how the Black Death had different effects on institutions in Eastern and Western Europe. Here's a brief overview:\n\nWestern Europe: The Black Death, which swept through Western Europe in the 14th century, resulted in a significant reduction in the population. This demographic collapse led to a scarcity of labor, which, in turn, increased the bargaining power of laborers. As a result, workers in Western Europe were able to demand higher wages and better working conditions. This shift contributed to the weakening of the feudal system and the rise of more inclusive economic and political institutions, as elites were forced to adapt to these new economic realities.\n\nEastern Europe: In contrast, the Black Death had different effects in Eastern Europe. While it also caused a decline in population, the institution of serfdom became more entrenched in this region. Landowners in Eastern Europe, facing labor shortages, sought to tie peasants to the land through serfdom, effectively limiting their ability to seek better opportunities. This resulted in more extractive economic and political institutions, where a small elite retained significant control and wealth.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "There’s winners and losers for sure, and it’s not fairly distributed.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah short term pain for us, but I’m hoping macro pulls us along for the ride.

You disingenuously posted it in a tone that made the information seem 100% confirmed from a source of yours, vs. \"rumors I heard from a rando on a public Twitter spaces\" to build your personal brand, whore clicks and cloud, and monetize. You're the worst parts of Tesla investor cultism. Actually, the worst parts of social media influencing.\n3. You distort/embellish the shit out of things, on the Twitter spaces the dude said he could do it in a fetal position while you said laying flat a 5'7 person fits. Funny how when we hear the same source we know how you stretch things, giving us a clue on what you could've \"stretched\" from past convos\n4. Speaking of which,  you're the same guy who got banned from Tesla investor events from getting info from Tesla execs in the guise of informal fan convo, then publishing everything online.
