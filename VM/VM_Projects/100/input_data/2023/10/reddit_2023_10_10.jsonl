So even if businesses that buy NKLA's vehicles are willing to build their own refueling station it's fuel is still going to be really expensive.\n\n3) Hydrogen is really dangerous. Despite there being so few hydrogen refueling stations there's already been multiple times in the last few years where there was a large explosion at said stations. In some cases these accidents were enough for the national government to order ALL hydrogen refueling stations be shutdown until the accident can be thoroughly investigated, which means if you had a Hydrogen vehicle you wouldn't have even been able to refuel it!\n\n4) The public also doesn't like hydrogen vehicles for the above reason.

I checked the sources and even the author admits that most of the universe wouldn't even have stars at this young age, and any stars that did form so early would have to be 8+ standard deviation outliers (a 1 in 10^17 chance!). even in an infinite universe, that's exceptionally rare, so the author admits the distribution would have to be non-Gaussian and permit much larger distribution tails (called kurtosis)  \n\nbut your problems don't end there. to form a rocky planet, you need rocks, which means you need elements heavier than H and He, which is all the universe had when it started. thus, you need a star to go supernova to create your heavy elements and we have found that they really don’t make very many heavy elements only neutron star mergers do, then you need those elements to cool and collapse into a second round of star formation, out of which a planet could then coalesce and form. this cycle itself is likely to take more than the 10-20 million year age of the universe, making planets by the time the universe was 20 million years old nearly impossible under our current models. not to mention said planet would be bombarded by the most insane gamma bursts ever on a constant basis. keep in mind it took earth hundreds of millions of years to cool down, and that’s with a cold cosmic background allowing lots of blackbody radiation. \n\nhe then links this with a theory about the complexity of genetic code over time possibly giving it a timeline of 10 billion years back to said habitable epoch, and even this is full of holes and ignores pretty much everything we know about abiogenesis.

This implies that the market at large thinks interest rates will *decrease* long term (because they are willing to lock up long term debt at rates lower than currently available).\n3. Therefore, this is often considered to be a \"predictor\" of recession, since rates are cut in recessions/downturns.\n\nHowever, to my thinking, an alternate explanation for the current yield curve inversion is not that the market expects a recession but that the market continues to expect rate cuts from the Fed because many believe the Fed has \"over raised\" the prime rate.\n\nWe've seen time and again the more bullish (on equities) declare boldly that the Fed will announce a pause in hikes or cut to rates at the next meeting, even though the Fed keeps raising (over the last 18 months). Could this persistently dovish bent in the market psychology be the explanation for the yield curve inversion?

{"title": "The bond market is signaling that the economy is fucked", "selftext": "Last week, I posted [an explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16y44xr/10yr_bond_yields_are_spiking_what_does_this_mean/) of what the spiking long-term bond yields mean for the economy. VM gave a great TLDR:  *The Fed's rate hikes are finally having their intended effect of sucking liquidity out of the system. This will lead to a sell-off in risk assets, and potentially a recession.*\n\nBut there was one loose thread in my thesis there. When recession is imminent, the yield curve should un-invert by having the short-term yields collapse below the long-term yields. But the un-inversion we were witnessing was happening in the opposite direction. Long-term yields were rising to meet short-term. So how and when would the un-inversion flip from one mechanism to the other?\n\nWell, just a week later, it's happening. Short-term yields have begun their collapse. Long-term yields are also declining now, but slower than short-term, meaning the un-inversion continues. The economy is ***fucked***. We have entered the final stage of the bubble pop.\n\n**Here's why:**\n\nImagine you're a savvy investor or finance professional, and you have a ton of cash sitting in short-term Treasury bills (or your HYSA, or whatever). That money is still pretty liquid, and available to jump on investment opportunities, buy houses, etc. You saw the rise in 10yr yields and thought to yourself, \"well 4.8% for 10 years is nice, but I'm happier getting 5.7% in my 6 month bonds for now.\"\n\nBut now too many people are follow that strategy, buying up the short-term bonds, and those short-term yields start to collapse. Your advantage over a long-term strategy starts to suffer. *Even worse* is, you see the long-term yields start to go down a little bit too! What if they keep going? This might be your last chance to lock-in >4% for 10 years! Okay, better take your available cash and park it in those long-term bonds.\n\nSuddenly, your liquidity is gone. But everyone else is in the same boat as you. *Everyone's* liquidity is gone. That ocean of money that was keeping prices and employment high just evaporated. And that's how you get a recession.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3lb49com3ftb1.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=022ed84b92e3de787dee181852aeb8c64b619656\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lxf405tw3ftb1.png?width=1952&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e054cf58460208824f82266b8b1f37e8269efcd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j61cahw24ftb1.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab5f7b85ed66d941647ab16aea1cfa50c6324e31\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/se7mgpt84ftb1.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4565cc2c1ea9032d73fd5cb4043fe8eb8e9266d", "id": "174sp0p", "created_utc": 1696963470.0, "score": 979, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 490, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|7 years ago\n**Total Comments**|676|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The Fed's rate hikes are finally having their intended effect of sucking liquidity out of the system.
