Tesla patented his electric alternating current (AC) induction motor on December 3, 1889 - U.S. Patent 416,194 - Electric Motor.\r  \nThe AC induction motor is a crucial component of AC electrical systems, and it's widely used in various applications, including industrial machinery and household appliances.

The Tesla Roadster – the only electric car for sale in Europe or North America -- uses an AC induction motor descended from the scientist’s original vision. Tesla Motors unveiled the Roadster in 2006, which UNESCO declared the Year of Nikola Tesla in celebration of the 150th anniversary of his birth.\r  \nFor the first time, Silicon Valley-based carmaker Tesla Motors will pay homage to its namesake, hosting a VIP celebration and prospective customer test drives April 15-16 at the TAG Heuer Boutique in Budapest.\r  \n“Nikola held more than 700 patents and remains an inspiration to me personally and to many entrepreneurs and inventors – both in Silicon Valley and around the world,” said Tesla CEO Elon Musk. “Without his vision and brilliance, our car wouldn't be possible.

Its interesting that GM's decision to scrap its EV1 program led to the birth of Tesla Motors...\n\n**What is the backstory about Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, and General Motors’ EV1 program?**\r  \n\r  \nMartin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning were early pioneers in the electric vehicle (EV) industry, and their work eventually led to the creation of the company Tesla Motors (now known as Tesla, Inc.). The backstory of Eberhard, Tarpenning, and General Motors' EV1 program is as follows:\r  \n\r  \n**General Motors' EV1 Program:**\r  \nGeneral Motors (GM) launched the EV1 program in the 1990s, primarily in response to the California Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate, which required major automakers to produce a certain number of zero-emission vehicles, including electric cars. The EV1 was a groundbreaking electric car developed by GM and was one of the first mass-produced electric vehicles of the modern era. It was available for lease to customers in California and Arizona.\r  \n\r  \n**Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning:**\r  \nMartin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning were two entrepreneurs with a strong interest in electric vehicles. They were inspired by the possibilities of electric cars and saw the potential to revolutionize the automotive industry. However, they were frustrated by the limited availability of electric cars and the perceived lack of progress in the industry at the time.\r  \n\r  \n**Impact of the EV1 Program:**\r  \nGeneral Motors' EV1 program gained some attention and interest in electric vehicles, but it was limited in scope, and GM ultimately decided to discontinue the program and recall and scrap the leased EV1 vehicles in the early 2000s, which generated controversy and criticism. This decision left many electric vehicle enthusiasts disappointed and looking for alternatives.\r  \n\r  \n**Tesla Motors Formation:**\r  \nEberhard and Tarpenning saw an opportunity to create a new company that would produce high-performance electric vehicles. They founded Tesla Motors in 2003, with the goal of developing and producing electric sports cars that would challenge the notion that electric vehicles could only be slow, low-range, and uninspiring. Their first product, the Tesla Roadster, was introduced in 2008, and it marked the beginning of Tesla's journey in the electric vehicle market.\r  \n\r  \n**Tesla's Impact:**\r  \nTesla's success in producing electric vehicles with long range, high performance, and advanced technology has had a profound impact on the electric vehicle industry. It has played a significant role in popularizing electric cars and accelerating the transition to sustainable transportation.\r  \n\r  \nEberhard and Tarpenning, along with subsequent Tesla CEO Elon Musk and a team of engineers, contributed to the development of electric vehicles that have changed the automotive landscape. Their story highlights the important role of early innovators in pushing for the adoption of electric vehicles and advancing the technology in the industry.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \n**When did General Motors' EV1 program begin and end?**\r  \n\r  \nGeneral Motors' EV1 program began in the early 1990s and ended in the early 2000s. Here's a more specific timeline:\r  \n\r  \nDevelopment and Introduction: The development of the EV1 electric vehicle began in the early 1990s. GM introduced the EV1 as a lease-only electric car in California and Arizona in 1996.\r  \n\r  \nDiscontinuation and Recall: GM decided to discontinue the EV1 program and recalled the leased EV1 vehicles in the early 2000s. The specific timeline for the recall and the subsequent scrapping of the vehicles varied, but it was largely completed by 2003.\r  \n\r  \nThe decision to discontinue the program and recall the leased EV1 vehicles generated controversy and criticism, as many EV enthusiasts and lessees were disappointed by the move. This marked the end of the EV1 program.\r  \n\r  \n**What was the driving range of GM's EV1 vehicles?** \r  \n\r  \nThe driving range of General Motors' EV1 electric vehicles varied over the course of the program as different generations and improvements were made to the car's battery technology.\r  \n\r  \n**First Generation EV1 (1996-1997)**: The initial generation of the EV1 had a driving range of approximately 70 to 100 miles (112 to 160 kilometers) on a single charge, depending on factors such as driving conditions and the specific variant of the vehicle.\r  \n\r  \n**Second Generation EV1 (1999-2000)**: The second generation of the EV1 featured improved battery technology and had a driving range of approximately 100 to 140 miles (160 to 225 kilometers) on a single charge. These improvements were a result of advancements in battery capacity and efficiency.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to note that these driving ranges were typical for the respective generations of the EV1. The EV1 was one of the first modern electric cars to be produced at a significant scale, and the driving range was a critical factor in its design and adoption. However, these ranges are considerably less than the ranges of many modern electric vehicles, thanks to the significant advancements in battery technology that have occurred since the EV1 program.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "UnLimItEd DeManD!!!11", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "i think its because most cars are buy to order if not they would have lots of cars in storage no?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Probably that and the sentiment that EVs will continue to replace traditional vehicles in the upcoming years resulting in an increasingly large market cap. \n\nThe less established brands like RIVN seem fueled by similar hopes with larger growth potential, but the risk there is you're hoping that one of them will actually be able to develop a profitable car and become a legitimate competitor with Tesla.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "No, because their factories have been running at max capacity so far.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Max?

That's the exact problem with making money which outstrips your pace.  You pay these damned penalties because you didn't estimate enough(or at all), and of course estimating a gain like $222K in a quarter is preposterous!  \n  \nAnnualized Income Installment Method is the specific worksheet that OP needs -it's a part of the estimated taxes specific to that large change in income.  You can read up on it Form1040 ES where they tell you about the estimated amount changing after March 30th, 2023.  AIIM is then part of [Publication 505](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p505) which you can follow the rules on which to pay.  It's a long ass thing, major starting point though - \"For estimated tax purposes, the year is divided into four payment periods. Each period has a specific payment due date. If you don’t pay enough tax by the due date of each of the payment periods, you may be charged a penalty even if you are due a refund when you file your income tax return.\"  So, I think because he made this amount in this quarter, he SHOULD have made estimated taxes predicting the amount which is impossible.  But, he still needs to pay by Jan 15th next year which is basically the same time you would pay estimated taxes, otherwise penalties hit.\n  \nI must say, I am no expert for sure, but I try to give warnings so people don't get fucked.

Their biggest competitor is us option Zelle and Apple Pay. Apple services absorbed lots of Pypl consumer base and continues to grow its services whilst Pypl retracts.

It’s just the fundamental fact that the pandemic pulled forward a lot of online shopping growth and it’s a tough base to grow off of going forward. While they’re great businesses, Braintree and Venmo are less profitable per transaction than the core online shopping business.
