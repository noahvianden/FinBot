The drop was caused by two major factors:\r  \n\r  \n**1.** Tesla's battery supplier, Panasonic, cut vehicle battery output in Japan during the third quarter, decreasing its annual profit prediction by 15%. This was attributable to a worldwide slowdown in EV sales. Panasonic provides battery cells to Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory in the United States. However, the Japanese manufacturing drop had an impact on customers worldwide, not only in North America.\r  \n\r  \n**2.** ON Semiconductor revealed lower-than-expected profit and revenue guidance due to decreasing sales. ON Semiconductor manufactures silicon carbide chips used by Tesla in its EV powertrain and other important components. A decline in demand for these chips is viewed as a possible indicator of slowing EV sales, notably for Tesla.\r  \n\r  \nTesla investor Gary Black said that the stock's downturn could be attributed to ON Semiconductor's -18% projection failure. This was owing to concerns about the increasing danger to vehicle demand caused by rising interest rates.\r  \n\r  \nTesla shares have dropped roughly 22% in the last month, but are still **up 60% year to date.**\r  \n\r  \n", "id": "17kias7", "created_utc": 1698749803.0, "score": 626, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 188, "comments": [{"body": "Going back to ATH would be more than 100% return.

Panasonic actually said they cut 1865 cell production in Japan, but not their 2170 cell production in the U.S. Note the 1865 cells are only used for the Model S and X. They expect sales to rebound somewhat due to Tesla‚Äôs price cuts on the S/X, especially now that the base Model X is eligible for the federal tax credit. Panasonic also said demand for the 1865 cell is not expected to fully cover production capacity (they had roughly 25,000 per quarter capacity, but Tesla is only making about 18-20k per quarter as Tesla has other logistical constraints in their Fremont factory). They also said that their demand for 2170‚Äôs is robust and they are moving ahead with their new factory in the U.S. They also haven‚Äôt sorted out the accounting for their US production tax credits.\n\nSo, in short, Tesla makes about 15-20k Model S/X per quarter, and 400,000-450,0000 Model 3/Y and Panasonic was only talking about the Model S/X in terms of production cut back.\n\nI do not think Tesla uses ON chips - STMicro is their primary supplier.

All the places I've seen regressions are to do with decision making.  General handling and control seems smooth and calculated.  Decision making - lane selection being the big one - has been the most controversial behaviour in most reviews/videos on YouTube.  \n\nI think Tesla has been slowly implementing AI control-out for very specific applications rather than just for auto-labelling of the environment.  The reason it makes decisions like attempting to go around traffic by changing into a turn lane to go through an intersection is that in its minimally trained form, it makes sense to find the path of least resistance.  This doesn't jive with traffic laws, nor is it safe, but in a closed-environment where rules haven't been trained, it makes sense for it from a logic standpoint.  \n\nI suppose I'm most surprised at how long it has been taking Tesla to train the AI with the mass data it has collected.  There will always be a lag between public builds and internal data processing, but we've gone half a year with basically the same issues.  Also, the fact that it's been so long since any talk about V12 concerns me.  I personally believe Tesla is once again falling behind Elon's overly ambitious timeline as it starts to scale the AI.  It's not a linear path, and there are likely many bumps along the road, but I think we're still a year away from anything appreciably better along with a V12 release.\n\nThis is all just my opinion based on daily driving our Model Y with FSDb.  My husband won't even use it anymore because it's so frustratingly dumb with its decision making.  I'm getting close to that point as well.  It's time for the step change Elon has been promising.

{"title": "üöÄAMD Earnings: Time to Hit it Big", "selftext": "So last week [I gave you guys AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17h0sy7/amazon_earnings_the_boomer_play_that_could_print/), the stock went up 7% after earnings and calls printed big time. An absolute banger. Now this week, let me show you what's in store for AMD and look at how we can make money on earnings tonight. Are we gonna see an earnings beat that sends us to the moon, or is it time to deploy the üí© emojis?\n\nWhether its autonomous vehicles, entertainment, or healthcare, AMD‚Äôs processors are powering people and businesses at a cutting-edge level. Yup, that's right; this chip titan's tech is in everything from your mom's car to the PS5 you can't afford. And the company will look to demonstrate how broad its reach is when it reports third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. We'll want to look to see whether AMD's streak of earnings beats can continue; working in AMD's favor is the noticeable rebound in global PC shipments suggesting that a recovery in the global PC market could be underway. \n\nIn the most recent quarter, worldwide PC shipments totaled 59.7 million units, marking an almost 17% decrease year over year. But that decline is showing signs of stabilization, [including sequential growth from the previous quarter](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/04-11-2023-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-declined-30-percent-in-first-quarter-of-2023), noted Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. ‚ÄúThe rate of decline in the PC market has slowed, indicating that shipment volumes may have reached their lowest point,‚Äù said Kitagawa, then adding, ‚ÄúThere has been progress in reducing PC inventory after more than a year of issues, supported by a gradual increase in business PC demand.\" In other words; we've hit rock bottom and it's only up from here. With PCs no longer in freefall, AMD's got a shot at keeping its stock price soaring.\n\n\nMeanwhile, AMD stock, which is up 48% year to date, while the S&P 500's playing catch-up with a measly 7%. This is because even amid the PC decline challenges or past issues related to supply chains, the company demonstrates strong operating leverage evidenced by its ability to grow profits at a faster rate than its revenue. Assuming the company‚Äôs growth metrics rebound in Q3, along with strong guidance, AMD stock will continue to rise despite its recent outperformance. This company can turn a profit faster than you can say \"capital gains tax.\"\n\nThe pencil pushers over at wall street are predicting 64 cents per share in earnings on $5.37 billion in revenue. Compare that to 67 cents and $5.62 billion last year, and you've got yourself some bearish vibes. But remember, CEO Lisa Su has hinted at a more bullish $5.7 billion revenue mark. AI demand alone could make this a $150 billion market by 2027.\n\nArtificial intelligence will continue to push the semiconductor industry, and will really help AMD well into 2024 and so on. In the meantime, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann sees the data center's strength helping AMD, especially their new MI300A/X APU/GPU compute accelerators, which could blast Wall Street's expectations. For those who don't know, he's referring specifically to their accelerated processing units and graphics processing units. More on these products later. \n\nRegulations on tech exports to China could be a curveball, but the longer-term outlook is good. PC demand is set to return by 2024, and the GPU market could grow by a crazy 34% annually over the next five years. This is as the data center industry is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.5% through 2030.\n\nIn the near term, AMD's management needs to tackle the chip industry's cyclical nature, but they've done it before. In the second quarter, the company beat on both the top and bottom lines by a penny, while Q2 revenue of $5.36 billion topped estimates by $40 million. This is despite the 18% year-over-year decline.\n\nThe beat was driven by 16% rise in the Embedded segment, which offset declines in Datacenter, Gaming and Client. During the quarter, operating income swung to a loss of $20 million from a year-ago gain of $526 million. But I expect AMD‚Äôs segment growth metrics to rebound in Q3. I'm fairly sure margin pressures have bottomed and are now ready for expansion. Assuming this comes with strong guidance for the holiday quarter. Here, AMD stock will continue to rise even with its recent outperformance.\n\nKeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh slapped a $160 price target and an 'overweight' rating, because he sees this rocket fuelling up for a late-year lift-off. He mentions, \"Despite modest risk to 4Q guidance given the pushout of MI300A volumes and a more measured Genoa ramp, investors will likely look through any near-term miss in anticipation of a December MI300X launch event and Microsoft onstage endorsement, providing a clear catalyst for the stock into the end of the year.\"\n\nAs traders, will should also look for a detailed impact from expanded restrictions on the sale of advanced technologies to China, unveiled earlier this month by U.S. Trade Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\nThe new restrictions, which expand upon new export rules put in place last year, are designed to limit China's access to \"advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to (Chinese) military applications,\" Raimondo said.\n\nChina‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs described those efforts as \"economic coercion and sci-tech bullying\" earlier this year and described the moves as \"against the principles of market economy and fair competition.\"\n\n**AMD's Products**\n\nDuring this last quarter, AMD expanded its FPGA portfolio with the launch of the Alveo UL3524 accelerator card. This is designed for ultra-low latency electronic trading applications. The latest state-of-the-art FPGA solution will help the company expand its footprint in the fintech domain. Fucking amazing. \n\nAMD also expanded its portfolio with the launch of Kria K24 System-on-Module (SOM) and KD240 Drives Starter Kit. The K24 SOM features a custom-built Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC device and the supporting KD240 starter kit is a sub-$400 FPGA-based motor control kit.\n\nThey also continued by expanding its fourth-generation EPYC CPU portfolio with the launch of 8004 series processors. These are based on Zen 4c core and a new SP6 socket. For those who don't know, the EPYC 8004 series processors can provide up to two times better SPEC power performance (per system watt) compared with the closest competition. Computerphiles believe that AMD‚Äôs EPYC 8004 series processors deliver balanced performance and excellent energy efficiency that is required at the edge.\n\nIn addition to this, AMD unveiled the new Radeon RX 7800 XT and Radeon RX 7700 XT. Anyone in the gaming space? These new graphics cards are optimized to deliver incredibly high-performance, high-refresh 1440p gaming experiences for AAA and esports titles. The company also announced the availability of AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, the next generation of the popular upscaling technology that is designed to offer massive performance boosts in supported games.\n\nAnd not even that long ago, in August, AMD announced that Amazon Web Services has expanded its 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor-based offerings with the general availability of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) M7a and Amazon EC2 Hpc7a instances.\n\nMoreover, AMD announced two new additions to the Radeon PRO W7000 series product line, the Radeon PRO W7600 and Radeon PRO W7500 workstation graphics cards.\n\n**What do the other Analysts Say?**\n\n* ‚ÄúWe expect slight upside to third-quarter results and a largely in-line-with-consensus fourth-quarter outlook. We believe PC tracked slightly better and data center tracked in line. We are modeling $300-400 million contribution from MI300 GPU in the fourth quarter, primarily from El Capitan supercomputer, which is a one-time project.‚Äù ‚Äî Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri\n\n* ‚ÄúAMD‚Äôs calendar third-quarter estimates should be achievable, particularly assuming some benefit from improving consumer PC shipments. The risk rather, in our view, is CQ4 (and perhaps CQ1). The ramp of El Capitan should provide AMD some momentum; however, we are less clear that AMD can hit elevated expectations, which we believe will eventually require better server CPU shipments in light of continued weakness in cloud-service-provider spend.‚Äù ‚Äî Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson\n\n* ‚ÄúThe AMD narrative feels all about their datacenter (and, particularly, their AI story) right now. In the near term the achievability of their second-half datacenter growth (guided to 50% half over half) will be the question (we think the growth into year-end is plausible as most of it is likely from El Capitan but Q1 estimates may bear some watching), though CPU share as Genoa finally hit crossover will also be top of mind.‚Äù ‚Äî Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon\n\n**What to do for Earnings**\n\nGiven everything that I've read so far, I'm sure calls are the way to go here. I'll be getting AMD 11/03 100c @ 2.58, the stock will need a ~5% rise to break even. I expect this and more. Keep in mind, this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. On Wednesday, we have ROKU, PYPL, and ABNB. And of course on Thursday, we have PLTR, SHOP, AAPL, COIN, DKNG, and SQ.
