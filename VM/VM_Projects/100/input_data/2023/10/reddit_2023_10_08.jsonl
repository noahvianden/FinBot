Nvidia has 0 competition and every single one of the richest people on earth is buying as many GPUs as they can, probably paying double/triple to get their hardware delivered first. This is happening right now as we speak.\n\nSooooooo ... uhm ... do only people that game 24/7 actually get what the AI revolution entails? Isn't it obvious? Are nerds with 10+ years of \"experience\" in their field the only people that can actually tell what's happening? Like do I have to be a hobby pilot for 10 years to see when a revolutionary invention is happening in the aerospace industry? Is everyone else blind to that? I'm confused. Do people always think they are being tricked when it comes to stocks? You could have had a nerdy friend working in machine learning and he could have told you everything that's going down now back in 2019.\n\nIf I understand this correctly, then the only reason Nvidia stock isn't rising every week is because people think they are being tricked by nerdy gamers?\n\nUPDATE: Alright, thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts! Really appreciate it. To wrap up, here's a summary of the reasons why Nvidia stock isn't continually rising:\n\n* People only trust their own eyes. Which I think is fair. I could sit here forever explaining how the AI revolution will play out and people would still wait until they can actually feel the impact themselves. For example, in the next 4 weeks, ChatGPT will roll out an image creator. A large amount of normies will absolutely love that feature. Normie subs to ChatGPT -> normie loves it -> normie understands Nvidia hardware is driving it -> normie invests -> stock rises. That's the only way it happens. No reddit post can compete with that.\n* Supply. Nvidia just can not keep up with the orders. The demand is wayyy higher than the supply. And this isn't changing anytime soon. Takes forever to build these factories.\n* Ursula got wind of the numbers Nvidia is crankin' out and is preparing a 4 billion fine for being smarter than the competition.\n* Geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nUPDATE: gg :)", "id": "1734880", "created_utc": 1696784682.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.21, "num_comments": 243, "comments": [{"body": ">Shouldn't the Nvidia stock be skyrocketing?\n\n\\+219.68% YTD is not skyrocketing enough for you?", "score": 476, "replies": [{"body": "No. Not when OP bought at 500", "score": 99, "replies": []}, {"body": "At least he's honest.", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "I bought Nvidia at 130 but I‚Äôm still not satisfied.

Owning stock in a company means you own a portion of all that company's assets, their debts and any assets and debts they might have in the future if you choose to continue owning the stock.\n\nGiven this when you buy stock in a company you want to understand if the price you're paying for your ownership in the company makes sense. You do this by looking at the assets and debts of the company today and make assumptions about what you believe the company's assets and debts might be in the future. Typically this is done by projecting a company's future cash flows (if you don't know what clash flow is think profit).\n\nAll else being equal you would pay more for stock in a company if that company has more assets (such as cash) on their balance sheet than at some point in the past. You would also pay more for a company's stock (all else being equal) if some new information arrises which causes investors to believe the company is likely going to have more assets in the future than perviously thought. Eg, investors want to buy now at a higher price because they believe in the future the company is going to be more profitable than they previously thought.\n\nThe things you said in this post are already completely understood by investors. Investors already believe Nvidia is going to do very well in the future and are paying a huge premium to own Nvidia stock right now. In fact Nvidia stock is so expensive many believe that the expectations may be too high despite the obvious tailwinds for the company in the coming years.\n\nThe reason Nvidia stock isn't just going to go up and up every day is because there is nothing making the stock more attractive to own on a daily basis.

Something needs to have changed in your outlook to believe it is worth more.\n\nYour issue is that you don't understand how stocks are priced. Everything you've said is already priced into Nvidia's valuation and has been for some time. If you want to see a good example of why what you're saying doesn't work look at the stock price of Intel over the last 30 years. In the 90s investors believe that computers and microchips were going to be the next big thing so they paid a huge premium to own Intel stock expecting massive amounts of growth. Of course looking back today they weren't wrong, but the investors who paid that huge premium in the 90s didn't do all that well on their investment because although the company did amazing, it never quite lived up to the expectations investors had in the late 90s.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "It‚Äôs simpler than this.

It goes down when people sell the stock (they accept a lower price to sell it). In general people want to buy stock at a low price and sell them at a high price. That's causing the volatility.\n\nTo answer your question, the stock price of Nvidia will probably go up in the future, if the company can prove they sell enough products. Right now, most people who are interested in investing in Nvidia have already invested in them. For the stock to go up even more there should be a higher demand (either more people who want to invest in Nvidia or/and fantastic results by the company).

Made a few tens of dollars and once I saw the potential I dropped $2500 into my brokerage and doubled it within 2 weeks. My portfolio was at 6k but I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the dollar amount. Next few days, I evaporated the profits. However, I wasn‚Äôt done.\n\nIn the beginning of the 2nd month I dropped 20 grand in my brokerage after realizing I need more capital to make a significant amount in this game. At this point, I kinda got the gist of options and majority of my setups/ predictions were hits. I started focusing on psychology. I knew from the start that this was a lot of people‚Äôs kryptonite so I binged Mark Douglas and other trading psychology videos. Slowly but surely I became profitable again(all time) on my portfolio with MSFT swings when they announced copilot 365 pricing.\n\nYour biggest loss is always right after your biggest win. I knew I was about to snap these gains into nothingness but didn‚Äôt know what to do about it. I damn near lost it all in earnings plays. Literally all my earnings picks flopped‚Ä¶hard. NTFLX, TSLA, it almost felt targeted like the market was waiting on my next move.\n\nFrom the day that I lost more than 10 bands in MSFT earnings, my account saw more reds than a Manchester United jersey. I‚Äôm talking BACK TO BACK red days. My account went from 30 grand to 10k in less than 2 WEEKS. I started trading 0DTEs to get my money back quickly‚Ä¶ no chance! The whole of August was‚Ä¶RED, the reversals were straight up ungodly. I was losing 50% of my portfolio with 6k in buying power. I wanted to experience what a tilt was sooner than later but I didn‚Äôt know it would last this long and demolish 95% of my portfolio. That 10k turned into 800 in the blink of an eye. My mental health was in the trenches but I knew this was part of the process. My portfolio was in shambles, so I had to reup with 10 bands. I decided to play NVIDIA straddles as my last card with earnings and what do you know? It also flopped.\n\nFast forward, September, I made consistent profits by scalping. Little profits, but profits regardless. My mentality was/ is break even is better than a red day. Last month I had only 4 red days and ended the month green, where each day was either break even or profit. My main goal was to not have any red days rather than make money.\n\nHowever, this first week of October was just not my week. Stress and frustration got to me. Monday, my devices were lagging and I missed out on my play of the day. Then I rushed into something else and ended up having to scramble to break even when it should‚Äôve been an easy green day. Slightly worse on Tuesday, I caught the top of the market‚Äôs INSANE dump for puts but my order was rejected(for the first time ever) and I missed out. Barely slept for Wednesday and the same thing from Monday happened and I had to break even.\n\nThursday was just the perfect setup for what would happen on Friday.

So I quickly entered SPY 0dtes to make 20 bucks. 2hrs later, the 1k profit went down to 250. I usually trade weeklies, so I only ever use 0Dtes to make back money from a losing trade. I ended the day with one of the weirdest feelings I‚Äôve ever felt. I still felt high from the 1k win but ALSO a cloud of shock and disbelief that I gave 800 back trynna make 20 bucks. Come Friday(yesterday), I wasted absolutely no time to revenge trade. Entered Tesla & Nvda puts as early as I could. Decided to not only double down but more than quadruple down. Just seeing the money casually float away like a canoe to the horizon but I was too uneasy to help myself. My hope was that the last time I sold a losing trade 2 weeks ago, it went deep in the money and I would‚Äôve turned 400 to 15k. But all 3 of my strategies expired worthless.\n\nEven though it‚Äôs hard to grip any handle of hope, I feel like I have to face the music at this point. My previous routine was scalping aggressively with a super tight stop loss of less than 1%. Even with my tight stop losses, Risking 60% of my port for 3% gain was simply not sustainable. What I need to do now is to be more selective and trade less AND still keep my stop loss. I refuse to let the market defeat me. I‚Äôm down $30,000+ but I still have 2500 to make that back. My biggest hurdle is ignoring my previous losses and treating this account like a brand new one. Making 300 a day is hard to appreciate when you know you‚Äôre down more than 30k. I might do monthly updates or just post when I make a million bucks depends on what y‚Äôall say in the comments lmao.\n\n\nTLDR: Been trading for 5 months.
