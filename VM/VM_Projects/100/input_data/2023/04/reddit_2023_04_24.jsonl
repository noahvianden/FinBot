If so, what strike are you comfortable with expiration.", "id": "12xle8d", "created_utc": 1682350230.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "Current price of TSLA is 160.39 as of this writing.  If you are long TSLA and your target price is 190 by July here is a trade with a trade plan that you can look into for demo account only. It is for a long diagonal: Buy 1 July 165 call and Sell 1 May 170 (35 delta) call for a debit of 10.50.  Risk is 10.50 to the downside which will be realized if TSLA drops to 85 based on risk graph.  There is also a 5.50 risk to the upside if TSLA rallies to 300 by May expiration.  This is a long delta and long theta position.\n\nHow to manage if TSLA goes down: Sell to close position if TSLA underlying is less than 149.88.  This will result in a $170 loss based on risk graph. At this point, consider buying stock if you are still bullish.  This would have saved you $1000 had you bought stock at 160 (current price now), and then it dropped to 150 which would result is a $1000 loss on paper.\n\nHow to manage if TSLA goes up:  If TSLA rallies to 169 before May expiration (25 DTE) Buy To Close 170 call and Sell To Open June 180 Call 35 delta (or whatever delta that will net a credit)  for a credit.  You will now have a  July 165/ June180 call long diagonal.  If TSLA continues to rally to 180, Buy To Close 180 and Sell To Open July 190 Call.  The end result will be a July 165/190 Bull call spread.  At expiration, if the 190 is ITM, you can close as a spread, Sell to Close 165/190 for a credit of 25.00 at MOC.  If the 190 is not in the money at expiration, you can exercise your 165 call if you desire is to own the stock.  You will have the right to buy TSLA for 165 and sell CC or whatever your heart desires.  If any of the short strikes do not get touched, let the calls expire and sell weekly 35 deltas.  To summarize, you are selling 35 delta and buying to close and rolling when those deltas hit 48-50 when they are ATM and then selling a further out 35 delta or whatever strike will net a credit.   \n As I mentioned earlier, this position is long delta so as long as you close the shorts early enough before the deltas get too large, your position will profit each time you roll for a credit.  Your 165 longs will have a larger delta than the new short call's delta each time to roll.

(Would you?) \n\nI would close the position if the [trade plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan) I defined before opening the trade said it was time to close it. A trade plan includes an exit strategy, and a minimal exit strategy has a profit target, a loss limit, and a maximum holding time.\n\n> 3.) When closing the position I am confused on the best way to go about it. Would I be better off selling the contracts or exercising them?\n\nTL;DR -- **Never exercise when your extrinsic value is greater than zero.**\n\nYou didn't say what the current value of the puts are, but let's use $.19 as an example. Premium on contracts is composed of intrinsic value plus extrinsic value, either of which may be zero. Intrinsic value for an ITM put is the strike price minus the current price, so in this case, 2.00 - 1.88 = .12. Extrinsic value is the full premium value minus the intrinsic value, so .19 - .12 = .07.\n\nSo in summary, if your put was worth .19, it would have **.12 of intrinsic value and .07 of extrinsic value**.\n\nSince .07 is greater than zero, don't exercise. Exercise would be equivalent to setting $42 on fire (since you have 6 contracts).\n\nClosing profitable contracts is always preferable to exercise, given that you lose all the extrinsic value upon exercise.\n\n> 4.) Is it unwise to wait until expiration if you are in the money? What happens if it expires and I do nothing?\n\nBasically, yes it is unwise. Profit today is almost always worth more than maybe more profit tomorrow, if there is a chance that profit could turn into a loss.\n\nIt is even unwise to try to squeeze a little extra profit out of the contract, since the risk/reward ratio can become diminishing returns.\n\n[Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/risk_reward_and_exits)\n\n**IF** you do nothing **AND IF** the puts are still ITM by at least 1 penny on expiration, you will be exercised-by-exception.

Since then it has drifted down to the 16-19 range which means the market is in a low vol period.\n\nMay 5th is 9dte so I don't think you adjusted too early when the short leg went ITM.  While rolling for a net credit is very desirable, moving the trade out to give it more time for $0 is at least a free roll.

Collecting $28 more drops the max risk down to $140.  Unfortunately IC s are difficult to roll so this is not usually reasonable to do.  Closing for a profit or letting the call side expire may allow you to roll the put credit spread out and possibly collect some additional credit to keep lowering the max loss amount.  As long as more credits are being collected without adding any additional risk there is no such thing as over adjusting IMO.  \n\nIf you reach a point where your analysis is showing the stock may not be moving back up then at least you can close for a much smaller loss and move on to your next trade.

This isn't new though.  In this interview with [Tesla Owners Silicon Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHmSrK238vI&t=2320s) last summer he said:\n\n\"*It's really the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money or worth basically zero.*\"\n\nOn the recent [Q1 earnings call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MVIWeU36ZY) (56:50), after repeating his yearly prediction that FSD will be 'solved' this year:\n\n\"*We're the only ones making cars that technically, we could sell for  zero profit for now and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy.  I'm not sure many people will appreciate the profundity of what I've just said, but it is extremely significant.*\"\n\nNow Elon has said this kind of thing many times before, but what's interesting is that it's not just him saying this - the actions of the company indicate they really do believe this.  The actions being:\n\n* Huge investment in the Mexico Gigafactory, which is all designed around the 3rd gen vehicle ... which they internally refer to as 'Robotaxi'.\n* Willingness to cut prices drastically and lose out on margin short term because they believe FSD will make up the shortfall in the future.\n\nIt's easy to disbelieve that FSD will be fully solved soon because of the ever-slipping deadline, but Giga Mexico will likely be open and operating in limited capacity by the end of next year - which isn't that far away.  Seems that Tesla/Musk genuinely believe FSD will be solved by then at least?\n\nI don't have FSD myself, but from watching the videos on YouTube two things seem clear:\n\n* It has improved tremendously since first release\n* It is not ready yet\n\nThe big question is why would Elon & Tesla make such a big bet on FSD if they weren't confident it will actually work, and work soon?\n\nI wonder if HW4 has something to do with this, which Tesla have been very quiet about (understandably, as they won't want to Osbourne their current HW3 cars).

Tony Stark is political, but only in fiction, which doesn't make us look at him with cavemen  goggles.\n\nRemember, the government told Tony to give his technology up. Tony said to go f themselves. We cheered. Government tells Elon to shut up, tries to fund his competitors, and tries to build tax laws specifically to take his money and his control over his companies. He says go eff yourselves. People say he's a douchebag and a monster. If Tony were real, not only would everyone be calling him a POS, they'd try to tax him to death to the point where he would not actually be able to afford being Iron Man.

He'd lose 18 billion the first year, then lose control over his company. Then he'd lose 30 billion in value via a depreciation of his remaining stock due to downward selling pressure and losing control of his business. He'd lose basically another 10 out of a remaining 52 billion based off arbitrary math regarding his suits.

This says nothing of the markets they still have to enter.  The reason they have this lead is because they're taking nothing for granted and in part realizing efficiencies that one only can when they look to eke out efficiencies at every turn.\n\nTo be honest, it seems like you don't actually disagree with that entirely, and almost seems like you're just itching for an argument anyway.  I stand by my statement though that cars are NOT a \"solved\" thing.  Elon's own statements about the true difficulty of scaling and maintaining a lead in that regard back up that sentiment.  He's literally stated that creating the vehicle itself isn't the biggest challenge, it's manufacturing it at scale.  And that was a statement he made for a single model - they've got entire market segments they've yet to enter.  Their $10T capex plan kind of underlines this reality.  Part of that investment is continuing to push the kind of advancements in both the actual product technology and manufacturing capability that they've done to date.\n\nIf you're going to argue that point, then actually argue it with an engaged response instead of just insulting me.

And that creates a self-fulfilling prophesy, where companies really \\*will\\* react to social media, because they think that everyone reacts to them.\n\nAs some of the sloshing money is taken out of the economy, and companies have to actually work to make a buck, this thesis is failing.  Look for firms to return to worrying about fundamentals, which means we will return to a time when there might be a storm on social media, but nobody (including companies) cares.\n\nNot a knock on social media.  I spend too much time there myself.

If people get out of whichever bubble they are in (does not matter to which side of the debate), they will find that most people are still curious, still have questions, and still see Tesla as the undisputed leader in EVs.\n\nMost of the confusing noise is coming from people who saw Twitter as \"theirs\", and are angry now that they feel like it belongs to \"the enemy\".  In the wake of that, they started making wild theories that Twitter was going to collapse.

This seems to already be the case, and as terrible terrible things continue to not happen to them and the economy eventually recovers, they will slowly ramp up their ad spending.\n\nAll this culminated in that infamous interview a few days back, where the best that the BBC could muster crashed and burned.

Look at something like Dojo where a huge amount of it is just dedicated to moving data around. And there's also sorts of designs for compute with embedded memory to make it more efficient and faster because a ton of time and energy in any CPU is just moving data. \n\nIf the first AGI can run on a raspberry pi, then making a million of them might be easy, but the networking would still be hard.

A google TPU uses about 200 watts per chip and has about 4,000 chips in a pod. So if a single pod could run an AGI it would be about 40,000x less efficient than a brain. But there's no guarantee that that would be enough hardware, especially if we're talking about superhuman AI Maybe you'd need something like a dojo exapod to run an AI that's significantly smarter than a human?

Given the trends in necessary compute to solve harder and harder AI tasks it looks like that hardware requirement will be pretty steep.\n\nEven if a single human level AGI only takes a single TPU pod to run, and even if it/we managed to get it running on every pod google has, that's thousands of new human level intelligences. Even if they can all work diligently and cooridinate efficiently, that's not going to produce more improvements faster than all of Google/OpenAI/MIT/etc. working on a similar problem. \n\nJust creating being able to create AGI doesn't mean that the singularity is imminent (although it would certainly be closer).

What happened was a testing company tried to see if gpt4 would try to \"escape\" by prompting it. As part of that it generated an email to send to a taskrabbit human, which the person running the tests actually sent. And then when questioned about whether it was a robot or not gpt4 \"reasoned\" that it should lie and said it was blind.

The New York Times said it was ‚Äúa model for the new American workplace.‚Äù The Dallas Morning News described  it as ‚Äúone of the most envied and respected corporations in the United  States.‚Äù Business Week looked at one of its pioneering ventures and said, ‚ÄúThe risk is remarkably small.‚Äù\n\nWhat company was the media talking about here? >!It was Enron Corporation!<[Source](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-jan-26-mn-24913-story.html)\n\nIf you've been lurking around here, you probably know who I am. I'm the \"idiot\" who bought 5000 shares of FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ then wrote an analysis of why I did so. Read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12hp63d/comment/jfpw63k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nI have also been keeping close tab of general sentiment on FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ so when I started noticing more and more headlines like these popping up in recent days/weeks my gifted brain switched into high gear. Take a look:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4yegokvsjva1.png?width=3564&format=png&auto=webp&s=87bc4ec3763263fd4d5539bc73044580eea4bfeb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c70r0dqarjva1.png?width=3384&format=png&auto=webp&s=e307fc498c5622967c1f37f368abc0d92454cc6f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nziir8bssjva1.png?width=2074&format=png&auto=webp&s=a931155cd2c07277bd14af9899f509b9b878b37a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zc5c0726sjva1.png?width=1662&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bc9f351bfc6516af423935a44cfeb0f07e6614e\n\nSee the pattern?\n\nIt's pretty fucked. Whatever is going on over at FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ, it ain't pretty, according to your friendly media and their hedge fund friends. You should dump it, you know, because it's fucked up. Like cocaine. It's bad for you. Matter of fact, between investing in FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ and cocaine, the latter is preferable any day, according to the media. \n\nEven the highly regarded Moody's Corporation, with a historical record of being always right and always prescient in everything they say/do, downgraded FRC several times (currently at \"junk\" status), which basically translates to \"between buying this shit and overdosing on cocaine, we recommend cocaine\"\n\nNot only is mainstream media overwhelmingly bearish/negative on FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ, but WSB is too! Just look around. Even on posts authored by me, ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s6xmg/you_have_less_than_one_week_to_get_in_on_frc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ufinh/degenerates_you_have_less_than_48_hours_to_get_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)),  if you go through the top comments, they're essentially variations of \"this guy is going to lose his shirt\", \"loss porn coming soon\", and \"Wendy's\". I still get countless messages everyday asking if I regretted my decisions, if I cried to mommy, or pussied out and paperhanded.\n\nTo answer your question in the affirmative: No, I have not. I have not changed my stance or my opinion by one inch and I have not sold a single share even though I'm in the money. Like I said before, I ain't about little profits, I'm about big profits and since I truly think that FRC can touch the moon, why sell now? üöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\nIn other words, while WSB and the entire world expects to see FRC fucked in every hole, here is lonely little me, trillionairekid, one lonely soul speaking up in favor of this stock in a sea of naysayers, and going against massive headwinds from every direction. If it wasn't for me, the narrative about FRC on WSB would be overwhelmingly negative, a narrative dominated by the hedgies and their media friends, who of course has massive short positions on FRC stand and has everything to gain from FRC going titsup. \n\n\"But, trillionairekid, if everyone is bearish on this stock, what makes you bullish???\" Good question degenerates. I explained it in my original analysis, but what I didn't say there is that I understand the fundamental truth which is that this game ain't a popularity contest. It ain't about going along with the fucking sheep herd, led by the nose by the hedgies and their media friends. The name of the game is to **INVERSE.** Run when the everyone tells you to buy, buy when everyone tells you to run. \"The time to buy is when there's blood in the streets.\" I believe I alone have played a considerable part in reversing the prevailing narrative towards FRC especially on WSB, and the trend has somewhat improved over the past week, but the sentiment about FRC on WSB and everywhere else is still ***extremely*** negative and bearish. \n\nI invite you to study my posts:\n\n1.

They report tomorrow so we don't know how much has returned since, but so far all regionals have shown that significant portion of the deposit outflows did in fact return in the weeks since mid March.\n\nNow, neither of these banks cancelled dividends, suspended exec pay or used the \"crisis\" word, like FRC did.\n\nSo it is safe to assume that FRC's situation is worse (i.e.  > 20% deposit losses during peak).\n\nIn the media it was reported that \"sources familiar with the matter\" were saying about 40% (or \\~70bln) of deposits left FRC during the peak of the panic runs.\n\nAssuming that's true, and that since then FRC would've seen similar returns to WAL, we would be looking at a gap of \\~50bln (before considering the 30bln deposited by the other banks).\n\nWhile that would certainly qualify as a \"crisis\" and require a considerable reorg to allow the bank to move forward, I believe that's exactly what this bank, that has historically been a very well run bank, is doing.\n\nThere's a multitude of ways to interpret the numbers from here, but I believe the bank will report losses of around 20-30bln (when considering the 30bln deposit), and their plan on reducing their liabilities moving forward, which will almost certainly involve selling some parts of the assets.\n\nHowever, there is no indication the bank is in any danger of lacking liquidity, and I believe the ER will show they still have a good amount of cash available.\n\nI am bullish in the mid to long term on the bank.\n\nI don't necessarily think this will 3-4x by the end of the week, but I think 2x is possible, and 3x later this year/early next year depending on other macro conditions.", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "And there's a lot smarter people with more money than us that can see this too.", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Fuck it.

If you question him, he has to pull up more tweets and quotes on his phone that he can't recite off the top of his head, and if you back him into a corner, he just defers to the \"experts\" and sends you some hour long youtube video.\n\nIt's been crazy to watch him completely lose himself to the tesla cult.
