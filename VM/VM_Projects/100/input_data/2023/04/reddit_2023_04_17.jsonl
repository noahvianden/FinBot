So what delta would the short leg be? If the long is 18 delta, that means the short put is higher delta by some amount. \n\nAlso, it would be useful to know the width of the spread you are contemplating.

Count every *change in direction* (buy after opening sell, sell after opening buy) for that day against PDT. \n\nSo if your quantity 5 lot is opened (buy) as one trade and you close (sell) quantity 5 as one trade, that's 1 round-trip for PDT purposes, because one lot saw one change in direction.

I do not have any permissions to trade bonds, Interactive Brokers does not think they are appropriate for me. There is the back ground, now for the joke. One day I sold a good bit of my positions since I thought they were over valued, went to put it into SPY till I found a spot to invest it. Not the best for taxes, I know. But, when I went to buy SPY I accidentally shorted it by how much I meant to buy it. Turned a $3 profit on it, only had the position for a few seconds before I noticed. But I went up the controller I work with and told him “I can accidentally short the market but I can’t buy a fucking bond”? He found it funny. Hope you did too.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">  “I can accidentally short the market but I can’t buy a fucking bond”?\n\nThat is funny! Thanks for sharing.

Each contract has it's own sweet spot, if it has one at all. If you go too far OTM, liquidity becomes unacceptably bad. If you go too close to the money, risk increases and EV drops.\n\nSo there isn't one volume level that works for all contracts. You have to figure out what the liquidity sweet spot is for each contract series, with the understanding that, like EV, the sweet spot can change over time or disappear altogether.\n\nNow all that said, for my +EV credit trades, I like to see at least 100 volume on the ATM strike and 10 volume around 30 delta, after the first hour of trading during each market session. Those are *very low* volume numbers, so liquidity and bid/ask spread cost inefficiency are going to be issues. As I've mentioned before, even with a large watchlist of underlyings, I can go several days in a row without finding a good trade.\n\nBut don't give up. You just have to monitor your watchlist each day, or set up alerts, to catch those fleeting moments when +EV is offered.\n\nAre you looking at IV?

The time to take it out should be a 2-year window far in the future; the window is to let you wait out a potential recession. The market always bounces back higher.\n\nNow this next part depends on how old you are and what age you want to cash out but most people aim for 30+ years on this type of fund.

This number removes inflation and covers a lot of fees. Fill the rest out how you want and the numbers it returns will be the equivalent of you being given that money today. The difference between 21 and 30 years essentially doubles your return. Try other combinations of the fields like adding a percent to the interest rate or aiming for a high monthly contribution if you don't have many initial funds.\n\n\nI can't tell you much about Fidelity specific fees. They may offer a tax calculator or you can use a generic one.\n\nInstead of S&P look into VTI or VOO.

And, I submit this respectfully, because it’s important to understand how the DoL and government manipulates this to puppet the citizens. This is apolitical- both parties do this. \n\nWhile it is true that the unemployment rate in the US has been relatively low in recent years, there are several factors that could lead one to argue that the true level of unemployment is actually higher than what is officially reported. Here are some possible arguments:\n\n1.  Labor Force Participation Rate: The labor force participation rate, which measures the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking employment, has been declining in the US since the turn of the century. This suggests that there are many people who have given up looking for work and are no longer counted as part of the labor force. If these people were included in the unemployment calculations, the unemployment rate would be higher.\nUnderemployment: The official unemployment rate only takes into account people who are actively seeking work and unable to find it. However, there are many people who are employed, but in part-time or low-paying jobs that don't match their skills or education. These people are considered underemployed and are not included in the official unemployment rate. If underemployment were taken into account, the unemployment rate would be higher.\n\n2.  Discouraged Workers: There are many people who have been unemployed for so long that they have become discouraged and stopped actively seeking work. These people are not counted in the official unemployment rate, but they are still part of the potential labor force. If these people were included in the calculations, the unemployment rate would be higher.\n\n3.  Wage Stagnation: Despite low levels of unemployment, wages have remained stagnant for many workers in the US. This suggests that there is still significant slack in the labor market, with workers unable to command higher wages due to competition from unemployed or underemployed workers. This suggests that the official unemployment rate may not be capturing the true level of slack in the labor market.\n\nOverall, while it is true that the official unemployment rate appears low, the true level of unemployment in the US is actually higher than what is officially reported.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Unemployment IS super low..", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Ah.

So unless these experts you speak of are themselves, self made millionaires who have predicted past event even remotely accurately, then they arent experts at economics.\n\nAnyway, recession was here last year. I have no idea why people keep talking like its \"coming.\" It already happened. We are still in it and have been for about a year give or take. The economy is about as strong as any normal period in time, if not a little better overall. For example, the 2000s decade was far worse even outside the major crashes. The only upswing was during the easy money leading up to the bubble and the few tech companies that emerged. Otherwise, the economy was worse for the layman. Buying power was far lower despite current inflation. It didnt get low till after the great recession.\n\nShort away. Im not trying to stop you. I respect your opinion too but im telling you now, your sentiment is the popular one across the board. It no different than what people were saying in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2011, 2012 and so on.

This could imply that the Fed will maintain its accommodative monetary policy for longer, which could support the stock market.”\n* “Tesla’s delivery numbers exceeded analysts’ expectations and showed strong demand for its electric vehicles. This could boost its revenue and profitability in the quarter and improve its competitive position in the industry. Tesla’s stock price could rise on this positive news.”\n* “GameStop’s stock sale plan indicates that it is trying to take advantage of its elevated share price and raise capital to fund its turnaround strategy. However, this could also dilute existing shareholders and put downward pressure on the stock price. GameStop’s stock price could drop on this announcement.”\n\nI think this is a fascinating application of AI and NLP to the financial domain, and I wonder how accurate and reliable ChatGPT can be in its predictions.

Which is way before Musk was super rich or super famous and if most people had heard of him, they just thought he was some rich guy with some weird startups:\n\n> Almost every person I talked to at both Tesla and SpaceX emphasized how much of an expert Musk is at their particular field, whether that field be car batteries, car design, electric motors, rocket structures, rocket engines, rocket electronics (“avionics”), or aerospace engineering. He can do this because of a combination of his immensely thick tree trunk of fundamental understanding of physics and engineering and his genius-level ability to retain information as he learns it.\n\n> It’s that insane breadth of expertise that allows Musk to maintain such an abnormally high level of control over everything that happens at his companies. About SpaceX’s rockets, Musk said, “I know my rocket inside out and backward. I can tell you the heat treating temper of the skin material, where it changes, why we chose that material, the welding technique…down to the gnat’s ass.”4\n\n> I asked SpaceX’s VP of Software Engineering, Jinnah Hosein, about Musk’s nanomanagement. He said:\n\n> *The biggest surprise for anyone first joining the company—SpaceX throws around term “nanomanager,” and you’re like, “Okay he likes to go down in the weeds, that’s cool”—but you have no idea. For the CEO of the company, he has an incredibly deep stack—he has all that info available to him, and he can drill down on any one thing, and often does. He’s making very low-level decisions and very low-level course directions for the company, with high fidelity, and I can’t imagine it working with anyone else at any other company. The thought of one person being a key decision point for so many things is remarkable to me—he can hold it all it in his head and recall it on demand in real time, as necessary, in order to be able to make good decisions.*", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "It's a great quote indeed, and almost a decade later it still matches almost one-to-one with what (former) Tesla/SpaceX employees say about him today.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "In fact, Elon hid emeralds in the carbon sleeved rotor prototypes for fun.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "It would be *amazing* if they called their next premium trim the “emerald edition”\n\n*Amazing*", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Based on the release notes, FSD may finally be able to pick the correct fucking lane to stay in.

He scored a gotcha on a single person, not the fucking BBC, only asswhipes pretend that this was a big victory over the bad lefty BBC.\n\nThat was my whole point, Elon acted like he was facing the BBC and the reporter got flustered, a human reaction when somebody pulls a dick move like that.\n\nOf course some people will like Elon more, those that believe the same wacko shit he does...\n\n>The point is not who is closer to the truth, but who is censoring others and steamrolling others to enforce truth, vs a personality who is pointing out hipocracy of others. A variety of viewpoints and an in-depth discussion will yield the best results. Not an expert’s proclamation.\n\nWTF, the primary point is to get as close to the truth as possible, starting of with saying this isn't as important as censoring is INSANE!\n\nThe idea we shouldn't trust experts is idiotic, WHY DO WE HAVE EXPERTS? People can't stand their own stupidity so they want to believe they are smarter than those who dedicated their life to certain subjects. Can the experts be wrong? Of course, all the time,  WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO GET IT RIGHT, is that not the goal, to get it as right as possible?\n\nHow am I projecting Carlson's insane viewpoints? HE IS REPEATING LITERAL RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA ON USA TELEVISION. He is praised by the Russians (same with Elon Musk when he says stupid shit about the war). Anybody repeating Russian propaganda, defending the genocidal, terrorist state invading a sovereign country and pretending they are somehow being forced to bomb hospitals, schools while they rape, loot, torture, murder innocents in the thousands is a traitor to humankind (if you believe human life has a basic worth).\n\nActively encouraging people to stop support for the side that the USA is backing WHILE repeating propaganda from the enemy, riling up people against their own government because of political ideology is beyond scummy.\n\nOnly those that believe the same insane shit don't understand this.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "He scored a gotcha on the BBC representative, which was indicative of the larger BBC. This reporter had been covering Twitter for a number of months, so is arguably the person BBC would have chosen as their representative. Why doesn’t BBC better prepare their staff on core topics? How weird is it to work for a company and have zero opinions on how it is structured or run? Or how weird is it to expect another party to discuss in depth their organization but not even be able to compare and contrast that to one’s own organization? The whole tone and policy-level of openness of the BBC was being judged there, not just the interviewers mental acuity. I don’t think uncle E being able to outmaneuver anyone is a surprise, more the general tone and policy of how the BBC operates and what it allows the reporters to cover, disclose, discuss, and how they structure their coverage.\n\nThe reporter was also giving expert qualifications to the “safety team” who were fired, as if their experience was the only possible way something could be done. Then when Elon says “actually? We’ve done it a better way and our numbers show hate speech has decreased” the reporter could have asked how they accomplished that task, and had an interesting bit of information for their viewers, instead, the reporter assumed there was no way what Elon was saying was possible, literally dismissing Elon’s response in preference of people who had been sacked for not being good enough/efficient enough at their job.\n\nFor example, the whole mars guy called in at the end and had a way better question than the BBC reporter! A hobbyist has better questions than the journalist. Perhaps instead of trying to target a scandal headline, the BBC could bring value by asking technical or forward looking questions, not just gossip over past struggles.\n\nI see because you don’t immediately agree with Elon’s viewpoint, you call it “wacko shit”. Why not try to see things from his perspective before coming to your own conclusion?\n\n[Truth can be a matter of perspective](https://maryfrancesflood.com/2018/02/15/truth-and-perspective/). The world is complex. The belief that only one truth is available for all situations is demonstrably false.\n\nThe point is that no experts should enforce their truth, but that true speech makes a good enough point to convince the majority eventually. I believe each person is in the best position to judge for themselves what is best for them. I would not presume to know better than another parent how to raise their child, for example. \n\nI am an engineer myself, doing some scientific work in green energy (read: “Expert”). I have seen the discourse over climate hysteria over the past decades. I have even seen the same false points about energy use that are easily disprovable through entry level engineering classes— for example, that charging an EV over coal powered power plants is somehow worse. What’s important is the *discussion* that *everyone* needs to have. You can’t skip that part, and that’s why Twitter is so important. It facilitates a discussion where ideas can compete.\n\nRailroading over people will not be productive ultimately. Just like Russia.\n\nAs for Russia, I’m not convinced the United States has a strategic interest in protecting Ukraine. No one has made a compelling argument to me as to why the Untied States is paying Ukrainians pension funds! What is our goal with fighting a proxy Cold War with Russia? No discussion of a risk of potentially getting us into WWIII? Weaponizing the dollar?\n\nInstead of forcing censure or censoring of anyone questioning the war, we need to produce *more compelling arguments* as to why the United States needs to put itself at risk by supporting this war.\n\nI also think it’s *super dishonest* to say “parroting Russian disinformation” when actually just stating Russia’s position on Ukraine in NATO for the last 20+ years. Why should we not take their position at face value, when it’s been so consistent? When people dismiss the longstanding tensions that brought us here, it kinda tells me that 1) they haven’t researched the history and therefor is operating under limited scope or 2) is lying to make their point. Neither is a good look.\n\nIf Russia has been saying for 40 years “hey, we don’t want this anti-Russia thing any closer than Germany” and it’s been creeping up and they say “we don’t want this anti-Russia NATO organization against Russia boarders” then we act all surprised when they take actions justifiable as self defense, you’re just fooling yourself. I’m not trying to justify their actions, don’t be confused. \n\nI don’t like Russia. Putin is a deush. But I find it dishonest to call someone a Russia supporter when they question the war establishment’s motives. It’s dishonest to call someone pro-Putin when they make a comment like “he picked the right time to strike”. You can hate another person and acknowledge they made a shrewd strategic move.\n\nTo claim the guy that provided the tech and paid for out of pocket the telecommunications to Ukraine for months,  pro-Russia, is just like… the opposite of what’s actually happened. Calling for further questioning or clarification of what’s going on is adding sanity or clarity, not supporting rape of Ukraine, as you claim.\n\nNeither Elon nor Tucker were supporting Russia’s attack on Ukraine, so I suggest you calibrate your radar, also perhaps have your blood pressure checked. 👍", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Yikes", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I am seeing these videos of people stealing loads of stuff from department stores.\n\nCan an American care to elaborate?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "1 day every year we have something called \"the purge\" where anything is legal", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Election day?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Mostly democrat ran cities don't prosecute these crimes.

And so, two other comments I want to make on this, just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1.\n\n> And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices. As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book given that backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022. But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs. The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focused on what our operating margin is.\n\n> And so, as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business, and as we're heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin.
