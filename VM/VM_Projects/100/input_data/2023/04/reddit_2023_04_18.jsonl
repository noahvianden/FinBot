{"title": "Time to buy Tesla ($TSLA) stock before Q1 earnings?", "selftext": " \n\nTesla ($TSLA) will be a highlight of this week’s earnings lineup, set to report its first-quarter results on Wednesday, April 19.\n\nWith shares of $TSLA off to a magnificent start this year, investors may be wondering if now is a good time to invest in the EV leader.\n\nLet’s see if Tesla stock is a buy right now or if there are better opportunities ahead.\n\n**Q1 Preview**\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla’s Q1 earnings is $0.85 per share, which would be a -20% decline from EPS of $1.07 in the prior-year quarter. Sales are expected to be up 25% at $23.56 billion Vs. $18.76 billion in Q1 2022.\n\nThe dip in Tesla’s YoY quarterly bottom line is partly attributed to higher commodity prices among raw materials like steel and aluminum in correlation with inflation. However, Tesla has also implemented several price cuts in the pricing of its EVs to boost deliveries and roll out newer models.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/nc3nuu2udmua1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d91a2d5fcfc7ad728237fb839d2e98f65d8a143)\n\nImage Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nWhile Tesla hopes its price cuts will boost demand and lead to higher sales volume, Wall Street will be closely monitoring the effect this has on the company’s earnings. To that point, many analysts are concerned that lower vehicle pricing will chip away at Tesla’s profit margins with the comany cutting its prices five times since January.\n\nTesla has now dropped the prices of its Model S sedan by roughly 5% to $89,000 and its Model X SUV by 9% to $99,000. The luxury versions of these models have also been lowered by about $5,000.\n\nWith that being said, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates Tesla should reach its Q1 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also at $0.85 per share. \n\n**Deliveries & Demand**  \n\nThe ability to continue expanding deliveries is critical during Tesla’s quarterly results. In this regard, the increasing popularity and demand for EVs may justify Tesla’s willingness to slash its prices. With demand in focus, Tesla announced earlier in the month that it delivered a quarterly record of 422,875 vehicles during the first quarter, a 36% increase from 310,000 deliveries in Q1 2022.  \n\nThis would still fall short of Wall Street’s estimates of 430,000 deliveries for the first quarter. As shown in the chart below, Tesla stock soared in its last quarterly report after beating delivery expectations but plummetted in the prior quarter when missing estimates. Still, Tesla’s ability to offer strong guidance for continued delivery growth next quarter could boost its stock. \n\n**Growth & Outlook**\n\nTesla is still the global leader in EV sales and controls about 65% of the market share in the United States. However, monitoring Tesla’s growth is very important for investors with companies like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) looking to even the playing field.\n\nAccording to Zacks estimates, Tesla earnings are expected to dip -5% this year but rebound and climb 33% in fiscal 2024 at $5.11 per share. It is important to note that earnings estimate revisions have gone down over the last quarter.  \n\nOn the top line, sales are forecasted to jump 25% in FY23 and soar another 21% in FY24 to $123.03 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would be a very stellar 401% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $24.57 billion.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/wjxy3fvzdmua1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=af3049e7976c81d7b4fddd720f49b219f194bcd6)\n\n**Performance & Valuation**\n\nTesla stock is up an impressive +52% year to date to largely outperform the S&P 500’s +8% and the Auto Manufacturers-Domestic Markets +22%. As a loose comparison, Tesla has easily topped General Motors’ +4% and Ford’s +9% YTD performance.\n\nEven better, Tesla stock has now climbed +272% over the last three years to beat the benchmark, General Motors’ +41%, Ford’s +151%, and its Zacks Subindustry’s +88%. \n\nShares of TSLA currently trade around $187 and 48.2X forward earnings which is well below its extreme decade-long high and 78% beneath the median of 223.9X. Tesla still trades above the industry average of 10.8X but Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for the company's growth as a leader and pioneer in its space.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nGoing into its Q1 report Tesla stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Tesla’s annual top and bottom line growth is still intriguing despite the decline in earnings estimates with its more reasonable P/E valuation offering support.\n\nAlthough the recent price cuts among its EVs may lead to better buying opportinuies in Tesla stock, this should also boost future demand. In this regard, investors could be  rewarded for holding on to Tesla shares at current levels especially as inflation begins to ease. ", "id": "12qiq5n", "created_utc": 1681813781.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "To me the stock price always rise high during the closest time to earning release due to hyped up, and result in little to no change or decrease after the earning release.

The new accounts carry Apple’s brand and are administered through the iPhone, but Goldman Sachs is the company’s financial partner. “We’ve obviously worked very closely at the overlap between who holds credit cards and who has a Marcus deposit and that overlap is small,” Solomon said on his company’s earnings call. “But we’ll obviously watch closely to see whether or not there’s any cannibalization.” Solomon added that the Apple offering “is a way for us to try to open up another deposit channel” and said “it’s always good for us to broaden our deposit base.”\n\nThe Apple-Goldman relationship is unique in that it brings together two historic brands in very different markets and underscores the degree to which some tech giants are jumping into financial services, potentially as competitors.

The new accounts carry Apple’s brand and are administered through the iPhone, but Goldman Sachs is the company that actually provides the financial backbone and infrastructure.\r  \nThe Apple-Goldman relationship is unique in that it brings together two high profile brands, from very different markets. This underscores the degree to which some tech giants are now leaching into financial services seeking to maintain high growth, yet potentially becoming competitors to Goldman. Apple builds fancy features for the iPhone and its Wallet app, like its Apple Card credit card, while Goldman is the actual bank behind the company’s financial services.\r  \nThe nature of business relationships, such as that between Apple Inc and Goldman Sachs, can be complex and subject to various factors that may impact their financial products in different ways. While collaborations between companies can provide benefits, there are also potential risks and challenges that could affect their own financial products in unforeseen ways.\r  \nGoldman Sachs is responsible for handling the financial aspects of the Apple Card, such as underwriting, customer support, billing, and payment processing. The collaboration between Apple and Goldman Sachs aims to provide an innovative and seamless financial product that enhances the overall experience for Apple users.\r  \nIt's important to note that while Goldman Sachs is the issuing bank for the Apple Card, Apple Inc retains control over the user experience, design, and integration of the card into its ecosystem of products and services.\r  \nPossible ways in which the Apple Inc and Goldman Sachs relationship could negatively impact Goldman's financial products:\r  \nCompetitive Landscape\r  \nThe financial services industry is highly competitive. And changes in the competitive landscape, including new entrants or evolving customer preferences, could impact the demand for Goldman Sachs' financial products, including those associated with the collaboration with Apple Inc.\r  \nGoldman has previously announced plans to become a large digital bank, perhaps competing at times with Apple to sign up new customers. For example, Goldman offers high-yield savings accounts through Marcus.

{"title": "Netflix shares sink after earnings report", "selftext": "[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/netflix-nflx-1q23-earnings.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/netflix-nflx-1q23-earnings.html)\n\n Netflix reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.\n\n* **Earnings per share:** $2.88 vs $2.86 expected\n* **Revenue:** $8.16 billion vs $8.18 billion expected\n\nOn Tuesday, Netflix said goodbye to what got it started — it’s DVD mailing business, in which it would send out the discs in red envelopes to customers. The company’s Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a blog post that it would finally wind down the DVD business, which “continues to shrink.”\n\nA year ago, Netflix had reported its first subscriber loss in a decade, sending its shares on a downward spiral, as well as those of its media peers. The results pushed Netflix and its streaming rivals to focus on profits over subscriber numbers.\n\nResults for the country’s new ad-supported tier will be top of mind. Last November, Netflix unveiled its cheaper tier with commercials, which costs $6.99 a month. The ad-supported tier came shortly after it lost subscribers as streaming competition ramped up.\n\nSarandos recently said the company is likely to offer multiple ad-supported tiers in the future.\n\nAnother focus for Wall Street will be Netflix’s crackdown on password sharing. Late last year, the company said it would begin rolling out measures to have people who have been borrowing other accounts create their own.\n\nThe company has said more than 100 million households share accounts, or about 43% of its global user base. That has affected its ability to invest in new content, Netflix has said. Both the ad-supported option and crackdown on password sharing are meant to boost profits.\n\nIn February, Netflix outlined password-sharing guidance in four countries: New Zealand, Canada, Portugal and Spain. The company said it would ask users in those countries to set a “primary location” for their accounts, and allow users to establish up to two “sub accounts” for those who don’t live in their home base for extra fees.\n\nThe company has yet to provide password-sharing guidance for the U.S., although it is expected to do so this year.", "id": "12r2j2b", "created_utc": 1681848431.0, "score": 575, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 135, "comments": [{"body": "They should have mentioned the word \"A.I.\" somewhere in the statement.", "score": 574, "replies": [{"body": "\"Artificial intelligence is helping us identify former password sharers who are trying to circumvent our crackdown by either sharing their living rooms or even live streaming their viewing experience.\"", "score": 170, "replies": [{"body": "Just talk about using AI to promote content and match genres to subscribers.

If the arrow penetrated one of these vessels, the Uruk-hai could have bled out and died quickly.\n\n    Severity of the wound: The force and speed of the arrow, as well as the type of arrowhead used, could have caused significant damage to the Uruk-hai's muscles, tendons, and nerves in the shoulder region. This damage might have been severe enough to incapacitate and eventually kill the Uruk-hai, especially given the chaotic nature of the battle and the limited medical resources available.\n\n    Cinematic effect: From a storytelling perspective, the scene might have been included to show the effectiveness and impact of the defenders' archers, as well as to create tension and drama during the battle.\n\nIt is important to note that the film adaptation may not precisely follow the events of J.R.R.

Year-on-year sales volume for the country’s brands in China are down 32 per cent in the first three months of this year, according to research company MarkLines. That compares with 9 per cent falls for both German and US groups and a 7 per cent slide for Korean automakers.  A price war sparked by Elon Musk’s Tesla has also hit European and US carmakers at a time when passenger car sales in China are falling as a result of sluggish economic growth.  But the slowdown has been particularly brutal for Japanese brands — Toyota’s sales declined in the country for the first time in a decade last year.  The sharp fall-off in sales poses a daunting challenge for Toyota, the world’s largest carmaker, which has been slower than rivals to pivot towards electric cars. The automaker has argued that not every country will be able to accommodate EVs because of electricity constraints and affordability and has bet on its hybrid models.  “There are clear signals that \\[Toyota\\] is at a tipping point,” said Tang Jin, a senior research officer at Mizuho Bank in Tokyo. He estimates Toyota’s market share in China to be 8 per cent, lagging behind VW’s 14 per cent and GM’s 10 per cent.   Toyota’s market share in China is estimated to be 8%, lagging behind VW’s 14% and GM’s 10% © Qilai Shen/Bloomberg “Last year was a watershed moment for China where the new energy vehicle market accounted for 25 per cent,” said Tang, referring to the category which includes plug-in hybrids, pure battery and hydrogen-powered cars.  “Toyota is the best-selling brand among Japanese players, but as overall demand for gasoline-powered vehicles in the market declines, it has not been able to capture business in growing areas.”  Toyota is unveiling two new models from its electric bZ series at the Shanghai auto show this week. The automaker had said earlier in April that two locally-developed models would be launched in China next year.  In March, Toyota’s year-on-year sales in China dropped 19 per cent. Honda also reported a 19 per cent fall and sales at Nissan were down 25 per cent. The slowdown was accelerated by the removal of Beijing’s generous tax cuts on combustion engine cars in December.  “The buying frenzy has slowed down in China,” a Toyota executive said at a news conference in February. “Although Covid restrictions have been lifted, we are currently not optimistic about the market.”  Before the pandemic, Toyota had invested heavily in China to take on Volkswagen, which entered the market 17 years earlier in 1985 through local joint ventures.   In 2016, Volkswagen sold 3mn vehicles, or 2.5 times more than Toyota but the sales gap between the two automakers narrowed to just 360,000 units last year.  Despite its reluctance to go “all-in” on electric vehicles, Toyota has attempted to accelerate its electric shift in China.  In 2019, the Japanese group signed deals with Chinese battery giant CATL to develop batteries for electrified vehicles. It also partnered with BYD, China’s largest electric and hybrid carmaker, on the sedan bZ3, its second mass-produced electric model in China expected to be launched this year.  The model will be produced at a plant in Tianjin, using a $1.2bn production line dedicated to producing electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.  Recommended  John Gapper Toyota has a tragic flaw in the electric vehicle drama  The company is also putting its high-end Lexus brand at the forefront of its more aggressive battery push, with all of these models becoming pure electric by 2035.  Analysts said one of the main challenges for Japanese carmakers is whether they can maintain their prices and profitability as Tesla and BYD intensify their price war.  Toyota and other Japanese brands have previously enjoyed relatively high margins for their petrol cars and hybrids but may need to sacrifice short term profitability, according to Jing Yang, a Shanghai-based director for Fitch Ratings.  “Among EV brands, only Tesla and BYD are profitable in China at the moment, and most other competitors are striving to ramp up sales volume at the cost of thin margins or even at loss,” said Yang. !<", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Media: Meanwhile… Tesla has a demand issue.
