When you trade something like earnings which has an elevated implied volatility attached to it, you are also trading with vega highly in mind.\n\nIn a scenario where you sell a short put, you can still make money if the stock price falls a small amount due to IV crush. This is why you often see people buying options for earnings and losing money even though they got the direction right. \n\nIn the case of OP, he was wrong and sold short puts, which gained value as TSLA fell, and with the IV crush post earnings it was not enough to reduce the loss due to delta as the stock fell.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wait, so normally, if TSLA goes down, the OP's short PUTs would have lost value right?\n\nThe only reason why the short PUTs are gaining value even when TSLA is going down is because of the High IV during earnings?\n\nSo moral of story is do not trade near earnings?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Wait, so normally, if TSLA goes down, the OP's short PUTs would have lost value right?\n\nNo, all things equal, short puts gain value when the stock goes down, which means OP losses money as they become more expensive to close. \n\nA short and long put are the instrument, just opposite sides. So the put will always increase in value when all things equal, the stock goes down. If you are holding the long put, you make money as you can sell for more. If you are holding the short put you lose money because you have to close for more. When I say gain value, I mean the PRICE of the put increases, regardless if you are long/short on it.\n\nThe reason why you can see a short put LOSE value even when the stock goes DOWN is commonly during earnings because extrinsic value is bloated due to elevated IV. This means that if the implied move on a stock for earnings is +/-10% and the stock only moves -2%, the short put ends up losing value because the extrinsic value gets collapsed through IV crush. In this case, the stock still went down, but you still made money because IV crush removed more value from the put than the put gained from the stock falling.\n\nTrading on earnings is a complex game of playing with IV and delta. There is a lot more risk because you can never predict what IV will be when earnings come out, but you usually can be fairly confident IV will always fall in some capacity. As such, you can sell a short put and trade on the notion that the stock can still fall but it will not fall as much as expected, therefore making this more of a vega trade.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "No. Contract value is contract value.
