Fees began being deducted in August, so OP ignored those statements for at least 8 months.\n\nYour question tells me you don't understand brokerage or bank accounts at all.  \n\nALL brokers can liquidate assets within an account to pay for the fees and financial liabilities of that account. EVERY SINGLE BROKER has the ability to sell the assets in your account to collect the financial obligations owed by the account.

If you buy more checks for your account, or open a safety deposit box, or bounce a check or overdraw your account, your bank deducts the fees from the cash in your account for those services.
