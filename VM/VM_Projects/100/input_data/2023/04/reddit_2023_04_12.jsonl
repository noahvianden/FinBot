Fear grew that depositors with more than the $250,000 FDIC insurance limit would lose their money. But over the weekend on March 12, the government backstopped all depositors in SVB, along with those in Signature Bank, no matter the amount they had with the banks.\n\nBuffett said the government would likely step in to backstop all depositors in all U.S. banks if that was ever necessary, though he did note that would require Congressional approval. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get the OK,‚Äù he said when asked if Congress would approve that extraordinary action. Buffett noted that Congress would also adjust the debt ceiling for this to take place in order to avoid financial ruin for the country. Buffett noted that shareholders may lose out if more bank failures occur and rightly so, but depositors shouldn‚Äôt be worried. Bank closures are an issue that‚Äôs impacted Buffett personally, he said, with his dad losing his job and savings in the 1930s when the bank he worked at failed.\n\nBuffett, 92, said he so confident that U.S. depositors are safe that he would put a million dollars of his own money in a bank and challenged someone else to do the same. He said he will give that money to charity at the end of the year if just one American lost their deposits through a bank closure, but he keeps the other person‚Äôs money if U.S. depositors remain whole. ‚ÄúIf any American depositor has lost money from a bank failure, the other soul gets to name where the $2 million goes, to what charity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf they haven‚Äôt, I get the payment. And that‚Äôs a firm offer, and we‚Äôll see who steps up.‚Äù", "id": "12jly7z", "created_utc": 1681305363.0, "score": 443, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "His million dollar bet is the same as me betting a penny.", "score": 287, "replies": [{"body": "He sounds exactly like a guy who has tons of money in‚Ä¶ bank stocks.", "score": 54, "replies": []}, {"body": "A full 0.0009% of his net worth!\n\nThe equivalent of somebody with a net worth of $1 million making a $9 bet", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "....", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I mean I would bet $1000 the exact same way, you want to take the other end of that bet?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Good for you, but Warren Buffett is not as confident as you in risking such a percentage of his net worth, and I trust his judgement better than yours.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "He owns insurance companies that insure larger deposits than the FDIC.

We are not a free market economic but a quasi corporate state that is  government dependant. It won't end well for those who think Wall steet is some kind of surety. Tesla make fantastic cars, but you can not have a future electric society when your infrastructure is falling apart, your social welfare and health systems are in crisis, and your educational systems are broken. Every health indicator on every level shows our culture in decline...including life expectancy. We now live in a culture where you are getting the same medical care if you make 1 million a year or 0 year. You can not sustain an economic system when your social system is crumbling around you. I think so many people will be so shocked by the next twenty years that they will are living in a sci fi movie that bends  toward post-apocalyptic.

With the Atlanta Fed tracking a Q1 gain around 2.2%, that would indicate a pullback later in the year.\n\nThat crisis had caused some speculation that the Fed might hold the line on rates, but officials stressed that more needed to be done to tame inflation.\n\nFederal Open Market Committee officials ultimately voted to increase the benchmark borrowing rate by 0.25 percentage points, the ninth increase over the past year. That brought the fed funds rate to a target range of 4.75%-5%, its highest level since late-2007.\n\nThe rate hike came less than two weeks after Silicon Valley Bank, at the time the 17th largest institution in the U.S., collapsed following a run on deposits. The failure of SVB and two others spurred the Fed to create emergency lending facilities to make sure banks could continue operations.\n\nSince the meeting, inflation data has been mostly cooperative with the Fed‚Äôs goals. Officials said at the meeting that they see prices falling further.\n\n‚ÄúReflecting the effects of less projected tightness in product and labor markets, core inflation was forecast to slow sharply next year,‚Äù the minutes stated.\n\nBut concern over broader economic conditions remained high, particularly in light of the banking problems. Following the collapse of SVB and two other institutions, Fed officials opened a new borrowing facility for banks and eased conditions for emergency loans at the discount window.\n\nThe minutes noted that the programs helped get the industry through its troubles, but officials said they expect lending to tighten and credit conditions to deteriorate.\n\n‚ÄúEven with the actions, participants recognized that there was significant uncertainty as to how those conditions would evolve,‚Äù the minutes said.", "id": "12ju98l", "created_utc": 1681323503.0, "score": 1627, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 393, "comments": [{"body": "bro for the past 6 months I've been hearing every single day that recession is either already here or that it is imminent.

Usually only a little bit, when things are running smoothly, but it must be something or else investing slows, economic growth slows.  People (big money, really) must be incentivized to *use* their money.\n\nThis same concept supercharges when there's deflation.  Now we (big institutional money, really) are incentivized to hold our money and keep it out of use.  Your dollar will be worth more tomorrow than it is today, so hold onto it.  Now investing STOPS.  And it's better to hold cash than stocks, so everyone (institutions) sells their stocks and the value of stocks plummet.  Ford, BP, General Mills, all go bankrupt because they're \"worthless\".  Because stocks are only valuable when other people want them, so I sit on my money.\n\nIn an exaggerated world to illustrate the point:  This means you and I get laid off and all corporations collapse, then because we're laid off we stop spending money and everything else collapses and the economy grinds to a halt.  So far though, this is just numbers on a screen.

I haven‚Äôt witnessed one that prebuilds more than their projected sales for the next few months. Usually just keep lots empty until someone buys and contracts the build (just drive through sub rural and suburban developments throughout the US and take note of how many mid 60s and newer developments still have vacant lots). They rarely build a house and sit on it until it sells because maintaining that inventory uninhabited is expensive, vulnerable to theft and destruction, and a liability.\n\nThere are strategies where duping your opponent into action is beneficial for you. Threatening to bulldoze a natural space for a sprawling development and antagonizing a fight with environmentalists can be very beneficial to gaining permits in other areas or pushing other agendas in housing. Also good move to shift blame on environmentalists when housing costs spike - ‚Äúoh there just isn‚Äôt room because environmentalists so we cant build any more‚Ä¶‚Äù Take hits on rural and exurb developments to get ammo for more leniency in urban and suburban areas, exemption from minimum occupancy requirements for short term leasing on multifamily, and exemptions from mixed income housing ordinances on new builds, height restrictions, zoning, etc. in more profitable, popular, and easier to access properties.  \n\nIf you think the shortage is simply because no one happens to have caught on and started building, consider that the estimated housing unit shortage in the US is around 6.5M units. The median house size in the US is 2000 sq ft. There are 142M housing units in the US. Despite a claimed 6.5M shortage, there are 16M homes vacant across the US. The difference in 2022 to 2024 DoD budget is $100B and could construct an additional 100K 2000 sq ft homes per year at california building costs. However, that cost would be lower depending on location and could be spread into renovations and smaller units. The average ‚Äúluxury‚Äù apartment is rarely more than a Home Depot special in terms of fixtures, appliances, and cabinets. Literally the same shit plus a dishwasher that would go into constructing new multifamily low income housing. However, building a bunch of tight small footprint apartments and studios requires nominally more toilets running up total property development costs. Although, maybe that‚Äôs made back by having more tenants? I doubt it once property management and maintenance for high turnover prone low income tenants are factored in. Same goes for single family housing. Same 2x4s, same concrete, same hardiboard siding, same shitty vinyl windows, same mass produced cabinet, same paint, same shingles, same romex, same toilets and sinks, etc. maybe a bit more crown mounding and possibly but unlikely in 2023 real wood floors. Margins in ‚Äúluxury‚Äù are way higher than pumping housing stock to get people housed with reasonable costs to stay that way. \n\nBasically, the US has the economic surplus to wipe out its housing issues while simultaneously creating millions of construction related jobs with average comp between $35k-$45k. Filling a staffing shortage for construction workers isn‚Äôt like the one apparently happening in software engineering. There are centuries of apprenticeship tradition and the trades are well structured to bring in juniors in a pyramid structure and scale quickly.

What matters is efficiency of the building, parking requirements, Sf of common areas, # of bathrooms, affordability requirement, and timeline to get entitlements and building permit.\n\nCertain cities in california having fees up to $50k per unit and also requiring developer to pay for street and utility improvements that should be the citys job also makes it difficult.\n\nThen there's cities like Los Angeles that just implemented a transfer tax that taxes every transaction over $5 million by 5%. As these large projects are levered 50%+, a 5% tax on sale price is a huge hit to the equity value.\n\nAlso, affordable units minimize # of bathrooms to 1 per unit, make units as small as possible per unit type, have no common area or amenities, and have a common laundry area rather than private washer/dryer per unit.

Some critics charge that by reflecting consumer substitution the BLS is subtracting from the CPI a certain amount of inflation that consumers can \"live with\" by reducing their standard of living. This is incorrect: the CPI's objective is to calculate the change in the amount consumers need to spend to maintain a constant level of satisfaction.\n\n>Specifically, in constructing the \"headline\" CPI-U and CPI-W, the BLS is not assuming that consumers substitute hamburgers for steak. Substitution is only assumed to occur within basic CPI index categories, such as among types of ground beef in Chicago. Hamburger and steak are in different CPI item categories, so no substitution between them is built into the CPI-U or CPI-W.\n\n>Furthermore, the CPI doesn't implicitly assume that consumers always substitute toward the less desirable good. Within the beef steaks item category, for example, the assumption is that consumers on average would move up from flank steak to filet mignon if the price of flank steak rose by a greater amount (or fell by less) than filet mignon prices. If both types of beef steak rose in price by the same amount, the geometric mean would assume no substitution.\n\n>In using the geometric mean the BLS is following a recognized best practice for statistical agencies. The formula is widely used by statistical agencies around the world and is recommended by, for example, the International Monetary Fund and the Statistical Office of the European Communities.\n\nIt‚Äôs more complicated than people make it out to be.

It can occur due to various reasons, such as reduced demand for goods and services, a decrease in money supply, or an increase in the supply of goods and services. \n\nWhen deflation occurs, businesses may struggle to sell their products and services, leading to reduced profits and layoffs. This can lead to further decreases in demand and a downward spiral in the economy. Additionally, deflation can increase the real value of debt, making it more difficult for borrowers to repay loans.\n\nInflation, on the other hand, refers to an increase in the general price level of goods and services over time. While inflation can cause some negative effects, such as reducing consumer purchasing power, it is generally considered less harmful than deflation. Moderate inflation can benefit the economy by encouraging investment, increasing competitiveness, and decreasing the real value of debt. \n\nOverall, while both deflation and inflation can present challenges to the economy, deflation is typically considered the greater concern.\n\n\nThis message has been generated by Nova - download it for free:\nhttps://apps.apple.com/app/id1669007652", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's year over year silly", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Everything is still very reasonably priced.

When the bulls are at max confidence and the rug gets pulled.\n\nLet‚Äôs review‚Ä¶\n\nRemember the SPCE news when the flew their shit flight? Rumor was bought, news was sold.\n\nRemember when Elon went on SNL and pumped Doge? Rumor was bought, news was sold.\n\nRemember October lows: we all knew it was going to be hot CPI. It can‚Äôt get worse than this. Rumor was sold, bad news was bought.\n\nRemember earlier this week, and last week, when people expected inflation to cool going into this CPI print? Rumor was bought, news was sold. \n\nRemember how the bulls say it‚Äôs ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù and they are pricing in a fed pivot? The rumor of cooler inflation, the reason for a pivot, was realized today, we sold off. Why? Why did rate expectations go up?\n\nRemember that energy deflation was the number one driver of overall disinflation? Remember how there wasn‚Äôt any rumor for OPEC cut? It surprised everyone and oil was bought immediately. Remember how energy prices underpin all economic activity - and that Biden already blew the SPR?\n\nRemember how the bulls just put together an epic 2 quarter rally from October to today, with rising rates, collapsing banks, and a shit economic outlook? Remember how they bought the dip, deployed their bonuses, deployed their tax returns and are all sitting on unrealized gains?\n\nRemember now that capital was deployed, and is still deployed, on the rumor of a fed pivot and a soft landing? On the rumor of ‚Äúthis time it‚Äôs different‚Äù? Remember how people are using 0DTE or margin to go all in on FRC shares?\n\nRemember how retail always moves last and the wealth transfer only works when retail deployed leveraged capital at the top - only to be liquidated on the way down - so smart money can deploy leverage capital at the bottom. \n\nRemember that Powell has delivered on his dot plot, and on expectations, at every meeting. Remember that ‚Äúno one sees rate cuts for the rest of the year‚Äù is what the man said.\n\nRemember money supply is tightening and banks are essentially all zombies at this point. All of them owe their existence to the feds special facility - they do what the fed wants - the fed wants inflation down unemployment up.\n\nRemember that unemployment might be hard to move, a lot of dead old people, no real immigration, no cheap labor. Remember pow doesn‚Äôt control unemployment, just the cost of money - so how much HIGHER does the dial need to go until we see 4 percent unemployment?\n\nRemember the money supply has never slowed this fast, to this degree, and remember US runs on credit. No credit? No growth, no more EPS no more multiple expansion.\n\nRemember, policy acts with a lag - nothing has happened yet in the real economy besides some minimal layoffs, SPACs died, and SVB died. A blip on the radar - the impact has been meaningless thus far.\n\nRemember, the smartest of retail will take their gains. Bearish. The dumbest of retail will buy the dip again, with leverage, just loading up positions on the wrong side of the boat. This makes the liquidation on the way down even more violent. Bearish.\n\n\nRemember that stocks need a reason to go up: buyers > sellers. Remember that bulls need to manufacture that reason (money, greed, innovation, cheap capital, no alternative). Is there more ammo left? Are the call buyers and leveraged longs going to reload tomorrow? Or are they feeling a little unsure now that they got exactly what they wanted?\n\nFear and greed drive the market.\n\nIt‚Äôs obvious what was driving the past 6 months of price action: greed.\n\nAre we all still feeling greedy‚Ä¶ or maybe‚Ä¶ we are afraid of losing those gains?\n\nGet fucked bulls.

It also assumes that the market is a zero-sum game, where gains for bears automatically mean losses for bulls, which is not necessarily true.\n\nSecondly, the post seems to ignore the fact that the stock market is a forward-looking indicator, which means that it reflects investors' expectations of future economic and corporate performance, rather than just past news or events.\n\nLastly, the post relies heavily on fear-mongering and emotional appeals, such as calling for the rejection of bulls and using derogatory language like \"dumbest of retail.\" These are not rational or intelligent arguments, but rather attempts to manipulate people's emotions and biases.\n\nSo, in short, this post is not a convincing or intelligent argument for rejecting the idea of bulls.
