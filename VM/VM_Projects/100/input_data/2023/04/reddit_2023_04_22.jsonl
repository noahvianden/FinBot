{"title": "Can anyone explain to me why markets are pricing in a pause or why anyone should be bullish?", "selftext": "I'm going to list off 10 reasons to legitimately be bearish for the markets right now. If you're bullish  and are expecting the fed to pause rates, I would love to hear how and why you think this will work with sticky inflation.\n\nI think I can say this for many others here, but nobody seems to understand why it's yolo season. So here are 10 reasons to bearish:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. *The 10 year is still dropping while markets go up.* What kind of psycho shit is that? For the record, the **bond market is king**. Every time we've come across a financial crisis of some kind, the bond market always pings problems and problems happen. It's like the Babe Ruth of forecasting shit breaking.\n2. *Inflation is sticky. How exactly can you pause rate hikes when inflation is sticky without inflation going back up? You can't, demand will ramp up again while rates are still low and only make the problem worse. Not only is the fed not going to pause rates, but they're more likely to raise them several more times.*\n3. *Higher rates means more problems for banks.* Less and less liquidity for anyone overleveraged in US treasury bonds which for the record, is a TON of banks. This means that banks not only lend less because of this, but because of the looming debt ceiling crisis, money going back into the economy will likely be less which means less deposits for banks. When this happens, deflation happens which is great depression kind of shit.\n4. *The fed clearly outlined a recession for 2023.*\n5. *US projection to run out of money moved from August to June of this year*. This is because the treasury saw less in taxes this year despite everything it paid the IRS to collect more. Seems like the ultra wealthy pulled off another hat trick again! Knowing how the government works, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the inflated time-line. It's probably mid-May.\n6. *There is a massive credit bubble around commercial real estate*. Roughly $1.5 trillion are due for repayment in 2025 and because of inflation and cultural changes around WFH, there's a good chance major banks won't see much of that back. This then furthers their liquidity crisis. If rates doesn't cause them to keel over, this absolutely will.\n7. *The rapidly escalating conflict in Ukraine.* This alone is becoming a massive blackhole for US tax payer dollars. Thanks to the individual who leaked the documents covering Ukraine, we now know we're losing the fight. So, not only have we pumped BILLIONS of dollars into the problem, but after this is all said and done, we may not even see that money back if ever. Does the federal government expect the middle class to pick up the tab for this too? Ha, of course they do.\n8. *OPEC is cutting off supply to oil* causing oil prices to go up thus making inflation worse.\n9. *Demand for housing is absolutely plummeting* which will likely begin effecting the means to increase supply here soon.\n10. *Commercial real estate defaults are growing rapidly.*\n\nI find it borderline hysterical to see the market go up when companies are seeing enormous profits still. It's as if retail and institutions can't see how this impacts inflation. Demand for money is still high which is why these companies are all profiting still. If demand is still high, there WILL BE NO PAUSE.\n\nFurthermore, rates were never meant to be low as a normal part of the economy. Rates are meant to be low when it needs to be stimulated. If rates remained low, we'd live in constant inflation. However, if the fed can't stimulate the economy without making inflation worse, how do you expect the fed to handle crisis' that disrupt the flow the economy?\n\nSo please, share with us what you know. Nothing about the stock market's sentiment aligns with what I was taught in school regarding economics and finance. If you have a legitimate reason as to why the market is pricing in a pause, especially around sticky inflation and everything else mentioned above, we're all ears. I say this humbly too. I will be asking questions and really investigate how and why markets should be pricing in a pause. If you can help it, providing a source would be nice. Nobody likes a trust me bro source.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TLDR:\n\nI want to know why the market is pricing in a pause despite sticky inflation plus the many other elements mentioned above that genuinely require the fed to stimulate the economy. Can't stimulate the economy when inflation is sticky or when rates are low. So, rates need to go up yet, the overall market thinks otherwise.\n\nWhy?", "id": "12utdzs", "created_utc": 1682134639.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|249|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I want to know why the market is pricing in a pause despite sticky inflation plus the many other elements mentioned above that genuinely require the fed to stimulate the economy. Can't stimulate the economy when inflation is sticky or when rates are low. So, rates need to go up yet, the overall market thinks otherwise.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'll try to answer each of the reasons you listed 1 by 1, and no I'm not going to be sourcing every answer, because I'm not writing for a research paper. You make the judgement if my answers sound reasonable or logical. For clarity I have a bit of a bias in agreeing with you on the lunacy, but I will try to use the middle ground perspective and remain as non-bias.\n\n1.) The reasoning is simple, if bond yields are declining this would mean the cost of borrowing becomes cheaper. This would be technically bullish for tech companies that needed liquidity for their research/burning money or operations. Every extra 0.01% they can save means a lot for multi-million to billion operations.\n\nNow to address the second part of your question that bond market is a good indicator. The issue is that the bond market have been inverted for 12 months, and as such it has caused complacency and spurred the belief that this time is **\"different\".** Additionally, while inversion itself is a great predictor of potential recession it isn't the end all of indicator(s). There have been time where it inverted, but the depth of recession isn't always severe. So why does this matter? Because when the bond yield inverted initially last year, you saw the panic selling when bond yields inverted. However, 1 year later GDP is still positive, and the economy is still growing while not as fast, but not contracting. Overall, people think that this time is **\"different\"**, and we have it under control or that this recession will not be as severe.\n\n2.) The issue with inflation being *sticky* is that you have to look at what part of it is being defined sticky. From our perspective the fact that food/oil/finished goods keep going up in price means sticky. However, from the central banks/FED's perspective, **core CPI** is what would be categorized as *sticky.* Although **core CPI** have been well sustained, it is not as high as it had been. Thereby, working in the favour of the narrative that CPI in general is coming down/moderating. This helps spur the belief that we can cut rates by the end of year if **Core CPI** comes down enough. And markets are trying to get ahead of itself and pricing in.\n\nTo address about the flaw with FED being able to sustain continuing rate hikes, as much as we want to believe the FED could. There is actually a true limit to how far the FED/government can hike rates. This sounds flawed and many will argue against me, but you have to remember the US is sitting on **31T and growing debt**.\n\nEach year the treasury/government have to pay interest on that using tax payers money. While tax payers revenue can cover interest payments so far, for every rate hike increases, that means there is less that can go to the annual budget. And not trying to be political, but the current administration have ambitious plans and require more spending. Thereby, demanding more of the annual tax revenues to be allocated to afford said budget. This, makes it difficult for the treasury/FED to sustain long-term high rates before something breaks down in the system. Either you increase rates so high that you can't afford both interest payments and annual budget spending. Or you have to make budget cuts, and at the moment the current administration is not interested in that.\n\n3.) You are absolutely right, in the fact that higher rates, means higher chance of problems for banks appearing. Unfortunately, as you can see from the recent actions of the Treasury Janet Yellen, they are willing to interfere and backstop/bailout banks. And from all of the hearings on capitol hill, Janet Yellen signalled supposed guarantees to all banks that they would be \"backstopped\" should the need arise. This of course is introducing moral hazard, however the markets are happy with the current answer and isn't pricing in potential threats. **Rather, they are pricing in that in the event of more banking problems, this will in fact spur the FED to slow down rate hikes or pause to avoid systemic risks from appearing in the overall market.** Making markets to be happy and pricing in pause/rate cuts at the end of the year, because deflation might occur as you pointed out.\n\n4.) Exactly, as you said the FED is outlining recession, therefore markets are anticipating deflation will occur sometime in the later half of the year. The reasoning is that because the FED themselves have identified it, this will mean that they will pause/rate cut in the latter half of the year to soften recession problems.\n\n5.) Debt ceiling issue is indeed one of the potential problems that might cause problems. However, there is this belief that the US will not default on its debt because every politician knows deep down the USD depends on it's credibility. Before, the US was on the Brent Wood's agreement. Therefore, the USD could hold the world reserve currency, and not fear a technical default as badly. Because the USD was backed by gold. Now it's only by faith/trust, therefore there is a huge political incentive for politicians to prevent a default. Right now Congress/President is just playing chicken and waiting to see whose right and whose wrong. Also there is the 2024 elections, there will be an agreement made and the treasury will just kick the deadline further down the road until said agreement is made.\n\n6.) Your argument about commercial real estate is indeed true, but you have to remember for rate hikes, this is in regards to FED/government primary concern. They are not as concerned with the commercial real estate as opposed to residential real estate. Because there is a direct political fallout with citizens losing homes as opposed to investors losing money on investments. Therefore, this bubble bursting while devastating to pensions etc, the FED doesn't have to care as much for investors spillover. As it's dual mandate is maximum employment and price stability (mainly for citizens, not investors).\n\nNot trying to disregard it, but this commercial real estate bubble crisis have been going on for years. And each time they have kicked the can further down the road. Also there is the belief that interest rates will pause/cuts will occur later this year. Meaning that it is an **opportunity** rather than a real crisis (again the market sentiment is weird, but logical as it is forward looking).\n\n7.) Ukraine war, directly impacts Europe more than the US. And to your point, while the Biden administration might be saying they're giving xx billion dollars aid packages to Ukraine. You have to see what kind of aid it is that they are giving, is it real cash or weapons/equipments/gears/food etc? If so the weapons/gears that the US is giving isn't brand new and are old or used equipment, but are being priced as retail new prices instead of fair value, which includes depreciation costs. It's a great way to look like you're being supportive with big number $, when in actuality, it's not a lot as the equipment, gears, weapons have depreciated a lot. Now this definitely affects the US budget, but remember giving away used gears that have been paid doesn't cost the current tax payers money. So it's contribution to inflation will be minimal and let's be honest, the US have billions of money to throw at reckless spending, a few more going to a more productive thing in the defence of democracy and shoring up allies who trade with the US will make them more dependent. Increasing trade in the long run, bringing in a net benefit. Making markets more happy for the future.\n\n8.) To clarify, OPEC is not cutting off supply, it's reducing supply and while this will have a negative impact on the fight against inflation in the short term. This is starting to line up with the narrative of potential recession later this year. As demand declines in the face of a recession, the excess supply of oil will accelerate deflation to the point of recession or severe economic slowdown. The supply demand scales will reach equilibrium better if supply balances ahead of time to match demand. So markets are actually looking at this as another support for their argument of rate pause/rate cuts. And it's quite logical and make sense, that this is a indicator for the FED to consider a pause/rate cut should oil prices/demand come down as anticipated by OPEC. Remember the goal of the FED is to achieve **disinflation back to 2%, not deflation.** \n\n9.) That's actually not true, the demand for housing is actually at all times high, it's the **demand for mortgages is low.** The amount of people that can afford current rates isn't a lot. This is what drives down mortgage numbers and if there is less demand, supply must follow. Thereby, helping the 10 yrs bond yield to be slightly lowered due to lack of demand for mortgages at banks/financial institutions. \n\nNow if mortgage rates come down, that actually spurs more house buyers to come in and buy. In addition even if what you said is true, with potential of a lot of supply coming to the markets. Then that actually feeds into the narrative to the FED about pausing rates/cutting rates. Remember I pointed out the dual mandate for the FED in response #6?  FED goal is Maximum employment and Price stability, now **price stability doesn't mean affordable, it means stabilized/sustainable prices and not deflation.** This means the FED is fine with high prices in housing as long as it's fundamentally logical. Which, sadly it is at this point as interest rates are too high and people who are locked into low rates aren't willing to move out. Thereby causing a lack of supply = higher sustained price = price stability. Horrible and inhumane from some perspective, but from market's that's good news! That's why D.R. Horton stock went up despite the abysmal earnings report. Hope of rate cuts/pause will spur more orders for new houses and lower rate will mean borrowing to build will become cheaper and spur more demand!\n\n10.) Read my response to #6", "score": 98, "replies": [{"body": "Whew I'm really tired... \n\nOverall, markets aren't being hysterical to the potential pause/cuts of the FED. It's being perfectly logical, because like you said **bond market is king**. Now the FED's fund rate could be 5%, but over the span of 10 yrs the market is pricing in somewhere around 3.5%. Why? Because as I listed in this long argument there is a real limit to where the FED's can go with rate hikes because the 31T and growing debt interest payments will eventually outpace tax payers revenue should it go higher. So what does this mean? At some point the FED must pause or even cut rate hikes otherwise a default will happen. When that occurs the USD will devalue so markets are being logical and are going up in nominal value. \n\n**Personal tin-foil theory:**\n\nIf your USD is becoming less valuable what will you do? Buy any class of assets that can generate a cashflow or returns that can match or keep up with the devaluation in the dollar. Therefore, market makers are going far ahead and buying equities/residential property/gold etc. This pushes up the value stock markets/real easte etc despite a hawkish FED. Because at the end of the day, the trust in the FED is over, and it doesn't matter what the FED do or if inflation runs away. The FED can't raise rates further otherwise defaults occur. It's why we have Zimbabwee, Turkey, Venezuela, Lebanon etc. Their currency has crashed, while for multiple factors at the end of the day they defaulted on foreign debt. Causing a currency crisis, that's why the FED can not raise rates up too far. And will have to pause at some point, the FED/treasury/government will not allow a default otherwise the USD will face a currency crisis too. Markets aren't dumb and they are pricing in said scenarios and just anticipating it ahead of everyone else. And at the end of the day they're not wrong the government will have to either pause or cut rates.", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.
