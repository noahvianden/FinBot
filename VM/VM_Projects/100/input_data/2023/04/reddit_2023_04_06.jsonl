People said house prices could never go down due to structural lack of supply. It went down at a pace comparable to 2008 in 2022.\n\nSo here's something most reasonable people would agree on, whether bulls or bears (permabulls and permabears don't count). If you think an economic recession won't happen (I won't count a rolling recession as an economic recession), the bottom COULD already be in on Oct 2022. If you think an economic recession will happen (even a mild one), the bottom is definitely not in. Even if the bottom is in, we are not going to have a V shape bull run like 2020. This is because the Fed is still trying to keep GDP growth low for 2023, and throughout first half of 2024. This will limit earnings growth, and high interest rate will prevent PE expansion. Also, at SP500 around 4200, the valuation is pretty high, even for the bulls. But bulls can tolerate higher forward PE since they're gonna assume PE expansion in a bull market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the hard part is really determining if an economic recession will happen or not. I'm going to assume you know all about the bull thesis, so I will just list out some potential downsides to GDP.\n\n1. In the past when rate hikes were in increments of 0.25% and happened over years, recessions didn't happen immediately after the Fed pause. The Fed finished hiking in mid 2006. Bear Stearns failed in Mar 2008. Lehman failed in Sept 2008. When Bear Stearns failed, the market rallied 15%. If we're assuming 3.5% rate will cause a recession and 12 months of lag, recession won't even happen until Sept 2023. Stock market is not gonna roll over until like 3-6 months before the recession happen. You think everything's gonna happen immediately, but economic cycles take a long time to play out. That's why it's hard to predict recessions. If everything made sense, everyone would be able to do it.\n2. Recessions are non-linear. Things can look strong and then a few months later look weak. To make it worse, a lot of times the data showing economic data is strong, get revised and become weak. Everyone thought core PCE was around 3.6%. It got revised up and are now showing consistently around 4.5-5%. Everyone thought initial jobless claims was too low. It just got revised up today. Q1 GDP was estimated to be 3.5% a month ago. It's now 1.5%. The only thing giving the market the jolt to pump was in early January, the job report was shown to be extremely strong when the market thought recession was imminent. We know this is due to the warm winter causing companies to retain workers. Also, retails sales got pulled forward for the same reason. If retail sales got pulled forward, these next quarters aren't gonna be strong. Also, consumers are expected to run out of their COVID savings by summer of 2023, according to JPM and BofA. The strong spending you see now, it's not gonna continue.\n3. The debt ceiling debate is still going on, and no one's even talking about it. Market need to pressure politicians to come to an agreement quickly and not wait until the last minute. If the bond market thinks politicians are gonna play game and sell off in anticipation, while the banking issue is still in the background, that's not gonna be good. This time, the Republicans seem determined to not raise it, but we'll see if it's an act or not.\n4. The banking crisis isn't over. It's actually just begun, but just in the background for now. We're going to see mass exodus from depositors looking for yields. We're going to see real estate gets hammered due to regional banks tightening their lending standards. Real estate has been weak, but it cannot get too weak, otherwise it will pull down other sectors in the economy. The impact won't be seen until at least 3-6 months later. The impact can range from 0.5% to 1.5% rate hike equivalent. This banking crisis really shocked the bulls because they never saw it coming. Now that it happened, there're a lot of implications that follows, and it definitely has raised the recession probability by a lot. The Fed choosing to hike rate in March instead of pausing also shows their resolve to bring down inflation, even if it risks an economic recession. Even slightly hawkish economists were okay with the Fed temporarily pausing for one meeting.\n5. Right now what's keeping the market optimism is that even though Q1 is expected to be bad, 2H of 2023 is expected to sharply rebound. This could be due to expectation that Fed will ease rates, or that they won't keep rates high for long, therefore holding down GDP growth for 2024. If that turns out to be the case, and 2024 GDP gets revised down to around 0.5%, market cannot \"look forward\" beyond the slow growth environment. Also, this upcoming earnings will hear CEO give guidance on future quarters and we'll see some potential revision down for upcoming quarters.\n6. Europe recession fears is going to come back. Europe dodged recession last winter due to warm weather. High energy prices still exist, and by fall 2023, European recession talk will resume.\n7. The Fed's optimal trajectory requires incredible amount of precision. Nonfarm payroll, which is around 300k now, will need to go down to basically 0 for several months. It'd be incredibly easy to flip to negative once you're close to 0. Same with GDP, 0.4% this year.\n\nIn conclusion, I think market will be range bound between 3600-4200 until the recession eventually hits. If market's feeling pessimistic, it'll drop down to around 3600. If market's optimistic, it will go up to around 4200. If we dodge the recession, market won't break the range until at least Fall 2023 where we're a lot more certain inflation will go down to low 3% instead of mid 4%, and also start to price in a lot of the recovery quarters 12 months ahead. If inflation prints are around low 3%, the Fed will allow the financial condition to ease. They're gonna regurgitate holding for longer, but they won't be forceful, kind of what they're doing now (but now it's mostly because they're concerned about the banking crisis). If inflation prints remain around 4%, you're gonna start to hear \"some pain\" in Powell's speech again, which would trigger market selloff.", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "Where did housing prices drop at a 2008 pace?", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "They didn't.

Europe recession is completely dependent on energy prices. Europe inflation is primarily caused by high energy prices and not equally by the hot labor market, unlike the US. Every single talk on Europe avoiding recession, has brought up energy and warm weather as the primarily reason. Sure right now you guys don't have an energy issue. We'll see after China reopen and drives commodity prices up again. \n\nIt's funny you consider me a major bear, because a few weeks ago when SP500 was at 3800, I specifically said it's unlikely for Sp500 to break below 3800 for now.

We know that Elon is ruthless about general efficiency and slashing business overhead.  With more than 70% of employees eliminated, Twitter as a platform is still operating well as far as I can tell.  It actually seems better than it was a year ago.  This doesn't mean Twitter can't fail financially.  I just see the odds as low. \n\nI am far more concerned with the fact that Elon has total control over an information arsenal, and there is no one to check him. \n\nAdditionally, even if Elon did overtly weaponize that information, most people on the Internet don't truly value their privacy.
