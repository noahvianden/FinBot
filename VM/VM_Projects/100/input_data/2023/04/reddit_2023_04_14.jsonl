For instance, JPMorgan likely benefited from an influx of deposits after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank experienced fatal bank runs.\n\nBut the industry has been forced to pay up for deposits as customers shift holdings into higher-yielding instruments like money market funds. That will probably curb banks’ gains from rising interest rates amid the Federal Reserve’s efforts to tame inflation.\n\nThe flow of deposits through American financial institutions is the top concern of analysts and investors this quarter. That’s because smaller banks faced pressure last month as customers sought the perceived safety of megabanks including JPMorgan and Bank of America. But the bigger picture may be that deposits are leaving the regulated banking system overall as customers realize they can earn higher yields outside checking and saving accounts.\n\nAnother key question will be whether JPMorgan and others are tightening lending standards ahead of an expected U.S. recession, which could constrict economic growth this year by making it harder for consumers and businesses to borrow money.\n\nBanks have begun setting aside more loan loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy later this year, and that could weigh on results. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.27 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.\n\nWall Street may provide little help this quarter, with investment banking fees likely to remain subdued thanks to the still-shut IPO market. CFO Jeremy Barnum said in February that investment banking revenue was headed for a 20% decline from a year earlier, and that trading was trending “a little bit worse” as well.\n\nFinally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the economy and his expectations for how the regional banking crisis will develop. JPMorgan has played a central role in propping up a client bank, First Republic, which teetered last month, in part by leading efforts to inject it with $30 billion in deposits.\n\nShares of JPMorgan are down about 4% this year, outperforming the 31% decline of the KBW Bank Index.\n\nWells Fargo and Citigroup are scheduled to release results later Friday, while Goldman Sachs and Bank of America report Tuesday and Morgan Stanley discloses results Wednesday.", "id": "12lthja", "created_utc": 1681470187.0, "score": 1272, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 239, "comments": [{"body": "Probably should be paying more than .05% on deposits when money market is 5%, then people wouldn't transfer accounts as much.\n\nThis is why I leave very little in my bank account, there's really no point if the bank won't pay you for it when I could just get a brokerage and dump it all into BIL or SGOV.

Are you asking if there is some law legally determining what the Fed can and can't do in terms of rate hikes, or are you asking if there's some economic theory to explain the need for further rate hikes?\n\nAssuming it's the latter then you should think about rates in terms of economic incentives. Specifically, given that economic actors are always trying to maximise their real returns within a given risk tolerance, you should consider how rates impacts this dynamic.\n\nThe primary reason the Fed had to increase rates over the last year is because when inflation rises real yields on savings drop and real borrowing costs decrease. When this happens consumers are incentivised to borrow and spend savings while investors are forced to invest in riskier in pursuit of yield. This is why inflation can spiral out of control because if not quickly addressed with higher rates since economic incentives start to shift towards incentivising more spending, more borrowing, and more investment which typically results in even higher inflation. \n\nThis is the reason many cite the \"Taylor rule\" and the need for Fed funds to exceed the inflation rate to bring down inflation. Because unless Fed funds is above the rate of inflation savers will receive negative real yields on their savings and therefore be incentivised to borrow and spend.\n\nUnlike last year, this year inflation is almost certainly going to drop rapidly over the coming months. The rate of inflation falling will by itself increase real yields, so compounding this with further Fed hikes could be dangerous if you believe inflation is likely to fall significantly this year. Or put another way, if last this year parking money in a \"zero-risk\" money market fund could yield a real return of 2% a year, why on Earth would you take on additional risk by investing in a company which might yield a real return of 3-4%? And if you're a consumer, why would you would to borrow or spend when you can earn such an attractive return on your cash by just keeping it in a money market fund?\n\nIf there's one thing I think we can say with some certainty, it's that the Fed is not going to continue raising rates if inflation continues to cools and starts to fall significantly below Fed funds.

Movie is a 1 hour and 32 minutes long love letter to Nintendo's long running video game franchises. If you still feel young at your old ass Millennial age when you see Mario, you should get your ass into a theater and watch this movie. Everything about this movie is amazing in terms of the video game references.\n\nThe plot is super simple and basic but it is quite literally a Mario movie so if you're expecting Shakespeare I'm not sure exactly what was wrong with your expectations but it's you that needs fixing, not the movie. It's an excuse for Mario (Chris Pratt), Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), Donkey Kong (Seth Rogan), and friends to fight with Bowser (Jack Black). And many video game inspired action sequences result. My favorite by far was the Mario Kart sequence. Absolutely brilliant. Also yes, Jack Black steals the show as Bowser.\n\nThe music is also a highlight of the film, the musical references to the games are amazing and fit perfectly into the rest of the score.\n\nFinal Rating: Tanuki Mario/10\n\nedit: I forgot to mention, this movie has the best use of this song since Shrek:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWcASV2sey0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWcASV2sey0)\n\n(2)\n\nThis movie isn't for you.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I am sorry friend, but I'm not a marriage counselor 😂", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Bet chatGPT couldn't have written this one", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I liked the \"just blow on it\" reference.

Well the 787 was three years late and is *still* like $30bn in the hole, so that tells you how well that strategy worked for them. To be fair though, this aircraft did use a significant amount of new tech in materials and manufacturing, so I’m not saying it would have been trivial to do even if they designed it entirely in house. But the substantial degree of outsourcing absolutely made the problem worse.\n\nThe MAX is the latest example of bean counting winning out over engineering. It is truly remarkable what the engineers at Boeing have been able to do with that thing, given the original design is 60 years old at this point. Look up a picture of a 737-100, and compare it to a MAX 8. \n\nFrom an engineering perspective, a clean sheet design should have succeeded the last gen 737, not another re-engined 737. Boeing was actually going to make a new aircraft to replace the 737, but airbus dropped the NEO on them back in 2010 and forced Boeing’s hand. Maybe if the 787 development was going better and they weren’t massively in the hole they would have continued with the clean sheet replacement for the 737, but that’s conjecture on my part and I haven’t specifically read anywhere that is what happened, or would have happened.

In 1974 the un-inversion occurred pretty much right as the market reached a bottom. In 1981 and in 2000 it un-inverted while a decline was actively happening, but over a year before the bottom was actually reached. In 1990, 2007, and 2020 it un-inverted well before the decline even began.\n\nI'm not saying there isn't a pattern. I'm saying the details are so wildly variable that there is nothing really actionable.\n\nThe 10-3 is currently inverted.

If it's like 1978, we don't start declining until 2025 and the recovery happens swiftly in 2027. If it's like 2020, we have a flash decline this year and are fully recovered in a matter of months.

But see here:\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/chart/28401/annual-returns-of-the-sp-500/\n\n“Historically, back-to-back down years are a very rare occurrence, as our chart shows. According to Macrotrends.net, the S&P 500 has only seen consecutive years of negative returns three times since 1957, in 1973/1974 and in 2001/2002/2003 with returns getting worse in the second (and third) down year on each of those occasions. Since 1957, the S&P 500 has ended the year in the red 18 times including 2022. On 14 occasions, the index returned to growth the next year.\nAnd while history might point to an upbeat 2023 – on average the S&P 500 gained 15 percent in years following a negative year”", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "2 problems with this:\n\nFirst, why 1957?  That’s not many data points on a yearly chart.   As you pointed out elsewhere, it’s arguable that we should even go back before 2020 when discussing the current market regime, but if you’re gonna use a yearly timeframe, more data points is better.\n\nSecond, that 5% figure is ignoring Bayes’ Theory of probability.  It’s equivalent to saying, “the coin was heads last time, and the odds of two flips being heads are only 25%, therefore the odds of this next flip being heads are 25%.”  Obviously that’s not true.  The odds are still 50%.\n\nSimilarly, if the odds of any given year being down are about 25%, then the odds of down years happening twice in a row are 6% (0.25 x 0.25).  Which roughly matches your 5% number, given the small sample size.\n\nBut that doesn’t make the odds of a down year, once you were already down the year before, 6%.  The odds would still be 25%.\n\nAnd in fact, going back to 1970, there were 12 down years through 2021 and 3 of those were followed by another down year.\n\nAnd 3/12 is, unsurprisingly, 25%.\n\nHowever this is the simplest and crudest possible statistical study.  If you want more realism, your model would need to look at valuations, economic conditions and many other things.\n\nAt present there are positive and negative indicators, and you have to figure out which lead and which lag, and which are correlated vs just being random noise.\n\nMy opinion, based on zooming very far out and on subjective synthesis of everything I can find, is that broad US equities are not likely to have meaningfully positive real returns over the next 5-10 years.\n\nSimilar to the conditions under which SPX failed to produce positive returns in >10 year periods following 2000 (~13 years), 1967 (~15 years), and 1929 (~25 years).  And none of those periods started with overall real asset valuations (across equities, CRE, housing and bonds) anywhere near where they are now.\n\nThis isn’t what I want to be the case, but to me desiring something doesn’t mean living in fantasy land and cherry-picking positive-appearing metrics.\n\nI have no idea when momentum stops and mean reversion kicks in.
