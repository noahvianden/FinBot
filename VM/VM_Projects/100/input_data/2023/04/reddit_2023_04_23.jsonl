Take this with a grain of salt as I’m very very new to “trading” so I don’t see how this chart helps. I don’t understand how this is useful other than to say “yep we’re in a recession.” \n\nFor instance to use it for forward projections you don’t know if the index has bottomed nor do you know if the S&P will lead or lag; you have mentioned historically it lags 75% of the time. I’d think the problem with this is if you’re using this to time moves you’re just adding more possible error as you need to guess two timings right (index bottom and the lag/lead).   Also, since the S&P and this index don’t correlate in movement sizing, I don’t see how it helps you predict if the markets adjusted accordingly. \n\nSo with all that being said, I’m not sure you can use this chart to say the recession will be worse.
