Typically assignments happen on or very near expiration, which is why specifying when the expiration date is important, as noted above.\n\nThe probability of assignment is inversely proportional to the remaining extrinsic value in the contract. The less extrinsic value, the more likely you will be assigned. Since extrinsic value goes to zero at expiration, this explains why assignments generally happen on or near expiration.\n\nThis is because the call holder that exercises early **will lose money**, equal to the extrinsic value.

The board's job is to oversee the officers. Elon has repeatedly proven over the past year that he can't be trusted to police himself.  I am of the opinion that Elon should stay CEO, but that he cannot also be on the board while he is CEO.  I don't have a problem with his operation of Tesla as a business.  I have a big problem with what I see as breach of fiduciary duty to Tesla's shareholders, in terms of his erratic Twitter behavior unnecessarily damaging TSLA valuation, and his unwillingness to accept any responsibility for this.  Voting against Elon is my only avenue for holding him responsible for his actions.\n* **Against** re-appointment of Robyn Denholm to Tesla's board.  As Chair, Robyn has ultimate responsibility to defend Tesla shareholder interests.  As far as I can tell, Ms. Denholm made no effort to communicate to Tesla shareholders what was going on in the last months of 2022 in relation to Elon's activities at Twitter and any impact on Tesla's business.  This is IMO a breach of fiduciary duty and cannot be tolerated.  She should be fired from Tesla.\n* **For** appointment of J.B. Straubel to Tesla's board.  Mr. Straubel dedicated 14 years to Tesla as CTO.  He knows the company very well, having played a critical role in the development of battery technologies and Gigafactory Nevada.  In his post-Tesla career over the past few years, he has continued to contribute towards the goal of a sustainable energy economy.  J.B. can be counted on to maintain focus, and to be a stabilizing presence in Tesla's organization.\n\nAlso voted:\n\n* **Against** executive compensation program (this is nonbinding so the vote is effectively meaningless)\n* **3 years** for review of executive compensation (again meaningless vote as nonbinding)\n* **For** ratification of independent accounting firm\n* **Against** stockholder proposal on \"key man\" risk reporting.  This is a waste of Tesla's time and resources.  I do not believe Tesla as an organization faces \"key man\" risk today in terms of any one person dying or leaving the company.  The company is too big and too established now.  The \"key man\" risk now, ironically, IMO is not that Elon will die, but that his unaccountability and unpredictability may damage TSLA valuation no matter how well Tesla's underlying business performs.\n\nThere is no point in building a great house, if the buying public believes that the house is not valuable because the builders are crazy and cannot be trusted.\n\nProxy vote choices can be changed before the Annual Meeting date.

The exact % odds, I could not say.\n\nInstitutional investors like Vanguard and Blackrock almost certainly take a dim view when a corporate board fails in its duties of oversight and a company's share price crashes 70%.\n\n* [This paper](https://www.skadden.com/-/media/files/publications/2020/02/directorsfiduciarydutiesbacktodelawarelawbasics.pdf) from law firm Skadden Arps provides a plain language description of fiduciary duties that directors owe a company and its shareholders.  Failure to exercise proper risk management, specifically with regard to Elon's behavior regarding Twitter, is a big problem.  Even if directors could not be successfully sued under the law, major shareholders could be left with the impression that the board was asleep at the wheel, and may retaliate with their votes.  \n   * Note that while oversight is typically of legal and regulatory matters, it is not limited solely to those topics. \n* Institutions will have to weigh whether current and potential future damage to TSLA valuation is likely to continue under current board leadership.  It is entirely possible that Tesla continues to perform well as a business, but that TSLA valuation stagnates as investors continue to be scared off by Elon's antics and weak board oversight.  \n   * As a general reminder, there are no rules that a company with X growth rate and Y profitability must have Z:AA forward PE.  Good growth rates and profitability raise the odds of a higher PE, but do not guarantee it. \n\nMy gauge of individual investor sentiment at places like TMC indicates a massive split in opinion among large and longstanding shareholders.  Many were already wealthy in the early days of TSLA being publicly traded.  Some own hundreds of thousands of shares.  \n\n* It is difficult to say exactly where the balance of voting power falls, but there are enough people who are openly disgusted with Elon's conduct to say that votes for retention of Elon on Tesla's board will not be as nearly unanimous as they once were.\n* There are some shareholders who will vote for and with Elon, no matter what he does.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sense I get from the continued silence of Tesla's board, and the proxy statement, is that the board is confident of retention.  But if Donald Trump managed an unlikely victory in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election on a wave of voter discontent, I think Tesla board members can also manage an unlikely path to defeat on similar shareholder discontent.  \n\nI believe that shareholders should be thinking now, about the impacts to Tesla's business and TSLA valuation, should Tesla's board lose both Elon Musk and Robyn Denholm.  \n\n* In this scenario, Elon is still CEO of Tesla.  It would take an entirely new board to fire him, which I view as unlikely.\n* I believe JB Straubel is almost certainly going to be approved as a board member.

The game was later rebooted in concept multiple times, and eventually what the world got was Fate/Grand Order. Kinoko Nasu wrote the original scenario but Higashide was not only the author of the LN but also the script writer for this anime. The production was handled by Aniplex’s internal studio A-1 Pictures.\n\nI’m going to be blunt here, if you’re expecting me to shit on Apocrypha like many in the fanbase do, then you can stop reading here because I’m not going to do it. I’ll start with the obvious: Apocrypha is a big dumb shounen story where the most inane and ridiculous stuff inexplicably happens because Higashide thought it would be cool and the main protagonist suffers from an agonizing and terminal bout of video game player character self-insert syndrome. It’s also insane amounts of fun, has a fundamentally strong story with an emotionally resonant core, and has as much fighting animated as the budget would allow, which ends up being a surprising amount considering this one probably was budgeted at a fraction of whatever the ufotable entries got.\n\nThe numerous Servants of Apocrypha have been adapted to look like their artwork in FGO, a necessity because of the massive success of FGO between when the LN was published and when this anime premiered. That said, they all are given character development and motives which are absent from their FGO incarnations. The pace of the anime has to move fast and it does, because there’s a lot of characters and a series of storylines which need to be covered under the greater story arc. There are numerous cameo appearances from characters who figure in the original F/SN timeline but if you didn’t know who they were, it wouldn’t affect your understanding of the main story.\n\nThe main story, involves a plan to merge all humans into a blob called the Human Instrumentality Proj- wait. That’s not it. The main story involves magical creatures called Pokemon beating the shit out of each other to be the stronges- wait. That’s not it either. The main story involves a puppet named Pinocchio who goes on a journey to discover what it means to become huma- wait. That’s definitely not it. Alright fine, jokes aside, the main story of Apocrypha is painfully derivative of almost every other story ever written before it, but that’s kind of the point. It was based on a canceled video game script, remember? The story is intentionally simplistic and derivative at its core because you were supposed to be Sieg in the game and doing all the stuff Sieg does and it would be like fucking epic and shit. Probably.\n\nSigh. I need to give a paragraph to Sieg. The complaints aimed at Sieg are a direct result of Apocrypha’s origin story. He just kind of does things which are otherwise impossible in every other corner of the Fate universe because wouldn’t it be cool if you could do that in the video game? It’s really dumb, but quite frankly by the end you won’t really care because Fate is a franchise which is fundamentally built around two founding principles: grimdark and “The Rule of Cool”. So, at some point you get something like Apocrypha which takes these two things and just feeds them steroids until they literally turn into a dragon and fly off into the sunset because why the fuck not. The fact that Sieg exhibits no sign of any personal motivations to do anything he does beyond “I feel like it and I’m the protagonist” is an example of main video game character syndrome and Higashide doesn’t pretend it’s otherwise when writing this story. Higashide straight up gets a huge measure of respect for his zero fucks given attitude towards Sieg as far as I’m concerned.\n\nAnyways, Sieg himself isn’t a particularly strong main character, but he’s surrounded by a vast cast of really enjoyable human and Servant supporting characters. Again, because of the amount of material to be covered and the large number of different characters, there isn’t a lot of time to delve into each one. This is kind of too bad, because I would have liked to have spent more time with all the other characters. The show is 25 episodes and kind of flies along and at the end you’re surprised it’s already over. That’s a good sign for any TV series when the hours are melting away and you’re still watching and enjoying yourself. \n\nI think ultimately Apocrypha boils down to this: You’ll leave wondering what the hell just happened but also thinking damn that was a lot of fun and I don’t even know why. A bunch of fights happen and super powered people beat the fuck out of each other, something about the nature of humanity or whatever, somehow it actually relates to the rest of the Fate universe in the most ridiculous ways imaginable, and you feel like you had a good time. If you are already a fan of Fate, and especially if you have played FGO, you’ll like seeing all the Servants in their original story and you’ll get to see original Gordes Musik Yggdmillennia. This is of course Goredolf Musik in FGO as he’s carried over almost as-is from the Apocrypha timeline to FGO.\n\nFate likes to pretend it’s some deep and philosophical work of art, mainly due to Nasu’s pretensions in the main F/SN timeline, but really, it’s quite silly and I think everyone knows it and just goes with it. But I mean that’s how Shakespeare was too in his day, dude just wrote shit he thought his audience would like and today we all act like he was some literary playwright genius when he was just writing shit he thought was cool. I’m only mentioning this because Shakespeare is literally a Caster Servant in Apocrypha. Yeah, that shit wasn’t made up just for FGO. He was in Apocrypha first. Also, Yggdmillennia is a ridiculous yet awesome name for a family, I’m just saying.\n\nFinal Rating: Great Big Fucking Massively Engorged Holy Grail War/10", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Many are going hehe jensen huang nvidia stonks weee. \n\nWhen nvidia was dropping to 98-99 last year where were all you clowns. \n\n“Haha jensen hid the crypto sth sth.

Absolutely FLIES with Premiere Pro / Adobe CC, FL Studio is amazing, the battery life is astoundingly good, and the processor is ARM based so scaling down and up was the core design philosophy.\n\nMacBook Air’s are insanely OP for their form factor now, the GPU cores and hardware support for rendering media files makes my Threadripper setup so underpowered… Oh, and iPad Pro’s with M1’s are the damn same. All day battery but super smooth graphics at 120fps, crazy thin form factors… Mark my words, the AR headset is coming simply because Apple realized they could with the ARM efficiency their new processor design offers. Latency and CPU/GPU handoffs are crazy optimized and every single store in my area recommends Apple Mx-based laptops and tablets for like practically anyone shopping nowadays.

Anyone who didn’t upgrade then is most likely happy where they are since PC’s aren’t that much faster YoY compared to the 2000’s and late 90’s. My 1080Ti still kicks absolute ass with a mild OC but I barely use it anymore because MacBook M1 Max absolutely demolishes it, taking less than 5 minutes on average for a render job that can take an hour easily on my desktop.\n\nConsidering how long most Apple users keep their laptops, plus Rosetta 2 barely even making a dent for x64-86 non-native software support, Apple would be king of these numbers excluding the fact that HP / Dell MINT money on lazy businesses that don’t want or need to have premium devices for their wage sla-… err, workers.\n\nThere’s a reason Apple is basically worth more than bank stocks for long term YoY growth because they don’t need to “innovate” by cramming half baked features. They refine ideas into products that people get tangible results from.\n\nEdit: I’ll bet my hat that Apple’s VR / AR goggles will use cut down versions of their M-Line processors with more GPU cores and less CPU cores for thermal headroom, reliable frame time and frame rate, as well as processing all the data into a wireless, self computing setup.
