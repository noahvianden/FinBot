Of these companies, 76% have reported actual EPS above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 77% but above the 10-year average of 73%.

And *slightly* fewer are beating than normal, but really an inconsequential difference given how few have reported so far. And the magnitude of the beats are slightly lower than usual. [Visually, you can see Financials/Tech/Real Estate missed expectations most frequently (ignoring magnitudes)](https://i.imgur.com/lajR74b.png). They state that healthcare saw the biggest magnitude of earnings surprises.\n\nThey anticipate 6.2% year over year decline in earnings.\n\nOn revenue:\n\n> In terms of revenues, 63% of S&P 500 companies have reported actual revenues above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 69% but equal to the 10-year average of 63%. In aggregate, companies are reporting revenues that are 1.8% above the estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 2.0% but above the 10-year average of 1.3%.\n\n[The sector breakdown was more evenly spread](https://i.imgur.com/YuGrHoz.png) for revenue misses.

[Can someone chip in here? You would need to read their main article where they discuss it.]\n\nFinally as for the rest of 2023 and the valuations:\n\n> Looking ahead, analysts still expect earnings growth for the second half of 2023. For Q2 2023, analysts are projecting an earnings decline of -5.0%. For Q3 2023 and Q4 2023, analysts are projecting earnings growth of 1.6% and 8.5%, respectively. For all of CY 2023, analysts predict earnings growth of 0.8%.\n\n> The forward 12-month P/E ratio is 18.2, which is below the 5-year average (18.5) but above the 10-year average (17.3).

I guarantee battery prices are not cheap enough for the bigger pack to be cheaper than an ICE as they are currently.

Pure EV or pure ICE seems to be quite a bit cheaper than PHEV’s? There has to be a savings for people to rapidly switch to PHEV’s and I think if it were possible companies would be doing it and taking the loss to get the market share (like Tesla initially did in EV’s)?\n\nHow much does a PHEV need to cost to justify switching? Assuming a vehicle lasts 150k miles (I know many vehicles reach 200k+, but others die out or crash much earlier), and if gas stays around $3 a gallon adjusted for inflation (and obviously it depends where in the country you live and other various factors), and your vehicle gets 30mpg (again varying greatly), that’s 10 cents a mile for gasoline, or $15k of gasoline over the life of the vehicle. If electricity costs 5 cents a mile (again varying greatly but this number is an average according to US EIA), then you’re talking about $7500 of savings using electricity over gasoline. But in a PHEV, I assume people buy this type of vehicle because they plan to occasionally use gasoline. So say you use gas 1/3 of the time for longer trips or whatnot, then the PHEV fuel costs would be about $10k. So $5k difference. And I’m sure there are more things that can go wrong with a PHEV since it’s got to be more complicated, so service costs would likely be higher. And again, people want to save money or at least not cost much more for switching. So say people would be willing to spend $3k more for a PHEV over an ICE. I don’t think it’s possible to do the extra battery and more complicated drive train for $3k, although I don’t really know. \n\nMy guess is that PHEV’s will continue to have a small and limited market, but BEV’e and ICE will continue to be the winners.

It also won't run that often leading to less maintenance and wear.

I would guess the popularity is a chicken and egg problem. They're expensive because they don't make that many, and people don't buy them very often because they're expensive.

One of them (Elon) has gone out of his way on multiple occasions to damage the valuation of the company.  We have a board chair (Robyn Denholm) who collects 10s of millions worth of shares, and cannot be bothered to defend the valuation of the company.\n\nI am still holding because my shares give me some measure of ability to hold the Tesla board accountable for their atrocious, and frankly lazy, corporate governance.\n\nMy belief is that Tesla valuation will recover, if Tesla continues to execute well on its business plans, and we have a board that responsibly carries out its duties.  Bad corporate governance at the board level, does IMO have an effect on market valuation.  Investors, particularly more conservative institutional investors, do not want to own business that appear to have no one at the helm.\n\nIf people want a non-Tesla example of what happens to valuation when board governance goes to shit, take a look at Illumina (ILMN).  Illumina is considered the gold standard in DNA sequencing machines, which are critical infrastructure in modern medicine and genomics R&D.  Prior to recent events, Illumina was consistently posting solid earnings of over a 1 Billion/quarter on something like 3.5 Billion in revenue.  Then the company went off the rails when management decided to illegally purchase another company without required approval from both the FTC and EU.  Their board did nothing to stop this, despite potentially hundreds of millions in fines.  Illumina became mired in legal red tape, wrote of billions in losses, and is still dealing with the fallout.  Shareholders paid for this with about 50% of ILMN's market cap, about 40 Billion dollars.  (**Edit**:  for those who are interested in a summary of the Illumina debacle and proxy fight for board control, a great summary from Fierce Biotech: [https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/illumina-facing-proxy-battle-led-activist-investor-icahn-over-grail-acquisition-wsj](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/illumina-facing-proxy-battle-led-activist-investor-icahn-over-grail-acquisition-wsj))\n\nTSLA shareholders need to get Tesla's governance back on track.

Illumina's management knew that their actions would result in hundreds of millions in fines from defiance of just the European Union, they acted anyways, and their board didn't restrain them from these illegal acts.    \n\nElon and Zach are unlikely to do stuff that is guaranteed to result in having to hand over billions to a government agency.  Nor do I think even Kimbal would stand idle if his brother was about to hand stacks of cash to regulators.   \n\nIMO, the biggest risk Tesla faces in potentially falling afoul of regulatory rules, is where FSD is concerned.  However, Tesla has consistently been cooperative with regulators, and in keeping customers aware that release of FSD features may depend on regulatory approval. \n\nFor example, the text of the FSD option in any vehicle configurator on Tesla's website states:\n\n`The activation and use of these features are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience,` **as well as regulatory approval**`, which may take longer in some jurisdictions.`  \n\nI'm fairly certain that Tesla won't cross any lines here", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sure, anytime!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "yah 2024 and beyond should be good", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Because then you're playing the market, and there are people smarter and richer than you (or me) that will fuck you out of your money if you try to play their game.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No the stock price may go down.

I'm almost 3 years late to this generation of consoles but it doesn't feel like it because a certain virus ended up ruining the first 2+ years of the generation and even now the first true PS5 exclusive title (Final Fantasy XVI) is just coming out this June.\n\nSo Astro's Playroom is a little bundle title that comes pre-installed on every PS5. Out of curiosity, since it's literally already right there, I opened up to check it out. Made by Team Asobi, which is today all that remains of the shuttered Japan Studio, it's a pretty straightforward 3D platformer which reminded me a lot of Super Mario 3D World but which also has special sections where you play with special mechanics, such as climbing in a giant robot gorilla or maneuvering in a little robot spaceship.\n\nThis little game is both cute and fun and certainly worth either the price of $0, or $500 if you count the cost of the console it comes with. Not necessarily because of the actual 3D platforming gameplay, which is certainly solid, enjoyable, and mechanically tight. No, the star of this game is PlayStation itself, which is the subject of a nostalgia-filled trip from the 1994 original PS1 to the new (as of 2020) PS5. You go through the PlayStation themed levels and collect \"artifacts\" which are 3D models of various PS hardware products and stop during levels to gawk at over 60 cute references to video games that defined nearly 30 years of PlayStation's history.\n\nTo put it simply, it's a trip down memory lane that just absolutely floods you with nostalgia. If you don't get a little choked up when you see some of the game references and bits of Sony's long hardware legacy, you probably didn't grow up with Sony and Nintendo the way I did. But if you're about that age when you're starting to realize the older you get, the better you were, and you can also count your childhood by which PS console you began with, then this game is a really amazing little journey through your happy childhood memories. Oh yeah, and the theme song is a fucking banger, there's that too. You can easily spend 5+ hours in it depending on how much you want to collect everything which is pretty nice for a free bundled title.\n\nA complete list of the game references:\n\n[https://www.ign.com/wikis/astros-playroom/Every\\_PlayStation\\_Easter\\_Egg\\_in\\_Astro's\\_Playroom](https://www.ign.com/wikis/astros-playroom/Every_PlayStation_Easter_Egg_in_Astro's_Playroom)\n\nThe GPU song:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVBjiFPMKMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVBjiFPMKMM)\n\nFinal Rating: Generations of Play/10", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "you have gotten in at a time when the prices are down so good one on that! look at marketplace for used games if you want to get a sizable collection but dont want to spend much. im doing this now for my nintendo switch.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "My kids LOVE this game!\n\nCan’t wait for the sequel!!!!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "btc 📉", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I like it when btc is cheaper.

Yet media headlines claim the company is “dying.”\n\nThe doom is overwrought. The eccentric billionaire is creating one of the most powerful media platforms the world has ever seen. This was underscored last week when he schooled an officious BBC reporter who claimed—without evidence—that the amount of hate speech is up on the social-media site. The CEO’s quick-witted lesson on free expression has since made the rounds on the platform, racking up well over 20 million views. That’s impressive reach—as was the company’s performance during the World Cup, when it hosted 147 billion impressions in about four weeks.\n\nMr. Musk is now accelerating plans to turn the chat room into the “everything app,” a [marketplace](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-plan-x-for-elon-musks-twitter-takeover-social-media-trump-flimflam-scam-california-silicon-valley-platform-banned-11665920490?mod=article_inline) he calls X.com, where users can buy and sell stocks, open bank accounts, shop for retail goods, pay bills and more. Last week he renamed Twitter’s holding company X Corp. and moved its incorporation from Delaware to Nevada. He also formed a new Nevada-based company, X.AI, and hired a former scientist from Google’s DeepMind laboratory to lead the venture. And Mr. Musk signed a deal with an Israeli online stock trader called eToro, which boasts more than [32 million](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/04/13/twitter-to-let-users-access-stocks-crypto-via-etoro-in-finance-push.html?utm_medium=LINKEDIN&utm_source=social_retention&utm_campaign=PR_PR%20articles_Twitter%20Cashtags%20_20230413_EN%20(FCA)&linkId=300000005320410) users across Europe, Asia and the U.S.\n\nIn December, Twitter added pricing data for $Cashtags: a function that enables users to type a dollar sign before a stock symbol—say, $TSLA—to see the latest tweets about the company. So far this year, CNBC [reported](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/04/13/twitter-to-let-users-access-stocks-crypto-via-etoro-in-finance-push.html?utm_medium=LINKEDIN&amp;utm_source=social_retention&amp;utm_campaign=PR_PR%20articles_Twitter%20Cashtags%20_20230413_EN%20(FCA)&amp;linkId=300000005320410), Twitter users have logged some 420 million searches using the feature. Now the platform will allow Twitter users to click cashtags and jump to eToro to buy or sell stock.\n\nMeantime, Mr. Musk is introducing more capabilities to the app: “We’re releasing features faster than in Twitter’s history—at the same time as having contained the costs and reduced the cost structure by a factor of three, maybe four,” he told the tech podcast “All-In” in December. Twitter’s “views” function is one such, which offers constant updates of how many people saw and clicked on each tweet. Mr. Musk noted that this requires Twitter’s servers to crunch some three million calculations per second—every second.\n\nAnother new feature, Community Notes, lets selected contributors rate and add factual context to posts. The site states that if enough contributors from “different points of view rate \\[a\\] note as helpful,” it will be publicly affixed to a tweet. No longer can journalistic “fact-checkers” get away with the shoddy work typical of the genre. One recent example: When the Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler [tweeted](https://twitter.com/GlennKesslerWP/status/1642144423956889600) what he described as the “incendiary claim” that George Soros “funds” New York prosecutor Alvin Bragg, he was instantly met with popular—and accurate—pushback.\n\nAll the while, Mr. Musk has cut a workforce of 8,000—with a median compensation of $232,626 a year—down to about 1,500, drawing the envy of his counterparts in Silicon Valley. The media responded by claiming that hate speech and vile images would soar on the site because of the cuts. Yet all indications suggest that cracking down on this content is a priority of Mr. Musk’s.\n\nIn his first two months at Twitter, hate speech was reduced by a third “and will get even lower,” he said in December. The company also [suspended](https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1601439984292360193) 300,000 accounts related to child exploitation in November alone—up 57% from the previous management and “significantly more than any other month YTD.”\n\nRecent [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/20/antisemitic-tweets-soared-twitter-after-musk-took-over-study-finds/) claimed that anti-Semitic messages had more than doubled under Mr. Musk’s watch in the first few months of his tenure—to 12,700 posts per week. But this is hardly significant, as an estimated 6,000 tweets hit the platform every second.\n\nThough many of Twitter’s top advertisers pulled their support when he took the helm, Mr. Musk says most of them are coming back. The platform was running a $3 billion annual loss when he got there, he says, and it’s on track to hit positive cash flow this quarter. “If [Disney](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/DIS) feels comfortable advertising their children’s movies, and [Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL) feels comfortable advertising iPhones, those are good indicators that Twitter is a good place to advertise,” Mr. Musk told the BBC.

Their competition doesn't have the same flexibility\n* They also have the ability to go all the way down to zero profit today and still be profitable long term by future sales of software/services to those customers\n\nBut it's also obvious that Tesla will raise prices to keep from having too large of an order backlog when demand is up too.

Whether people here like it or not, he is alienating some current and some potential future Tesla customers with this behavior.

As Elon cannot police himself, I believe he therefore no longer has a place on Tesla's board.  He is valuable to Tesla as CEO and Chief Product Architect.  He cannot simultaneously be in executive leadership and the board.\n\nAccordingly, I have voted my proxy against retention of Elon to Tesla's board, and also voted against retention of board chair Robyn Denholm. \n\nThis is the only logical conclusion I can reach.  \n\nStockholders should exert some discipline on Elon Musk, and begin to detach the Tesla brand from him.

I honestly don’t give a shit about professed politics. The corporate world is chock full of glaring hypocrisy to the point if people actually bought products only from those who they agreed with they’d be living in a commune in the California desert.\n\nThe problem is that the car is…a car. In a couple of ways I suppose it’s better than an ice? But in most ways I care about it’s worse. It’s more expensive, it’s less convenient to refuel, and I don’t want a giant touchscreen as my only option for controls. I’ve ridden in several and I left just not that impressed. When I’ve talked to owners about FSD I’m left stunned at the level of stupidity. It doesn’t fucking work. At all. And yet owners act as if it does.

Basically what they’ve done is taken a car that must be fully manually driven and sort of automated the absolute easiest parts of driving.\n\nBut real FSD is hard because of all the other subtle parts which is the same reason AI in general is hard and those problems are many, many years from being solved. But Elon and his followers perpetually promise that those parts will be solved in months. I believe Elon knows better but is cool with deceiving people as he’s clearly demonstrated over and over while his followers are just ill informed and stupid. If Tesla becomes mainstream it will not be in any way because of its unique ability to automate driving.\n\nI believe the fair value is probably somewhere around a BMW or a luxury car brand which is basically the space they play in.

{"title": "Degenerates, you have less than 48 hours to get in on FRC 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Hated by FRC shorts and put holders worldwide, but your favorite autistic member is back with another announcement. FRC is due to release their earnings on April 24th. That means you degenerates have less than 48 hours to get in FRC on the ground floor before earnings come out on April 24th.\n\nI posted my analysis as to why I believe FRC is the biggest bargain of the decade. Read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12hp63d/comment/jfpw63k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), it will open your eyes to the games being played on the general public (I'll post it in the comments too). I still get dozens of messages every day asking if I changed my opinion and if I've sold. No, I have not. I have not changed my stance one inch and neither have I sold a single share of FRC even though as of today I'm in the money and can walk away with a nice little profit. But I ain't about little profits, I'm about big profits and since I truly think that FRC can touch the moon, why sell now? 🚀🚀🚀\n\nEverything I wrote in that piece is as true today as when it was written, if not truer. Fear is in the air, blood is on the streets, and uncertainty reigns. The hedges and media friend’s attacks on FRC and regional banks have continued, though it's getting a little old by now. However, the sentiment is still unbelievably negative and fear driven. The expectation is that FRC is royalty fucked, that this thing is nanometers away from failure and total bankruptcy. That is baked into the price. But we've already seen that regional banks' numbers are fairly [good](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12t7ilq/the_average_deposits_of_regional_banks_in_q1/). This news hasn't had time to propagate through the market just yet, but it will soon.\n\nCome April 24th, we will find out one of two things: Either FRC is as royally fucked as everyone expects, in which case everyone shrugs and says \"knew it\" (the price might still go down a bit), or FRC turns out better than expected, in which case absolute pandemonium ensures. The range for this second scenario can be \"FRC's situation a little bit better than expected\" or \"god damn this thing is actually doing really well!\" or anywhere between. Read my analysis then take a nice, careful look at the below graph and tell me which scenario you think will happen:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2lpg7bgbgava1.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6d3aac81068b20f23c7ca3cdf97dd3e0db2a350\n\nRemember, this is a long play, so I advise against buying options.

If this happened the stock could shoot up over $50/60 but this is highly unlikely as the government doesn't give charity especially to banks.\n\n2) The Fed does #1 but in a less favorable way and some bank buys it out for around 10-$20. So some bank ranked 9 in size like Capital one to a smaller bank say 30th in size buys it.\n\n3) JPM or some big bank buys it out at the current price or slightly below or around the current price. This sort of will piss off the Fed as it won't show it has confidence in the small banking system\n\n\nI think #2 is the most likely option and I'd expect it to be announced this week after they report since the report will be horrible and selling pressure will happen.

We paid it off in 18 months only because we were still in school paying our $250/yr tuition. The house appraised for $180,000 in 1992 so we took out an equity loan and bought our second house. We put the first one on the rental market and have been increasing the rent 15% annually for the last 31 years. We don’t even bother basing rent off of local rates because all of our friends have been doing the same since the 90s. We collect $5,000/mo passive off that first home which has recently appraised for $1.8M. Our second home was $90,000. The remaining $90,000 from the equity loan went into renovations and expansions so we could fit our growing family. Also Karen needed a tummy tuck. We just downsized as our last kid finally moved out with her boyfriend. We sold the second house for $3.6M and used some of that to help the last kid with a down payment on her new home. They bought a cute little 2 bdrm fixer upper in silverlake for $900,000 and already have $400,000 in equity after a few renovations. (It helps that we send them $2,000 per month. It’s cheaper than letting her live with us). Finally, we just out I’d a young couple and made a cash deal on a craftsman cottage in Tennessee. Maybe we overpaid - we did settle $200,000 over ask, but Karen just needed that place. She fell in love with the little HGTV style herb garden in the back and I can park my boat in the driveway and the HOA won’t come down on me. Finally we live place that aligns with our political views. It’s unfortunate that young couple didn’t win the little bidding war we tried to start. I think they were borrowing with an FHA and had a 3% down payment. Probably took too long to get approved before we came along. Oh well, I did offer their agent my card and mentioned our rental property they could rent. The monthly rent is only $1,000 more than the payment woudlve been on this house.
