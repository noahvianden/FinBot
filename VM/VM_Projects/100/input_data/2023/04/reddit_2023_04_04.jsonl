Everyone uses TikTok but the revenue is a lot less than one would think. It really makes you wonder... I have several theories, one being that the audience on TikTok tends to be a lot younger, and the older generations that are on facebook, etc. tend to be more valuable for ads as they may have more expendible income. Another theory I had is that the role of Tiktok is primarily to consume, and does not really encourage you to engage and interact. I think as a user on Tiktok, all the quick dopamine makes it so easy to just end up in a zombie-like scrolling state, which really reduces the chance for you to engage with their product and ads. On the other hand, you'll see posts from your friends and family on fb/insta, which I think may encourage more engagement. In fact, Meta said in an earnings report that they do not optimize for time spent on the platform. They probably have already concluded that time spent on platform does not necessarily equal more money. Not entirely sure what metric they do primarily optimize for though... This is just a theory though. It could also be that Meta has a much more fleshed out advertisement targeting system, and Tiktok is just very far behind. Who knows?\n\nedit: Ah, and I literally just realized this now. There are quite some advantages to Meta/Insta having multimodal content.

{"title": "JPMorgan Warns Stocks Are in 'Calm Before the Storm'", "selftext": " Bloomberg Article:\n\nA  risk-on mood fueling this year’s equities rally is likely to falter,  with headwinds from bank turbulence, an oil shock and slowing growth  poised to send stocks back toward their 2022 lows, according to JPMorgan  strategist Marko Kolanovic.\n\n“The  Fed indicated no intention to cut interest rates this year, yet risk  assets are exhibiting an unprecedented rally, with European stocks  trading near all-time highs and US stocks recovering recent losses,”  Kolanovic wrote in a note to clients Monday. “We expect a reversal in  risk sentiment and the market retesting last year’s low over the coming  months.”\n\nIn  his view, the inflows into stocks over the past few weeks “make little  sense” and were largely driven by systematic investors, a short squeeze  and a decline in the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX.  \n\nA  drop in the VIX below 20, a level associated with less stressful  periods, suggests investors believe the banking crisis is contained in  the near term. However, Kolanovic characterizes the present market  backdrop as “the calm before the storm.” \n\nOne  of Wall Streets biggest optimists through most of the market selloff  last year, Kolanovic has since reversed his view, cutting his equity  allocation in mid-December, January and March due to a soft economic  outlook this year.\n\n Stocks have remained resilient this year despite rising interest rates  that have dented corporate profits, slowed growth and triggered a series  of bank collapses in the US and overseas. The benchmark S&P 500  rose 7% in the first quarter after dropping nearly 20% in 2022, while  gains across technology stocks have pushed the Nasdaq 100 up 20% since  the start of January and into a bull market. \n\nTech’s  outperformance has become even more magnified recently as traders ramp  up bets that banking-system stresses will prompt the Federal Reserve to  hit the brakes on its tightening campaign.\n\nUS  stock futures were steady on Tuesday, with contracts on the S&P 500  dipping less than 0.1% while those on the Nasdaq 100 edged 0.2% lower  by 3:51 a.m. in New York.\n\n“It  is worth noting the accordion-like nature of risk sentiment, where  restrictive rates produced an issue for various carry trades and the  ensuing pullback in yields mitigated some of the stress,” Kolanovic  wrote. “Although central banks are still communicating, there is ground  to cover on fighting inflation and pushing back against the market’s  assumption of cuts, so the original source of stress, rates higher for  longer, can reenter the picture.”\n\nCitigroup  Inc. strategists including Chris Montagu said net positioning turned  clearly bullish for the S&P 500 over the past week. There’s still  $15 billion of shorts to clear, which could support markets in the near  term, they wrote in a separate note on Monday.", "id": "12bvkbv", "created_utc": 1680640327.0, "score": 206, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 164, "replies": [{"body": "It's like how everyone but Epstein knew Epstein was going to kill himself.", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "That’s because he didn’t", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "That's the joke", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t get it", "score": -4, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "He only attempted it like a week before doing it and moved all of his assets into a trust. lol, this is the stupidest conspiracy theory.

The members believed that Glibgloby possessed the power to make their stock grow and provide them with bountiful gains by posting first. They would offer sacrifices, perform rituals, and pray to Glibgloby, seeking his favor and blessings for their stock.\n\nFor months, Glibgloby had played the part of the god, reveling in the adoration and worship he received from the members from posting first. He would don a flowing robe, carry a staff, and put on a grand show, claiming to control the sun and rain, and promising abundant gains in return for their faith.\n\nBut one day, as the members gathered in the town square with their offerings, Glibgloby found himself unable to fulfill his promises. The sky was foggy, and no amount of chanting or waving his staff could part the fog to reveal the sun. The stock was wilting, and the members grew anxious as they looked to Glibgloby for answers.\n\nGlibgloby was desperate. He had built his entire identity around being a god, and now he faced the possibility of being exposed as a fraud. He tried to maintain his facade, making excuses and blaming the macro events, but the members were growing skeptical.\n\nOne young girl named Mira, who had always been curious and observant, began to question Glibgloby's powers. She noticed that he never ventured out into the other subreddits or tended to the stock himself. He simply relied on the members' offerings and prayers to sustain his godly image.\n\nMira decided to investigate further. She sneaked out one night and followed Glibgloby to a hidden discord at the edge of the village. To her surprise, she saw Glibgloby counting the offerings he had received and laughing sinisterly. He had been deceiving the members all along, using their blind faith for his own gain.\n\nMira confronted Glibgloby the next day in front of the members. She exposed his lies and revealed his true nature as a charlatan. The members were shocked and heartbroken, realizing they had been fooled for so long. They demanded answers from Glibgloby, who could not provide any. His powers were nothing more than smoke and mirrors, and he had no control over the options market or the stock.\n\nWith his reputation shattered and his tricks exposed, Glibgloby fled the subreddit, leaving behind his robe and staff. The members, initially devastated by the failed rally, rallied together and worked tirelessly to salvage what they could. They learned to rely on their own hard work, the DCA, and the natural fundamentals to grow their stock.\n\nIn time, the sub flourished like never before. The members learned to appreciate the real miracles of nature and the fruits of their own labor. They no longer needed a false god to make their stock grow, for they had discovered the power within themselves.\n\nAs for Glibgloby, he wandered from electricvehicles to realtesla, trying to peddle his fake powers, but he was met with skepticism wherever he went. He realized that he had lost something more precious than his illusion of godhood - the trust of others. Glibgloby eventually faded into obscurity, a cautionary tale of a false god who learned that true power comes from within, not from deceit or manipulation. And the members continued to thrive, knowing that the real gods were the macro, institutional investors, and the hard work of their 0dte options.
