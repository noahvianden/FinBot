In Cali, your take home would be 10k (remember that about 1/3 to 1/2 of your compensation in Cali is unreliable bonus or  stocks. Those are awarded, if they are at all, once or twice a year.

The term spread used by the New York Fed refers to the gap in yields between the 10-year Treasury bond and the 3-month bill.\n\nWhen yields on shorter-term bonds are higher than yields on longer-term bonds, the yield curve is considered inverted. \n\nAn inverted yield curve has reliably predicted each of the previous eight U.S. recessions since 1970.\n\nWhen a yield curve is inverted, investors fear that the current high level of interest rates, reflected in elevated shorter-term yields, will push the economy into a recession, causing the central bank to cut interest rates in the future, thus discounting presently lower longer-term yields. This is why an inverted yield curve is often a precursor to a recession.\n\nThe **SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF** (ARCA: BIL), is a popular ETF which offers exposure to the ultrashort end of the Treasury curve, investing in zero coupon U.S. T-Bills with less than three months until maturity.\n\nThe **iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF** (ARCA: IEF), instead offers exposure to Treasury bonds with seven to 10 years to maturity. \n\n**Treasury Yield Curve Inversion: Where Are We Now?**\n\nIn March, the term spread was negative 1.15%, as 10-year rates were around 3.5% and 3-month yields were around 4.65%. The 10-year-3-month yield differential has further worsened to a negative 1.6% at the time of writing, with the 3-month yield jumping to 5.2% and the 10-year yield trading at 3.6%.\n\nIf such a spread holds or expands further in April, then the next month's New York Fed recession probability indicator will likely become even more negative than its previous assessment of a 57.8% chance of a recession occurring before March 2024.", "id": "12s4uwe", "created_utc": 1681927495.0, "score": 276, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 160, "comments": [{"body": ">An inverted yield curve has reliably predicted each of the previous eight U.S. recessions since 1970.\n\nBut were there moments where we had an inverted curve for a decent amount of time, but not recession?", "score": 148, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "A yield curve inversion has historically always preceeded a recession.

Savings, which help you stay afloat through a recession, are at/near all time lows. The reality is most people do not pay attention and they spend money until they can’t.\n\nA big factor in what is making the sentiment feel different - is the internet. There has not been a recession, aside from the covid flash-recession, in this age of the internet and technology. Information is more accessible than ever…you can figure out almost anything with a google search and some researching. It may seem like most people in here are “predicting” a recession, but there are only around 5.5 million people in this sub. In the USA alone there are >200 million working age adults. So even if every user in this sub is from the US, an active account, and predicting a recession - that would still be less than 3% predicting a recession. \n\nNow obviously there are people outside of this sub predicting a recession, I was just zooming the perspective out a bit.

It is possible, although unlikely, to have a recession without the stock market sinking/crashing. Trying to time, or predict the direction of, the stock market is no different from trying to predict which slot machine will pay. Now as to why I believe a recession is likely.\n\n* You don’t fight the fed. The fed is predicting, and assisting in the start of, a recession. \n\n*Fed funds rate is now at levels not seen since 2007-2008. This doesn’t directly lead to a recession, but it leads to a tightening of credit which is recessionary in nature. Any business that has been surviving on free money(low rates) - no longer has access to this free money. This will lead to bankruptcies, which we are starting to see. Many businesses will also restructure/cut costs - less business investment, lower pay/benefits, job cuts, etc. \n\n* Business inventories are rising. This has a negative effect on companies’ cash balances - not good with tightening credit. This also leads to companies reducing outgoing orders for product. This is mostly the cause for why you see manufacturing output rapidly declining.\n\n* The economic equilibrium is out of balance. Since the last recession, wage gains have paled in comparison to price increases (this was a problem prior to Covid and many were already predicting a recession before the pandemic). This rapidly accelerated in the last few years - so it is the same problem as before covid, but now much worse. \n\n* Yield curve inversion - I have seen this “doomsday” indicator recirculating online for months now, however, I suspect most do not understand what this is telling us. This means investors rather collect a fixed return over a longer period, because they view the potential reward for other investment options as not being worth the risk. I.e. They are expecting an economic downturn. \n\n* Federal assistance programs and debt repayment deferrals have/are coming to an end. This will only add insult to injury for already cash-strapped consumers. This leads to less expenditure. \n\nAlmost every economic indicator, with the major exceptions of unemployment data and the stock market, are pointing towards a recession. However, both of these indicators tend to lag behind the others. It may sound stupid - but I am hoping for a recession. Cooling periods are a normal/healthy part of the economic cycle.

CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.\n\nThe company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.\n\nRevenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.\n\nTesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.\n\n\nShareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.\n\nIn early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.\n\nA month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.\n\nAccording to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.\n\nTesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies.

That’s unironically exactly what’s happening. \n\nFirst off, tesla won’t be making less money at all. \n\nThey’ll be stealing sales from competitors. And since they’re still profitable, they will make MORE money overall. \n\n\nThe customers want a car of a certain quality for the lowest price. \n\nAt the current pricing Tesla makes money on every EV they sell while Ford, for example, loses tens of thousands (40% negative margin) for every EV they sell. \n\nFor Ford to stop losing money, they need to have big factories efficiently producing EVs (like Tesla already has), AND THEY NEED TO SELL THOSE EVS. \n\nAssuming consumers pick the cheaper car, all else being equal, Tesla can continually reduce prices while still growing their deliveries rapidly and improving their economies of scale (continuing to reduce their costs) and never lose money (IE still be profitable). \n\nThe improved economies of scale enable cheaper costs to build, which can enable even more price cuts while remaining profitable. \n\nThis forces Ford to lower prices in line with Tesla and lose even more money. \n\nHence Tesla destroying the competition by “making less money” (per vehicle). \n\nFord, on the other hand, already has -40% margin on EVs. As Tesla lowers prices, Ford has to lower prices even more (lose even more money) to sell EVs. \n\n\nFord sold 20,000 EVs in 2022.\n\nTesla sold 1.3M EVs in 2022.\n\n\nSo, again assuming for a second that the cars are equal in capability and that Tesla and Ford  factories are similarly efficient, for simplicity, Ford would have to scale to approximately 1.3M EVs per year to have similar economies of scale to what Tesla has today. \n\nIf Tesla stopped growing deliveries and reducing their cost to build and stopped cutting prices, and somehow magically ford could snap their fingers and instantly scale to Tesla’s production rate, Ford would still have to sell 1.28M EVs at a 40% negative margin. \n\nOn a $50,000 ASP, that’s a $25.5 Billion dollar loss. \n\nAnd in reality, it would take Ford 6 years to get to Tesla’s scale if they doubled output every year (more than twice Tesla’s growth rate). \n\nSo the costs of just losing money to compete with Tesla on price would be closer to $39B. \n\nThat doesn’t count the cost to build the factory. \n\nThat assumes Tesla doesn’t cut prices even more. \n\nThat assumes Tesla stops growing and innovating for those 6 years. \n\nThat assumes Ford can field a comparably compelling car. \n\n\nTesla is like a great white at a toddler’s pool party.

Commodities peaked second half of 2022 then had a broad steep decline but have been up recently off their lowers and appear to be moderating once again.\n\nSo Tesla's BOM/COGS should be lower in 2023 vs 2022 (on average) as commodities deflation makes its way through the income statement. And this should help offset some prioce reductions.\n\nWhat i think is interesting is to look at Sandy Mundro and Associates' estimates from 2018 vs 2022 here: [https://insideevs.com/news/632506/sandy-munro-tesla-price-annihilate-competitors/](https://insideevs.com/news/632506/sandy-munro-tesla-price-annihilate-competitors/)\n\nIn 2018 they estimated the COGS of a Model 3 LR at $33.6k. In 2022 they estimated  Model Y LR COGS at $39.4k, which is $6k higher. Even though the Model Y is 10% larger than the Model 3, it doesn't need 10% more materials so the COGS should be roughly the same all else being equal.\n\nSo if Tesla reduced COGS by 30% vs 2018, today's M3 RWD would cost around $22K to produce in 2018 commodity prices... which is insane when you think about it. It also shows that commodities inflation is probably responsible for a more than 50% or $10k rise in COGS.\n\nBut as i pointed out above, those commodity prices are coming back down and they still have a ways to go before reaching 2018's prices. When they do, Tesla recaptures all of that margin which could be potentially massive. What's unclear is how quickly commodity prices flow through the income statement. I'm certain there's a lag, how much though? I don't know.

During COVID it's also probable that a number of suppliers for materials and/or parts were unable to actually meet their contractual obligations due to shutdowsn which could have forced Tesla to buy some things at spot prices from other suppliers who could deliver.\n\nAnyway, it's interesting to note that in the Q1 report Tesla highlighted higher materials, commoditites, and logistics costs on YoY basis as a negative impact to revenues/earnings. This is notable because if you look at spot commodity prices you'll notice most commodities peaked in the second quarter of 2023 and (as i pointed out above) are 20-40% lower today on a YoY basis. Yet Tesla's COGS are higher YoY. This is the lag i'm talking about. Clearly the materials in cars being made today were paid for or bought at higher prices than last year. And those higher prices are almost a year ago now.\n\nSo going forward, it's likely that COGS will decline from materials deflation. But it will take time for that to impact the income statement. We're already seeing some impact though on a QoQ basis, and they said we would see more next quarter. And I imagine this will probably continue well into next year if commodities continue deflating to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nFocus on the chart Tesla provided. They said they cut COGS by 30% on a Model 3 on an inflation-adjusted basis. This means if commodities return to 2018 prices, Tesla's COGS on a China-made Model 3 would probably be around $22k (assuming Munro's estimate is relatively accurate).", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Great comment.\n\nBut why the assumption that commodity prices will go back down to 2018 prices? At first glance that seems no different than assuming house prices will go back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nSome commodity inflation came from disrupted supply chains. But some of it also came from money printing. And some of the prices in EV specific materials (like lithium) could continue upwards due to EV production and competition.\n\nHave you done enough research to say which factors are dominant in this case?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think there's too many specifics to really thuroughly research and make a definitive conclusion.\n\nBut if you zoom way out, in my opinion at least, i believe most of the \"inflation\" during the pandemic was directly the result of forced shutdowns. Forced shutdowns of factories and production caused supply shortages of everything, from materials, to commoditites, to micro-chips. And at the same time the ultra-low interest rates and free money from government stimulus programs helped to prop up demand for products and services, especially for finance loans for homes and cars. Work from home orders in particular drove up demand for computors/laptops which worsened the chip shortage (but this was also a non-recurring event).\n\nBut this wasn't a natural shift in supply or demand, it was artificial. The \"norm\" was pre-pandemic, and that is what i believe we will be returning to. Of course, there are \\*some\\* materials like Lithium or Nickel which have (as a result of increased EV production) seen real demand increase since 2018. And prices on those materials may be materially higher until supply catches up. But i also believe there is plenty of supply of those materials in the earth, and supply will catch up to demand.\n\nLook at Lithium for example, it's allready closer to 2018 prices than it is to it's 2021-2022 peak. Similarly, more new Nickel mines are being opened rapidly in Indonesia and this isn't the first time Nickel prices have been this high. In 2007 and again in 2011, Nickel prices were as high or higher than today but look at where they ended up a couple years later. So i doubt this time will be any different.\n\nAnd i guess i have one last observation on inflation and the growth in money supply due to all the stimulus. You know, alot of people like to parrot this idea that inflation was created by all the new money pumped into the economy by the government, but if that were the case, then why didn't all the stimulus from 2009 keep materials and commodity prices permanetly higher? Alot of metals (like Nickel, Aluminium, Steel) bottomed out during the recession in 2009, peaked a couple years later in 2011, but by 2015 they were back to their 2008 lows.\n\nSo, i think it's pretty clear the money supply doesn't control commodity prices as much as supply/demand does, which is in turn controlled by interest rates/economic conditions. In 2009, commodity/materials prices bottomed due to what was a severe recession, high unemployment, etc which severely depressed economic activity (home building, car buying etc). The FED dropped interest rates and pumped a bunch of money into the economy. Economic activity ecentually turned up, and as a result demand for commodities recovered and so did their prices. But dropping rates to near zero doesn't permanently increase demand, it's like a sugar high. Everyoen tries to take advantage of it all at once at the start, and then once everyone has got their loans and bought cars/homes, it doesn't matter if rates are near zero... demand eventually trails off. And that's what you see in commodity prices.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the FED didn't start raising rates until 2016. So despite the fact that interest rates were basically held near zero from 2009-2016, you had this boom bust cycle in commoditites which was probably due to supply and demand. First a lack of demand during the recession, then a spike in demand thanks to record low interest rates (the sugar high), and then finally following the spike in prices was probably a spike in supply and/or a dip in demand which brought prices back down.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "2018 is when they were first ramping model 3 production (not getting economies of scale) and only producing in California (significantly higher labor costs).

You also need to get some better sources. [EPA.gov](https://EPA.gov), the ICCT report, and [sciencedirect.com](https://sciencedirect.com) are highly political institutions.\n\nHere's the facts around renewable energy (excluding nuclear and hydro which are actually amazing).\n\nRenewable energy (wind and solar) are intermittent, low density forms of energy. While they technically always exist on earth, they do not always exist in the same geographic location, and require a ton of effort to concentrate and turn into usable power. The sun only shines during the day, and the wind does not always blow. Since these realities go against our basic energy demands (we need heat when its cold and dark, irrigation and cooling when it's hot and not windy) we create grids which have BOTH the hydrocarbon capacity for energy generation and a secondary supporting layer which is made up of unreliable energy like wind and solar. This is massively inefficient and causes tons of problems, but even putting that aside, there is not a single grid in the entire world which relies on wind or solar for its power needs.\n\nHydrocarbons like oil, gas, diesel etc. are very dense forms of energy. They also benefit from being highly portable, easy to store across long periods of time, and cheap to produce. The reason that people want to transition to electric vehicles is not because we want to 'reduce exhaust fumes'. There are very strict regulations already in place for car emissions, and in most wealthy countries with good rule of law this is already not an issue. You're also just exporting your emissions to another location where the power is actually generated, so not exactly a huge accomplishment. The real reason people want to transition to electric vehicles is because they have bought into the lie that our energy consumption is going to destroy the world. They think C02 (plant food) moving from 250ppm to 450ppm is going to disrupt the delicate balance that existed in nature and kill us all, which is insanity. Governments have acted on that insanity to take tax money and put it towards 'green' energy sources, which is why all these companies pander to ESG narratives and why companies like Tesla can sell inferior products to consumers.\n\nOnly a complete moron would think building an entirely new stock of vehicles worldwide which relies on batteries (mineral mining + energy use) and a theoretical solar and wind grid which doesn't work and would require more mineral mining and energy use to even have a hope of existing would be a net benefit to the planet.

With the most recent launch AMD actually has some firepower with their latest lineup in terms of price/performance but all of that again applies only to retail gpu's.

While I’m on the way on a long trip in my car or hybrid, you’ll be in your third stop burning 90min trying to charge your shit. Just use your brain. What seems like an easy transition isn’t. EV is hot right now because of massive inflated gas prices. But it will never be sustained at these levels, guaranteed. At that point when gas drops, the price points will need to be comparable, the efficiency in timing to charge has to dramatically improve (even a 15 min charge is way longer than a 2min stop at a gas station), and the market has to dramatically grow. That all takes time….a shitload of time.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "What a brain dead response. \n\nA) Oil is not going anywhere.

Government regulations are going to force it \n\nD) car manufacture are chomping at the bits to go electric to increase their margins. Because now they can get rid of the dealers. And also because margins are higher on electric vehicles. And also replacement of batteries will make cars obsolete sooner and make people replace cars quicker. \n\nE) battery tech is improving and there is massive amounts of improvements in the next 10 years. Range is not an issue. 99% of commuting is under 50 miles a day. This made up fantasy that people run out of battery because they drive day trips everyday applies to almost nobody. \n\nF) even if you did need to make a stop for a road trip. charging speeds are improving. A 10-15 minute pit stop will get you 50% more battery. That’s a bathroom stop on a road trip. And there is no more need for gas stops during the day. It charges at work or at home. Also gas doesn’t take 2 minutes my friend. Next time time yourself. It’s more like 4-5 minutes. \n\nG) electric to grid battery charging will allow home  owners to have a free battery  as backup. Also setting up a charger at home to charge at super off peak times means you are paying less than gas in every possible scenario. Gas will never be cheaper than off peak charging at home when you sleep. \n\nI have more reasons but I’ll stop because you probably won’t even bother reading or are so stubborn won’t even accept any of these facts.

If he’s not going to innovate the design, then the company is as good as dead since the major automakers know that generation refreshes are how their brands stay relevant to consumers.\n \n\nYeah, it will be interesting to watch this fight unfold over the years. Automakers make really small changes to their vehicles except updating the body annually. The Tesla Gigapress is able to deliver high margins in the industry with the downside it’s incredibly expensive to set up, and Tesla is locked into the same design every year. Not good if people become sick of the aesthetic. \n\nIf Tesla’s price and product is not inherently superior to that of legacy automakers, consumers can be wooed by a sexier design by another automaker, and Tesla’s big bet will not pay off. On the other hand, if legacy auto can’t make EVs that are the same quality as Tesla at Tesla’s price point, they will be in trouble in the long run.  \n\nPersonally, I dont really care what my car looks like (I guess I have some vanity, I draw the line at a Leaf). I just want my car to be safe, reliable, and cost effective (low cost per mile over the car’s lifetime).

These types of tax credits (cash back) will even have companies like Chevron scratching their heads thinking should we open another rig or take that money and become EV charging station manufacturers and be guaranteed to get 30% of the investment back.  \n\nWhat does this all mean?  It means the company selling EV cars and most established in EV (Tesla) will have most to gain as a result of all this investment from the tax credit hungry venture capitalist looking for a 30% guaranteed return from an investment.  There will be close to $500 billion worth of federal credits printed over the next 10 years.  It will not be abnormal for even small time people to be able to buy a federal credit on the resale market for 90 cents on the dollar from one of these venture capital offices that has a shit ton of them to sell.
