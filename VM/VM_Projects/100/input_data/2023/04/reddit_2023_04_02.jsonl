In March, CEO Elon Musk announced the company plans to build a new factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from its factory in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe company also produces a heavy-duty truck, the Semi, at its battery plant in Sparks, Nevada. The company began deliveries of the Semi in December 2022.\n\nAccording to a mean of estimates, compiled by FactSet as of Friday, Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 432,000 vehicles for the quarter. Estimates included in the FactSet analysis ranged from 410,000 to 451,000 deliveries expected.\n\nThe independent researcher who publishes under the handle TroyTeslike was expecting deliveries of 427,000 and production totaling 445,920 vehicles.\n\nThe first quarter of 2023 was marked by repeated price cuts by Tesla including in the U.S., Europe and China.\n\nTesla’s moves sparked a so-called “price war” in EVs, and posed a challenge to competitors including Ford and General Motors who are trying to gain marketshare in the fully electric vehicle segment domestically.\n\nTesla shares rose more than 60% in the first quarter to close at $207.46 on Friday ahead of the production and deliveries report. (They closed at $123.18 on December 30th, the last day of trading in 2022.)", "id": "129rlfw", "created_utc": 1680455896.0, "score": 435, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 457, "comments": [{"body": "Deliveries by Q1 throughout Tesla's history.\n\nQ1 2023: 422,875\n\nQ1 2022: 310,048\n\nQ1 2021:  184,877\n\nQ1 2020:  88,400\n\nQ1 2019:   63,000\n\nQ1 2018:   29,980\n\nQ1 2017:   25,000\n\nQ1 2016:   14,820\n\nQ1 2015:   10,045\n\nQ1 2014:    6,457\n\nQ1 2013:    4,900\n\nQ1 2012:        0", "score": 350, "replies": [{"body": "The growth in production numbers is nuts too:\n\n2019: 365K vehicles\n\n2020: 509K\n\n2021: 930K\n\n2022: 1.3 million\n\n2023 Q1 only: 440K", "score": 178, "replies": [{"body": "New factory ramping up too with Monterrey likely opening up by next year with the cheaper Tesla model.\n\nCybertruck to come out this year and hopefully, an announcement of a Cybervan using the same vehicle platform as the Cybertruck by sometime next year.", "score": 68, "replies": [{"body": "Cyber truck to come out this year. \n\nLol.", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "Just like full self driving.

I don’t think there’s another automaker that has as little debt as Tesla does. And the whole tech company troupe aside, I think their supply chain and production lines for EV is still several years ahead of its closest competitors in the US and Europe, and their charging infrastructure is 5 years ahead.

Never stop for gas, never check the oil. It stays cool in summer and warm in winter. If I need service, I just schedule it from the phone app and a dude comes to my house. Large online community which answers every question.\n\nPersonally, I’ve been trading Tesla since it was public and probably 30% of my gains have come from that company. I wish I had just held my original shares, but each time the market cap got “too high, too fast” or my calls would print, I would cash out instead of roll forward. In 2019 I even went short bc it was absurd price after my deep otm calls printed and got lucky with the covid crash and bagged on the way down too. I didn’t get back in until this year when it was beat up a bit and left a lot on the table. \n\nYou can’t evaluate Tesla like traditional car makers, you just can’t. There are many more layers. It’s more similar trajectory to apple in the late 2000s early 2010s.  Look at their numbers. They sell pretty much every car they make and they don’t even advertise yet. They have a very loyal customer base and probably will experiment upgrade cycles like apple did with iPod/iPhone.\n\nYou honestly think dinosaurs like GM and Ford are going to compete? The only thing they make real profit on is big trucks/SUVs and that’s really only down to their own brand loyalty and the tariffs on imports. They have huge debt, supply chain and labor issues, poor management, and no real vision. People hate on Tesla for its EV tax credit benefit as not sustainable, but the big three benefit from a 25% import tariff on pickup trucks that started 60 years ago.\n\nMy boomer dad (if he lives long enough) will get an electric car the same way he reluctantly gave up his flip phone for an iPhone. He will consult me and I’ll tell him to get a Tesla bc that’s what I have and can give him the free tech support for it if he needs it.\n\nAlso, don’t forget the silent generation and boomers own like 75% of everything and are going to die in the next two decades. What do you think their GenX children and zoomer grand children are going to buy with that money?  Toyota and Lexus? \n\nAnd my point about market cap, is that most retail traders don’t care about market cap. They think (wrongly) share price is a measure of value.

The company, in the message, asked employees to cancel all in-person meetings with vendors and other outside parties at its headquarters. \n“During the week of April 3, we will communicate key decisions related to roles and staffing levels across the organization,” the company said in the message viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMcDonald’s declined to comment Sunday on the number of employees being laid off. \nMcDonald’s in January said that it planned to make “difficult” decisions about changes to its corporate staffing levels by April, as part of a broader strategic plan for the burger chain. \nChief Executive Chris Kempczinski said in an interview at the time that he ex pected to save money as part of the workforce assessment, but said then he didn’t have a set dollar amount or number of jobs he was looking to cut. “Some jobs that are existing today are either going to get moved or those jobs may go away,” Mr. Kempczinski said.\n\nMcDonald’s employs more than 150,000 people globally in corporate roles and its owned restaurants, with 70% of them located outside of the U.S., the chain said in February. \nMcDonald’s in the message acknowledged that the week of April 3 would be a busy one for personal travel, which it said contributed to the decision to deliver the news remotely. Workers who wouldn’t have access to a computer during the week should provide personal contact information to their manager, the company said.\n\n“We want to ensure the comfort and confidentiality of our people during the notification period,” the company said. \nCompanies across industries are reducing head counts amid concerns about a slowing economy. Layoffs that began in the tech sector last year have spread to retailers and manufacturers. Last month Amazon.com Inc. said it was eliminating 9,000 more jobs, following previously announced layoffs.\n\nMcDonald’s sales have held up even as retailers have reported a slowdown in spending. \nThe company told investors in January that some lower-income consumers were ordering fewer items per visit or opting for cheaper offerings, but customers generally continued to spend at its restaurants. \nMcDonald’s has conducted several rounds of layoffs in recent years. In 2018, McDonald’s said that the com pany was cutting its management to be “more dynamic, nimble and competitive.” The company said at the time the layoffs would occur as part of a half-billion-dollar plan to shrink administrative expenses by the end of 2019.\n\nMr. Kempczinski, who was the company’s U.S. president at the time, didn’t disclose the scope of the head-count reduction, but said it included regional chain offices. McDonald’s said it employed 205,000 people globally in corporate roles and its owned restaurants in 2019, down from 235,000 in 2017. \n\nIn a company message from January, McDonald’s said that the sprawling company operated in too many silos, leading to redundancies and slowing its innovation. The chain said it aimed to consolidate its work on some projects, and stop or move away from others.", "id": "12a1vka", "created_utc": 1680477486.0, "score": 893, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 398, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|53|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: McDonald's is planning on notifying its workers of their job status virtually this week.
