Intel and AMD flagships have anywhere between 12-24 cores, and double the amount of threads. 24gb of ram is not enough in VR applications today, which is probably why Intel and AMD allow over a hundred. L3 cache is pretty useful for CPU heavy applications, like lots of VR applications are, and that's why AMD made an entire line of chips with more L3, and Intel followed. 3.5ghz clock speed slow AF. Intel and AMD are both over 5 at this point, and not just for half the cores. \n\n\nSo yes, apples hardware does in fact suck, and has literally zero chance of running any hardware intensive tasks.

{"title": "Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard", "selftext": "LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).\n\nThe  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.\n\nMicrosoft said it plans to appeal the decision.\n\nThe  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.\n\nMicrosoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.\n\nCloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.\n\nMicrosoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.\n\nExecutives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.\n\nHowever, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.\n\n[Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. \n\n Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)\n\nand other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.\n\nMicrosoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.\n\nMicrosoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.\n\nThe CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.\n\nCloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.\n\nEven with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds. Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)\n\nand other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.\n\nMicrosoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.\n\nMicrosoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.\n\nThe CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks.

Nor are people going to suddenly stop using their OS, or buying XBoxes/games or even their enterprise products. Generally speaking, enterprise doesnt buy MSFT products because they love MSFT. They do it because MSFT is really the only game in town for controlling and securing LAN PC's. Literally no competition in the space. At least none that is fully supported at the hardware level and constantly updated. There is a shift to cloud but you cant really secure your LAN this way. There are also a few Linux based projects that aim to do something similar but they have sparse support and would require you to switch all desktops to Linux which would be a huge task and likely not worth it.\n\nReally the only downside here to MSFT is they lose direct service contracts. That will be replaced by 3rd party contracts. Basically some company in the UK will take over servicing MSFT products and they will pay MSFT for access otherwise their products wont get security updates.\n\nAll this said, its obviously not ideal to walk away from a country. No one wants to do that if they can avoid it so MSFT will likely make some concessions instead of pushing their way out.

Many years ago I spent time watching a lot of his interviews. There was literally a youtube channel called Every Elon Musk Video. And I could understand the more difficult parts of his personality, like how hard he drives people.\n\nNothing he's done has surprised me. Everything today is consistent with who he was back then. He was never a \"democrat\", for instance. The dude is not a follower. He's not gonna follow a fucking political party. Some people maybe had a caricature of him in their minds. Which is understandable, but it's not like he suddenly changed. Many people avoided investing in Tesla specifically because they thought Elon could do something crazy, like buy Twitter by selling Tesla stock. That wasn't a black swan, it was completely white.\n\nAbout the only thing I've been surprised by the last few years is Tesla having to cut prices so steeply. I don't think increased production is the main reason, and I don't think Elon's brand is a significant factor either. My guess is it's just the economy, and particularly interest rates. If I remember correctly, Elon said halving the price of a vehicle would roughly increase demand by 10x? Then taken the other way, increasing monthly payments can hurt demand sharply.\n\nIf I've done the [math](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=solve+f%28x%29+%3D+%281%2F10%29f%28x%2F2%29) correctly (unlikely), a 10% increase in monthly payments would correspond to f(1.1)/f(1) ~ 0.72, approximately a 30% drop in demand. Of course many caveats etc but something to consider. In other words this is all Powell's fault. As for vote, I'm voting for Elon on the board. His behavior is within my expected parameters, and even if it wasn't I wouldn't want to tempt mediocrity by voting against him.

That wasn't a black swan, it was completely white.\n\nFrom a First Principles perspective: let's assume that it is true, or at least extremely likely, that Elon will do something every few years that could wreck TSLA valuation because it makes investors want to stay away from the stock.\n\n**If Tesla's business is still doing really well in 5-10 years, are you willing to see the value of your TSLA holdings reduced by 75% again?**  With a slow and uncertain recovery?\n\nThis is why I'd rather have a board that communicates and defends shareholder value much better than the current one.\n\n* Tesla's board could have communicated last October that Tesla was still operationally in good hands and described why.

They didn't\n* There was no effort on the part of Tesla's board to make clear that Elon's opinions and behavior on Twitter do not reflect Tesla's values as an organization.  This was a flagrant dereliction of the board's duty to protect the interests of shareholders\n\nNone of this would have impeded Tesla from an operational standpoint.

Also the pandemic/FED chaos has played a part not just in the down cycle but also the up cycle, so that can make the drop seem more extreme even though it's not that crazy from a longer term baseline.\n\n> Tesla's board could have addressed allegations that Elon was misusing Tesla FSD engineering resources for Twitter. They didn't\n\nIt's probably not super useful for us to go back and forth much, but this is a good example to highlight the different perspectives. When I heard Elon was using Tesla engineers at Twitter, I thought \"yea, that sounds right, it's what I would do.\" I have a decent understanding of software engineering. Twitter engineering itself couldn't be trusted, so the only reasonable way to hit the ground running was to borrow engineers from either Tesla or SpaceX. Tesla made the most sense because of geography and subject matter.\n\nIn other words, Elon was misusing Tesla resources for Twitter. There may be laws against what he did the same way there are laws against jay walking, but I don't care. It was a temporary leech of resources that Tesla would have been better without, but it's what made the most sense given the various constraints. He couldn't un-buy Twitter at that point.\n\nThe board itself I see as mostly a rubber stamp board, which I would rather have over a mediocre board. Mechanically, I think Elon controls too large a proportion of the company for the board to have much power, which might explain why they don't want to incur his wrath. He will go scorched Earth for potentially the pettiest seeming thing, so they have to pick their battles wisely and quietly.

{"title": "Prediction: FRC will survive and recover", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am long 1400 shares on FRC at $12.00. I stayed up all night going over their Q1 financials running various scenarios. I work in finance and prepare / review financial statements for a living, so I'm highly regarded as an expert when it comes to this stuff (however **this post is not financial advice**). \n\nAfter poring over [their financials](https://ir.firstrepublic.com/static-files/013f57fb-b980-4353-bbb3-0e7a3b27f20a), I'm growing increasingly confident that First Republic Bank will survive the most recent round of panic selling that we witnessed yesterday. I am predicting that the bank will not be seized by the FDIC and will return to profitability by 2024 after some restructuring. I am basing this opinion on several facts that I have outlined below. I may also be just huffing massive amounts of copium so take this FWIW.  \n\n\n1. **FRC does not currently have a liquidity problem.** They have $45b cash & credit available vs. customer deposits of $104b (cash to deposit ratio of 0.43). The same ratio in Q4 2022, prior to the panic, was 0.53 ($94b cash and credit vs. deposits of $176b). This is the key reason I think they will survive. As long as they are liquid and able to pay depositors, there is no reason for the FDIC to step in.  \n\n2. **FRC has and will continue to have positive net margin interest.** Net margin interest is the difference between interest income and interest expense. This is what had the market really worried with FRC. Since the bank is now borrowing money at higher rates from the federal reserve discount window to replace deposit outflows, the market assumption is that FRC's increased interest expense will make it death spiral. In their earnings disclosure, FRC provided the interest rates on their various assets and liabilities. Extrapolating those rates to future quarters shows that they will remain positive on net margin interest, ie their interest income will exceed their interest expense, even with the more expensive borrowings on their books. IF they do absolutely nothing, they will lose $91m in the next quarter (their first loss in many years). That's a very modest loss and hardly enough to take out a bank of their size.  \n\n3. **FRC has a viable path to profitability.** As they already outlined in the earnings call, FRC plans to sell between $50b to $100b of its loan portfolio. They will use this to pay down the amounts they have borrowed from the discount window. They will have to sell at a discount considering their bargaining position and the high-interest rate environment, but they can leverage the fact that their customers are high net worth with the potential to bring in more business to whoever buys the loan (wealth management being top of mind). If they execute this, perhaps with the help of the same banks that assisted them with the $30b deposit earlier, they will significantly improve their net margin interest. From the details filtering out in the press, the sale of the assets is a necessary first step to allow them to be able to raise capital from private equity to shore up their balance sheet.   \n\n4. **The FDIC does not want to step in.** The earnings release is not a surprise to the FDIC, they get up to date reports from FRC daily. If the situation was bad enough to put them in receivership, they would have done that weeks ago (remember, the Q1 earnings release shows us numbers from March 31). The FDIC coffers already got drained due to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failures, they will not seize FRC unless its absolutely necessary to protect depositors (which it isn't because FRC is liquid). The other banks also do not want FRC to fail, because they will be on the hook to reimburse the FDIC via a special assessment for losses arising out of FRC's failure.  \n\n5. **FRC's deposit base is more loyal than SVB.** SVB's clients were mostly start-ups, who by their nature live in a world of disruption with a here-today-gone-tomorrow view of the world. Contrast that with FRC's clients, who are mostly high-net worth individuals. The remaining depositors at FRC already weathered the first round of panic, so we can assume the more skittish depositors have already left. Also, FRC is known for its excellent customer service and personalized wealth management practice.   \n\n\nI ran several scenarios based on the plan outlined by FRC executives. I believe if they succeed in carrying out the restructuring they outlined, that they will return to profitability by 2024, with an earnings per share of about 1.86. Typically, bank stocks trade 12x earnings, which would mean a fair market value of $22.32. Not exactly a moonshot but may be a value pick during recessionary times.\n\nAnyway it's early morning now and looks like FRC is up to $8.45 pre-market, I am going to hodl and ride it out into the sunset.

Quality of SERVICE and PRODUCTS is degrading quickly. There are labor and supply shortages everywhere. Productivity and trade will dovetail.

{"title": "Your lotto play for META's earnings tonight", "selftext": "Yesterday, I posted about MSFT's earnings [and anyone who listed banked hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ytt9u/why_im_getting_msft_calls_for_earnings/). The stock is up 8.5% today, calls up massively. My last earning post before that was last week with [Tesla](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s2zqb/what_to_do_for_teslas_earnings_tonight/) which did extremely well too. Now we're looking to print more with META today. Who's ready? \n\nThe company will report its Q1 2023 earnings today after market close. The Facebook parent has been one of the greatest beneficiaries of tech's year-to-date rally, the company's stock climbing nearly fucking *70%* in 2023 ($124 -> $211). The company's \"year of efficiency\" messaging and execution has resonated with shareholders (us), so the next question is – can ol' Zucky keep it up? \n\nHere's what analysts on Wall Street are expecting to see out of Meta:\n\n* Revenue: $27.67 billion\n\n* EPS: $2.01\n\n* Advertising Revenue: $26.76 billion\n\n* Family of Apps Revenue: $26.88 billion\n\n* Reality Labs Operating Losses: $3.8 billion\n\nI expect the stock to beat the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. The company outperformed the street estimates in the last quarter, despite a 4% y-o-y drop in the total revenues to $32.17 billion. The top line primarily suffered due to lower advertising revenues. Notably, the average revenue per user was down on a year-on-year basis. That said, the daily active users improved in the quarter. I expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.\n\nMeta's \"Year of Efficiency\" has involved substantial cost-cutting at the company. In March, Meta announced it would lay off [10,000 workers](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/meta-to-cut-another-10000-jobs-zuckerberg-says/), building on the company's previous layoff announcement back in November, which affected [11,000 employees](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1134139800/facebook-layoffs-instagram-meta). At the close of 2022, Meta had more than 80,000 employees. The impact of Meta’s cost-cutting initiatives such as reducing its headcount will be scrutinized.\n\nA number of analysts are coming into this earnings cycle with substantial optimism about Meta's trajectory (including me). JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth currently has Meta at Overweight and raised his price target on March 24 for the company to $270 from $225, reiterating the company as a \"top pick.\"\n\n\"Importantly, 2023 may be the 'Year of Efficiency,' but we believe Meta is building the critical muscle for financial discipline over the long term,\" he wrote in the March note. \"Meta shares have more than doubled off their early November lows but we still think there’s meaningful upside ahead driven by accelerating revenue growth, continued cost efficiencies, and still attractive valuation.\"\n\nHowever, challenges remain for Meta, as investors will look for improvement in the much-talked-about losses generated by the company's metaverse operation, Reality Labs, which lost a [whopping $13.7 billion in 2022](https://news.yahoo.com/meta-reality-labs-lost-13-230453969.html). Reality Labs is expected to report a loss of [$3.8 billion](https://www.forex.com/en-ca/market-analysis/latest-research/what-will-big-tech-earnings-mean-for-the-nasdaq-100-outlook/) in the first quarter, up from a loss of $2.96 billion for the same period last year. However, this would be an improvement quarter-over-quarter, with Meta posting a $4.28 billion loss from Reality Labs in 4Q 2022.\n\nAdditionally, company watchers are hoping Meta can begin to leave the digital ad slowdown of the last year in its past. Early data indicates that, on the ad market front at least, there could be a light at the end of the tunnel. The decrease was due to a slight drop in advertising revenues, which suffered because of tough macroeconomic conditions. The same was evident from the ARPU figure for the year – down 3% y-o-y. On the flip side, the DAUs increased by 4% y-o-y. I believe the Q1 results will follow the same trend.\n\n\"We think investors are cautiously optimistic on an improving digital ad market, while META has improved its cost structure and have given investors more confidence in management's commitment to profitability,\" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black on April 24. \"Recent ad checks indicated March ad spend was higher than anticipated and engagement data with Facebook and Instagram has been positive relative to peers.\"\n\nSo despite the Reality lab losses, I think META will beat estimates and will shoot up AH. So the play will be similar to MSFT, a call spread. I'll be getting META 4/28 215c and selling the 230c. This will cost $470, but can offer 3.2x gains if this goes our way.", "id": "12zph3r", "created_utc": 1682527051.0, "score": 135, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 102, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|31|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12juh8u/can_delta_or_united_airlines_stock_takeoff/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12qxya3/what_to_do_for_netflix_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s2zqb/what_to_do_for_teslas_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12kvaap/your_play_for_uhn_earnings_tomorrow/) \n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/CalmGains, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: I expect Meta to beat the street's estimates for earnings and revenues.

In a way, it was a good thing because Chrome, Firefox and all other browsers were already moving towards anonymizing data as much as possible, and this time it seems that META Has caught up. With its Conversion API, and Gooogle's Enhanced Conversions  it's able to get only some partial data, and that helps keep the user's anonymity. Going forward this API is supposed to replace the deprecated Pixel API, that was the bane of their existence when IOS 14+ Came out. \n\n\nAnother event that's bullish for META : Tiktok ban is gaining traction.
