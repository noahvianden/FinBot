(The resale market on the old chips these companies are replacing will cut out of their potential revenues as well.)\n\n3 - They have ongoing supply chain issues. They would need to ensure they are getting all of the required materials to make a million AI chips a year on top of all of the other tech they are producing. \n\n4 - Their market is already being limited - the US isn’t allowing them to sell any chips to China, unknown if other restrictions will follow. \n\n5 - The macroeconomic environment isn’t the best at the moment and innovation tends to come at a pretty high cost. \n\n6 - US/ China tensions over Taiwan have been escalating for a while now and Nvidia relies on Taiwan to manufacture their chips. \n\nLet’s just say they are able to overcome all of these challenges and consistently keep that 35% increase in revenue. They would still have a much higher P/E ratio than MSFT, which is also expected to greatly benefit from the AI innovation. \n\nI’m not trying to hate on Nvidia here whatsoever, I believe they are a truly innovative company and will continue to find success in the future.

{"title": "$TSLA National Adopt A Bear Day - 2023", "selftext": "Once upon a time, there was a CC bear named John who loved investing in TSLA. He was an experienced trader and had a good understanding of various trading strategies.\n\nOne day, John came across an opportunity to write a covered call option on TSLA. He decided to sell the call option as he thought the stock price was unlikely to go up much further. The premium he received for selling the call option was a nice boost to his portfolio.\n\nWeeks passed, and the stock price remained relatively stable. However, John started to hear rumors about a major product announcement by the company that could send the stock price soaring. He dismissed these rumors and felt confident that he had made the right decision to write the covered call option.\n\nOn the day of the product announcement, John was shocked to see the stock price skyrocketing. It was up by over 50%, and he had missed out on huge upside potential. He realized that he had underestimated the market's reaction to the news and had made a costly mistake.\n\nJohn felt frustrated and disappointed that he had missed out on such a big opportunity. He had believed that he had a good understanding of the stock and the market, but he had been wrong.\n\nJohn learned a valuable lesson about the stock market that day. He realized that even experienced traders can make mistakes and that it's important to stay informed about the companies in which he invests. He also learned that sometimes, it's better to hold on to a stock and not write covered call options if there's a chance of a major announcement that could significantly impact the stock price.\n\nFrom that day forward, John made a commitment to stay up-to-date with company news and be more cautious when it comes to writing covered call options. While he missed out on a huge opportunity, he gained a valuable lesson that would help him make better investment decisions in the future.\n\nJohn's name was change in the interest of privacy.\n\n\\-----\n\nThese guys need some love.
