They seem to assume that hedging volatility has some kind of value, though I can't find out what value they think it has. It's like they assume the reader already understands the value hedging volatility would have. And maybe they are right. In certain institutional contexts, hedging volatility can reduce costs, which ultimately improves performance, all else equal. For example, if excessive volatility creates more taxable events, via capital gains distributions that can't be balanced out by tax loss harvesting (because the prospectus for the fund prevents too much of that), that can be detrimental to an institutional portfolio.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "OK, thanks.
