{"title": "Samsung‚Äôs profit plunged 95% to its lowest level since 2009 as chip demand slumps", "selftext": ">South Korean electronics giant Samsung‚Äôs operating profit plunged in the first quarter as prices for its memory chips continued to fall and demand remained weak.  \n>  \n>Here are Samsung‚Äôs earnings at a glance in the first quarter:¬†  \n>  \n>**Revenue:** 63.75 trillion Korean won (about $47.6 billion), down 18% year-on-year. That is on par with [Samsung‚Äôs own guidance of approximately 63 trillion Korean won](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-earnings-guidance-for-first-quarter-2023) but below the 63.9 trillion won expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates.  \n>  \n>**Operating profit:** 640 billion Korean won (roughly $478.55 million), down from 14.12 trillion won a year earlier. The company [issued guidance earlier this month](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-earnings-guidance-for-first-quarter-2023) saying Q1 profit would be 600 billion Korean won.  \n>  \n>This is the company‚Äôs lowest operating profit since the first quarter of 2009.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**Samsung sees memory recovery ahead**  \n>  \n>Traditionally, Samsung‚Äôs biggest profit driver is its semiconductor division which consists of sales of memory chips that go into everything from personal computers to smartphones to servers in data centers.  \n>  \n>Samsung posted a 4.58 trillion Korean won loss at its semiconductor business versus a 8.45 trillion won profit in the same period last year.  \n>  \n>During the pandemic, smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips as demand for consumer devices increased, but they are now grappling with excess inventories as consumers cut back on purchases of these goods due to rising inflation. This has led to a fall in prices for the memory chips that Samsung sells.  \n>  \n>The South Korean giant said this month [it would be making a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/samsung-electronics-says-first-quarter-profit-likely-plunged-96percent-as-chip-glut-slashes-prices.html) cut in memory chip production, following the lead of smaller rivals such as SK Hynix and Micron.  \n>  \n>‚ÄúSamsung Electronics announced the disappointing number for the first quarter, but at the same time, they announced a meaningful production cut amid the severe memory chip downturn. After that, the market reacted positively on the news,‚Äù SK Kim of Daiwa Securities Capital Markets told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box Asia‚Äù on Thursday.  \n>  \n>Samsung did however forecast a recovery in the second-half of the year.  \n>  \n>‚ÄúDemand is expected to gradually recover in 2H amid projections that customer inventory levels will have declined,‚Äù Samsung said.  \n>  \n>[Samsung said it expects limited demand recovery](https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-first-quarter-2023-results) as large-scale data centers invest more conservatively and customers continue to adjust inventories. Samsung also expects launches of new smartphones, PC promotions and expansion of new CPU adoption to boost memory chip demand.  \n>  \n>SK Hynix, a competitor to Samsung, [also guided for a recovery in memory chips](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/sk-hynix-reports-record-quarterly-operating-loss-forecasts-better-outlook.html) when it reported a record quarterly loss on Wednesday,  \n>  \n>‚ÄúIf we got a rebound, it‚Äôs mostly driven by the production cut and some restocking demand. So we see, despite the disappointing earnings number, some positive investor sentiment on the stock,‚Äù said Kim.  \n>  \n>Samsung‚Äôs stock was around 0.6% higher on Thursday.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**S23 Ultra gives mobile a boost**  \n>  \n>During the first quarter, Samsung launched its latest lines of flagship [smartphones called the S23 series](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/samsung-galaxy-s23-smartphone-lineup-to-take-on-apples-iphone-14.html), which gave its mobile division a boost.  \n>  \n>Revenue at its mobile business grew 22% versus the previous quarter to 30.74 trillion won, but was down 2% versus the same period last year. Operating profit came in at 3.94 trillion won, up 3% year-on-year.  \n>  \n>Samsung was helped by sales of its highest priced smartphone ‚Äî the $1,200 S23 Ultra.  \n>  \n>‚ÄúThe premium market grew in terms of both volume and value even amid weak smartphone demand caused by lingering macro uncertainties,‚Äù Samsung said in a statement. ‚ÄúSales grew and profitability recovered to reach double-digits on the back of strong sales of new premium models, centering on S23 Ultra, and efforts to enhance operational efficiencies.‚Äù  \n>  \n>Overall, Samsung‚Äôs smartphone division appeared to remain resilient amid an overall tough quarter for the industry. Shipments of smartphones fell 13% year-on-year in the first quarter of the year, according to data released Thursday by market research firm Canalys. Samsung reclaimed the top spot globally in terms of smartphone market share, Canalys said.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>**Tech recovery underway?**  \n>  \n>Samsung is the latest tech company globally to report earnings after numbers from U.S. technology giants [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/), [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) and [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/).  \n>  \n>Daniel Yoo, head of global asset allocation at Yuanta Securities Korea, pointed to strong results from these American tech firms.  \n>  \n>Meta saw [first-quarter sales boosted by advertising from Chinese companies](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/meta-q1-23-earnings-boosted-by-chinese-retailers-buying-ads.html) while Microsoft posted¬†[third-quarter results](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-report-2023.html)¬†that beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines.  \n>  \n>‚ÄúI do think that the recovery story is coming. And the good factor is that despite such poor profit numbers coming through, we are seeing sharp prices stabilizing,‚Äù Yoo said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúStreet Signs Asia‚Äù on Thursday.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/27/samsung-earnings-q1-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/27/samsung-earnings-q1-2023.html)", "id": "130jaxp", "created_utc": 1682595709.0, "score": 1676, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 225, "comments": [{"body": "Bad for Samsung, but NVME drives have never been so cheap.

{"title": "Your lotto play for AMZN's earnings tonight", "selftext": "So yesterday I told everyone to buy [META calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) before earnings and it was a straight banger with the stock up 15% after earnings. The day before? [MSFT earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/), posted it before market close. Those who followed either times made big money! What's today's post? Let's take a look at Amazon (AMZN) which is set to release its earnings report today after the closing bell. Can we do it again? Let's see. We're all eagerly waiting to see the tech giant's financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. With a gain of 23% year to date, way above the 7% rise in the S&P 500 index, Amazon has been one of the better-performing names within the tech sector. We want to know if daddy Bezos can maintain his strong momentum.\n\nI expect the company to top the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. Amazon outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 9% to $149.2 billion. It was due to a 13% rise in North America revenues and a 20% improvement in the Amazon web services segment. That said, the positive impact was partially offset by an 8% drop in international division revenues. I fully expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.\n\nTrefis estimates Amazon‚Äôs valuation at [$134 per share](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/p5DVYQLL/Amazon-AMZN-Valuation-Is-AMZN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427), which is 22% above the current market price of around $110. \n\n**Revenues expected to top the estimates**\n\n[Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 9% y-o-y](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/HcytK2Km/Amazon-Revenues-How-Does-AMZN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427) to $514 billion in FY2022.\n\n* The company witnessed positive growth in net revenues from physical stores (11%), third-party seller services (14%), subscription services (11%), advertising services (21%), and AWS (29%) divisions. We expect the same pattern to continue in Q1.\n* The net sales from the online stores category marginally decreased in the year to $220 billion. We expect the same trend to continue in Q1.\n* Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $560 billion for the full-year 2023.\n\nThe estimates follow that Amazon‚Äôs fiscal Q1 2023 net revenues to be around $125.99 billion, slightly above the $124.54 billion consensus estimate.\n\n**EPS is likely to beat the consensus estimates**\n\nAmazon Q1 2023 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.22, 5% above the consensus estimate of $0.21. The adjusted net income decreased from $33.4 billion to -$2.7 billion in FY 2022. It was partly due to an increase in operating expenses and partly because of an unfavorable decrease in non-operating income from $13.3 billion to -$18.2 billion. Markedly, the non-operating income primarily suffered because of a pre-tax valuation loss from an equity investment in Rivian Automotive.\n\nWe expect the operating expenses to follow the same trend in Q1. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $1.71 and revenue per share of $55.44 for the full-year 2023.\n\n**Stock price estimate is 22% higher than the current market price**\n\nRemember the $134 evaluation? This was using an RPS estimate of around $55.44 and a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of just above 2x in fiscal 2023. This translates into a price of $134, which is 31% above the current market price. Note that P/E Multiples are based on Share Price at the end of the year and reported (or expected) Adjusted Earnings for the full year.\n\n**What do other Finance Websites Say?**\n\n[TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/) also expects Amazon to post strong results. They report that Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is likely to remain a significant contributor to the company's overall revenue.\n\n[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/) predicts that Amazon's first-quarter earnings will be driven by its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. It also notes that AWS (Amazon Web Services) is expected to post revenue of $14.03 billion, representing a YoY increase of 28.6%. \n\n[Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) mentions that in response to an uncertain macro backdrop, management has implemented some aggressive cost-saving measures to boost both profitability and its margin profile. These measures include shutting down unprofitable businesses, reducing its global headcount and reprioritizing resources in an effort to right-size the business. The goal is for amazon (like meta) to emerge leaner and stronger. \n\nFor those who don't know the [Tastylive website](https://www.tastylive.com/), they've also provided a comprehensive preview of Amazon's earnings report, highlighting the company's ability to beat expectations in the past. Amazon has a history of surpassing Wall Street's earnings estimates, and it is expected to continue this trend in Q1 2023. However, they also mention potential challenges, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, that could impact the company's financial performance.\n\n**Amazon Earnings Expected Move**\n\nTake a look at the implied volatility of the options market, we can see what the market perception is on AMZN‚Äôs stock price movement going forward. With an expected move of ¬±$6.55, we are looking at just over a 5% expected move on the current stock price for this earnings announcement, which is not necessarily high for a household name like Amazon. If we were to look further into the June cycle though, we can see that this ¬±$6.55 expected move makes up over 60% of the June cycle‚Äôs expected move, which is a substantial chunk given the circumstances.\n\nAMZN stock is currently trading around $110, and we can see that equidistant out-of-the-money options for the weekly options cycle are trading for around the same price - this tells us that the market is not pricing in any sort of skew for this announcement, which is a perceived high-velocity movement. This basically (unfortunately) offers no indication on whether it's going to move up or down. However, given all the details above, what do *you* think? No seriously, take a moment to think about the information presented before you continue reading and try to think: calls or puts for earnings? We do know that with the stock currently at $110, Amazon's risk-versus-reward profile suggests the stock could produce strong returns in the next 12 to 18 months. *But what about earnings??*\n\n**What to do for today's Earnings**\n\nGiven all the considerations above, it would be an absolute degen play to even bother considering going into Amazon for earnings. (Oh.. who am I kidding?( Let's fucking go for it! AMZN 4/28 call spread is looking juicy. Can buy the 115c and sell the 120c for $122. This can offer 4.1x gains if things go our way. Mind you, this is not financial or investment advice - this post is just offering education based on what people tend to look for in a company to make an earnings prediction.

Now look at what happened over night‚Ä¶ we went from a 26% chance of 450-475 rate/ 40.2% chance of 425-450 rate to currently now a 48% chance of 450-475 and 30.2% chance of 425-450‚Ä¶\n\nWhat does this mean? This means that we actually just saw over night the market go from pricing in 75bps of rate CUTS by the end of the year to now only pricing in 50 bps of rate CUTS by the end of year‚Ä¶ \n\nNow last time I checked the market has always seen rate cuts as bullish and rate hikes as bearish‚Ä¶ actually what is even more impressive is that over the last month we went from an expected 35.9% chance of 400-425 fed funds rate EOY (aka 100bps of rate CUTS) to where we currently are as mentioned ago‚Ä¶ that means FINALLY the market is actually starting to believe jpow‚Ä¶ \n\nNow this is where im pure speculating and spit balling my theory here‚Ä¶ what if markets really didn‚Äôt believe JPOW last fomc? What if we ran up in hopes that JPOW was wrong and that we would actually cut 100bps‚Ä¶ well in less than a week JPOW is going to stand up there and tell the markets ‚Äúim hiking 25bps and once again as I said last meeting our base case is NO rate CUTS this year.‚Äù Now this time markets are going to start to believe him‚Ä¶ \n\nThen what happens next? Well we get CPI and boy do I think we get some CPI fireworks‚Ä¶ look at the price of OIL alone and the fact that current forecasts are for an unchanged YOY CPI/ CORE. Why does that matter? Well after 9 consecutive months of downward trending CPI we finally are about to stall/ rebound. What is that going to do? Well that is going to cause even more panic‚Ä¶ why? Simple‚Ä¶ JPOW absolutely can not (outside of an actual black swan market crash) stop rate hikes if inflation rebounds or even just slows its downward trend. \n\nWhen inflation is unchanged or more likely rebounds on May 10th markets gonna panic‚Ä¶ but I think they already know this‚Ä¶ they are going to have to with no choice price in even less rate cuts by EOY if not more rate HIKES by EOY‚Ä¶ \n\nSo the question would be why did SPY just put in the biggest green day in over 3 months on seemingly extremely bearish new that is staring us down right now? Its simple‚Ä¶ market needs exit liquidity‚Ä¶ Today is going to be the highest volume bull day since March 31st. In my opinion and theory markets know May is going to be a very bearish month and that we are going to see a true drop (think 380-390)‚Ä¶ right now we are seeing this push back up into the consolidation range for a few reasons‚Ä¶ 1. Burn as many people already short (remember market is apparently the most net short since 2008) before the drop happens. 2. Big money needs to exit their longs and shares that they bought from 410-418 and 3. Big money is trying to get the best price they can on shorts. \n\nIn no way should the VIX have dropped nearly 10% on the data and news we got this morning and not with what the market priced in with the fed funds rate‚Ä¶ This is a fake rally in my opinion. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/144zb3ojwhwa1.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae5e5f4b65436f705c365266e6a0e56eb4bab790\n\nFrom a supply and demand stand point we had a pretty killer and wild day‚Ä¶ We had a lot of changes‚Ä¶ \n\nWe officially established a new demand (support) at 404.3 and in doing do pushed up to take our 406.74 and 409.18 demand. \n\nIn addition we pushed up all the way to 412.62 supply and had a pretty solid rejection off of it. \n\nI see two scenarios playing out here‚Ä¶ first scenario is that tomorrow we will push up to touch 414.22 demand (to take it out) but close back under 412.62 which should reconfirm that level as supply (resistance) that would then pave way for a push back to 404.3 demand and possibly down to 399.07 supply next week. Or the second scenario would be that we just immediately turn around and sell off back under the daily 8/20ema tomorrow which most likely would result in 412.62 being reconfirmed as supply (resistance) \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8t7a7r2kwhwa1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6f3a42f80a8e89fb86270705c75b0482cd1c005\n\nNow on SPY here price action wise this was quite the reversal and really did put a stop to the bears right in their tracks‚Ä¶ The biggest and most bullish thing I see here is that we came up and retook the daily 8 and 20ema‚Ä¶ While it is possible we could immediately double top tomorrow and drop back under the daily 8ema by EOD‚Ä¶ more likely than not this shows a pattern of continuation to the upside for tomorrow. \n\nLooking at this realistically we have now established a new range of 404.3 to 415.6. Upside should continue to be limited right around the 414 to 416 area. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvukdyikwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=21145d09c4bc76d82141054a69800b33039408d5\n\nWe do get some more data in the morning which will be interesting to watch play out and how markets receive this data‚Ä¶. I honestly don‚Äôt have a high sense of direction for tomorrow but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see an attempt to touch and take out that 414.22 demand we left above‚Ä¶ doing so really would open up a lot more down side possibilities. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 412.6 -> 415.4  \n Demand- 414.2  \n Support- 410.6 -> 409.2 -> 406.9  \n Resistance- 412.6 -> 414.1 -> 415.2\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v67q9ykwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b482691fa1a3bd42f9854fe817042d78b072fb04\n\nFutures daily also had some re-arranging today. We put in a new demand (support) at 4085 and have push up to take out 4117 demand. We now are currently sitting just over 4158 supply with the next supply at 4178 and 4198. \n\nMuch of the same here on Futures as SPY I do see a case to immediately turn around to reconfirm 4158 as supply (resistance) with a double top drop‚Ä¶. But I also see a case for push back up to 4178/4198 supplies first before we eventually push back down to 4085 demand and eventually 4040/4055 supply. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s932s7elwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=100d27ecbe027e0ba5d4d27823ae07db83f1cf69\n\nMuch of the same here we came down here and double bottomed nicely off 4085. In doing so we retook the daily 8/ 20ema and retook critical level of 4095. \n\nWith the current down trend broken we should expect this 4085 to 4178 range to be our new range until fomc or something else breaks that trend. As of right now the closer we get to 4178 the more bearish we should find ourselves. \n\nI do believe we will continue this run up tomorrow but I believe we are just being presented and even better short opportunity for summer time.\n\nFutures Daily Level  \n Supply- 4158 -> 4178  \n Demand- 4085  \n Support- 4138 -> 4110 -> 4095  \n Resistance- 4158 -> 4178\n\n**VIX1D**\n\nThe VIX1D actually gets its own section today because it was so intriguing to me as while we only have now 4 total days of data‚Ä¶ todays the first day that didn‚Äôt make sense to me. \n\nThe VIX1D, or the 1-Day Volatility Index, measures expected volatility in the S&P 500 Index for the current trading day.Taking an aggregated measurement of weighted prices across one- and zero-day P.M. settled SPX option expirations, the VIX1D calculates its value of expected volatility, according to the Cboe‚Äôs press release. Simply put, the VIX1D reflects the midpoint values of weekly SPX put and call prices for today and the next day in real-time. \n\nSo that‚Äôs the definition of apparently what the VIX1D measures.. now lets look at the VIX1D today‚Ä¶ \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kda0aewlwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2560f15ec08942660639077b7672535a6ade3383\n\nThis is VIX1D on a 5min chart with HA candles on the left and standard candles on the right‚Ä¶ what does this price action show all day? Well it showed that the VIX1D had a MASSIVE drop over night (at open‚Ä¶ remember vix1d closes at 415pm and opens at 930am which I still think it should be the same hours as the regular VIX). After the massive gap down what did it to? It rose all day long and aggressively rose all day long.\n\nNow why is that odd? Well lets think about this the same way we think about the regular VIX‚Ä¶ if we watched the VIX gap down about 30% at open only to close up 11.29% by the EOD what would you expect the price of SPY to do? You would 100% expect it to have a massive drop. And if it didn‚Äôt what would you expect? Well you would expect that there is a massive imbalance somewhere and that something isn‚Äôt correlating correctly‚Ä¶\n\nSo I see two ways this fixes itself‚Ä¶ we either 1. Have a massive melt down on SPY tomorrow to catch up to VIX1d or 2. We have a massive correction to the downside on VIX1D which then causes an even bigger rally on SPY tomorrow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67049ibmwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4a3950a3ec6fa0ee884fbd2ab1915719e9a259c\n\nCurrently I am in the process of tracking VIX1D and finding a correlation‚Ä¶ I am not using Mondays data as its not helpful for me and my analysis so I only have 2 days of data‚Ä¶ so far what I have seen is that IF the 4pm to 415pm move on VIX1D is down (so the 415pm close is lower than 4pm opening on candle) SPY will open green the next day (no correlation on how green yet). I also see a correlation that IF the VIX1D closes HIGHER the day before then the next day SPY CLOSES red‚Ä¶ IF the VIX1D closes LOWER than the day before then the next day SPY CLOSES Green‚Ä¶ \n\nSo if we look at this trend and data so far‚Ä¶ we should see a green open on SPY followed by a red close‚Ä¶ now of course two days of data is hardly anything to take a trade off but I continue to track this and plan to track this for the foreseeable future and analyze IF we can make a predictive guess‚Ä¶\n\nBut I share this data now because if that‚Äôs the case and data holds true we are actually setting up for a massive red day tomorrow with how aggressive the VIX1D rallied. \n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ecgugpmwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c6aebaaa81bc69bd1df5fc5f55b593a90acb124\n\nNow this is where I continue to be a little dumbfounded‚Ä¶ I see zero basis for why the VIX would be down 9.66% today based on the GDP data and the change in the EOY fed funds rate expectations‚Ä¶ We should have seen a continuation on the VIX to the upside‚Ä¶ however, that‚Äôs not what we got and we now find ourselves back in this red channel from 15.05 to 17.1. \n\nThis also brings us back under the daily 8ema/ 20ema. \n\nNow the question and the data I will be taking from today is does the VIX outweigh price action on SPY compared to VIX1D‚Ä¶ as in does a massive red day on VIX mean more than a massive green day on VIX1D. \n\nI also can not for the life of me understand while the VIX would drop 9.66% (meaning there is now less 28dte+ long term puts than yesterday) when a recession is pretty much imminent and the actual chances of a fed pause grow further and further away. There is a severe imbalance here. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0k1e04nwhwa1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=fafb37fbee265099a5bcdaf525096acdf00def15\n\nToday was an absolutely frustrating day‚Ä¶ took a small loss on a meta put which im not even upset about‚Ä¶ \n\nBut intraday trading today was absolutely frustrating and at times senseless‚Ä¶ It felt like almost all day we were set up for clear cut bearish movements. However, what we found was pushes to the upside just continued‚Ä¶. The hardest part about today was that I recognized we were in extreme bull momentum for most of the day and I even tried a few times to get in on calls (actually loss on a few or took profits too early) however the technical never set up for an entry‚Ä¶ and by time it actually set up for a call entry it had already moved.\n\nToday was a lesson in a few things‚Ä¶ 1. NEVER and I mean NEVER fight extreme momentum no matter how good a play works (I struggle with this ever day like this)‚Ä¶. 2. We do not need to trade every single day‚Ä¶ recognize the days that are advantageous to your strategy and capitalize on those‚Ä¶ sit out the rest‚Ä¶ 3. There will be days that are the exception to the rule‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt mean we change our rules to fit that day‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the exception not the rule. \n\nI am still thankfully sitting at my weekly profit goal overall right now but today took a huge chunk out of my weekly profits. Today was a frustrating day and one that you look back and say well obviously it was easy‚Ä¶ just buy a call at hold it all day‚Ä¶ well sure everything is easy when you look back‚Ä¶ but for anyone who uses any sort of technical analysis or price action reading or anything outside of FOMO‚Ä¶. Today was anything but easy. \n\nRemember‚Ä¶ tomorrows a new day and we have 252 trading days a year‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt have to trade every day‚Ä¶ also have a set amount every day that if you lose $xxx then you stop for the day and come back the next day‚Ä¶ one of the worst thing someone can do is continue to trade on a day that‚Äôs not made for their strategy and eat way and weeks or months of profit.", "id": "1317xu1", "created_utc": 1682631108.0, "score": 92, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "I‚Äôm quite surprised by the +10% to -2% (so far) move AH on Amazon.

(Schwab also sucks balls on option order execution).

Wouldn't companies complain about their stock price being manipulated by corrupt analysts. Like for instance if the estimate was for intel to have earnings of -$0.03 but they announce -0.04, so they now plummet and there everyone who gets paid in stock options is poorer and at higher risk of losing their job. This is an interesting thought experiment you're making me have right now on the importance of beating in comparison to actually improving the financials. Like if analysts keep over estimating Apple's earnings and revenue, would AAPL keep going down even if they were actually improving their Earnings and revenue by a good amount? If there are actually corrupt analysts they would probably not make it so obvious, and balance out the overestimates and the underestimates. Either way comparing Intel's revenue and earnings from last year definitely looks bad, but comparing it with last quarter it is... still decreasing. Intel's Q4 2022 EPS was +0.10, though it missed by 0.10. Same with revenue, it was actually higher at 14B but it missed by .5B. This caused a drop which recovered briefly before it plunged down to $25 at its bottom. In Q3 2022 It beat by 0.26 for an EPS of 0.59, and barely beat on revenue at 15B. This caused a brief rally before again correcting. Still, analysts already knew it was decreasing and still for whatever reason have a price target for intel at round 29 despite its decreasing earnings and revenue. I cant seem to be able to find data for price targets but they were probably around $28. I mean I found the attached picture but idk how to read it its confusing. And now the price is $29, pretty much the same price as in January and October. TLDR : Point I think im trying to make, idk at this point anymore, is that analysts already knew that earnings and revenue was going to decrease, intel probably told them in the last two conference calls in the their 10-Qs/10-K, so for that reason the stock isn't going to go any lower once they announce that they have earnings way worse than last year and that they're unprofitable for the first time in forever, since everyone already knew that. As for corrupt analysts, yeah I wouldn't be too surprised but estimates are also aggregates of many different analysts' forecasts, so that would require some serious collusion, and the more people that know about that kind of thing the more likely the cat is to get out of the bag, which would get a lot of people jailed lol.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h4m50fsmrlwa1.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=1754dc9dc1fa52662ed60fe01ad4a684de0116f2", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Do you understand them?
