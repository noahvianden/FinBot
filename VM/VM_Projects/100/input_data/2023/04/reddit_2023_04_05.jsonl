You‚Äôll save yourself a lot of grief and a lot of money if you do. With few exceptions, an extremely high p/e ratio is a handicap to a stock, in the same way that extra weight in the saddle is a handicap to a racehorse.*\r  \n\r  \n*A company with a high p/e must have incredible earnings growth to justify the high price that‚Äôs been put on the stock. In 1972, McDonald‚Äôs was the same great company it had always been, but the stock was bid up to $75 a share, which gave it a p/e of 50. There was no way that McDonald‚Äôs could live up to those expectations, and the stock price fell from $75 to $25, sending the p/e back to a more realistic 13. There wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with McDonald‚Äôs. It was simply overpriced at $75 in 1972.*\r  \n\r  \n*And if McDonald‚Äôs was overpriced, look at what happened to Ross Perot‚Äôs company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), a hot stock in the late 1960s. I couldn‚Äôt believe it when I saw a brokerage report on the company. This company had a p/e of 500! It would take five centuries to make back your investment in EDS if the earnings stayed constant. Not only that, but the analyst who wrote the report was suggesting that the p/e was conservative, because EDS ought to have a p/e of 1,000.*\r  \n\r  \n*If you had invested in a company with a p/e of 1,000 when King Arthur roamed England, and the earnings stayed constant, you‚Äôd just be breaking even today.*\r  \n\r  \n*I wish I had saved this report and had it framed for my office wall, to put alongside one that was sent to me from another brokerage firm that read: ‚ÄúDue to the recent bankruptcy, we‚Äôre removing this stock from our buy list.‚Äù In the years that followed, EDS the company performed very well. The earnings and sales grew dramatically, and everything it did was a whopping success. EDS the stock is another story. The price declined from $40 to $3 in 1974, not because there was anything amiss at headquarters, but because the stock was the most overpriced of any I‚Äôve ever seen before or since.*\r  \n\r  \n*You often hear about companies whose future performance is ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù in the stock price. If that‚Äôs the case, then EDS investors were discounting the Hereafter. More on EDS later.*\r  \n\r  \n*When Avon Products sold for $140 a share, it had an extremely high p/e ratio of 64‚Äîthough nowhere near as extreme as EDS‚Äôs. The important thing here is that Avon was a huge company. It‚Äôs a miracle for even a small company to expand enough to justify a p/e of 64, but for a company the size of Avon, which already had over a billion in sales, it would have had to sell megabillions worth of cosmetics and lotions. In fact, somebody calculated that for Avon to justify a 64 p/e it would have to earn more than the steel industry, the oil industry, and the State of California combined. That was the best-case scenario. But how many lotions and bottles of cologne can you sell? As it was, Avon‚Äôs earnings didn‚Äôt grow at all. They declined, and the stock price promptly plummeted to $18‚Öù in 1974.*\r  \n\r  \n*The same thing happened at Polaroid. This was another solid company, with 32 years of prosperity behind it, but it lost 89 percent of its value in 18 months.*\r  \n\r  \n*The stock sold for $143 in 1973 and dropped to $14‚Öõ in 1974, only to bounce up to $60 in 1978 and then stumble once again, back to $19 in 1981. At the market high in 1973, Polaroid‚Äôs p/e was 50. It got that high because investors expected an incredible growth spurt from the new SX-70 camera, but the camera and the film were overpriced, there were operating problems, and people lost interest in it.*\r  \n\r  \n*Again, the expectations were so unrealistic that even if the SX-70 had succeeded, Polaroid would probably have had to sell four of them to every family in America to earn enough money to justify the high p/e. The camera as a rousing success wouldn‚Äôt have done much for the stock. As it was, the camera was only a moderate success, so it was bad news all around.*", "score": 115, "replies": [{"body": "What is this from?", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "his book \"One Up on Wall Street\"", "score": 29, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "P/E is a noob trap, Tesla had 1000 P/E with a lower marketcap and now it has 50.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "That is not even remotely comparable.

Here's some bullet points of why:\r  \n\r  \n\r\r  \nCovid boost fading - The covid boost brought massive requirements for data centres, crypto mining and gaming. This allowed NVDA to maintain high margins and sell higher amounts of processors. Their customers now have an oversupply of processors, these sales will fall and the margins with them.\r  \n\r  \nAI boost is coming - This might be enough to save them for this quarter but all of the big tech names are creating their own chips which leaves little space for NVDA to increase their market. Other major players were already creating models so just because consumers are seeing AI in the news won't change their purchasing much.\r  \n\r  \nHigh Valuation - We all know that the valuation is high but how are they going to quadruple their revenue? I would agree to this if they can make their Saas successful but they are competing against this all the big cloud service providers but they have no previous experience of Saas so for me this feels like a long shot.\r  \n\r  \nInsider Selling - There's been significant insider selling over the last couple of years.

If he says 'buy the dip' in 2025 at $500 and then dumps billions then I will consider selling $450 calls to buy $550 puts 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, or 12 months out.  Or sell $450 calls to buy multiple $450 puts.  The expected pattern is that the stock has a small shock drop, then attempts to rally back up, but then fades 10-20% over the next few weeks.  If it doesn't stick to that script (maybe a whale would be buying at that point to support the price) then I will rotate out (of those options, not the shares I'm hedging)\n\n(edit: doing this at $300 -- selling $280CCs to buy 320 puts saved my ass last fall.

{"title": "Debunking Kerrisdale Capital's Bearish Take on C3.ai", "selftext": "**Update:**\n\nC3 responded to Kerrisdale's allegations and published a [statement](https://ir.c3.ai/static-files/a4394b09-6a6d-40be-b0f2-4cfbbc89c176) on their website.\n\nAnd here is an [interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2023-04-05/fedex-aims-to-cut-4-billion-podcast) with the CEO (starts at around minute 10).\n\nAccording to their statement, they follow the US GAAP standard ASC 606 for revenue recognition, which states that revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied, regardless of billing.\n\n\\-\n\n**Original Post:**\n\nHi all, I'm new here but basically spent all night looking into the [C3.ai](https://C3.ai) and [Kerrisdale.](https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/)\n\nI'm long on C3 - so I'm as biased as Kerrisdale here, but apparently, that doesn't keep people from taking their word for granted, either. I have a degree in Finance, worked at a big-four accounting firm, in the financial industry (upper management), and am now a business owner (that was too lazy to create a new account for posting this - that's why you'll find me posting all kinds of UE5 stuff, otherwise. My dirty hobby...)\n\nBut I'm a hopelessly logical investor, meaning I couldn't figure out why Kerrisdale's letter to Deloitte yesterday moved the markets at all. So I needed to understand the whole situation better and digged deeper.\n\nI went through C3's financials and Kerrisdale's report and looked at their letter to the Auditor, and here are my two cents on their March 6th report and their letter to Deloitte. Apologies for the lengthy post, but it's a complex topic.\n\nIt is worth questioning whether Kerrisdale's attempt to undermine C3 serves to manipulate market perceptions, particularly when considering the firm's history of short-selling and ongoing [legal scrutiny.](https://www.thestreet.com/markets/regulation/doj-sec-probe-dozens-of-firms-in-short-selling-sting)\n\nLet's start by shortly going over Kerrisdale's report from March 6th.\n\nKerrisdale's report conveniently overlooks C3's unique value proposition and casts doubt on the company's competitive advantage. However, this dismissal seems disingenuous, given the distinct position C3 occupies in the AI software market.\n\nContrary to the report's implications, C3's industry-specific AI solutions set it apart from the likes of IBM, Google, and Amazon. The company's focus on sectors such as energy, manufacturing, and financial services demonstrates its commitment to providing tailored solutions that address the unique challenges faced by these industries.\n\nThe report also paints a bleak picture of C3's growth rates, suggesting that they are unsustainable. However, the data and industry trends tell a different story.\n\nAI adoption is in its early stages across a variety of industries, with tremendous potential for growth. The ongoing digitization of industries and the increasing demand for AI-driven solutions are good for C3's prospects.\n\nC3's ability to secure long-term contracts with major clients demonstrates the trust and satisfaction customers have in its products and services. This contradicts Kerrisdale's pessimistic outlook and raises suspicions about the firm's motives. They basically take one of C3's strengths (their ability to build long-term partnerships and client relations) and give it a negative spin.\n\nKerrisdale's report attempts to pigeonhole C3 as a company reliant on the energy sector, potentially to create uncertainty and fear in the market. But this claim conveniently omits the company's broader diversification strategy.\n\nC3 has made significant strides in expanding into healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services, proving its ability to penetrate new markets and adapt to different industry needs. This diversification not only mitigates the risks associated with dependence on a single sector but also showcases C3's resilience and growth potential.\n\nThe report also casts doubt on C3's future competitiveness by highlighting declining R&D spending. This interpretation, however, seems deliberately misleading when considering the broader context of the company's strategy and expertise.\n\nStreamlining R&D spending could be a strategic move by C3 to optimize resources and concentrate on the most promising projects. It is important to recognize that R&D spending is not always directly proportional to innovation or product development success.\n\nMoreover, C3's existing technological expertise and intellectual property provide a strong foundation for future growth. The report's attempt to misrepresent the company's R&D spending is... questionable.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that C3's unique competitive advantage, growth potential, diversification strategy, and technological expertise paint a more optimistic outlook for the company's future prospects than Kerrisdale's report suggests. As AI continues to transform industries, C3's targeted offerings are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities, in my opinion. Of note to me is their [ESG product](https://c3.ai/products/c3-ai-esg/) \\- ESG will be a really, really big thing in the near future, especially here in the EU, in the near future.\n\nMy opinion: investors and market participants should be mindful of the potential for market manipulation and misinformation, especially when considering reports from firms with questionable motives and legal standing.\n\nLet's finally move on to what caused yesterday's market movements. Kerrisdale's letter to the auditor, Deloitte. Keep in mind that this is just my take on it. But I think that my opinion is not entirely unqualified.\n\n**TL;DR: Deloitte is the biggest accounting firm in the US, and it basically comes down to this: you either trust a short-seller publishing an open letter going hand-in-hand with a well-timed media campaign at a conspicuously opportune moment (C3 was about to really take off and obliterate their short position), or you trust that C3's financials, on which Deloitte signed off on, are correct. Your call.**\n\nSlightly longer version:\n\nKerrisdale Capital sent a letter to C3's auditor, raising concerns about the company's accounting and disclosure practices. The letter questions the company's revenue recognition methods, particularly for long-term contracts, and the impact on financial results.\n\nC3 has consistently provided transparent financial results, as evidenced by their fiscal Q1, Q2, and Q3 2023 reports. The company has experienced steady revenue growth and diversified its client base, showcasing a strong business model.\n\nC3's financial reports adhere to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), ensuring that revenue recognition and other financial practices are in line with industry standards.\n\n**As per US GAAP guidelines, companies recognize revenue when the performance obligations under a contract are satisfied.** C3's long-term contracts are structured to deliver AI software solutions and services over time, and the company recognizes revenue accordingly.\n\nIt is essential to emphasize that C3's revenue recognition practices are compliant with the accounting standards and have been consistently applied across all financial reporting periods.\n\nIn their own March 6th report (page 13), Kerrisdale calls out C3 for their long product cycle (6-18 months). **Considering C3 is a rapidly growing company that closed bookings of about $650 million in Q3 FY 23, it's hardly surprising that \"the company‚Äôs accounts receivable have ballooned\", according to their letter to the auditor.**\n\nWith C3.ai's strong bookings performance in Q3, it is reasonable to expect a corresponding increase in unbilled receivables. This growth in receivables is a natural consequence of the company's expanding business and long-term contracts, reflecting the ongoing demand for its AI solutions.\n\nOn page 13 of their report, Kerrisdale acknowledges that C3 has a long product cycle, ranging from 6 to 18 months. This admission, coupled with the growth in unbilled receivables, suggests that Kerrisdale's claims are inconsistent and contradictory.\n\n**The long product cycle means that C3's revenue recognition is spread across multiple reporting periods, which naturally leads to a growth in unbilled receivables.** This growth aligns with US GAAP guidelines.\n\nThe contradictory nature of Kerrisdale's claims raises questions about their understanding of US GAAP or their willingness to misrepresent financial information intentionally. It is essential to consider the possibility of malicious intent, particularly in light of the firm's ongoing legal scrutiny and history of short-selling.\n\nThe US Department of Justice and the SEC are currently investigating dozens of firms, including Kerrisdale Capital, for potential market manipulation through short-selling schemes. I found relatively little information on this, but little or unsubstantiated information apparently suffices. I quoted one of several articles earlier in this post.\n\nGiven this backdrop, Kerrisdale's claims regarding C3's accounting and disclosure practices might be an attempt to manipulate market sentiment and cast doubt on the company's financial integrity.\n\nIn light of the transparent financial results provided by C3 and the company's adherence to US GAAP guidelines, Kerrisdale's claims regarding accounting and disclosure issues appear to be unfounded.\n\n**In conclusion, C3.ai's growth in unbilled receivables is a plausible outcome of its strong Q3 bookings performance and long product cycle.** Kerrisdale's contradictory claims and potential misunderstanding or manipulation of US GAAP guidelines warrant skepticism and caution, IMO.\n\nI expect Deloitte to back up C3 in their FY 23 audit opinion, voiding Kerrisdale's claims. I think the whole thing is a well-executed publicity stunt by a short-seller that was facing serious trouble from the stock being about to take off. I would have done it the same way. Even including the SEC, which is/was investigating Kerrisdale, in their letter is a bold move, but implying regulatory action/fraud, is exactly what Kerrisdale needed to \"cover their ass\" here and get the much-needed market reaction. Hats off to them, textbook execution.\n\nSo that's it. Thanks for reading, if you even made it this far.

They make stuff for any old generic company to (hopefully) better view and understand their own data.

I don't think the stock popping off on an AI bubble is particularly warranted, but most of the others doing so don't have any more merit to them either...

I'm not saying all data would be complex enough for 14, few cases would be, but 5... off the top of my head I think 5 is the default value so I wonder how much they explored.

These changes can impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition, and you need to take them into account when analyzing a company's financial performance.\n\nConcerns about revenue quality related to a growing receivables balance are valid, especially if it's due to changes in the pricing model.

Moving from a subscription to a usage pricing model does concern me; especially as the accounts receivable balances increase significantly. It suggests to me that customers aren't using the products enough and that this AI company is doing something equivalent to digital channel stuffing. \n\nA subscription model is less risky from a revenue quality standpoint because regardless how much the client eats, you still get your money. However, there is always the risk of overeating by some customers in a subscription model; negatively impacting margins. Additionally the risks of an increasing receivables balance right now is that financing costs are increasing because small banks like SVIB went under and bigger banks provide less favorable financing terms. Which at the very least can potentially impact margins negatively as financing costs rise and, at worst, cause a company to go bankrupt if they cannot deficit finance their operations on their journey to profitably.\n\nMy suggestion would be to do more research and reading and really be able to scrutinize this company and the questions posed by the short seller more deeply.
