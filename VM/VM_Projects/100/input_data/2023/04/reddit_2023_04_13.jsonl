{"title": "Why Tesla is losing its EV dominance ?", "selftext": " \n\nTesla ($TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle.\n\nWhile Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year’s New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins. \n\n## Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack\n\n“Tesla who,” Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023.\n\nThe impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge.\n\nGap closed.\n\n“The IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can’t do better,” Parker crowed.\n\nAnd it’s that type of Tesla mentality that’s likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit.\n\nOlder automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.\n\nThese will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado.\n\n## What's next for Tesla\n\nTesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive. \n\nS&P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025.\n\nS&P Global Mobility’s Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that \"competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‘keep declining' as a result.\n\nThe inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question.\n\nGeneral Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant’s EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year.\n\nThat may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla’s record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground. \n\nTesla’s U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023. Within that same time frame, General Motors' EV market share grew from 0.1% to 9.9%, and Ford’s foothold grew to 8.4%.\n\nThe pressure on Tesla is one of the factors forcing the carmaker to slash prices *again*. Tesla marked down its vehicles for the fifth time this year, its latest effort to boost demand and regain lost market share.\n\n\"In this EV arms race Tesla needs to defend their turf and customer base with price cuts,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. \"Everyone is trying to catch up. Tesla cutting prices were the near-term pain for long-term gain strategic poker move.\"\n\nRBC analyst Tom Narayan also thinks lower prices could help Tesla's demand issue, telling Yahoo Finance Live that lower prices are a \"great way to really steal market share.\"\n\nDespite some upbeat outlooks from Wall Street on price cuts and the fact Tesla's stock has been a favorite among investors since the start of the year, shares are still off more than 40% in the past 12 months. That's a much starker decline than competitors Ford and General Motors, with respective one-year drops of 14% and 10%.\n\nThe relative underperformance of Tesla's stock proves some investors are looking at its recent price cuts and quarterly delivery miss as a sign of trouble ahead for the electric vehicle maker.

The simple fact that Stellantis and VW's largest market is in Europe and Tesla is #2 in EV sales is problematic for European automakers. Your comment with the links didn't tell the full story so I simply provided a better source.\n2. Which automakers are profitable selling pure EV's? Go down the list. You'll find that outside of Tesla, possibly the only other automaker profitable selling EV's is BYD and that's only when you consider the subsidies they receive from China. Without those subsidies, they are likely unprofitable but it's difficult to really say because BYD doesn't report PHEV and BEV numbers separately. Every other automaker encounters significant losses selling EV's and there is a huge transition cost that is taking place with for example, Ford estimating that they will lose $5 billion in 2022/2023 selling EV's. I mean, you mentioned Stellantis. Their CEO has publicly came out and said EV's are too expensive for them to make. They are unprofitable selling EV's. VW is unprofitable selling EV's. GM is unprofitable selling EV's. Now, consider that Tesla is not only profitable selling EV's, they have the highest margins in the auto industry for all major sales vehicles. Think about that for a second: Other automakers are losing massive amounts of money selling EV's while Tesla is making the highest margins in the auto industry selling EV's. When you consider that the future of the auto market is 100% heading towards EV's, the math becomes quite clear.\n3. BYD only sells vehicles primarily in China and some Asian countries. Tesla not selling as many vehicles as BYD in China isn't the end-all, be-all. They just have to have a sizable enough market. How many foreign automakers do you think can enter a country and completely dominate that market? It doesn't happen in the largest countries. \n4. \"But Tesla is worth more than all the automakers combined.\" Well, why do you think that is? Because traditional automakers have had declined growth. Take for example, Ford. 2004 revenue: $177 billion, 2022 revenue: $158 billion. You investing your hard-earned money into a company that has declined revenue from nearly two decades ago? Ford's stock price 2004: $14.50, Ford's stock price currently: $12.50. I'll ask again, are you investing in this if you're looking to make money? Traditionally, auto companies haven't been good investments. Hence, why people don't invest in them which results in a lower market cap. Tesla, and to a lesser degree, some other EV companies are exceptions. Why? Because Tesla is experiencing rapid growth year over year while selling a new product in the auto industry. Some other EV companies, such as LUCID/Rivian are complete crap but because investors are looking for alternatives to legacy OEM's which don't perform well in the market, they are looking for the next 'Tesla' in the market.\n5. FYI, Tesla isn't just a car business. Which automaker do you know has the largest EV charging business in the world? Which automaker do you know is directly investing into robotics? Which automaker do you know has as much knowledge in self-driving capabilities as Tesla? Which automaker do you know is building energy storage factories? Which automaker do you know is actively building their parts in-house? Which automaker do you know develops their own software?[https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/09/tesla-to-open-a-new-megafactory-in-shanghai-china-company-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/09/tesla-to-open-a-new-megafactory-in-shanghai-china-company-says.html)\n\nIn due time, all of this will be even more evident. Remember, Tesla in 2018 was on the verge of bankruptcy. Tesla in 2022 just had the best selling passenger vehicle in terms of revenue (Model Y) and in 2023, the Model Y is projected to be the best selling passenger vehicle by unit sales.

Given that Stellantis had record income and that their EVs already make a sizeable part of their sales, they are profitable. \n\nThe problem you have, is that the introduction of new models also forces Tesla's margins down. We are already seeing heavy continuis price cuts from Tesla. You have to ask yourself why the margins where so high. And the answer is simple. They sold cars for very high prices being the only game in town. That ends now. \n\n>Tesla not selling as many vehicles as BYD in China isn't the end-all, be-all. They just have to have a sizable enough market. How many foreign automakers do you think can enter a country and completely dominate that market?

Again, if you have a market cap of most your competitors combined and lose market share, that is not a good sign. \n\n>Because traditional automakers have had declined growth. Take for example, Ford. 2004 revenue: $177 billion, 2022 revenue: $158 billion\n\nToyota grew nicely, VW as well,  BYD grew insane. \n\n>Traditionally, auto companies haven't been good investments.

Because Tesla is experiencing rapid growth year over year while selling a new product in the auto industry.\n\nCar companies have been bad investments due to the cyclicality of the industry. Tesla does not change that. It might experience some nice growth, but given the recent price cuts , my prediction is that in Q2 they will shrink. \n\n> Which automaker do you know has the largest EV charging business in the world?\n\nIrrelevant as that is a very low margin business. Outside the US, chargers are normed so you can charge with every car. Superchargers will be open to others in the US soon as well. \n\n>Which automaker do you know is directly investing into robotics?\n\nIf you mean the prototype that was able to do less than a Honda one from 2000s sure, but I'll bite. How about Hyundai who owns Boston Dynamics, the leader in robotics?\n\n>Which automaker do you know has as much knowledge in self-driving capabilities as Tesla? \n\nHow about Mercedes that actually offers L3 and is the responsible one? Musk pumps every feature even if it 5 year + out. He would no doubt implemented this if he had the option. Or Cruise from GM that is completely self driving. Now you probably come with the argument that it is only for certain parts. Musk is known to pump, if he could do it they would.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Which automaker do you know is building energy storage factories?\n\nAgain mostly low margin business. But lets take CATL, who is the biggest battery and energy storage company in the world. \n\n> Which automaker do you know is actively building their parts in-house?\n\nEvery business decision has positives and negatives. Building parts stricly in house is great, when you are in a growth cycle - but it quickly turns against you when you are in a stagnating cycle. There is a reason why car makers are working together with partners. \n\n>Which automaker do you know develops their own software?\n\nMost of them, and I wish they would stop as Android Auto and Apple CarPlay is much better.\n\n>Name me an auto company doing anything remotely close to what Tesla is capable of doing.\n\nBut that is all already baked into the valuation. Tesla has 582b market cap. Lets take Toyota the biggest car company in the world +. BYD as they are the leader in EVs in China + CATL the biggest energy company in the wordl + Hyundai who just sells 2m cars and owns Boston Dynamic. \n\nThat is 222b (Toyota)+97b (BYD) + 139b (CATL) + 34b (Hyundai)= 492b. \n\nSo unless Tesla can keep their margins of last year (which it cant as the price cuts will show) and the ASP (which it can't as the price cuts are showing) and it can sell 15m cars, become the biggest energy company in the world and the leading robotics company as well -  its overvalued. Given the high competition I doubt it,.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So much wrong with this.\n\n1. It's not problematic for Tesla. The valuation makes sense when you consider their PEG. The issue is you are still treating them as a car company when analysts and people who buy Tesla stock are not. Is there something you somehow magically know that they don't? Provide your case as to what Tesla is worth, then. Show me your numbers and data.\n2. These carbon credits weren't exclusive to Tesla. Tesla began making EV's when EV's were a huge unknown. Tesla took the risks, Tesla reaped the rewards. Other automakers could have done the same but they lacked innovation, expertise, corporate leadership that replaced innovators, and overall were making too much money from ICE vehicles to care. Stellantis is profitable selling EV's? Can you prove it? If they are profitable, why is their CEO constantly in the media complaining about EV's being too expensive?\n3. Average Tesla vehicle price... wait for it... for year 2022 is the same as it was in year 2019. The price cuts have to do with the fact that there isn't as much money going around in economies across the world because of inflation and increasing rates which have affected discretionary income. When there was more discretionary income, Tesla increased the prices of their vehicles. Now, the vehicles are pretty much the same price as they were when Tesla originally started selling them. Declining economy = drop vehicle prices. It's common sense, dude. Tesla isn't the only auto company dropping prices.\n4. Car companies have been bad investments because their business model is debt-leveraged and thus, inherently makes their business risky in an economic downturn. That and the fact that people don't replace their vehicles every year. You still can't explain the massive blunder in auto sales falling and revenues falling for automakers. That isn't 'cyclical.' That's because vehicles become more efficient. The auto industry is not an attractive investment segment, period.\n5. Energy storage is a lucrative business because of the IRA subsidy and because there is a growing demand of astronomical numbers for energy storage systems particularly in areas with renewable energy sources but an inability to store them into the grid. The margins were impacted by lithium prices in 2022 but lithium prices have become much cheaper. Tesla just began ramping up energy storage so it will become more evident in the upcoming years rather than now.\n6. Hyundai acquired them - they didn't start it. Huge difference in expertise. That's like saying Apple can acquire LUCID and all of a sudden, Apple is an expert on EV's. Either way, Boston Dynamics robots aren't purposed the way Tesla Optimus plans to use their robots. How many robots have Boston Dynamics sold since the inception of their company? There's your answer: They aren't focused on selling as much as they are just creating concepts. Tesla plans to use their Tesla Optimus as a daily form function at an affordable price. Boston Dynamics can't achieve that which is why they are simply creating niche robots for a specific purpose only, largely for commercial use.\n7. You have a lot to learn about self-driving capabilities. Geofencing makes it safer but it is extremely limited to certain areas. If that was Tesla's goal from the beginning, to be geofenced to certain areas, they would have accomplished that years ago. Tesla instead wants to have self-driving capabilities everywhere, or in most routes. I have FSD-beta. When I go on road trips in highways, I never touch my steering wheel. In some city streets, I can't rely on FSD but it depends on where. If you think Mercedes can achieve that, you don't know much about the system. GM Cruise is completely self-driving? Yeah, geofenced in a small radius. The vehicles aren't designed to go anywhere past that. \"Musk is known to pump.\" Don't take my word for it. There are YouTube channels where FSD-Beta is being used. Hundreds of hours of driving. If you'd like, when I'm going to my next road trip, I'll gladly dashcam my Tesla and show you how beautifully it works. Is it perfect? No. Are they the closest to actually achieving FSD capabilities on a wide scale? 100%. All these other self-driving companies are focused on geofenced areas which obviously is safer because you're riding the same route thousands of times. Why would anyone pay thousands of dollars for that? Hint: They don't even offer it unless you are paying six figures for their car.\n8. CATL isn't a car manufacturer. They are a battery manufacturer.\n9. Most of them don't, actually. Which is why when there was a chip shortage, many of them were clueless on how to repurpose their chips to enable a wider range of capabilities. Tesla repurposes their chips because they have a legitimate engineering team that works on this. \"Android Auto and Carplay is better.\" Yeah, it's better because again, these auto companies suck at software. Tesla's software is good enough to where Android Auto and Carplay actually makes it worse for a Tesla driver in terms of experience. Volkswagen tried to improve their software capabilities but gave up leading to what many believe was the reason Herbert Deiss was fired (too much emphasis on software that ultimately didn't pan out).\n10. Developing parts in-house leads to higher margins and quicker response/manufacturing processes. That's why Tesla's automanufacturing plants are far more efficient than other automanufacturing plants. Other auto companies don't do this because they are just assembly plants. Order parts, assemble, sell to dealerships. Tesla has more control of the total business.\n11. \"Baked into the valuation.\" According to who? You? Do you have numbers showing any of this? How much are you valuing their businesses? There is a lack of faith in Toyota because their # of vehicles sold continues to decrease, they sell low margin vehicles, and are slow in adapting to EV's. BYD is a strong business but they primarily only sell vehicles in China and some Asian countries. There are a lot of EV companies in China so the fact Tesla is #2 isn't a slight against Tesla in the way you think it is. Do you think Apple has #1 market share in China? No. How much is Apple worth again? Remind me. Thus, Tesla doesn't have to be #1 in China to be worth a high amount as a company. CATL, battery manufacturer. And they operate in the Chinese exchange, not USA. If you know China, you would know that their capital markets are very weak compared to the U.S. markets. That's why many Chinese companies issue ADR's to trade on the U.S. exchange. CATL would be worth more if they traded in a wider access exchange. Hyundai is a garbage business, dude. They make $850 net profit per vehicle sold. Their business is weak and not growing. IDK what you are really making comparisons about here. You have yet to find an auto company as involved in multiple segments as Tesla is. You're using incomparable companies (Boston Dynamics is not a direct competitor to Tesla Optimus and since its inception, has mostly been a conceptual based robot. The robot you saw jumping around? That's programmed for specifically that purpose. Tesla wants their robots to be more of an 'assistant' to you while also creating robots specifically for commercialized purposes), (self-driving capabilities being geofenced doesn't make them FSD. Again, if Tesla's goal was to self-drive in limited areas, they would have achieved L3 years ago. Their goal is to get you from point A to B from almost any destination). You're valuing them purely as an auto business (Tesla made $12 billion in net income last year compared to Toyota's $18 billion despite Toyota selling 6x as many vehicles in an environment where ICE vehicles are being phased out and if Toyota was only selling EV's, they would be unprofitable). No one in Wall Street, a credible analyst, or someone buying bunches of Tesla shares are valuing them as strictly an auto business. You say it is priced in, okay, that's fine.

If EVs weren't profitable, they wouldn't have such a good result. \n\n>Declining economy = drop vehicle prices. It's common sense, dude. Tesla isn't the only auto company dropping prices.\n\nThe price matter for Tesla, as they are priced like they would grow a huge amount. Last year they had high prices.

Tesla hasn't sold any either. You are literally disproving your own thesis. \n\n> If you think Mercedes can achieve that, you don't know much about the system. \n\nMercedes literally has it and beat Tesla to level 3.

The chip shortage was mainly because foundries did not want to produce the low margin car chips. These chips have been thoroughly tested and been approved in different weather, location etc. Car companies did not want to risk problems down the line with non-car approved chips. Tesla did. Yes legacy car still has catch-up to do in Software. But the point is, that despite this, Tesla is already getting outsold or has competitors catching up quickly in terms of sales numbers. \n\n>That's why Tesla's automanufacturing plants are far more efficient than other automanufacturing plants.

Do you have numbers showing any of this?\n\nTo get to the current valuation. Tesla earnings need to grow 30% for 5 years and then 20% for another 5 years. Given their historic growth that doesn't sound a lot, but cars don't scale. i.E If you start at 200k vehicles and have 1 factory, that can produce 500k cars - you don't need a new factor. But if you are at 1 million, you suddenly need a new factory every year. Scaling gets harder and harder. \n\nThere is also a limit to how many cars you can sell on the ASP that Tesla does. There is a limit. So either Tesla offers cheaper cars, that would erode margins or they stop growing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> How much are you valuing their businesses? \n\nI already showed you that Tesla is worth more than BYD, CATL, Toyota and Hyundai combined.
