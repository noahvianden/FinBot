I like that it doesn’t get looped in with these ultra high growth tech companies and I think that’s a plus. \n\nI just really like this stock and this company.

Moreover, most of the Endo in tamoxifen is converted to a useless molecule; Atossa has patented the pill form of the beneficial version such that it gets absorbed in much higher quantities. It’s essentially an upgrade of tamoxifen. \n\nThere’s also the study focused on reducing breast density for improved mammogram accuracy.

Anecdotal experience from investing in a different company provides no insight on ATOS (unless you prefer fallacious reasoning?). \n\nAlso, “Tamoxifen is well tolerated,” and “I doubt a metabolite will be more effective,” — they clearly haven’t done any research on the drugs in question... Tamoxifen requires hormone suppression (early menopause) which women generally prefer to avoid, and the amount of natural Endo our livers produce from Tamo is significantly lower than the pill form of Endo being trialed here; it’s like comparing a syringe to an IV bag. \n\nThey’ve had one late-stage patient who could not tolerate Tamoxifen try Endoxifen through FDA’s emergency channel, and that person has been since cancer free for three years. \n\nLastly, Endoxifen was recently selected for aggressive testing in the I-SPY trials, which are focused on bringing effective breast cancer medications to market as soon as possible. Here’s a quote from the I SPY founder:\n\n“Z)-endoxifen is one of the most active metabolites of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is known to be effective in treating and preventing ER+ breast cancer, but may be most effective in those patients who can adequately metabolize it, ”said Dr. Laura Esserman of the University of California San Francisco, founder and leader of the I-SPY TRIAL. “(Z)-endoxifen may overcome some of the shortcomings of tamoxifen, as it is already the active metabolite. Perhaps most exciting is that it may be effective in premenopausal women without the need for ovarian suppression. Ovarian suppression in premenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women are associated with both short-term and potential long-term side effects that diminish adherence.(Z)-endoxifen holds promise of being a more effective and tolerable alternative to targeting the estrogen receptor in women with early-stage breast cancer.”", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What a shit stock, good luck losing everything.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Lol clearly you don’t have much experience investing in biopharmas. \n\nI made quite the pretty penny on EXEL few years back; plan to do it again.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great, good luck.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes many bought in due to FatAspirations and feel burned, but has nothing to do with the product itself.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "AMC = 98% , other stocks = 1% , coins = 1%", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Semiconductor short", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "BBIO, ETC, and IVR", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "eeeeewww", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Diversify", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "TMO", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Surprise it took this long to find this one.\n\nAmazing company.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "CTXR. 80%", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wow", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "MPC and CROX", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "DVN, approx 13% at current value. $31 average entry price, will be looking to exit completely mid summer (should have last year, but still learning how to take profits).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Why are you looking to exit completely mid summer?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not super confident in the quality of remaining inventory in shale generally.

However, the Apple privacy changes only affected 3rd party data, so it really affected measurements for advertisers to track the # of customers that actually ended up converting or buying something due to an advertisement. I'm sure that 3rd party data also helped meta's ad targeting algorithms as well. But the thing is that overtime, businesses advertising on Meta have been able to circumvent this signal loss through different techniques, such as the conversions api. This tends to be more of a burden for the businesses though, because they have to build it into their website, but I think a lot of businesses have adopted it over time which had lessened the impact of Apple ATT changes. Of course, Meta still has access to the data of user behavior WITHIN their apps (hopefully this will continue to be the case in the EU, I am watching the legal situation rlly closely with GDPR) so their ad targeting algorithms still have plenty of data to work with.\n\nBut yes, the other tailwinds were definitely there, but I was not too concerned about it. There is nothing stopping Meta from making the content on Reels BETTER than TikTok. Sure they were later to the game, but they have all the computing resources necessary to train a model. TikTok will never kill Insta/FB because those platforms are inherently social, whereas TikTok is more of a video sharing platform (so I'd say it compete with YT more). You will always want to know what your friends, crushes, exes, are up to. I am not too sure what you mean by \"more and more FB based businesses taking route\". I don't think that is a valid assessment because if you're simply referring to business pages on FB/insta, then Meta doesn't really make money from that.

Problem is that it's very difficult to monetize these types of models, primarily because it is very difficult for one company to completely monopolize this technology. We've seen in the news how there have been many custom LLM springing up like Bloomberg GPT, and models like Alpaca, etc. that have cost <1k to train. Plus, LLMs are cool because it can serve as an alternative to search, but the problem is that (in my opinion) most of the money-making search queries are for people buying things. If you were buying like a chair, it's much more efficient to type \"chair\" in google than to wait for a LLM to generate you an entire response and serve you a couple of chair options. Legacy search is much better for this. Anyways, the point I'm trying to make here is that people have been too distracted by the latest AI developments, and often forget that AI has always been used and prioritized in these companies (especially META) for years. The \"AI\" is just invisible to everyone because no one really thinks of recommended content and search relevancy as AI. Meta is totally the one to benefit from AI because there is so much room to improve the relevancy of content. This is in contrast to Google where their main form of making money is selling ads based on keywords. Google search definitely uses AI though, but it's mainly used to understand new and complex queries from users. Although the relevancy of the search results can improve, this will not necessarily improve the relevancy of the advertisements, as the advertisements are based off of keywords already. How are you going to improve ad relevancy using AI if it's already based off of keywords?? You can't give an ad outside of what the user searched for, which is a serious limitation. I feel that Google is lacking room to grow and AI will not really benefit them in the longer run.
