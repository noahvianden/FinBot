I just think their team overall is moving in the right direction. \n\nI use them for everything and for the most part the Ecosystem is pretty flawless despite what some people will say. I actually really like their products. I also think they are executing on development of that ecosystem on all fronts not just the cloud part (like Amazon) and google is no where close to what msft is. \n\nAnd in this their customer base is massive which spreads the risk of any one LOB across many different areas - ooo consumer sales down? All good, azure/enterprise is up Etc etc. \n\nSpeaking of growth and acquisitions - I think Satya is doing a great job. The acquisition of GitHub was genius, open AI and Activision are deff notable and the Xander grab was very smart too as they build out their marketing and analytics wing. but it‚Äôs the acquisitions they are making for cloud products, cyber security, IoT and data management that prove my other point that their focus is on growing in these key areas which is huge. \n\nI like satyas reserved but aggressive approach. They grow but they don‚Äôt acquire a lot of fat doing so and what he‚Äôs been able to do since taking over is nothing short of legendary. I think he is one of the best current CEOs in the game and will go down in history as such. And because of his style he has built and equally impressive team around him which as we all know is almost more important than being a good ceo. \n\nLast but not least I like the stock because I‚Äôve been following it for a while now. I understand how it moves and where it‚Äôs levels are. I like that it pays dividends. I like that it‚Äôs a good balance of defensive but more than enough upside for me for long term growth. I think it handled this down turn really well and while it doesn‚Äôt move like Aapl or google it‚Äôs definitely a more measured safe bet for me. I like that it doesn‚Äôt get looped in with these ultra high growth tech companies and I think that‚Äôs a plus. \n\nI just really like this stock and this company. I could end up being dead wrong but for it to turn against me we would need like another Steve Ballmer era, some dark horse move out of google/Amazon or some major catastrophe for that happen and I think I pay enough attention to defend against that happening.\n\nThere‚Äôs deff more you could dig in to. Like I don‚Äôt even really touch on gaming/marketing/analytics/consumer etc - which I also think are being done well and gives me more reason to like it but I‚Äôm most interested in how they handle cloud computing/development/deployment/security and their ecosystem.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "To be clear my first comment was sincere.

Tamoxifen is known to be effective in treating and preventing ER+ breast cancer, but may be most effective in those patients who can adequately metabolize it, ‚Äùsaid Dr. Laura Esserman of the University of California San Francisco, founder and leader of the I-SPY TRIAL. ‚Äú(Z)-endoxifen may overcome some of the shortcomings of tamoxifen, as it is already the active metabolite. Perhaps most exciting is that it may be effective in premenopausal women without the need for ovarian suppression. Ovarian suppression in premenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women are associated with both short-term and potential long-term side effects that diminish adherence.(Z)-endoxifen holds promise of being a more effective and tolerable alternative to targeting the estrogen receptor in women with early-stage breast cancer.‚Äù", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What a shit stock, good luck losing everything.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Lol clearly you don‚Äôt have much experience investing in biopharmas. \n\nI made quite the pretty penny on EXEL few years back; plan to do it again.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great, good luck.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes many bought in due to FatAspirations and feel burned, but has nothing to do with the product itself.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "AMC = 98% , other stocks = 1% , coins = 1%", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Semiconductor short", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "BBIO, ETC, and IVR", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "eeeeewww", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Diversify", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "TMO", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Surprise it took this long to find this one.\n\nAmazing company.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "CTXR. 80%", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wow", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "MPC and CROX", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "DVN, approx 13% at current value. $31 average entry price, will be looking to exit completely mid summer (should have last year, but still learning how to take profits).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Why are you looking to exit completely mid summer?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not super confident in the quality of remaining inventory in shale generally.

However, the Apple privacy changes only affected 3rd party data, so it really affected measurements for advertisers to track the # of customers that actually ended up converting or buying something due to an advertisement. I'm sure that 3rd party data also helped meta's ad targeting algorithms as well. But the thing is that overtime, businesses advertising on Meta have been able to circumvent this signal loss through different techniques, such as the conversions api. This tends to be more of a burden for the businesses though, because they have to build it into their website, but I think a lot of businesses have adopted it over time which had lessened the impact of Apple ATT changes. Of course, Meta still has access to the data of user behavior WITHIN their apps (hopefully this will continue to be the case in the EU, I am watching the legal situation rlly closely with GDPR) so their ad targeting algorithms still have plenty of data to work with.\n\nBut yes, the other tailwinds were definitely there, but I was not too concerned about it. There is nothing stopping Meta from making the content on Reels BETTER than TikTok. Sure they were later to the game, but they have all the computing resources necessary to train a model. TikTok will never kill Insta/FB because those platforms are inherently social, whereas TikTok is more of a video sharing platform (so I'd say it compete with YT more). You will always want to know what your friends, crushes, exes, are up to. I am not too sure what you mean by \"more and more FB based businesses taking route\". I don't think that is a valid assessment because if you're simply referring to business pages on FB/insta, then Meta doesn't really make money from that.

Meta HAS BEEN, and will CONTINUE to benefit hugely in developing AI for recommending content/ads on FB/Insta. Recently you hear all of this buzz surrounding LLM and ChatGPT, which is cool and all. Problem is that it's very difficult to monetize these types of models, primarily because it is very difficult for one company to completely monopolize this technology. We've seen in the news how there have been many custom LLM springing up like Bloomberg GPT, and models like Alpaca, etc. that have cost <1k to train. Plus, LLMs are cool because it can serve as an alternative to search, but the problem is that (in my opinion) most of the money-making search queries are for people buying things. If you were buying like a chair, it's much more efficient to type \"chair\" in google than to wait for a LLM to generate you an entire response and serve you a couple of chair options. Legacy search is much better for this. Anyways, the point I'm trying to make here is that people have been too distracted by the latest AI developments, and often forget that AI has always been used and prioritized in these companies (especially META) for years. The \"AI\" is just invisible to everyone because no one really thinks of recommended content and search relevancy as AI. Meta is totally the one to benefit from AI because there is so much room to improve the relevancy of content. This is in contrast to Google where their main form of making money is selling ads based on keywords. Google search definitely uses AI though, but it's mainly used to understand new and complex queries from users. Although the relevancy of the search results can improve, this will not necessarily improve the relevancy of the advertisements, as the advertisements are based off of keywords already. How are you going to improve ad relevancy using AI if it's already based off of keywords?? You can't give an ad outside of what the user searched for, which is a serious limitation. I feel that Google is lacking room to grow and AI will not really benefit them in the longer run.
