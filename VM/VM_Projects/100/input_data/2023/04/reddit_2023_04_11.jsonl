While the ad was intended to promote diversity and inclusivity, it could actually backfire and lead to a decline in sales. Additionally, I've noticed a lot of TikToks and other social media posts suggesting that there hasn't been much inventory movement lately. If demand for Anheuser Busch's products is decreasing, this could lead to lower sales and a drop in stock price.\n\nSecondly, the company is carrying a significant amount of debt - over $100 billion to be exact. This makes the company highly leveraged and vulnerable to economic downturns. A rising interest rate environment or economic recession could make it difficult for the company to meet its debt obligations, which would negatively impact its stock price.\n\nThirdly, Anheuser Busch's current ratio is low - a rule of thumb is to have a ratio of 2 or higher, but Anheuser Busch's current ratio is currently only 0.66. This suggests that the company may be having trouble meeting its short-term obligations, which could be a red flag for investors.\n\nLastly, I've noticed that the puts for Anheuser Busch seem relatively cheap when compared to the stock's historical volatility. This could be an opportunity for traders to take advantage of the situation and potentially profit from a decline in stock price.\n\nOverall, I believe that Anheuser Busch's stock price may be headed for a decline, making it a prime candidate for purchasing puts. Of course, as with any investment, there are risks involved, and it's important to do your own research and make informed decisions.\n\nWhat do you all think?
