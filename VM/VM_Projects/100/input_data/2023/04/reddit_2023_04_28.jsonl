And possibly can see a severe recession in one of part of the economy while everything else is fine.\n\nI highly suspect Elon lives in rich person/Silicon Valley/investment world. The data he sees and the people he talks to basically all live in that world (see the all in pod). If the fed keeps raising rates, all those people and businesses that are built on leverage will completely fall apart (ergo severe recession). I think that‚Äôs why you see those people yell the loudest that we need rate cuts. These people aren‚Äôt impacted by inflation but more rate hikes.\n\nThe other side of the economy are the people that actually do work and contribute to productivity. These people don‚Äôt see a recession because there‚Äôs jobs available and if you‚Äôre a good performer you‚Äôre still getting raises (like I‚Äôve seen people get here). These people don‚Äôt get impacted by rates as much but are getting killed by inflation.\n\nThis is the problem that the fed is facing. They‚Äôre trying to get inflation under control to improve the latter situation without killing the former too much. Because if the former completely goes away then the latter dies too into a recessionary spiral/depression.\n\nIf they don‚Äôt get inflation under control now with 5-6% rates and a mild slowdown or recession, then it‚Äôs going to take 10%+ and a big recession to fix it later.
