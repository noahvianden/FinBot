It’s a cheerful, efficient building that bears the hopes and scars of the population it serves. The carefully curated murals and architectural flourishes give way to extensive water damage inflicted when a resident on an upper floor reportedly slept with the faucets running. Social workers walk purposefully through the halls, greeting residents, and well-loved dogs are being walked everywhere you turn.  \n>  \n>But what makes Tahanan notable isn’t its aesthetic.

There’s the requirement to get your power from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission rather than PG&E. (PG&E is no great shakes, but the S.F.P.U.C. is considered even harder to work with.) The Arts Commission does a separate review of your design. You need an additional review from the Mayor’s Office of Disability. That’s a good one to examine because, well, who could oppose that? But these projects are already in compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act, and the additional review takes time and comes at a cost. “They come in when you’re done,” Foster said. “And they’ll say, ‘That threshold is two centimeters off, and it is in all of your doors.’ And so that delays people moving in for another couple of months. And it might mean that you miss a financing deadline and have an adjuster on your tax credit fees that are another $2 million. So it just has a big ripple impact.”Tahanan is the first affordable housing project in San Francisco built using modular housing. All of the units above the ground floor were fabricated at a factory in Vallejo, Calif. “That definitely helped with meeting the time- and cost-saving goals,” Foster said. But some local unions were furious, even though the factory in Vallejo is unionized. That might have been enough to kill Tahanan in a normal planning process. For that reason, Foster’s group isn’t planning to use modular construction on its next affordable housing project. “It just was too big a political lift,” she said\n\nA lot of the red tape and what not is also why it's hard to build high speed rails and what not in the US.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Really curious what’s going to happen with KRE.

[Here is the comment I made in mid February](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/112uzdy/rstocks_daily_discussion_wednesday_feb_15_2023/j8po699/). \n\nThe summary:\n\n> In January [2023] the tech unemployment rate fell to 1.5% from 1.8% in December, according to CompTIA's analysis. \n\nThat same firm released their update following today's job numbers. It seems it went from 1.5% to 2.2% in February, and then stayed constant at 2.2% in March. I can't access their full report. But even despite that, job posting increased to 316K.\n\n> Tech industry employment, covering all workers employed by technology companies, experienced a **modest decline of an estimated 839 jobs last month**. Telecommunications accounted for the largest share of the decline at -3,100 positions, which was offset by gains in cloud infrastructure, tech services and software.            \n> \n> **Employer job postings for tech positions increased by 76,546 month-over-month, to a total for March of nearly 316,000. This represents the highest level of employer hiring activity as measured by job postings in seven months.**\n> \n> **Technology employment across all industry sectors increased by an estimated 197,000 positions** for the month, according to CompTIA’s analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics #JobsReport data. The **unemployment rate** for tech occupations held **steady at 2.2%**.\n\nSo yeah, there is no reason to doom over the tech sector's labor market.

Thanks largely to the strong job market, the number of American workers earning less than $15 has been cut nearly in half in the past three years, from 39 million pre-pandemic to 20.6 million at the end of 2022. It’s a rapid and long overdue shift in how American society values low-wage workers.\n\n> The data come from Ben Zipperer, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute who runs the tracker “How many low-wage workers are in the U.S.?” Before the pandemic, fast-food workers, home health aides, janitors and other low-wage workers saw modest pay increases largely due to 30 states raising their state minimum wages above the $7.25-an-hour federal requirement, Zipperer says. But circumstances changed dramatically during the pandemic. The swift economic rebound and the great reassessment of work triggered something almost no one anticipated: a tight labor market. Many low-wage workers, in particular, realized they could trade up to better jobs with higher pay and more flexibility.\n\nAs pointed out by [Arin Dube](https://twitter.com/arindube/status/1640129791595622409):\n\n> Importantly, the sharp drop in share of workers below $15 isn't merely an artifact of inflation.\nAdjusting for inflation, the share below $15 has fallen by ~1/3 since 2019.\nConsistent w/ strong real wage growth at the bottom and compression in our work: https://nber.org/papers/w31010", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "They can write whatever they want, groceries are more expensive than ever and the wage gains did not help with base expenses", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "People getting laid off is not a “fantastic” trend.

The point is that the tight labor market right now isn't necessarily because the economy is booming, but rather due to structural and demographic factors. Obviously it's a good sign that people who want to work can, but it would be wrong to use that as a data point for how strong the economy is in and of itself. \n\nI didn't read through the rest of your data carefully so not necessarily any issue there but this comment stuck out.\n\nEdit: Here's the Fed source. It's from 2020 but I think it's reasonable to extrapolate the trend then to now:\n\n\"In sum, the current ultra-low unemployment rate is not due to a particularly high job-finding rate but rather to unusually low rates of people moving into unemployment, which reflects the long-run downward trend.\"\n\nhttps://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2020/march/why-is-unemployment-currently-so-low/?amp=1", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your third link is pre-Covid, which is not really useful for today's market tbh given how much the labor market has changed since then...

In any case, none of this seems to really invalidate how strong conditions are for the working class relative to historical levels. \n\nYour first link claims we have a bunch of missing workers. Here was the [CBO forecast](https://i.imgur.com/bEsGSSB.png) in January 2020 of number of workers. We completely are back at forecasts despite having a horrible pandemic in the middle of it.\n\n[Another measure: payroll employment](https://i.imgur.com/R4jeO70.png).

My comment shows employment rates are high, people who want jobs get them (low unemployment), labor force participation rates quickly [recovering to old levels](https://i.imgur.com/vaEVa1o.png). \n\nFurther, they find that hours worked actually increased the most for the lowest income workers:\n\n> So employed Americans are working less, on average — but which ones? The reduction in work hours was more pronounced among men ages 25-55 with a bachelor’s degree. And high-earning men reduced their hours the most: for example, **the top 10% of male workers by earnings (making more than $140,000 per year) reduced their work hours by an hour-and-a-half a week, from 44.7 hours in 2019 to 43.2 hours per week in 2022. By contrast, the bottom 10% of male workers by earnings (making less than $22,000 per year) worked more hours, 23.4 hours per week in 2022, compared with 22.6 in 2019.** Those who worked long hours reduced their hours the most. The top 10% of male workers by work hours logged at least 50 hours per week in 2022. This is a lot of hours, but in 2019 the cutoff to be in the top 10% of male workers by hours worked was 55 hours a week.\n\nIt's the richer workers who are working less, and who I am less concerned about. We want to see low income workers at higher levels of employment, participating more in the economy, and working full time.\n \nMoreover, your link:\n\n>  In fact, other survey data showed that workers’ desired hours of work declined, providing direct evidence that the hours reduction was voluntary. \n> \n> What did workers do with the time freed up from work? The latest available figures from the American Time Use Survey provide a clue. It turns out **married men are the ones that reduced their work hours the most, and they spent more time socializing and relaxing**. \n\nIs this a bad thing also? Those who did reduce their hours did so voluntarily and to enjoy life.\n\nYour links takeaways:\n\n> I see two longer-term gains for workers. First, a **better work-life balance** will help workers improve their mental and physical health, which may allow them to be happier and possibly more productive, even, and to work into older ages if they so choose. Second, as men working long hours reduce their hours, women, who typically work fewer hours and do more non-market work due to societal norms, may choose career paths that used to demand long hours, **improving gender inequality** especially at the top end of the earnings distribution. \n\nSounds good to me!\n\n**TL;DR:** The second links says higher income/wealth Americans are choosing to work less hours and take leisure (Fine, they can afford it). This does not contradict my claims about lower class / working class Americans, who are working *more* hours, earning more at those jobs, and participating in the economy at historically high rates. Anybody who wants a job can get one.\n\n----\n\n**General Comments**\n\nIs it not incredible that disabled workers are able to be employed at decade highs in today's market?

Look at how high they are typically!\n\nIf you had to pick a time for labor markets in the last 20 years, would you really argue times were better for low/middle income Americans in 2016? 2019? [Ignoring things like gun violence/suicides/drug overdoses which we can't really just 'fix' with better monetary policy or fiscal spending; that's just an American society is f'ed in some ways problem] Real GDP per capita is like $78K vs 50-60 in the 2010s. That is nearly *double* that of France or Germany.\n\nLike look at how quick this recovery has been compared to post GFC, which was devastating.\n\n> It took around 12 years for prime-age (25-54yo) employment-to-population rate to recover after the recession following the financial crisis.\n\n> It took around 3 years after the recession following pandemic.\n\n\nWe now have far more generous federal policies since the early 2010s.

Your caveats are at least more useful than the other dude's \"You actually believe CPI\" or just \"No your data is just wrong.\"\n\nFull employment is incredibly good at spreading wealth/income among historically hard-hit demographics.\n\nWho is this economy bad for? People with wealth in the stock market, housing markets, etc. Banks and executives.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "To clarify, I'm not saying this labor market is *bad*, what I'm saying is that there are structural and demographic factors that help explain why it may be that way.  It's very different to say that everybody can get a job because \"the economy is firing on all cylinders\", vs. everybody can get a job because \"there are less workers\".\n\nMy inexpert opinion is that the economy does look pretty healthy right now, apart from the glaring debt issue.  So I wouldn't say that it's purely a supply of labor thing, but I would say that that helps, and that it's important to keep in mind.  Check out the US median age over time:\n\nhttps://www.bourbonfm.com/blog/us-median-age-population-1950\n\n\nWe're now over 38 if you search for current data, indicating that the aging trend has continued. \n\nTo clarify this is a global trend, not only US.  Not least of which in China, which I won't link but is getting old, too. And this trend is projected to continue:\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/672669/projected-global-median-age/ (expand data points to see historic data)\n\nAs for my source from 2020 about a \"long-term downward trend\", I think that due to demographic factors it's not unreasonable to assume that this has continued. Actually, take a look at unemployment data, it seems to have been trending down for awhile now and also seems to have continued that trend post-Covid:\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE\n\nFinally, I think you have to consider other factors like de-globalization and \"made in the USA\" or \"made at home\" trends, arising from Covid and geopolitical tensions making us realize that cheaper products from abroad aren't always better.  This is great for domestic workers.  I would also consider climate change and the prospect of war, which both mean that we can't afford to have workers sit idle and need to get them to work building solar panels (or whatever) and tanks (or whatever).\n\nAll of this is wonderful for labor, and I think it's only fair to admit that it's playing a part in the robust labor market right now.  That said, it comes with some drawbacks.  An older population means we have less workers and more dependents, and that means those that do work have to work harder to pay for pensions and healthcare for these people.  Secondly, along with the other factors I mentioned like de-globalization, a tight labor market thanks to demographics pushes wages and prices up, making 2% inflation somewhat unrealistic (this is not the end of the world but is something we will have to deal with, and are dealing with now).  Finally, the incentive to take on more and more debt to pay for these things, plus the reality that interest rates will probably be higher for longer, will compound the debt issue that I have mentioned many times before.\n\n**Tl;dr** - In sum, I never meant to say that the labor market is bad right now.  It actually looks very strong, as your data have shown. I'm not an economist or academic and I haven't done extensive research on it, but from what I've heard it's not unreasonable to attribute a great deal of this to demographic and other structural factors like de-globalization.  It's still a great time to be a worker, and there's clear benefits to the notion that if you want a job, you can get a job.  But like everything, this situation comes with tradeoffs which we will have to manage.\n\nPeople are dumb and will distort data to fit any narrative they want.  Sorry you had to deal with that, I know you go out of your way to be really thorough so that can be frustrating. I really do my best to be evidence-based, obviously we all have personal biases but I think what I've shared, at least, is not contrary to the data you've presented.\n\nAs a final note, I've shared this a lot but I think people \"feel\" that things are worse and unfair for some reason.  My 92 year old grandma is always talking about how crappy America has gotten and how she understands why I live in Spain now.  Admittedly some of these things are not directly supported by data, and it's frustrating when people resort to conspiracy-level claims when the evidence contradicts them.  But I think you can't immediately dismiss people's feelings when it comes to these things.  It's not that their claims are correct, they may be very false, which we ought to point out.  But at the same time I read recently in China that the vast majority are proud to be Chinese, happy with the government, and happy with the country's economic progress.   Admittedly, in an authoritarian country that means less than it would otherwise, but the author of the book I'm reading says it wouldn't be fair to say that it's all thanks to Chinese people being afraid to speak out.  Which makes sense, because the level of development that China has seen in the last 50 years is startling.  They have their own challenges, clearly, but the average Chinese person has reason to believe that things have been getting better, whereas for the average American, for whatever reason, that may not clearly be the case. \n\nAnyway hope this makes sense, feel free to push back or share your opinion and take care.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "What do you guys think of JEPI?

The fifth such cut in Tesla’s largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.\n\nSome analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Tesla’s industry-leading profit margins could be at risk. This week Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries of almost 423,000 vehicles, up just 4% from the prior quarter after price cuts in the United States, China and other markets aiming to spur demand. Tesla has set a target of 1.8 million deliveries this year.

That doesn't mean it isn't still risky though. However, that is besides the point, I don't even own any TSLA. \n\nWhat I meant to say is that it was always their plan to scale production massively, from the very beginning.

Luckily for them, it worked, because they managed to create a product that had high demand and was, for a long time, basically without competition. Now things are changing, other players are entering and establishing themselves in the market. People told me 10 years ago that once Tesla cars become popular, the legacy automakers will just rush in, create a better version of the same car and crush Tesla with their manufacturing capability. This has not happened and most of the serious competitors had to iterate multiple times until they managed to create a car that could compete with Teslas cars, and even now many struggle with manufacturing. There are a lot of reasons for that, but the fact is that Tesla is (outside of China) still by far the largest manufacturer of EVs, and that despite the fact that their cars have a bad reputation when it comes to quality control.\n\nAt this point Tesla has pretty much secured it's future as an automaker.

Their highest volume product is the Model Y and this price cut brings the price back down to where it was in January.\n\nThey cut prices in January, raised prices, and then cut prices back down to the same amount.\n\nThe Model Y Long Range is still priced above the 2021 pricing. The Model 3 standard range also received price cuts, but it is still above its 2021 pricing too. Model S/X pricing still above 2021 pricing too, by about $5,000.\n\nAs for margins, we will see. There will be some margin compression as guided by their CFO. Remember, it isn't just prices, it's cost of goods sold too. The costs of materials has been dropping a lot as the supply chains are also getting back to \"normal.\" Plus, Tesla's scale is much higher than 2021 with better fixed cost absorption. Their new factories in Austin and Berlin have achieved 4,000/week and 5,000/week peak rates respectively, which is going to help with margins. Furthermore, the IRA tax credits provide production tax credits that dramatically lower the cost of battery cell production.\n\nSo we will see at their earnings release how all this shakes out in terms of margins - it is quite a fluid situation with a lot of different variables.\n\nNote that in the US, the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, and Nissan Ariya all do not have any IRA EV tax credit. The Ford Mach-E is getting cut in half to $3,750. All of these have pricing problems.\n\nFord Mach-E California Route 1: $57,995 - $3,750 = $54,245\n\nHyundai Ioniq 5 SE AWD: $50,335 - $0 = $50,335\n\nKia EV6 Wind (e-AWD): $52,600 - $0 = $52,600\n\nNissan Ariya Engage+ e-4ORCE AWD: $51,190 - $0 = $51,190\n\nTesla Model Y Long Range AWD: $52,990 - $7,500 = $45,490\n\nMany dealerships are still asking for mark ups over MSRP, while you don't get that with Tesla. Also, the Model Y is a much larger vehicle in terms of interior cargo space, especially compared to the Ioniq 5 and has access to the best DCFC network in the US.  It's 70 mph range is also substantially higher.\n\nWinter range, tested by Bjorn at 75 mph:\n\nFord Mach-E LR AWD: 163 miles\n\nHyundai Ioniq 5 AWD (summer, so higher than winter range): 180 miles\n\nKia EV6 AWD: 170 miles\n\nNissan Ariya 87 kWh FWD: 181 miles, AWD version should be about 10% less.\n\nModel Y LR AWD: 203 miles\n\nAs a result, Tesla is squeezing the competition with price cuts and will continue to ride their cost curve down. Everyone else is going to have to respond, or just continue to see very low marketshare. Ford has had to cut prices, and will likely have to cut them again.

The stock is already well off the 2021 levels.\n\nAgain, for 3/4ths of their production, this round of price cuts only is back down to where they were in January.

Of course, recession could cause some problems, but Tesla is well positioned for that compared to other automakers. Mainly because of stagflation where cost of oil may remain high, or, if we don’t get recession, price of oil will remain high, the cost of ownership advantage of electric will remain strong.\n\nIt is the legacy automakers that have to replace profitable products with not-profitable ones in an aggressive manner in the next few years that will have major financial stresses.
