Banking Crisis take two, FOMC, calendar of events and VIX 52W low … 4-28-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and VIX Weekly Market", "selftext": "Well most of us who have been trading for a while know that yesterdays technical defying rally was and should be seen as the exception not the normal… However, back to back moves like this is exactly what this market does to try and convince people this is the new normal “just by calls and let it ride.”\n\nHowever, I am the first one here to say that this is not the normal and thinking that you can just buy calls and let them ride all day to be immensely rewarded will leave you and your port burned out by the end of next week if you even make it that long. \n\nWe got a lot to unpack here…\n\n**Sell in may and go away**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1cr88m02qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=459a90347a9c407894a57f33a76f6b932c1e6dd1\n\nIf you have been around trading for any amount of time you know that historically speaking we end up with articles saying to sell in May and buy back in October. What I find hilarious if you type in “stocks sell in may” to google right now these are the first two article that pop up… The Media has a way of not only keeping us on our toes and they also have a way of shaping the narrative to fit their needs. \n\n**Bank Crisis** \n\nIf this feels like déjà vu to you well it should… why? Because guess when the last bank collapse happened? It happened the week before FOMC (relatively speaking)… And now the quiet week right before FOMC what do we have? We have FRC officially going under… Officially as of EOD here we are with FRC being taken over by the government and going into receivership. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sb5r4k212qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d999a121d0b1cc1bd6357b7df58471bbcae0440\n\nIf you traded today then you saw the massive market drop we had from 1030 until 11am… At that point you would have thought it was over for the bulls and that market much like in March with the SVB issues would see a huge drop and that would be it for the bulls… \n\nHowever, we regained strength and some how managed to continue to push up EOD. This further fits not my theory I mentioned last night that I truly believe this is a run for the exit and retail is being left as the exit liquidity. \n\nI have two questions… whos next (bank wise)? And how does this effect FOMC next week? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fjnvcxq12qwa1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4955d6caa9084c33da6d1dd3d91fe28f9d8f503\n\nSo now JPOW is in a REALLY tough place here… why? Well he has to now answer for how SVB and FRC are both outliers and there contagion hasn’t truly set in now… The next question is that last FOMC jpow DID consider a pause but they still went ahead and got did a 25bps rate hike… \n\nJPOW also mentioned that rate hikes is still his base case… meaning he expects to continue to hike and definitely is not planning to pause…\n\nFOMC Wednesday is likely to be very spicy… \n\n**FOMC**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ie86w522qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=65d76f1743f301876a8c200017d247eb481f1e0f\n\nNow unless you have been living under a rock… you know that FOMC is next Wednesday May 3rd. Now we also have ADP non farm, and PMI… So lets talk about it… whats the expectation for FOMC on Wednesday? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gkh2t5i22qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9438746b050ae6ee1328656ce639586446ebc2aa\n\nThis week saw a peak expectation of at 89.1% chance of a 25bps on Wednesday… however, today with seemingly the news from FRC we saw that number drop down to 80.@ as of EOD. \n\nFor me I am fairly confident JPOW is going to do a 25bps rate hike and I am also fairly confident that despite what happens over the weekend with FRC we are going to see him stick to the script that inflation is still too hot and has not properly come down yet, he is also going to once again re-iterate that rate cuts is NOT the base case and that the fed does NOT expect a pause by EOY. \n\nThe question we are faced with this time… will the markets believe him or not? \n\nThere absolutely is a base case where the market shrugs him off once again and pushes this higher until we get a true CPI rebound (possibly the following week) that then “shocks” the market. However, IF we finally see market and price this in correctly for the first time since March we might finally see not only a sell off but a sustained sell off in the markets. \n\n**Calendar of Events**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yynv2ry22qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5be665bcfc5ad0a9d9d720ba0ba7f6a91cbe67e8\n\nFrom a calendar of events stand point we have a banger of week ahead data wise… \n\nMonday starts us off with more PMI data, followed by Tuesday with JOLTS, then of course Wednesday is ADP, more PMI and FOMC, we immediately follow up the fireworks on Wednesday with challenger jobs, and unemployment claims, then we finish the week out with the all important unemployment rate and our first fed speaker Cook post FOMC. \n\nPre Markets next week are likely to be extremely volatile and unpredictable. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/av11ere32qwa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=42ba5b8a1c4f84ab079442b6b93ce1e0310fd3fd\n\nAlright lets get into the technical now. \n\nAfter establishing a new demand (support) yesterday at 404.3 I was wondering if we might see a push up to 414.22 to take out that demand before starting our next leg down. I did not expect us to push through that and break through 415.25 supply. We had a pretty large fight at 415.25 most of the day and for a lot of the day until the huge EOD push up it looked like that was our line in the sand. \n\nHowever, we have now found ourselves wondering if we are going to push higher through 417.03 supply or if we found ourselves back in the daily range. If we do push higher here we have a huge gap from 417.03 to 429.8 with no major levels in between. \n\n**SPY Weekly SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ve5mmwt32qwa1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&s=47a15e57ff464acbf0c3210146f638cf1ba58745\n\nThis is where things get a little interesting here and honestly the more I look at it the more the weekly looks like we might actually have a huge blow off top push to 427.53 before we finally come cratering down. \n\nLast week we put in a new supply. Doing so allowed us to come down and take out previous 409.98 supply. What is incredible and extremely unexpected is that we actually in the process of all of that turned weekly supply at 412.66 into a weekly demand now at 411.87. \n\nIt should definitely be noted this is what I would call a “weak” demand (support), however, it is definitely not something we can ignore. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ntl1nvb42qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=13e0120517cea222764dc087de506a0439f0f98a\n\nNow what really is impressive here is how fast this recovered this week. Two days ago I wouldn’t have expected to close over 405.2 let alone all the way back over 415… \n\nAs you can see we actually do find ourselves in a broad black bull channel once again and we have ourselves in a 3 day long intense red bull channel. \n\nWhen we loss 405.2 I would have expected a continuation back down to 390.1, however, we actually found ourselves bouncing aggressively off the daily 50ema and retaking the daily 8/20ema. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fqspads42qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=92142b447621379b5f566ee8ac6c20c511bc1cd9\n\nLooking at the weekly price action objectively here we after closing three doji candles in a row we actually just closed out a massive bearish hanging man candle… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lskbyl852qwa1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&s=60189bd5e82960be53f6f5b46cb033167b99bae0\n\nNow as you can see one could assume that this IS the top… however, that would mean that we are trading based on sound technicals and logic. Or perhaps this is a preamble to whats going to happen after FOMC. However, we definitely have to take in to consideration the fact that we did drop and bounce off the weekly 20/50ema… \n\nHonestly as much as I am bearish long term… it is very hard not to feel bullish looking at this here. So lets talk about it…\n\nFrom a bullish stand point today we bounced off the daily 8ema and confirmed it as support today. Since we bounced back inside the 405.2 to 419.5 channel the natural upside target here should be 419.5. not only that we did close over the march 18th 415.6 candle high just barely… but in doing so we should open ourselves up for more upside. \n\nFrom a bearish stand point we are coming into the upper end of our range here and resistance where bears have their highest opportunity and chance to reject. The one thing I have noticed lately on SPY is that we go on these sell offs that then lead into massive 2 days rallies that make absolutely no sense form a technical stand point… the most recent example is March 15th/ 16th and March 2nd and 3rd.\n\nNow the question is which case is stronger here… from a macro economical/ data stand point we should see our top here and we should start our next leg down… however, from a daily technical stand point here as long as we hold this daily 8ema honestly its very hard for me to not want to feel bullish and start looking for a rally to 420+ into FOMC. \n\nSPY Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 427.5  \n Demand- 411.9  \n Support- 411.6 -> 407.3 -> 404.2  \n Resistance- 416.1 -> 422\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whbp74u52qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3984869824411fcb552a44248fd62af236cd7ecb\n\nNow on futures daily supply and demand here there is no change on futures… we bounced off 4085 demand and established that two days ago and now we are attempting to push through 4178 and follow through 4198 supply. \n\nIf we can break through 4198 supply then much like SPY we have a pretty large push up to 4310 without much levels in between. \n\nOne thing to point out here on futures daily is the volatility (relatively speaking using an indicator) we have put in back to back high volatility bars. Now the last time we did this (put in a high volatility bar let alone more then one) was March 10th to March 20th…. We actually put 7 high volatility bars in a row in… and what happened then? Well you guess it… we put the bottom of the sell off in and then went on a month plus long rally. \n\nSo the theory would be here with this high volatility that we are nearing the top and we should be nearing the temporary top. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6g96bob62qwa1.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a82e14dd67201a6448c687df81b6bc4f9227597\n\nNow this is where we actually find ourselves in a much different place on Futures then we do on SPY…. Futures did not establish a new demand and it also did not come down low enough to 4055 to take out previous weekly supply. \n\nHowever, this is where we have found ourselves in a massive weekly imbalance… we are seeing ourselves establishing a weekly demand and then immediately turning around to close over that weekly supply… that show an incredible imbalance that will need to be reconciled by either a massive flush back under this 4173 supply or a large enough push up towards that 4283 supply that we can turn 4173 into a demand (much like spy did). \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kh1kxft62qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4514db6191544c0de2191f34be4e928df7352db0\n\nNow on a daily stand point here for Futures we find ourselves in a place much like SPY… a massively broad 2 month long black bull channel followed by a huge extreme red bull channel. \n\nThe question would be are we on a path up to that 4250- 4300 area or have we found ourselves actually finding the top? I hate that we are truly each day left with more questions than answers… \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y36m9y972qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ae6511b1bab786cf6c5331b74d8b9f77aeba322\n\nFutures did not quite break through the wick tops of the January/ February highs, however, we also closed out a massive hanging man bearish reversal weekly candle here too… This one was however, bullish engulfing… \n\nAgain far more questions than true answers and sense of direction… I truly hope that FOMC provides not only direction but sense of answers and clarity. \n\nFutures Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 4174 -> 4284  \n Demand-3919  \n Support- 4149 -> 4095  \n Resistance-4190 -> 4220 -> 4280\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/opo4rrt72qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf8ec727b256dbe2a9d65157509d884afbf7befa\n\nThe one question I think we ask ourselves every single day… IS the VIX broken? My answer is yes but only when it wants to be…\n\nSo lets pain the picture here… This week (and today) we got data that suggested inflation has not cooled, we got data that suggested a recession is upon us, we got data that suggested the economy remains far too strong (remember strong economy the harder and longer JPOW can rate hike), not only that we witness yet another bank (this time the 14th largest) officially go under, and we have one of the most important fed events in less than three trading days (FOMC). \n\nNow despite all of this… the VIX (which remembers shows you the voaltility of longer 28+ dte options) decided it was going to not only put in a 52 week low but an almost 18 month LOW for the VIX… \n\nFrom low to high over the last 3 days the VIX has unwound nearly 20%. Absolutely insane when you look at what is coming up over the next two weeks and not only that everything we got data wise this week.\n\nTruly I just can not for the life of me fathom why the VIX is behaving like this and I truly can not really imagine a world where no one feels the need to put on long term downside protection… \n\nI mean look at that massive spike in March with the last time we got the same banking information… why are we not seeing a similair reaction? \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0gx29s982qwa1.png?width=913&format=png&auto=webp&s=479c5962215427f8278f8e17c8cdb1ba9ea952a8\n\nTodays trading started out much like yesterday but honestly it was even more extreme during opening hour… I truly cant remember the last time we ran $3 up during opening hour let alone during the first 30 minutes of the day. \n\nThankfully I was able to make some money on some scalps and then it pretty much all went down hill from there… we had that huge reaction to the FRC data and that’s where everything went wonky… market couldn’t decide if we were going to melt down like march or if we were going to ATH… after getting absolutely massacred I was able to crawl back to some decent profits to close out the day. \n\nI think what is most frustrating over the last two weeks is that I have had incredibly profitable Monday, Tuesday and Wednesdays and then end up unfortunately giving back some of it on Thursdays and Fridays. \n\nOne interesting trend that I am monitoring on my weekly logs is that for 2023 my win rate has dropped almost 20-30% since January, however, despite a rough February my profitability remains the same. The question would be why? One thing that I have noticed lately over the last 2-3 weeks is that I am allowing myself to take far more entries then every before (or perhaps im just getting more entries). I have noticed that if the entry criteria is there then I take the play… however, sometimes that obviously doesn’t play out. One thing I have also noticed is that I am far quicker to stop myself out then ever before. All in all a good week of trading and profits though.
