{"title": "Is Alibaba stock ($BABA) a buy now?", "selftext": " \n\n* **Alibaba still owns some of the best businesses in China.**\n* **But Alibaba's investors must endure a few major risks.**\n* **Alibaba stock is relatively cheap.** \n\n## Alibaba might have own great businesses, but investors should not ignore the downsides of holding the stock.\n\n**Alibaba's** **($****BABA****)** stock has been volatile. It peaked at $317 per share, fell to a low of $58 a few months ago, and recovered to $120 early this year.\n\nBut as of this writing, the stock has fallen back to around $90. The bulls might be excited with the opportunity to buy this high-quality company on the cheap. But before jumping into the stock, let's go through both sides of the coin of investing in Alibaba. \n\n## The Bull case\n\nForeign investors were shocked (and perplexed) when the Chinese government decided to crack down on its national champion Alibaba and its various subsidiaries like Ant Group in the last few years.\n\nWhile no investors enjoy seeing their company face a government crackdown, the event signaled to me an important fact -- that Alibaba owns some of the most dominant franchises in China.\n\nTake e-commerce, for example. Alibaba served around 900 million customers in the fiscal year 2022 (ended March 31, 2022 ). That year, it enabled about 8 trillion yuan (more than a trillion dollars) worth of transactions on its Taobao and Tmall platforms. In that year, Amazon achieved around $600  billion. \n\nAlibaba's success in the retail industry sparks further expansion in related sectors like logistics, cloud computing, fintech, and others. For example, Alibaba Cloud is the most significant player in China, with around 37% market  share in 2021. Alibaba's fintech associate, Ant Group, powered over half of China's payment  industry while leading in other areas like lending and asset management.\n\nAlibaba also owns some younger (but with great potential) ventures like Cainiao Logistics, overseas e-commerce, and local consumer services. These businesses could grow into further giants as they operate in large and growing markets.\n\nIt is also important to note that Alibaba has a solid balance sheet ($61 billion in cash net of borrowings ) and strong cash-flow-generation capabilities -- it generated $20 billion in free cash flow in the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023. With these firepowers, the tech giant can afford to invest heavily in sustaining and growing its leadership in various businesses. \n\nSince its IPO in 2014, Alibaba has been growing revenue at a rapid rate of more than 30% (even 50% in some years).  While its recent growth has been disappointing (more on this in the next section), the company has the necessary ingredients -- solid businesses and plentiful resources -- to keep growing at respected rates for years to come. \n\n## The bear case\n\nAlibaba might own a few good businesses, but there are still risks that investors cannot ignore.\n\nOn one level, investors must face the inherent risks of investing in Chinese companies amid the significant differences in market dynamics, culture, and regulatory regimes. Investors must understand these areas well to make sound investment decisions.\n\nOn top of that, the biggest hurdle for investing in China comes from the political risks. The crackdown on technology companies -- including Alibaba and Tencent -- that has been ongoing over the last two years is an excellent example of what the Chinese government could (and would) do to keep the country under its tight grip.\n\nOn its own, Alibaba is also facing numerous challenges. Topping the list is the slowdown in growth in the last few quarters. For perspective, revenue grew 41% in fiscal 2021, 19% in fiscal 2022, and just 2% in the first nine months of the fiscal year 2023. Alibaba's already gigantic size, competition from Pinduoduo and Douying, and COVID-19 lockdowns impacted the company's recent performance. \n\nOn the one hand, the bulls might argue that growth would again pick up over the longer term, given the above-mentioned opportunities. Yet, the bears might be concerned that Alibaba might have passed its prime and that it's unlikely to return to its old days of hypergrowth mode.\n\n## So is Alibaba stock a buy?\n\nThe bulls and the bears have good reasons to hold onto their stances.\n\nFor investors willing to tolerate some volatility, it makes sense to buy Alibaba stock today. It owns some of the best businesses in China, and the stock is cheap -- it has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.7 compared to its five-year average of 6.5.\n\nBut for those uncomfortable with the associated China-specific risks or unwilling to tolerate the company-specific challenges described above, it's best to avoid the stock.", "id": "12yf9mg", "created_utc": 1682418400.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 133, "comments": [{"body": "It’s too fucking annoying to own tbh.", "score": 186, "replies": [{"body": "Seriously this is NOT one of those set and forget kinda stocks.\n\nOnce you buy you’ll have to tend to it every day like you’re owning a dog lol.", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "The two happiest days in a BABA holder's life: The day you buy the stock and the day you sell the stock.", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "boat", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "😂", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "😂", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yeah, it takes both time and skill to own.

The EPS revision trend is already very negative. Investors should also expect Intel to fully suspend its dividend in FY 2023, if conditions in the PC market don’t improve.\n\nThe chip maker may be facing renewed downside pressure on its valuation, after new PC shipment information from International Data Corporation (\"IDC\") showed that the PC market extended its slump in the first-quarter. With volume shipments crashing yet another quarter, it is highly likely that Intel will report a very poor Q1’23 earnings card later this week as well (expected April 27 post-market).\n\nConsidering IDC’s preliminary estimates about worldwide PC shipments in the first-quarter, I also expect Intel’s EPS estimates to continue to fall. I also believe there is increasing risk that Intel’s guidance for FY 2023 will be significantly negative, and I would not rule out that the chip maker will have to suspend its dividend completely!\n\nIntel was already looking back at a terrible year in FY 2022, where revenues declined 20% to $63.1B, and net income dropped 60% to $8B due to a broad slowdown in consumer demand. Slowing demand has led to weaker end-market prices, resulted in higher device inventories as well as lower volume shipments, a trend that really accelerated in the second half of FY 2022. There seems to be no indication yet, however, that this trend is easing. According to the report from IDC, preliminary PC shipments for the first quarter indicate that the PC market overall remains in a very weak condition... and as a major chipmaker, Intel will likely have experienced the full brunt force of this downturn in Q1 2023.\n\nTotal PC shipments in the first quarter declined a massive 29.0% compared to the same quarter in the year-earlier period. In the fourth quarter, also according to the IDC, worldwide PC shipments declined 28.1% year over year, so operating conditions in Q1’23 slightly deteriorated compared against an already very weak fourth quarter.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It’s sarcasm, you can delete the copy and paste", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Haha!

Obviously this stock is a buy also. \n\n*(joke).*", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So here's a bit of analysis on Intel\n\nTheir biggest issue bar none is their declining margin. Even if there is a broad slump in demand for mobile/client/datacenter compute, AMD and Nvidia have been able to maintain their margin, unlike Intel. In my opinion however, Intel's decision to accept lower profitability in the short term is likely the best option for them as a company and is very likely to pay off in the long term.\n\nIt's no secret that Intel hit a huge stumble with its 10nm process. It was such a disaster for two key reasons: a far too ambitious shrink and too few resources allocated to its development. 10nm was planned for volume manufacturing in 2017, and the aim of the node was to create a process effectively two shrinks ahead of TSMC/Samsung, resulting in an incredibly efficient and performant process. 10nm was very expensive however, but the calculus on Intels behalf was that they would end up being so far ahead it wouldn't matter. Of course this isn't how it played out, and by the time Intel achieved volume production of 10nm, TSMC already had N7 (similar density) and N5 (+80% denser). Intel's changes to refine 10nm vastly improved the node (Intel renaming their 10nm ESFF to Intel 7 is very reasonable given the uplift from 10nm+ Ice Lake) however the underlying issue of high cost per transistor has not significantly improved, which is further supported by the fact that as Intel has shifted volume from 14 to 10 margin has decreased in a heavily correlated fashion.\n\nWhile Intels manufacturing team hit a brick wall during this period, their architecture teams actually significantly improved. Intel has traditionally relied on having superior process technology over favoring better architecture design, but the 10nm failures forced them to shift toward better design prowess. While Intel cannot match competitors in performance per watt with their inferior node, they have still achieved incredibly impressive voltage scaling to high clocks, better memory controllers, a big.LITTLE implementation with minimal scheduler issues, and a multitude of dedicated accelerators on their datacenter parts especially. \n\nWhile the delays associated with Meteor Lake on Intel 4 suggest an underlying issue with that process (and its derivative, Intel 3), the cause has actually been trying to make too many bold changes from one gen to the next. Meteor Lake is not only on a new Intel process node, it also is the first Intel SoC to use tiled packaging with a compute, IO, and graphics tile, the reimplementation of an L4 cache, and a redesign of both P and E cores (with Crestmont being a major design change). Another major reason for MTL's delay is actually because of TSMC, not Intel; TSMC's N3 delay/yield issues forced Intel to change their graphics tile to N5 instead, requiring many additional steppings. SPR's delay is in a similar vein, with sweeping changes gen to gen (EMIB interconnects, new accelerators/vector and matrix extensions, significant changes to L3 access, and DDR5 + PCIe 5.0).\n\nIntel's core products are fundamentally very good, however their execution has been so poor that they effectively have products 2-3 years old (in road map terms) competing with TSMC and AMDs newest. However there are many indications that their execution in both manufacturing and design is rapidly improving, as the 18Å process was actually pushed up ahead of schedule along with their 2025 compute products.\n\n2023 will be the worst year on record for Intel. This quarter will likely be rock bottom for them, although it's possible it could be worse the following quarter, but either way it doesn't matter all that much. \nIf Intel is able to actually hit their road map for Sierra Forest and Granite Rapids, then that is enough for me at least to believe they aren't doomed to become the next IBM. It will show that both manufacturing (first Intel 3 products) and design (SRF = all E Cores + multi IO tile) are capable of executing again. \n\nIn the mean time, Intel discounting their products to maintain as much marketshare as possible until they have their new products out that will be both more advanced AND more importantly have higher margin due to lower manufacturing costs per transistor is the best strategy for the company. If they need to kill off their unprofitable side divisions (RIP Optane you are dearly missed) to keep their core divisions funded then so be it.\nIndicators that would cut against my belief in Intel's turnaround would be 1) SRF delayed (either officially or effective paper launch) past 1H 2024, or 2) Margin does not begin to increase by end of 1H 2025. 2) would significantly hamper R&D for products released in the next 3-5 years and Intel would likely have to kill off core divisions and essentially become just Intel Foundry Services as their entire business. Long term, low margins will result in an ATI/Radeon vs. Nvidia situation, where Radeon made less money than Nvidia even when they had better products, allowing for Nvidia to entrench themselves with CUDA (software) and dedicated accelerators (Tensor cores) with their far greater margin and subsequent R&D budget. If Radeon hadn't fallen so far behind in gaming performance, Nvidia wouldn't have been able to dedicate silicon area to Tensor and RT cores which were of no immediate benefit to their main division (gaming), but did allow them to cement their stranglehold on datacenter and lay the framework for proper DLSS and RT in future games/product generations.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "My bags got even heavier.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So it’s going to rocket in share price right?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Calls it is.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So, where do you guys value this at?
