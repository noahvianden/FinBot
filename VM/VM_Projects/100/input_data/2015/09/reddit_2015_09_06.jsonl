{"title": "How I plan on turning $10,000 into $20,000 by Thursday.", "selftext": "I'm posting this to help solidify my thought process as we go into next week. If anyone finds benefit from reading this, then I'm glad to have posted it. There are three steps on my journey. The first of which starts on Tuesday morning:\n\n-------\n\n#Step 1:  Buying AAPL calls early Tuesday morning, selling them at the bell on Wednesday morning.\n\nTarget Entry: None. Purchasing them a bit after the opening bell.\n\nTarget Profit: 30%\n\nI'll be looking to buy $10,000 worth of October 16 115 Calls. I'm not exactly sure how I'll be timing my entry, but if China shits the bed on Monday/Tuesday, then I'll wait until the dust settles before I buy. I personally think major volatility is finished for the Chinese market, but either way, it shouldn't affect my play after I purchase the calls. AAPL should go up once the market settles on Tuesday.\n\nWhy AAPL Calls? : The event on Wednesday morning that starts at 1 PM EST. AAPL usually has a nice price appreciation going into the event, and even with the choppy market, I expect the same for the stock.\n\nWhy are you buying October calls? You're paying for theta that you aren't going to use.\n\nYeah, I am. For a few reasons. Namely that I'm at best, a novice options trader. I don't dabble in them very much, and holding too much volatility doesn't sit well with me. Buying a distant expiration date protects me from fast price jumps both up and down.\n\nIf you're worried about volatility, then why don't you just buy verticals or something?\n\nI suppose I should. But, doing it this way is just easier for me to understand and manage.\n\nExpected Outcome: If AAPL appreciates in price by at least 3%, then I'll walk away with around a 30% gain on my calls. Which will bring me up to $13,000.\n\n-----\n\n#Step 2: Roll $13,000 into GNSZ on Wednesday morning.\n\nTarget Entry: .90 cents\n\nTarget Profit: 22%\n\nGNSZ is a Jbem777 pick, and it's the stock that all of his followers are currently focused on. It's a microcap biotech company that is going to present at a conference on Wednesday at 10:50 EST. They were originally going to present sometime in November, but their data was so compelling that they chose to present it early. It's a very attractive catalyst.\n\nAs a result of Jbem's buy-in, the price has already jumped from .70 to .85 cents. However, I think his followers are going to be cautious  and not let the price appreciate too high before the conference, after many of them got burned by buying too high during his SGNZ play that never took off. I can see the stock going up by another 5 to 10 cents between now and the the conference, however. I hope to buy in at .90 upon selling the AAPL calls. The company has a low float and a ton of Jbem devotees with an itchy trigger finger, waiting for the green light from this company to buy. After the company presents, I can easily see this breaking $1.00 and into at the very least, the $1.10 range, where I'm hoping to sell.\n\nExpected Outcome: I'm looking to buy in with an average of .90 and sell at 1.10. I doubt it will go that smoothly, but assuming it does, I'm going to walk away with a 22% profit on my $13,000, which brings my total to a little under $16,000.\n\n------\n\n#Step 3: Roll $16,000 into TPIV - the bane of my existence, and hopefully the reason for my salvation.\n\nTarget Entry: 40 cents\n\nTarget Profit: 25%\n\nI love this company. I expect big things for it in the future. However, I hate this fucking stock. It has imploded from a high of $1.80, to a current low of .33 fucking cents, while waiting for a Phase 2 announcement, which I thought would have happened a long time ago. It's hard to envision seeing $1.80 ever again. But, I have a good feeling that with patience, good things will come this company's way.\n\nAnd, as it turns out, the company is presenting at the exact same conference as GNSZ, and while it doesn't have nearly the kind of hype that GNSZ has, it still remains as a low float stock with tremendous upside potential.\n\nI have my long position in this stock set in stone, that I will be holding until I feel that it gains the kind of market cap that it deserves (read: never.)\n\nBut, if they announce FDA approval for Phase II at this conference, then the stock is going to go on a ride upward, which makes it an attractive short-term play.\n\nI plan to hold GNSZ until the very last possible moment before buying TPIV. Their presentation starts at 3:00 PM. I'm not worried about a huge price appreciation until we hear news. And even if there is a Phase II announcement, I don't expect the market to fully digest the news until Thursday. This is a Pink stock after all, with no Jbem hype anymore.\n\nStill, I can see a very quick move from .40 to .50 which is where I will be selling this short-term play, even though I think this stock will run much farther upward.\n\nWith a 25% gain, that will bring my total to $20,000.\n\n-----\n\n**Why am I doing it this way instead of just yolo'ing AAPL weeklys or something?**\n\nKeeping my stress levels low. I think all three of these are very safe bets. The most risky is definitely the calls, but I really can't see the AAPL stock trading flat in a run-up to the conference. Even if it does, I can just pull the money out and start the next phase of the plan.\n\nHopefully, it all works out!\n\nEdit: Formatting.\n\n\n\n", "id": "3juxb2", "created_utc": 1441549439.0, "score": 153, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 111, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 79, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ive been doing well selling premium on absurd IV.

A fast track status announcement would be very big too, as it cuts down the length of time that the drug needs to go to market. With their flagship drug having Phase 2 approval, the company can also start establishing partnerships with big pharma (as of a few months ago, the company was in talks with a big pharma group, from my understanding) The price should naturally appreciate as the company continues to gain traction from there.
