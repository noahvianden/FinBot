I emailed them a bunch, and they told me I could call them to sell it, but that is terribly inconvenient and having to talk to a live human-being is obviously way too intimidating so I kept emailing and pestering them about it and eventually the SELL button showed up in the interface, but the information was still garbled. For example, the stock name showed up as G@b*$2 and there was no price info (which you really shouldn't be counting on RH for anyways), and I could only market price sell.\n\nShitty thing is, when it first went to OTC it actually doubled in price the first two days and I was locked out from being to sell. Luckily it was just the bullshit stock I only bought 100 of to test out my first trade on RH.
