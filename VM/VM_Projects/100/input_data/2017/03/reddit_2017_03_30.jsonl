The market was bound to cool down eventually, but to simply attribute it to the real estate tax is classic confirmation bias. Prices began dropping before the tax was even instated. There are dozens of factors that contributed to the cooling down of the market:\n\n* Down payment for insured mortgages was raised to 10 per cent from five per cent for homes priced over $500,000\n* B.C. government introduced a three-per-cent tax on homes sold for over $2 million\n* Fear and anxiety of a bubble (\"red\" level warning for housing market)--lowering consumer confidence \n* Federal government introduced new rules in October that made it harder for first-time buyers to get a mortgage\n* Locals have stopped putting their homes up for sale as alternatives are too exorbitant (affecting supply/volume)\n\nIf you read up on the issue and actually look at the statistics, although foreign buyers play a bigger role in Vancouver than in any market, it's still a relatively small percentage.

No one knows what exactly the catalyst was for the decline in prices but the foreign buyer impact is suspect as a major cause in my eyes. One piece of evidence here is the shift that can be scene from Vancouver to Toronto - prices in Toronto have skyrocketed since the Vancouver changes and that to me seems well attributed to foreign buyers shifting their attention to Toronto. The fact is prices have been so high, based on average income real estate is totally unaffordable to the average person.

Similar to the ebb and flow of economic cycles, presidents have a tendency to attribute the success of the economy to their doing, when in reality much of it is out of their hands. Fiscal policy can only achieve so much, the rest is left up to consumer sentiment, monetary policy, and the countless other variables that play a factor. I do agree that purchasing a house as an investment should come second to purchasing a house as a home, thus justifying a foreign tax to deter speculators trying to make a profit. But I also think a much larger issue was the simple vehement sentiment of home-buyers, pushing the price skyward.
