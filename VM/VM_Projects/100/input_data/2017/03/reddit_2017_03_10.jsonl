I can roll it out easier. Monthlies are also more liquid.

With weeklys I'd have to keep writing ATM.  While I'm writing at strikes I don't mind buying, the goal is not to get exercised.  I'm trying to generate income.\n\nThe contract lost $36 value in the first week and that was marked before the AH gain. I am thinking I may even be able to buy it back Monday and net more than the weekly premium including transaction costs(?).\n\nLastly, I'm only selling 10 contracts. 4 weekly trades is 4x the transaction costs or an additional 32$ roughly per month.\n\nI'm not disagreeing with your calculations but I don't know if that's the whole picture.

The reason for this is so that they don't engage in \"prohibited hedging\" by disposing common stock for 60 days while Goldman is going to sell the shares in the open market strategically so they don't cause sharp price drops. Though the price they bought at seems interesting because y'know AMD being a pretty badass and confusing stock.
