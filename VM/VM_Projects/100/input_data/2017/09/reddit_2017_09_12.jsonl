That's not how anything works.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You are severely misinformed and don't understand how a sports league works. The NFL as an organization is non-profit. The TEAMS are for-profit. It wouldn't make any sense for the small market teams that make less money than the large market teams to subsidize their tax burden by taxing the NFL as a whole. The NFL does not make any money. Jersey sales, tickets, TV deals, anything else you can think of that the NFL teams use to make money, none of that goes to the NFL organization. They don't make any money, the teams make money. \n\n\nBefore 2015 change:\n\nEvery dollar of income that is earned in the National Football League — from game tickets, television rights fees, jersey sales and national sponsorships — is subject to tax. None of this income is shielded in a tax-exempt entity. Instead, the NFL’s 32 clubs pay tax on all of these revenues.\nClaims that the NFL is using a tax exemption to avoid paying the tax due on these revenues are simply misinformed. The confusion arises from the fact that there is one small part of the NFL, unrelated to all this business activity, that is tax-exempt: the NFL League Office. The league office is the administrative and organizational arm of the NFL and does things like write the rules of the game, hire referees, run the college draft, negotiate the collective bargaining agreement with the players, conduct player safety research, and run youth football programs.\n\nThe league office acts as a trade association for the NFL clubs. In the same way that other trade associations support companies in other lines of business, it establishes rules and standard practices for its members, develops programs to help them run their operations more efficiently and profitably, and promotes the business in the broader community. Trade associations are nonprofit organizations. They don;t engage in any business activity. As a result, they are exempt from being taxed under section 501(c)(6) of the federal tax code. (Charities are exempt under section 501(c)(3); the NFL League Office has never claimed to be a charity.)\n\nBecause the league office does not receive income from game tickets, television contracts and the like, its tax exemption does not apply to any of the profits earned in the NFL overall. All the money-making activity is conducted by the for-profit, taxable teams.\n\nAfter 2015 change: \n\nThe National Football League announced it will end its decades-old tax-exempt status, which it said had become a “distraction.”\nIn a letter to team owners, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the move addresses a misunderstanding about the tax status of the $10 billion-a-year organization. The central league office, which coordinates and manages the league’s affairs, is listed as a nonprofit organization, but the NFL’s 32 teams already pay taxes on their profits, as well as on player salaries and merchandise sales.\n\n“The effects of the tax-exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years,” Mr. Goodell said in the letter. “The fact is that the business of the NFL has never been tax-exempt.”\n\nMr. Goodell said that the league office and its management council will file returns as taxable entities for the 2015 fiscal year, adding that the change won’t affect “in any way” the function or operation of the league.\n\nHowever, by forgoing its tax-exempt status, the NFL will no longer be required to disclose the salaries of its commissioner and other top executives. Mr. Goodell received $35 million in salary and bonuses in 2013.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Revenue /= Profits\n\nNot saying Apple isn't a much bigger company, but the things you choose to bring attention to are trivial ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm quite certain that Apple's profit margin is higher than the NFL.\n\nMany NFL teams make zero operating profit a year. \n\nIf you wanna talk profits iPad/Apple dwarfs the NFL even more", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Like I said, not saying apple isn't a much bigger company, but the things you're comparing are trivial.
