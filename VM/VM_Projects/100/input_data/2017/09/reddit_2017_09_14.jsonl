Both were up like 5 percent yesterday. $AMD was trading @ $12.20. But I'm quite sure I actually bought options on the European AMD traded in Boerse, which is now trading @ 10.30ish (€) Which turns my 14€ call into a $16.66 call expiring in December. So pretty worthless, right? I mean, if AMD were to rise to 13-14 next week, would I make money from selling the calls with a higher premium? \n\nAlso, if you could explain IV and it's importance to me, I'd appreciate it. I know that IV of some AMD 14 November options in 50ish, but I have no idea what it means or what I should do with that information.

Let's apply to AMD - 50% IV at a price of $12 (to make things easy) means there is a 68% chance that in the next year, AMD will trade between $6 to $18 a share (the 68% comes from the definition of one standard deviation, read links below for more info). This will help you in deciding what strike and expiry you may want to take a position in. IV is also a component in the formula to price an option's premium. You can think of it this way, a high IV means the premium is \"relatively expensive\". This is due to the uncertainty aspect (risk) of where the prices may end up in the future. It's also very important to be aware of what IV crush is.

If you don't know your break-even, you can't really be sure if you are making a good decision or a bad one, even if you think you know a stock's future movement. \n\nBreakeven is the price where you'd be profitable on the option directly, without adding in time value. \n\nYou combine your option premium (Going to use dollars to normalize against strike price) $91 for 13 strike with your comission, let's say $20 to be cautious. That's $111 dollars, or $1.11 per share. \n\nSo, that 13 strike would need to hit 14.11 (and increase of $1.11)  to \"break even\" - and every penny above that is in the black. \n\nA reason why this is important is, say, you think AMD reliably fluctuates between 12 and 14 (as a lot of people on this subreddit do). \n\nYou'd buy your 13 strike, thinking \"hey, I'm going to make some bank when it hits 14\", but some quick math shows you that if it only hits 14, but never any higher, you won't intrinsically be able to profit off this options play without a ton of time value (which, again, you'd have to pay for).
