We're talking about burning people alive and non-stop, week-long riots.\n\nWhile the protests will subside, the damage will be done: volatility will spike in the fear that the United States end in up a civil war. VIX hasn't spiked above $20 since the \"FBI reopens its investigation\" last November and if you look historically, it tends to jump every 3 months or so. That brings us to today.\n\nThe riots will lead to burning cars, rocks thrown at police and a couple of deaths. Imagine the Chicago Riots, but financed by Soros and much bigger. Yeah.\n\nThe fear that a mob might overthrow Trump will be enough to terrify the market. VIX WILL jump one way or another.\n\nOf course, we know this will die down the minute the media stops talking about it, but the point remains that volatility is about to explode - at least temporarily - and you can benefit from it by mass buying UVXY.
