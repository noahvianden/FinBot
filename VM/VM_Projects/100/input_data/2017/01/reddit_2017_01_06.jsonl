This is especially noticeable when you make note that HP and other laptop manufacturers are making their thinner laptops bigger to add battert life. This is because we've hit more or less the 99% energy storage potential of lithium ion batteries. Unless we miraculously find a new way to manufacture stable Lithium batteries without  the current anodes and cathodes (which are pretty important for most batteries to function but are also the biggest enemy to battery lifespans) you wont see lithium battery tech expand. More than likely you'll see excursions towards solar plating on electronics to suplement batteries until the next generation or supercapacitors are realized. \n\nLithium as a brand new battery technology is effectively done for.

It kind of mirrors opec in that while high price of oil gave them insane profit, it also allowed their market share shrink permanently. Saudi arabia had to open up full production for a very long time to drive the oil price down enough to stop further exploration and well drilling...paticularly the oil sands of canada and the dakotas. Even then, the damage was done because once the capability was there (the captial expenditure) those wells are permanent.\n\n\nSo maybe you are right in a sense that Li is the gasoline of the electronics world?
