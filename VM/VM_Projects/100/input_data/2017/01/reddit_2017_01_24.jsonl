Also, no amount of distro can overcome internet infrastructure... can't stream tv if you have 2g speeds and slower tech). You have not given a single example of how netflix and amazon are different (i'll get you started: amazon is 2 tiered, but i can see that ending shortly).\nI am legitimately interested in how the two business models are different, and why netflix is here to stay.\nPerhaps you could say why the following are not real threats:\n1. Distro - the cannot expand at the same rate as previously because they are already in every market where internet is physically fast enough to stream their service.\n2. Competitors\na) other content producers can still sell their products to any streaming service. One wrong move and they could just boycott the service. Netflix makes some good content. They also make some ok content. They are making a lot, but it's a big ask for them to make enough good quality content to keep the consumers subscribed. I know that i wouldn't pay the monthly fee for just their content.\nb) the only other streaming service of any worth is amazon. Small note to the others, they exist and could take the market with a few good deals with major content providers. Amazon has the branding, the worldwide reach, the platform and is starting to make some very decent content.\nc) other media platforms such as tv networks are starting to put more content online. Bbc, channel 4, abc, and sky. Sky, in particular, builds its online streaming into its broadband and tv packages. It will be an interesting time when a large consumer base migrates from the cable and satellite platform to solely consuming sky content online through smart tvs etc. Pushing fowards, setting up an online streaming platform is the easy part. They have the branding, they have the content. Just needs decent marketing to be a direct competitor to netflix. Remove the adverts and merge a couple of networks and you have a strong direct competitor.\n3. Peripherals. Amazon has a little universe of entertainment. It has the screens, it has the home automation, it has the literature and music online services, it has online and real shopping, it has web services.

I get home in my amazon self driving car (they are working on self driving trucks, of course they will consumerise that tech by 2022), listen to some music (not amazon original music but maybe one day...). I get home, where my amazon echo turns on my tv, and continue to watch my amazon original show. Then i read an amazon published book on my amazon kindle. You get the idea.
