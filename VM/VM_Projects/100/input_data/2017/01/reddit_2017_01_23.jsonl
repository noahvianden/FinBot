Speaking simply, if you sell $45 calls you keep the premium and lose nothing if Yahoo is below $45 and you begin to lose money if Yahoo breaks above $45. \n\nThose are two ways to make money off of a stock going down without holding any stock in the first place.

It essentially takes some inputs like current stock price, strike, time to expiry and volatility and crunches the probabilities into an expected value of how much owning that call option is worth (i.e. is a pretty good approximate of what the option premium would be if you opened up your trading app right now).
