Since they are puts and not calls, the moment Apples share price drops below the put price they are considered In The Money(ITM) and can be sold, the more they drop below the put price, the more money the options contracts are worth. \n\nSo if it drops below 120 a small amount of options are in the money and can be sold. Below 110 and a lot more of his puts are in the money and can be sold, if he has held onto his 120 puts up to this point they are worth about $1,000 more per contract. Below 100 and all of his puts are In the money if 120 and 110 puts are still held they are worth $2,000 and $1,000 more respectively. Any further below $100 and more and more money is made. These prices fluctuate based on a number of different factors. Time, volatility are the biggest of those factors. \n\nSome things to consider:\n\nOptions trading has a term called IV Crush that FScomeau knows well from his GOOG earnings play yesterday. IV crush is Implied Volatility crush, meaning that the value of volatility on options drops significantly after expected news has been announced (earnings, FDA trials, FED meetings). This could make you lose money even if you bet the right way. \n\nRight now Apple shares are worth roughly 648B dollars (5.31B float x $122). If Apple hits $99 and all of  fscomeau's put options are ITM Apple's shares would be worth 526B(5.31B float x $99). Essentially 2/3 of his trade relies on Apple losing 122 BILLION in market share by Feb 17th. This isn't unheard of, Apple has lost 100 billion on bad earnings before, but it sure is a lot of money. \n\nPeople have been calling for the end of Apple and their lack of innovation since Steve Jobs died and Tim Cook took over back in 2011. Since then Apple has gone from 50.00 to 122.00. Or looking at it pre 7:1 split it has gone from $350 to $840 (fuck bag holding). \n\nOne problem with thinking it will drop that significantly is that it's the golden egg of the stock market. Apple has always gone up, any weakness would trigger most investors (whether they are right or wrong) to buy into the weakness. However, all companies are eventually not relevant.

I asked for help getting NVDA up above like 105 so I could sell it. Someone called me a faggot and later that day it made it to 106", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I understand that terms like “fag” and “gay” are often used in a “joking” manner. When you use them, you probably don’t do so maliciously — and certainly not in a way to purposely offend or insult homosexuals. You, like many, may use the words without even thinking twice about it. Sometimes it just slips — it’s an easy, long since accessible insult. It’s almost a habit, right? Well, even if this is the case, it doesn’t make it okay.\n\n\nFirst of all, let’s start with the obvious fact that “gay” often doesn’t even make sense in most contexts in which it is used to describe something or someone. Take for example when you are hanging around with your friends and you say something along the lines of, “Why won’t you come out tonight? Stop being gay.” There is nothing gay about staying in. You mean stop being lazy? Anti-social? Lame? Is there really no better adjective you can find in your brain to use — one that is not only more politically correct but also more accurate for the point you’re trying to make?\n\n\nJustifying your use of these words by saying “I didn’t mean it offensively,” doesn’t make it okay. Not only does it show ignorance, but it also shows a concerning lack of intellect. Yes, context is important.\n\n\nBut it’s the implication behind it that is the problem.\n\n\nIf you are calling someone a faggot or gay, you are still using the term in a condescending, demeaning and often insulting manner. You never say, “This new guy I am dating is so fun and sweet! He always acts like such a faggot.”\n\n\n“But it’s just a word!” Some people argue that by rejecting the word you could potentially give it more power, making it taboo or more controversial, and that they choose to use it as a means of “reclaiming” it. I am not suggesting you ban these words from your vocabulary; I am suggesting you don’t use them if you are doing so with the intent to insult.\n\n\nYou don’t get to impose your own meaning on words and use them on, or against, other people... at least not while holding the ignorant belief it will go without ridicule — that the context you’re using it in is excusable. You can’t reclaim something without a thorough understanding of where it came from and the problem surrounding it. And the fact that you use it so carelessly leads me to assume you don’t have that thorough understanding.\n\n\nTo you, it may be “just a word.” If so, you are fortunate. A lot more fortunate than others who have a lot of pain and suffering tied to it. Sure, it’s not a big deal to everyone, but just because it doesn’t affect some people doesn’t mean it isn’t your obligation to care about who it may — and why.\n\n\nThe best depiction of the problem with this word, and one that forever changed the way I view it, was a scene from comedian Louis C.K.’s show, Louie. The particular scene is of him and his friends playing poker, poking fun at their gay friend, and asking a number of questions about “gay things.”\n\n\nLouie asked him if he thought he shouldn’t be using the word “fag” on stage during his routines. His friend responded by saying:\n\n\nI think you should use whatever words you want. When you use it on stage, I can see it’s funny, and I don’t care. But are you interested in what it might mean to gay men? Well, the word ‘faggot’ really means a bundle of sticks used for kindling in a fire. Now, in the middle ages, when they used to burn people they thought were witches? They used to burn homosexuals, too. And, they used to burn the witches at a stake, but they thought the homosexuals were too low and disgusting to be given a stake to be burnt on, so they used to just throw them in with the kindling, with the other faggots. So that’s how you get ‘flaming faggot.’\n\n\n... You might wanna know that every gay man in America has probably had that word shouted at them while they’re being beaten up, sometimes many times, sometimes by a lot of people all at once. So, when you say it, it kind of brings that all back up. But, you know, by all means, use it. Get your laughs. But, you know, now you know what it means.\n\n\nBe responsible. Hold yourself accountable. Pay attention to the words you use, the way you articulate yourself, and be aware of how the things you say may affect people around you. At the very least, take the time to understand the origin of a controversial term you use and the meaning it has for other people in our society before deciding not only whether or not you have the right to say it, but what feeling entitled to do so says about you.\n\n\nYou may not be homophobic. But saying you are “just joking” or only saying it to people who aren’t gay doesn’t absolve you of blame. You may not be able to solve the issue of homophobia in our society. But what you can do it make sure you aren’t — consciously or not — contributing to it.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

While that still represents only 11% of Apple's net sales, it alone is higher than the average S&P 500 company, exceeding the likes of Starbucks Corp., Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. \n\nWith much attention fixated on the iPhone -- including what Apple might have in store for its 10th anniversary device later this year -- software and services also bear watching in Tuesday's earnings report as Apple looks for new ways to boost margins and maintain growth. \n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet forecast first-quarter services revenue of $6.9 billion, up 14% from a year ago. That should contribute to overall sales of $77.4 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Earnings per share are expected to have slipped to $3.23 from $3.28 a year ago. \n\nAs iPhone, iPad and Mac sales all slowed in fiscal 2016, services jumped 22%. That was the best growth among Apple's segments and more than double from the prior year. \n\nGood news is piling up for this part of the business, too. Apple confirmed to Billboard last month that Apple Music had 20 million paid subscribers just 18 months after its launch. Total revenue for the App Store, an important contributor to Apple's bottom line, reached $28.5 billion in 2016, with Apple collecting about $8.5 billion of that. \n\nApple's overall 38% gross margin, a closely watched measure of profitability, has come under pressure in recent quarters as iPhone sales have slowed and average selling prices have slipped. But services are a bright spot on this front. Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Research, forecasts that services average a gross margin of about 73%. He also believes that after the coming iPhone launch, most of Apple's revenue and gross-margin growth will come from services. And services should increase to 12% of overall revenue in the current fiscal year and jump to 19% by fiscal 2021, according to Mr. Schachter's projections. \n\nOf course, this all pales in comparison to the iPhone, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of Apple's overall revenue. After retreating for three consecutive quarters, Apple's flagship product is expected to exhibit some sales growth again in the first quarter. \n\nApple's stock, which has recovered from its mid-2016 doldrums, remains roughly 8% below its record and fetches just 13 times projected earnings over the next 12 months. That undemanding valuation should serve up more gains for investors. \n\nWrite to Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com ", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "In it for the syrup.

With a \"blue chip\" stock like apple, having options wont work. You need something completely volitive and then an option to save your bacon because there is always a gullible investor.\n\nBut with Apple its different.\n\nAlso you did not consider their Retna Touchbar launch.. Their mac sales were down until October, people were waiting for the launch. Also they just completed their campus which is going to start increasing their intrinsic good will. Brand value is also up. \n\nI think the iPhone sales will push the stock down, but it is unlikely to move given a hold rating by most people given the brand value. In 2012 that was different because they too were introducing a new notebook, iphone sales were down ect. But Apple is relatively more diversified now especially with the app store and the extreme sales/demand with the new mac book pro. It was released 4 months ago and apple stores are still sold out here in Australia... I think thats the biggest hole in your assessment.\n\nAlso, the cost of labour is also down given Chinese RBM has depreciated some 10-15% since the beginning of 2016, with commodities and imput priced down due to low demand. \n\nApple removed a 16gb variant, this means there is more relative premium in each phone they sell. \n\nThe new touchbar mac is 20% more expensive per Teraflop and is selling like hot cakes.
