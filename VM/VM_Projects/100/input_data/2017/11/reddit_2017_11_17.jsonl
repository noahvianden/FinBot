Most investors don't go on leading subsequent rounds of investment in companies they've already invested in.

And thus up to the point of the IPO, Elon owned about 31.9% of SolarCity through these investments and some small new option grants.\n\nSo, he did put most of his money where his mouth was, even if it is not clear if it was indeed all of it.
