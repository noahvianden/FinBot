That doesn't apply to me and I didn't face any of those issues or restrictions.  \n\nIn general, I am skeptical of these community fiber efforts. I believe that government isn't very good at managing infrastructure overall when you look at costs, maintenance, sustainability, upgrades, etc and giving them more things to manage isn't a good idea. I don't think it's right to have the government or a government-subsidized operator competing with private businesses, because the government can play by different rules. These community fiber networks usually fund their construction debt with taxes. All taxpayers, whether they use the service or not, have to pay. And if the network doesn't work out financially, taxpayers are going to have to pay to subsidize the networks on an ongoing basis and/or ball them out.  \n\nWhile some of these community networks appear to work well (EPB is a frequently cited example), many others have collapsed or fizzled out. Provo Utah spent $39 million on a fiber network that they couldn't sustain and then gave away the network to Google for $1! Often, these community networks cannot achieve the scale needed for the business to really work. When it's time to upgrade the network to newer technologies and faster speeds, some of these community networks are still paying off their initial debt and either get a taxpayer bailout or lose their competitiveness and collapse.  \n\nFor the above reasons, I think that there needs to be restrictions on community broadband networks so that they don't end up as some taxpayer funded boondoggle. They should be structured as private non government entities that the government is an investor in. They shouldn't directly receive tax money or have any special bailout treatment.

In so many jurisdictions there is only one broadband provider and that was the case under presidents and congresses held by both parties.
