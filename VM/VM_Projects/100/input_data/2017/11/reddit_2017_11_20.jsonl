This man expects nothing accept perfection, it makes me more comfortable that he is delaying for perfection, rather then pump out defects like all other car manufacturers have been successfully sued for!\n\n• He ain’t making these himself!  He has teams of engineers, etc.  They don’t need his physical presence to complete a task!  And he does not and cannot use money from Tesla for his other projects.  Each project gets filed as a Corp and shopped around for investors.  Or they open the door and pick investors out of the crowd!  He has no reason to *steal* Tesla money when thousands of people with millions of dollars are eagerly waiting to fund his genius.\n\n• $35,000 vehicle with a 300 mile range and the highest safest rating ever tested with an INFINITE mile warranty “not making that up” will sell just as quick if not quicker then any other $35,000+ vehicle out there that isn’t needed for a family vacation drive.  And insurance is rock bottom prices!  Can’t beat insurance on a Tesla!  And Tesla’s 4th model sedan is rumored to be sold at 20k so theoretically most working people can afford one!  Recession or not they’ll beat competition!\n\n• Wrong again!  Every other model has met production goals and his autonomous factory don’t get raises!  It will pull profits,  most of what is used is cross compatible with other models so Tesla is not reinventing the wheel.  Motors used in cars are used in the semi, etc.  Compared to what other companies have spent for R&D, Tesla hasn’t went overboard by any means!  Especially when you factor in the cross compatibility of parts/supplies!\n\n• WTF lol, you serious?  They already won the race!  Fucking things completely drive themselves!!  What more do you want!
