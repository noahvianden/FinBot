{"title": "I'm different but I'll still help you guys", "selftext": "I believe in social programs to lift people out of poverty. I believe climate change is man made and requires government intervention and tax incentives to slow and ultimately reverse. I believe the Trump administration is a serious threat to the security, stability, and superpower status of the United States. I believe calling everyone faggots makes you sound like a never-been-kissed 13 year old and that's kind of a gay look. Although I'm very different from most of you, we have one thing in common: tendies. Yesterday I ate tendies and seasoned fries for breakfast. I recently purchased a 4 piece tendie meal from Wendy's and was euphoric to find 5 tendies in the box. These tendies were purchased after midnight, so they were all dark and dry and shit, but I just used extra BBQ sauce and enjoyed them anyway. Basically what I'm saying is even though you guys think the Earth is flat and Arabs are a bigger threat than lone wolf white men mass shooters and a militarized police state, I still see us as brothers and sisters. Because of this I decided to give you an actual tip. There are a few semiconductor stocks that I'm sure most of you are already aware of. $INTC, $NVDA, and of course $MU are all talked about regularly on here and these are some strong, albeit safe, investments. My tip is a little bit different. If you really want to come up in this game we call stock, you need to find the up-and-comer. The little guy flying under the radar. The superstar yet to be discovered. I've done my DD (again, I'm different) and I believe I've found the next big semiconductor stock that could bring us all massive tendies and let us transcend our differences. The company is called Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) and right now it trades for only $9.95 a share. I predict this price could reach $14 before Christmas. I'm giving you this tip because I believe in people overcoming their differences and coming together for the greater good. Together we can lift each other out of poverty and build a brighter future. I hope you will accept this gift, and I hope you will accept me as part of this community.
