{"title": "I guess I sort of owe you guys an apology", "selftext": "16 days ago I submitted my first post to WSB (Wall Street Bets) and it made a huge splash. I explained how my world view and politics were a little different from most of the other posters here, but still offered advice about Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD). At the time of my post it was trading for only $9.95 a share and I predicted it would reach $14 by Christmas. I was called a \"f#ggot\" and told my \"sh!t\" was all \"ret*rded\". I would be lying if I said these things didn't hurt my feelings, however I was very confident that my tip would make us all chicken tendies and I would be vindicated. As you know by now this didn't happen. Christmas has come and Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) is only trading at $10.53. A modest improvement, but nowhere near my prediction. I personally still made enough for chicken tendies, but nowhere near the amount of tendies I planned on receiving. I'm currently in NC (North Carolina) for the holidays and I plan on getting a dipped fried chicken dinner at Thelma's (http://www.thelmasdownhomecooking.com) before my flight home tomorrow. I love North Carolina style dipped tendies and the southern sides that come with it. For those of you in other parts of the country, go ahead and try this recipe: https://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/north-carolina-dipped-fried-chicken  I'm very sorry that my prediction was off and I hope you guys can find it in your hearts to forgive this silly old libt#rd cuck. Going forward I plan on taking on more of a back seat role in this community.
