{"title": "How do I short the Canadian Housing Market from the U.S.?", "selftext": ">Summary \n\nCMHC = Fannie/Freddie Mac\n\nCanadian housing has nearly tripled in 10 years.\nA single detached house has gone from about $200K CAD to over $800K CAD.\n\nCMHC has $20B in assets and $946B in liabilities\n>50:1 leverage\n\nBanks have lent out a trillion dollars in mortgages for hyperinflated crackshacks while removing any risk of default for them by offloading them to the CMHC (mortgage insurer). At one point, the CMHC allowed 40 year mortgages (in 2008 60% of all new mortgages were 40 year terms), with 0% down (cashback mortgages were a thing with 7-10% cashback), and no maximum loan value. In 2008, over 90% of mortgages were insured by the CMHC (read: \n\n>the entire Canadian housing market is subprime\n\nCDIC = FDIC\n\nInsures up to $100K.\n\nCDIC has $3.4B in assets\nCDIC has $679B in liabilities\n>200:1 leverage\n\nBoth CMHC and CDIC are backstopped by the government.\n\nA 20+% correction would wipe out the CMHC and at least one major Canadian bank as they have uninsured mortgages (already happening with Home Capital, the Canadian CountryWide). A bank being wiped out would wipe out the CDIC.\n\nThe CDIC and CMHC being wiped out would require the Canadian government to issue hundreds of billions of loonies in new debt, sending the loonie to sub-50 cents, possibly to 20-30 cents or even hyperinflating.\n\n>What's happening now?\nThe CMHC has been reigned in to a max loan value of $1M, max amortizations of 25 years (from a high of 40), 5% downpayment on the first $500K, 10% on the next $500K (7.5% on $1M).\n\nPeople have been using \"alternative lenders\" who loan $2-3M on self-declared income or with fake documents. Now these lenders are blowing up and not making new mortgages, hence prices have stagnated or dropped (as in Van, already down 15% this year). \n\nOnce a massive across the board drop occurs, lots of people who are leveraged to the tits with negative/0/5% downpayment 30/35/40 year mortgages will be underwater (they will owe more than they can sell their house for). \n\n>Canadian mortgages are all Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) that reset every 5 years\n\nWhen renewal comes up, which is soon for a lot of 2010-2012 mortgages on 40 year terms with negative/0/5% downpayments, they will be forced to come up with hundreds of thousands of cash to bring their mortgage Loan-to-Value back down to 80-95%. 99% of people won't be able to come up with the money, so the bank will write off the mortgage with the CMHC mortgage insurer, who will pay the bank the loan back then take possession of the house and do a fire sale, and then go after the homecuck for the balance which will be hundreds of thousands for life. Bankruptcy can't discharge CMHC debt since it is Crown debt.\n\nIn fact, banks can call in mortgages at any time for any reason (lol). So if they see prices dropping, they will pre-emptively call in mortgages and write them off to stay afloat. Once this occurs, it's a race to the bottom as banks are forced to call in more and more mortgages to stay afloat (in order to maintain their Tier 1 capital ratios with marked market values of the houses on their books)\n\n", "id": "7jw94f", "created_utc": 1513299696.0, "score": 157, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Wang Chungs will continue to funnel their money into real estate to hide it from the commies back home.", "score": 163, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "I can't stop thinking of Ping from The Office", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "> Canada has a loop where any child born on Canadian soil gets a passport.\n\nJus soli?\nThat's not a loophole Canada has, the US has the same.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Explain how non citizens get a passport", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Having passport => Citizen.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Heard Chinese people forget they bought a house and a lot of houses are empty there.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "My home now.

However, I think you're looking in the wrong places. You can't short CMHC and even if you could, why would you short someone with an unlimited source of money?\n\nYou need to understand the process. The Canadian banks have been selling mortgages to the CMHC and keeping a 'fee' to act as a custodian for the mortgages. This is essentially 'free money', because they've already sold the mortgages. The flow of money looks like this Borrower>BANK>CMHC>Investor. \n\nMost people look at this situation and say, well fuck it. They've sold the mortgages so the risk is gone and you can't short the CMHC cause they're the government and you can't short the investors because the CMHC has backed the mortgages. However, the banks in Canada(similarly as the US) have unintentionally(or intentionally?) moved toward a fee based banking structure, rather than a traditional(3-6-3 structure). When they sell mortgages and take the fee, the income is no longer tied to their mortgage book, it's tied to the shittiest mortgages within that pool. This means the inherent income strength of a traditional bank has been lost. Under the surface they're much more volatile then the market is currently priced.\n\nHere's where things get interesting. 1) The obligations between the Banks and the CMHC state that the banks MUST pay the CMHC for the mortgage pool EVEN if the banks don't receive the money from the borrower(s). This means if a borrower defaults, or fails to make payments, then the banks are on the hook. This means that the 'free money', evaporates overnight and essentially turns into an obligation. 2) The obligation between the banks and CMHC state that the payout for default occurs when the property is sold. If things really hit the fan, then the banks could be sitting on properties they can't sell with borrowers who aren't paying and because of (1), they'll be required to pay. There's an element of 'time risk' that the Canadian banks have ignored, because they assume that there's no risk(CMHC guarantees). Can you imagine if sales dry up and the bank is sitting there with a mortgage that they're required to make payments on. You think they're going to wait out the market? I doubt it. \n\nI think the most important takeaway from all of this is that the income streams from the Canadian banks aren't as secure as they once were. Fee based models are great until the market slows and you aren't writing mortgages. Then your fees disappear and possibly become an expenses(from defaults).\n\nThere's another aspect that you didn't mention and I think it's VERY important. The Canadian banks have new accounting rules coming.\n\nhttp://www.advisor.ca/news/industry-news/banks-to-see-major-changes-in-loan-accounting-and-capital-reporting-226222\n\nSo, they have new accounting rules, new stress test rules, new foreign buyer scrutiny, higher CRA scurtiny and an overall bubble market. This is a really bad combination.\n\nI'll be using Royal Bank here, but if you look at any of the annual reports for the big 5 they will say essentially the same thing. I'm using the 2017 report.\n\nHere's the evidence showing(1) that they do in fact have an obligation to pay, regardless of the borrower status. The point that the banks needs to pay is the point that their fee is eliminated.\n\n> Under the NHA MBS program, we are responsible for making all\npayments due on our issued MBS, regardless of whether we collect the necessary funds from the mortgagor or the insurer. \n\nHere's (2);\n\n>When a borrower defaults on a mortgage payment, we submit a claim to the insurer if the amount recovered from the collection or foreclosure process is lower than the sum of the principal balance, accrued interest and collection costs on the outstanding loan. \n\nAnyways, fuck the banks. They're done. Full disclosure here, I'm short...\n\nOh and I noticed a lot of people are talking about the Canadian banks being highly regulated and no NINA loans,ect...HA!
