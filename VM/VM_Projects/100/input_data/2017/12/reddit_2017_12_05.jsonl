If I don't get approved after finals, then I'll just seek out an educational loan instead. \n\nSo to avoid a cash advance, I'll buy loads of $500 Simon Gift Cards or Paypal Cards while also getting cash back for the purcahses. So the fee of buying these gift cards are covered. I'll then use that money to start trading. I've been thinking about going into crytpo now. PIVX has my interest.
