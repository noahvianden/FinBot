Nobody knows the base case if DRAM supply overreaches or if China starts competing for real, so they're afraid that there will be one year of 10 EPS followed by a dramatic drop in 2 years to possible earnings losses, and thus it could take 10-15 years to get to 50$ earnings in the aggregate.   As just an example, if the base case (the new memory cycle \"valley\") is even 4 EPS coupled with years of 10-15 EPS at the peak then this thing trades at a higher multiple.  Certainly higher than six.  As it stands right now, people think 9-10 EPS might just be the peak of the cycle and so they're jumping off.  Even if there is still a memory \"cycle,\" but they're underestimating the new baseline earnings in the valley of the cycle, then Micron is so undervalued it is ridiculous.  If it is true that eventually earnings will again go negative or barely positive, then the stock is probably fairly valued if not overvalued.  That's the bet being presented to investors right now.  I'm betting that there is an attractive baseline now in light of the changed market dynamics from prior cycles (oligopoly pricing behavior/implied collusion, larger moats to protect the oligopoly because the technology is now so far ahead, and most importantly, the demand side is growing at an incredible rate and will continue to grow so even if prices drop, revenues will not and marginal cost efficiencies will increase).  That's the bet I'm making, and it may take a few more quarters to prove it to the market, but once it is proven, we will see a PE expansion.  If I'm wrong, I'm ok with that because the upside is great, and I'll just buy the dip for a few years and sell the next time the cycle peaks (rinse and repeat).  As further upside, I think Micron is an attractive acquisition candidate in the near term, especially if DRAM prices continue to grow or remain stable.  Samsung has a huge competitive advantage in its other business lines now because it can source memory from itself at cost.  There are many memory buyers who might want a similar advantage.\n\nSorry so long-winded, but I've been thinking about this a lot this week as I know you have, Marty.
