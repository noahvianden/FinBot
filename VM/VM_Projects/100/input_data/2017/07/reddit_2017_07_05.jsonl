My position is not one of foolish protectionism or even a blind allegiance to American companies.  \n\nSo, does anyone remember [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man)?  Or how about this the [Tiananmen Square protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989).  Or, more recently, the variety of human rights abuses that have been perpetrated in China, not the least of which is the abduction of people whose only crime was [selling books] (http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/16/asia/china-hong-kong-booksellers/index.html).  Then, there's the emerging aggression toward other nations, including the US, regarding the [South China Sea](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38729207).  And their checkered history with [Tibet](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-24611657).  And their questionable claim to [Taiwan](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538).  And the extensive [censorship](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/chinas-scary-lesson-to-the-world-censoring-the-internet-works/2016/05/23/413afe78-fff3-11e5-8bb1-f124a43f84dc_story.html?utm_term=.0f4a31b95162).  And their [criminal justice system](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/opinion/chinas-broken-justice-system.html). and [\"social management\"](https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21711904-worrying-experiments-new-form-social-control-chinas-digital-dictatorship).  And unconscionable [violations of labor](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/22/asia/china-labor-unrest-we-the-workers/index.html).  I could keep going, but you get the idea.\n\nChina has a long track record of being a horrible trade partner.  Consider their record on [currency manipulation](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/business/economy/trump-china-currency-manipulation-trade.html), though that may be working itself out... [or maybe not](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/economy/china-tightens-controls-on-overseas-use-of-its-currency.html).  And [intellectual property theft](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22634685).\n\nSure, I will buy something made in China when I can't find an equally good product for a reasonably competitive price that's made anywhere else in the world, but I do tend to avoid Chinese made items when I can.  The reason for this consumer decision is that my purchases of Chinese made products yield taxes paid to the Chinese government, which are then used to suppress human beings.  So, to answer u/CarrotStickBrigade 's question - It's not the nationality of the owners that influences my decisions so much as is it is how the proceeds of my purchases affect the ability of tyrants to suppress the vulnerable.  There is some evidence that, in some subtle ways, many of my concerns about China are being constructively addressed.  When I feel that the Chinese government is acting in a way that is consistent with internationally-shared, contemporary values on human rights, labor, and some of these other issues, then I will reconsider my opinion on this matter.  **I think the Chinese people deserve better.  If you disagree, then by all means, downvote with impunity.**\n\nu/deadandroid - You made a very serious accusation toward me, and it's one that confers tremendous social stigma.  Based on what I wrote above, there was no rational basis for your accusation.  Though I don't expect that such a thing would happen, you owe me an apology.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}

It's risker and requires a lot of up front margin to be locked into your trade, the broker tends to take the cash up front to cover the trade. It's a shitty position to be in, in my opinion.

When you say *\"it will sell your 100 shares and you keep the premium\"* by definition you have to be selling a call. You sell the *call* option where the buyer has the right to purchase (\"call\") your 100 covered shares.\n\nSelling a put means writing a contract to someone giving them the right to sell you (\"put\") shares at a set price. A \"covered\" put just means you set aside the cash to buy those shares when the owner exercises their put option, and you have to buy them.\n\nYour general reasoning is right - sell puts if you are bullish and sell calls if you are bearish to capture premium in both cases - but your use of the term \"covered\" appears to be wrong.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Shit you right bro.
