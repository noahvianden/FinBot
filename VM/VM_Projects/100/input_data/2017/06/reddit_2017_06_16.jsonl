You want to be as high on the structure as possible. This does not inherently mean returns are lower. The market is not efficient because everyone has different priorities.\n\nWith BAC-L and the Warrants, I am at the top and bottom of the equity tranche. Only depositors and creditors are above the BAC-L and the A warrants are effectively above the common equity (as dilution to common & options is likely priced in; I'm too lazy to figure out if it is or isn't). Options on BAC could get murdered if they announce a huge hike the dividend. Great for the long-term, but if you hold during the pay-out period, that pay-out is not priced in.\n\n#StayWoke\n\nEdit: I've provided a number of comments that explain why this can trade above the conversion price.

So as BAC increased so has BAC-L. This makes sense.  The issue I tried to point out is that BAC-L has appreciated too quickly in my opinion. What do you mean when you say, \"I want to know if this $1300 caps it.\"?  Are you asking if it will trade above $1300? It certainly can. In my opinion it would not be a great buy for the purchaser.

IT'S LITERALLY THE ONLY REASON I POST. \n\n1. Sell when converted. Think of it as an option; do you hold a call until expiration? Most of the time, no. You sell at 3:59 p.m. Someone else is a better position to exercise your option than you. \n\nYou could sell for a slight premium up until the conversion. \n\n2. See my edit and read the paper. The last image I posted shows the P&L for these securities. The paper is better because it builds the graphs one by one by one. There is a point where the price moves much higher than a linear P&L. The paper goes into detail and I'll defer to that. Happy to answer after you look there. \n\n3.Not necessarily. See answers to other comments. See paper linked in post edit. The stock could move to $80 and the WACC for BAC could be 9% (currently it's 7.14%: https://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/BAC/WACC-/Bank-of-America-Corporation).\n\nIf the stock is at $80 and funding costs are 9%, you won't be forced to convert since BAC is getting 2% discount on their funding by leaving it, as is.\n\nNow, if it's at $80, paying 7.25%, BAC-L would trade at a minimum of $1600. Again, see paper, BAC-L would theoretically trade higher than $1600 due to the dividend. \n\nYou could create your own \"synthetic\" security. You'd buy a BAC bond paying 7.25% and buy the Class A warrants or DITM LEAPS. Price that out and I bet it costs slightly more than this (likely this is due to capital structure hierarchy).\n\n4. See paper. It's not capped at $1,300. It's not a standard preferred security. If BAC was at $66, I wouldn't have posted anything because their may be \"call risk\". \n\nHowever, BAC needs to move 277% before there it's even callable. While I make absolutely no guarantees,  I think it's safe to say, a move like that will take multiple years. Let's say it takes 3 years to get there, that's $217.50 in dividends. \n\nWithout a TMV calculation, you should be willing to pay $1,300 + $217.50 = $1,517.50. If it runs too far too fast, well, shit... But look at market cap, look at fundamentals, and look at macro issues; it will be difficult for BAC to become that large so quickly. If it does, it's the second largest company on the NYSE. \n\nHope to hear back from you and hope that helped clarify. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. Was meant more as a rhetorical question, in regards that maybe my capital can be put to use elsewhere, if I believe the company is a poor investment overall. If I consider it a poor investment, why would I take on the bond? For example after the recession BAC-L didn't pay out dividends for 5 years. So now I'm bagholding with no benefit and likely losing value as the common stock decreases. This may be an unfair example due to the extreme circumstances, yet still a possibility. \n\n2. So read the paper and saw the graphs. I still think it's overvalued, that's basically what I'm getting at. I understand that there's a bubble where the premium paid is quite large, maybe we are in that bubbled region. The premium being paid is fairly large, but I do like a good Dividend. If it's trading at 1300 and the BAC common is at 23, why would I want to buy the bond other than to collect the dividend? As the bond trades higher the div. yield decreases. Say BAC is at 25 and the bond is trading at 1450, again the only reason I see to buy the bond is to collect the dividend. Is there more potential appreciation, I'm sure there could be but that's not something I'd like to speculate on. You may be interested in this... http://www3.valueline.com/pdf/convbook.pdf  \n\n3.  Again this ties into 2.  But what I'm saying is there may be better ways to invest your capital. Although I do see the appeal even at a purchase price of 1600, the yield is still 4.5%. This is why I've been focused on the dividend aspect. Regardless of what the bond trades at or if it's converted or not it's about collecting the most dividends as possible, with the highest yield possible. Is there more possible appreciation, sure could be, but I wouldn't speculate. So a question to you is what price would you be willing to pay for the bond today? Would you pay 1400 or 1600 or even 2000? If you paid 1400, it would take more than 19 years to recoup your investment off the divs alone. Granted the bond will hopefully appreciate but by how much and how quickly? The graphs are theoretical after all.\n\nAgain I like it and will keep an eye on it, but this is what I was thinking.

If they cut dividends, they'd have to do it across the board. \n\nWith cutting only the common dividend (3b) they'd have funds available for the $435m to pay this dividend. \n\n2. You make a valid point. The caveat is that BAC may determine this is a cheap funding mechanism for them and keep it. If that's the case, an investor would be less worried about being converted right at $65 and be fine being converted when the stock is $80+. If you bought it, right now, your basis is $64.10 per share. You're good for $0.90 of upside and if they don't convert right away, and it makes it to $80, you've got $15.90 per share of gains. \n\nThere is a risk on buying it above $1300. If it's past $65, you'd need to reevaluate. \n\nI'd pay $2000 if BAC is above is above $100. You'd get 20 shares at $50 that you essentially paid $100 for. You'd be able to sell them for $100 and its neither a gain or loss. \n\nIf it's $2000 when the stock is at $25, that's a different story. ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the reply.
