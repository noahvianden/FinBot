All answers are literally on their website, just do your damn research\n* Coding wise know your stuff. How to implement algorithms, which are best, good coding practices, bad coding practises, why unit testing is good. General CS stuff. Know at least how to program in Python and Java(or Scala). Know why using scripting language is better or worse over a compiled one. Likely the stuff you work on will be difficult, not algorithmically but logically very difficult to implement. Show your good at that\n* Research about the company, find out the extra curricular stuff they do. Volunteering, sports groups, show that you will join that as well. I joined a team, and man I met people all through the chain, from interns to partners. Its a good way to have an excuse away from your desk, meet more people and have others in your back.
