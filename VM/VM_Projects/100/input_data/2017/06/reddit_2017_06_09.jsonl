Welcome to /r/wallstreetbets and now you can start losing money with the rest of us! \n\nJokes aside, you can make money when a stock falls by either shorting, buying puts, or selling calls. Shorting is like the opposite of buying a stock, you borrow shares from a broker and pay them back later (hopefully when it's at a lower/cheaper price). \n\nCalls are contracts that let you buy a stock at a certain price (called the strike price) by a certain expiration date. Long story short, stock goes up enough, you're earning way more of a percentage gain depending on the strike price, volatility, and a bunch of other factors. However, that's not always the case, as you have to watch for how much implied volatility is priced in, and theta decay, etc. Puts are the opposite of that (sell a stock at a certain price). Stock goes down a lot, you earn even more. For each contract (100 calls or puts), depending on the delta, it'll be similar to holding (or shorting) like 50-100 shares of the stock most of the time, but at a much much lower cost. The most you can lose though, is the premium you paid for the contracts. \n\nThere are dozens of other options methods (butterfly, straddle, strangle, faggot's delight), but I wouldn't recommend you try them with real money until you research it thoroughly.
