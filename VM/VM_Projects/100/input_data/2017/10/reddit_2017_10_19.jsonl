But then there was a downgrade or something like that when it hit the SMA and it has struggled since. \n\nThis is also a good time for me to reiterate, **to trade whether it is swing, day, momentum, literally any trading other than \"buying and forgetting until retirement\" REQUIRES strict trading parameters established before opening the position!!!**\n\nIf these were my first few months of trading and I opened the same position I 100% would have sold after the downgrade and subsequent drops for a 10-20% loss.
