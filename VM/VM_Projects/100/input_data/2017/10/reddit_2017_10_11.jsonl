{"title": "So I finally made it up to 1 million. It honestly took exactly 14 months. I suggest everyone start with 750 k.", "selftext": "Here is an album of pretty pictures of my stupidity: https://imgur.com/a/HZjM8\n\nI came to you guys 4 months ago and you guys gave some great advice and were really nice, but I ignored it I'm sorry. :( I did have the idea to listen to it, and I plan to listen to it now for the most part with the ideas you gave me at the time. Which was pretty much sell some covered calls. I did learn I can do spreads since then, so perhaps I'll try some spreads with my new found knowledge from my experimenting the past year.. But I'll probably focus on covered calls for awhile.\n\nSome explanations: My father passed away and this is his IRA he left me and my mom. I started with about 750 k the financial advisors we had were almost fully into financials and Europe for the past 8 years which returned about 4% per year, and they were taking out a 1% fee on top of that. They ignored all my predictions and stock picks too so we left them last year. Me and dad were honestly unhappy with how they were performing and were probably going to leave them anyways. I started trading it and selling their positions and choosing my own on august 11th 2016. Some I kept, most I sold though.\n\nWe already took a 45 k withdraw. So including that the portfolio is up around 43% since I got my hands on it. After I stopped messing up and learned to actually hold stocks longer and take larger positions is when the portfolio's value started sky rocketing. But perhaps with the positions and risk I'm taking I probably should be closer to 100% return. I made a copy of the original portfolio and I'm only doing 145 k better than them, they have a 23% return for the year, assuming the portfolio would have stayed the exact same. I spent 3 k on trading fees.\n\nMost of the time the positions were no larger than about 10% of the portfolio's total value. There were times I took around 20% position if I felt super confident after watching for awhile, or perhaps a quick swing trade. I did swing trade AMD a whole lot, about 5 times this year. NVDA about 3 times. I can't day trade in the portfolio so several of the losses were me not being able to day trade before it dropped. \n\nThe trades I didn't maximize profit in and hold such as BABA, I just found more interesting stocks to get into at the time and decided to play those instead, just never found a good entry point for BABA again..\n\nThat's about it for what I have to say, I might take some questions if anyone has any.\n\nI'll see you guys next million I make, it should be easier than the first million.\n\nOops forgot to thank you guys, You guys did help me a bit in several of my picks, I'm not sure if I would have ever invested in AMD or NVDA if I didn't read it here first. So thank you WSB. :)", "id": "75sv75", "created_utc": 1507762791.0, "score": 856, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 295, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 717, "replies": [{"body": "inb4 all timelines in the photos were just reversed", "score": 94, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just him?
