Maybe the fanboys don't see it, but I see the iphone as a product with a lot more potential than it currently delivers and it effectively chooses to limit that potential for foolish reasons. They could easily make their software allow for more user customization for 'advanced' users while retaining their current model for the masses of typical users. They could also easily let the app store function without as much restriction, maybe make an 'adult' section or something.
