Streaming services are hard but if any company has the resources to make a successful one then it's Disney.  Netflix, Hulu, Amazon & WWE are all streaming services which started off shaky but given time, have turned into near flawless operations.\n\nYou won't be watching your content on www.disney.com.  They will figure it out through a smart TV/ game console app.\n\n\n2.) Disney movies carry with them a brand identity unlike any other.  They aren't like Netflix which relies on acquiring licenses or spending $6 Billion for content...they already have a library of content which spans 80+ years.  Combine this with their rights to Star Wars and Marvel and you have a killer lineup of content you can unleash at any time.\n\nPeople will also not watch a different company's content...at least not at any rate which would make any significant impact.  People grew up with Disney movies because their parents grew up with Disney movies and that trend can be possibly traced back to an even further generation.  There is also a distinct quality when it comes to Disney's content and characters...Mickey Mouse will ALWAYS be infinitely more recognizable and thus, desireable to kids than Shrek and it's not even close.\n\n\n3.) While I don't know all the specifics of the deal, I do know their service will provide (at the least) the Disney library, Marvel and ESPN.  I would also assume you could lump the Star Wars universe into this as well.  \n\nDisney also owns the ABC TV group and (I believe) A&E Networks.  I don't think they would make content from these networks exclusive on their service but at the very least, they could be offered to the consumer.\n\n\nWith regards to ESPN and their subscription count...this is directly tied to cable service packages, not to individual subscribers.  People aren't unsubscribing from ESPN, they are unsubscribing from all of cable and as of now, ESPN has had nothing to counter.  With this deal, you could have a streaming service which would provide live sports which has the possibility to be HUGE.  Survey any person who still has cable why they haven't cut the cord yet and I guarantee you will find a lot of this answer, \"I really want to but I need to keep cable for live sports\".
