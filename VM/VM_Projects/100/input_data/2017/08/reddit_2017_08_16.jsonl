You have the power to determine the price of oil, or put plastic companies you dont like out of business, because you basically have unilateral control over the supply. The Sherman Antitrust Act can be used to break up your company. This is a horizontal monopoly.\n\nLet's say you own Oil Conglomerate Co. You own a bunch (but not even most) of the oil rigs and drilling sites. You also own a bunch of the gas refineries, the shipping trucks, and the gas stations. This is smart because you control your own supply chain, this reduces the final cost because less owners are involved. (Put another way: if each stage of the process involved an independent company then each of those companies would be seeking a profit along the way, with this vertical integration the only profit needed is at the final point of sale to the consumer).\n\nThe second instance is, to my knowledge, not very regulated (if at all). This is why we have such massive companies in the form of multinational conglomerates. However, how big is too big? The point of antitrust laws were to prevent businesses from chasing profit motive to the point that it caused negative social ills. How big should Amazon get? Amazon Mortgage? Amazon Car? Amazon Ed Loans? Amazon Gaming? Amazon Lumber?\n\nIt's a difficult question with no easy answers. Also, someone with an actual education please elaborate on this and correct my errors.\n\nEdit: Why is vertical integration potentially a monopoly? Well, it isn't until it is. I don't think I can say there even ever has been one before, making this a very academic exercise. The fear is that a large enough company that is vertically integrated through all things turns the entire market outside of that company's offerings into a market for suckers.
