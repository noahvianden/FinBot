In /r/AMD_stock, some commentators are speculating that it's because the newest product is a disappointment performance-wise, but in my (limited and anecdotal) experience, the fine details aren't as important to the market.\n\nAnyways, in more concrete terms, management says that the company will reach an [EPS of 0.75 by 2020](http://investorplace.com/2017/05/the-advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-stock-bull-case-takes-a-hit/#.WYPJJIgrKUk), which sounds disappointing, but industry average EPS, depending on your source, ranges from [22.07](http://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?ind=1010)\n to a whopping [170.69 with a forward PE of 67.76](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/pedata.html).\n\nIn the liberal case of 170.69, we're all gonna be filthy rich. Ha. Yeah right. The reason why I don't think this is the case is because this is public information, and more seasoned analysts have access to this data, and more. If AMD were actually going to reach a PE ratio of over 60 with 0.75 EPS, everybody would have bought in already. Elementary market efficiency.\n\nIn the conservative case of 22.07, AMD comes up to an estimated price of 16.5525 in 2020. Compared to today's price of 13.24, that's a 20% upside in 2020, which annualizes to 6.26% growth per year. That sounds more likely, considering overall market growth, which annualizes to about 7-8%. At its current price, AMD is on track to approximately match market performance. In fact, now that I'm looking at the numbers, maybe that was the cause of the fall after the earnings beat. Under these valuation estimates (which is also public information), 13.24 is a reasonable price for today. Maybe even lower, in fact.\n\nHowever, I am in for an entirely different reason: volatility. We've both seen how much AMD can slide in either direction over a few days. Well, according to Business Insider, [that's because of inexperienced millennial investors](http://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-investors-are-getting-smoked-on-amd-2017-5). Like me, apparently. Here's the thing, though: dumb money is predictably dumb. When AMD makes headlines, dumb money comes in and makes the peaks higher and the troughs lower. As long as we have a good, conservative estimate of where the price should really be today along with some decent technical indicators, we can swing trade this baby until we're all yacht owners.\n\nBy the way, thanks for asking this question.
