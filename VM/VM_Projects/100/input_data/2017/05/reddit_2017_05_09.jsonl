I'm currently reading a delta of ~-.6, so I lose ($330-$320 [the price it \"was\" at) * -.6 * 100) = $600 loss.  If that happened tomorrow morning, I'd also have losses due to theta.

You want the underlying asset's price to be lower than the strike price of your put (higher if it's a call).  The more it moves down (again, up for calls) the more you make money.  At expiration, a put is worth Strike - Spot, with a call being the opposite.

{"title": "DD on NAK, round three", "selftext": "I have been getting a lot of pms and comments asking me what happened with the dip today.A seeking alpha article was posted with a bearish short term opinon on the piece. I think a rich fool or firm  heavily shorted NAK, as the stock almost immediately dropped 30% to 1.67 in one minute. This was no natural dip, but some man made dip, most likely guacamole. Another question I have been getting, is that am I still planning on holding? Yes. Price fluctuating is not a big deal when you consider that I was not planning on selling before the veto appeal anyways. I still believe the stock is going to the moon yesterday. The facts upon which I bought in on have not changed in anyway.\n\n**I double checked facts on the article which claimed that Kerrisdale closed its short position, I believe it to be fake news. Please remember in the future that cnafiance is a shitstain of a news source.**\n\n\n* **Basics**\n\n\nNorthern Dynasty Minerals aka NAK, is a speculative mining company based in Alaska which owns the Pebble Project. **Pebble Project is a deposit of minerals that is thought to be the second largest mineral deposit in the world, including 70 million ounces of gold, and 57 billion pounds of copper**. What has been preventing the Pebble Project from beginning the mining process for the last twenty years has been a mix of environmentalist activist groups, fishing corporations and the EPA. The fact is that the land near **the Pebble Project hosts a considerable amount of streams and rivers that are inhabited by wild alaskan salmon, about 90% of wild salmon originate from here, which amounts to 200 million usd per year of income.** The mining of Pebble Project is a concern for many who inhabit Alaska due to the fact that mining projects are known to be very likely to eventually pollute the surrounding environment. If you want some slightly deeper understanding, please check out my previous DDs.\n\n\n\n* **Who am I?**\n\n\nMany of you may know who am I, I am the Strudel Man, writer of Nak DDs. However for those of you who do know know me, let you give a fast rundown. [In February was when I posted my first DD on NAK, at the time the stock **was worth 2.9 USD and soon soared to 3.5** USD.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5qcakh/a_more_indepth_dd_on_nak/) At that time[ I began to feel the stock was becoming overvalued on hype and sold at 3.05 before the peak](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5t9lzx/nak_attack/ddmezwd/?context=3). However at the peak a firm called Kerrisdale began a short and distort which somehow created a mass panic which sent the stock crashing to a **low of 1.15 USD**, [I was convinced that the likelihood of the veto being approved was high and that the panic was illogical. I wrote a second DD which said to buy at 2.3, and the stock rebounded for awhile then started crashing again before it eventually hit 1.15.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5ucse0/a_second_dd_on_the_pebble_project/) For the past 5 months I have been watching this stock daily, reading almost every article released on NAK, around two weeks ago I wrote another thread stating to **buy at 1.45, and now the stock is sitting safely at 2.2**.\n\n\n\n* **Reflections**\n\n\n\nThe Kerrisdale Crash was a harsh lesson but incredibly educational. A very humbling experience, as I legit thought I was retarded for a few weeks. I learnt the hard way that the economy can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. I thought it was simple for anyone to see that the Kerrisdale Article had little value as it revealed no new facts to the public, and simply restated risks that everyone knew coming in. I also learned to never catch a falling knife, ***always make sure the dip is the final dip when you buy on the dip.***\n\n\n\n* **What has changed?**\n\n\nAs you can see my previous DDs were written months ago, and circumstances have changed since then. [Most notably on 5/4 a statement was released stating that the veto would be delayed to 5/11, and at the same time the wording practically informing us that NAK would be approved](http://www.miningweekly.com/article/northern-dynasty-epa-identify-likely-framework-to-settle-longstanding-dispute-next-week-2017-05-06/rep_id:3650). *~~Kerrisdale has deleted their position on NAK from their website and [possibly closed their short position yesterday](https://cnafinance.com/northern-dynasty-minerals-nak-stock-kerrisdale-was-so-wrong/15236).~~* Which means Kerrisdale no longer thinks that the Pebble Project is worthless.\n\n\n\n* **Risks + Gains**\n\n\nFor the last two weeks I have been shouting to the world to buy NAK, many people have listened to my advice and send me many pms thanking me for their 20/30/40% gains on their investments. Just as many people have commented that they are afraid to ‚Äúcatch a moving train‚Äù or unwilling to take a risk for the gains. I just want to say if these people had listened to me they would be having the same gains as I am having. If you do not believe in the NAK, believe in the hype. **While I personally believe that it is highly unlikely, there is a possibility that if the veto is rejected the stock will crash to a fraction of its current worth**. After disclaiming the risk, let me say that I think the stock will continue to soar until 5/11, and that if NAK veto is approved, the stock will soar even more. That even without the veto approval in sight the stock traded at an all time of 3.5, that if the veto is approved the stock will be worth considerably more. **The best time to buy is now.** \n\n* **Afterword**\n\n\nHere is a link to my current position in NAK http://imgur.com/a/d0vKa .At some point in the future I am planning to do some basic number crunching of possible share worths if the mining process ever begins. \n", "id": "6a8wot", "created_utc": 1494370092.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "The equivalent of amd when it was at $15", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Pure hype.
