I worked there in high school and I still pick up hours when I'm home from college. The upper management is a nightmare.

Total bullshit, they scratched phones. BUT, it costs the store $5 a pop, and they were pushing them for $29.99, and rarely dropped the price. Turns out, some dumbass in upper management bought out a shitload of these thinking the $5/piece was an easy high margin product and got stuck with a huge amount of them. Basically what I'm saying is their retail/storefront sales are complete crap and are dying.

I should also mention that we lose money on every printer and almost every laptop/computer that we sell. They hope to make up for it with overpriced tech services but they don't sell because they're expensive and shitty and you should never trust anybody at staples to fix your computer. 3rd party ink is becoming much more well known, high quality and popular, and that really only leaves the copy and print center as the last high margin area of the store.
