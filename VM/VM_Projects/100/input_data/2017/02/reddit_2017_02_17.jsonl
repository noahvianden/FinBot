NVDA tapped its 50-day EMA today.\n* In each case, the stock had made multiple attempts to break through a specific price range and failed to do so until it rebounded off the EMA. In the first case, $37; in the second case, $63; in the third case, $71. In today's case, the stock has attempted and fallen from $120 twice. \n* Also on the daily chart, the relative strength indicator has been a reliable way to identify a buy-in point. NVDA has rebounded off of 45 on the RSI consistently. It's currently hovering around 45.\n* However, the weekly chart looks pretty overbought. Please take this into consideration.
