However, there's also the chance that commons get beat to shit, making preferreds more valuable (this would happen if commons are wiped out or diluted ).\n\nAs for which preferred to choose? Depends. Some pay better dividends, some have a par value of $50 or $25, some are more desirable and that means greater liquidity. It's whichever ones you think give you the best upside.
