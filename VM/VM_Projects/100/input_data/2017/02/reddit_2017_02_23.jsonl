It also has a very nice dividend (NOT irrelevant since a stock paying 1.44 has a natural \"floor\" to its price - currently div% is 5.6% which is nice). Hence fundamentals look decent.\n\nFrom a technical analysis standpoint (I'm no TA expert), I just don't see this stock ever going below $20 over the medium term without something major (big resistance at 20.73, I don't see who the hell would sell the stock at that level especially considering the div mentionned above).\n\nIn short: I'm not really sure that OP is right about the upside for gamestop, but I do believe that, even if he is wrong, the downside is limited.
