I still don't think Intel can/will come up with anything competitive in the short term, especially on the high end.\n\nMy (hopeful) scenario is that consumers jump on board asap because there is finally a cost conscious CPU that gives Intel the middle finger pricing-wise. In the meantime, corporations keep an eye out for performance and demand in the consumer section before making the decision to adopt AMD enterprise level processors because cost really is the bottom line here. So consumers are the lab rats for the AMD experience and once these are all overwhelmingly positive, corporations jump on board as well. \n\nI understand this is very optimistic, but it wouldn't be a YOLO play if there was no risk of downside.

Really it's the $259 1600X that wasn't unveiled here that competes with the $340 7700k.  \nThey might drop them like 10-20%.  They will have to wait until Coffee Lake to bring some refreshed designs that don't have an integrated CPU which are cheaper to make. They'll possibly make a new 6 core design with no iGPU that's binned down to 4 cores.

I agree with you that they could've priced them a little more aggressive but NOT that much! I would've liked to see if they were priced like this: $309 for the 1700, $379 for the x version and finally $489 for 1800x. If they were priced like that it would be a lot easier for Intel fanboyz to make the move, because like you said their prices now won't convince many of them(lets hope that we're wrong for the sake of technological progress) but my preferred pricing would make the choice a bit more easier.

Intel owns x86, AMD owns x86-64. x86-64 enables an x86 cpu to use more than 4 GB of RAM, which literally every computer today does. The three companies are Intel, AMD, and IBM. IBM doesn't sell to consumers so that leaves only Intel and AMD to cover the entire world.\n\nIn addition AMD has a ton of high-end graphics IP. It's basically just NVIDIA and AMD making graphics cards for consumers and professionals for the entire world.\n\nThis combination of CPU's and GPU's will be insane when combined. In H2 AMD will launch their new APUs that will very likely be a Ryzen-CPU with Vega-GPU on the die. With HBM. The laptop market is gonna be wild over this. Intel and their built-in HD Graphics is nothing compared to what AMD have with even Polaris.\n\nShort summary: AMD is one of two companies supplying the world with computing power. AMD is one of two companies supplying the world with graphics output and massive amount of teraflops. AMD owns part of what makes the computing of the world go around.\n\nFor a bit about marketshare.  \nAMD has somewhere around 20-25% marketshare in consumer computers. That's about to change.  \nFor GPU's they have 25-30% marketshare in consumer computers. That's a bit more difficult to say anything about because we don't have much detail about Vega yet, but it's likely to at least even out.  \nAMD has somewhere around 0-2% marketshare in servers. Yes, seriously, that little. With Naples coming summer/H2 that's about to change. Anywhere from 5-10% would be a massive boost of revenue for AMD but it's not unlikely they get more.\n\nThey're gonna make so much fucking money and it's all thanks to Ryzen.

The GPU market is an afterthought if Naples is as good as Ryzen is looking.\n\nIt's not insane to compare Tesla and AMD. AMD owns so much important IP for the future. I mean come the fuck on. If you own half of what makes the worlds computing go around you're not looking at anything but growth.  \nTesla on the other hand, at least their BEV business, is dying.

I'm borrowing 3k right now so I get charged $15 a month (0.5%). There are no interest fees on profits or their money, only the monthly fee you must pay.\n\nThere is a margin maintenance to maintain or you will need to add $$ to your portfolio/not be able to trade until the amount is settled. I believe the margin maintenance is if your portfolio drops below the $ amount you borrowed. Mine is $2,100. So if I magically lose all of my portfolio down to $2,100 they will freeze my account. I'm not yolo enough for that to ever happen though lol. \n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Also my first 3 months were free.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Time to acquire a rope company.
