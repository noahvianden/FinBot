Tesla exists today, in large part because Elon Musk went *against* this.  He took about half his 180 Million $US Paypal fortune (a large \"bird in hand\") and threw it into the highly risky company (\"two in the bush\").  The *vast majority* of humans would be psychologically incapable of doing this.
