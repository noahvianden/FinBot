I do not consider this advice but just answering with his opinion with any or all questions I ask.)\n\n***(I plan on doing way more studies of my own before I even attempt to do anything. I have never traded nor attempted to trade to this date.)\n\n0) Is there any Do's and Don't advice for a newbie? Like is there any common mistakes I could know about? Is there any website(s) that give solid information about the activities of everything in general that happens during the trade week? Also, is there a preferable trading outlet I should consider trying? I want to do my 'due diligence' but afraid of reading ill-informed information which would then skew my point of view accordingly, which could have been avoided by reading quality material.\n\n1) I don't mind losing all of my invested cash, but what would be a good 'starting size' bank roll to develope a sizable portfolio? (In example, is a \"$500\" bank roll invested in small scale items similar to a \"$20,000\" bank roll invested in bigger scale items?)\n\n2) As a potential \"Investor\", I feel more tempted to 'ride the waves' for a more \"long term investment\" than most. I understand the market is very unforgiving with swings in either direction. Is this a general \"bad play\" for traders? More for your opinion on this one: In general, do you feel that we are supposed to ride the waves day by day, or is it possible to ride for longer terms? I assume there's a bigger risk by not playing it \"minute by minute\", but I'm tended to believe that just because something closes low, doesn't mean like it's \"doomed to be low\" forever?\n\n3) Im more interested in stuff like technologies, so would it be a wiser decision to 'invest' and 'trade' for stuff in a similar category? Like since i'm really into building computers and such, would it be easier for me to read into trends of Apple, Microsoft, AMD, Intel, Nvidia... etc if I keep up with how everybody is doing? I'm open to \"open my horizons\" and delve into other stuff, but I feel that I should build up confidence in myself and 'stay in my little realm' for now. To me, this seems to be like a huge, vast plane and it would be literal suicide to dive into stuff I know nothing about, besides looking at a few graphs that depict \"trends\", and bet on them. \n\n4) Most importantly, to me, what skills can you learn while doing this? I'm more so interested in learning analytical skills and comprehensive assessments *while* trying to make cash. Kinda like \"earn while you learn\" type stuff. I know I probably won't be the next big guy, but I feel as long as I have a \"chip and a chair\", I can still be in the game. I understand I can fall flat on my ass, but that's 'a OK' to me. As long as I learn something productive while doing this, I feel it'll be a great experience for me.\n\nI deeply appreciate any and all advice you could give me.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Look at tastytrade on YouTube.

Although the internal compliance denied the allegation of the FT, the shareholders had already reacted and the stock price took a nosedive (-35%). The Bafin imposed a two month short selling ban in response to the massive stock move suspecting potential market manipulation. These fraud allegation have been largely refuted by an independent law firm Rajah & Tann by now tho and the short selling ban was lifted on April 19. Currently the Wirecard AG is taking legal actions against two FT journalists and multiple short sellers on market manipulation.\n\nAlthough Wirecard was exonerated by multiple audits and law firms, Wirecard's management, though very good in conducting the operating business, don't offer much transparency, thereby spooking investors. I met some of the managers a couple of times and their attitude is best summarized by: \"What do I care for what some WallStreet banker or potential investor thinks of our business? It's all about business, not PR\" That's the main reason for the stagnant stock price the last couple of weeks.\n\nMy prediction: They will beat or at least meet the estimates, but will raise their guidance due to all the strategic partnerships they already have and constantly enter (example: with Softbank 2 weeks ago). I think it has big upside, and could moon if it manages to break through the 145 (‚Ç¨).\n\nWhat to buy? Some 5/17 otm calls or long dated calls. The strike price for the 5/17s, depending on your risk management, should be between 135 and 150 (‚Ç¨) imo.

Could be a server rack got unplugged at the NYSE. Could be a foreign government sending a message. We'll probably never know.", "score": 125, "replies": [{"body": "No.  Bids disappeared.  Everyone turned their shit off", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "How do bids disappear across the board, on no news for no reason? \n\n\"Bids disappeared\" explains why prices air-gapped lower, but it doesn't explain *why all bids simultaneously disappeared in the first place.*", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": " Understand that the market was down a little more than 3% intraday before the actual \"flash crash\" happened.  It was rather controlled up till that point, chugging along towards a very important support level on the S&P500 1066, something like that. I had been shorting, covering, hitting bids or anyone going long the whole session.  The market typically slows down as it approaches important price levels on indexes as shorts start to cover, get long ,etc. All this starts to be reflected in other index and individual stock. They didn't disappear simultaneously, well that statement might be half true. Anyone bullish got destroyed early in the morning and kind of dwindle through the trading day.\n\n As the market starts to come back from lunchtime S&P was well over 100 points from that level, word gets getting around that some dow stock was trading at a super low price or some weird shit was going on.  As no one gives a shit about the DOW it was no big deal. That stock and some other dow stock started to trade at some weird volatility for reasons unknown but seemed like something happened with the stock's designated market maker or maybe some glitch.  Typically the stock would halt trading to find out what the issue is. Only the stock was never halted.\n\n\n  Few mins later someone tells me Dow is down 700 points.  I tell him no one cares about the dow why are you talking about the dow who gives a shit about the dow. The dow is down 7% which is not supposed to be possible, especially since every other index is not even down 4%.  None of this was reflected on the S&P which was what I trade.  It was a major descrepancy for the dow to trade 4% lower than the other indexes as you may or may not know,  Indexes go up and down in tandem not straying too far from each (i.e. Dow 30 points/Nasdaq 10 points/S&P500 3 points).\n\n\n For those wondering why it is not supposed to be possible,  All Stock exchanges from nasdaq, nyse, cbot, cme have what they call circuit breakers that will pause or halt trading in times of \"extraordinary volatility\".  These are typically set to start triggering when the market is up or down 5%.  No other index was even close at the time.\n\n\nAll of the sudden my platform started going crazy, the price ladder started moving up and down 10, 15, 20 points every few seconds and just cracking new lows with extreme momentum with little retracing or pause.  I thought my trading software was glitching out but everyone was like \"wtf is going on\".  This went on for what felt like at least an hour but was really around 10 mins\n\nThis really was the craziest thing ever.  Somehow the glitch with the dow triggered someones algo to react by buying/selling/hedging/inversing or whatever it was programmed to do in other parts of the market causing others to react.  I've never seen the market swinging so violently with so much energy.  Nothing like it has ever happened. \n\n\n  Bids disappeared because no one knew what the fuck was going on.  NYSE Specialists who are supposed to step in and provide liquidity in these situations provided none.  The spread between bid and ask in the futures pit was $20 wide when the normal spread is .25 cents or less. Every discretionary trader , hft, market maker, liquidity provider everyone who trades for a living either stepped away, closed positions, blew up or was in the process of blowing up was not going to jump in front of this.  No one was jumping in front of this train.\n\nTLDR.  Liquidity disappeared because no one knew what the fuck was going on. \n\n\n\n To answer your question", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "This was a good read.
