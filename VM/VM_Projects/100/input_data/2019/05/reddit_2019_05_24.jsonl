If Tesla does solve for full autonomy, however, and its electric vehicle production surpasses our bear case estimates, TSLA could scale significantly higher than our previous $4,000 price target during the next five years, thanks to our newly introduced bull case for electric vehicle volumes,\" write analysts Tasha Keeney and Sam Korus.\n\n• Ark's math: \"At an average selling price of $48,250 (today’s ASP), Tesla’s EV revenue would total $82 billion at 1.7 million units and $145 billion at 3 million, respectively, in 2023. In the bear case, gross margins would average 25%, which is Tesla’s guidance, while selling, general, and administrative costs (SG&A) average 10% of sales, comparable to that of other premium auto companies even though its overhead should be much lower. ARK also assumes that Tesla will spend 13% of sales on research and development (R&D), its average for the past five years compared to the 4.3% average of GM, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler in 2018. ARK also expects Tesla to reinvest excess cash back into the business to fuel growth. We expect its multiple of EV to EBITDA/R&D to reach 8, slightly higher than the 7.3X average for the auto industry today despite the superior growth profile of EVs relative to gas powered cars. Taken together, based on the electric vehicle opportunity alone, these assumptions suggest that Tesla’s enterprise value will scale from $47 billion today to $120 billion in our bear case and $250 billion in our bull case, pushing its stock price up from roughly $195 into the $560-$1,200 price range.\"\n\n• Ark Invest has open-sourced its valuation model on Tesla with a spreadsheet available for download through GitHub.\n\nhttp://www.seekingalpha.com/news/3466784", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Back on the warwagon after panic selling last week!

{"title": "From $30,000 on Tuesday to... (Part - 2)", "selftext": "Hey all, just wanted to post an update thread (in lieu of editing the original) for anyone who came along for my ride. \n\nHere’s a synopsis of the original post:\n\nAfter seeing Monday’s huge red candles, I had a moment of autistic clairvoyance where I just ‘felt’ like the market direction through the week would be as follows- \n\nTuesday, huge recovery. \n\nWednesday, flat. \n\nThursday, massive bloody red. \n\nFriday, moderate recovery. \n\nI invested $30,000 in $SPY on Monday EOD. Capitalized on the Tuesday run-up to the tune of $10,000. I swing-traded a bit through Wednesday and ended up at $45,000. EOD Wednesday I put it ALL into ORCL puts and SPY puts. Came up to about $125,000 when I exited my positions on Thursday. \n\nThe part 2 is because I put all of it into Day0 SPY/ORCL calls and proceeded to bleed through the rest of Thursday’s session (while providing some live updates).\n\nORIGINAL POST LINK::\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/bs38e4/all_hail_red_thursdays/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app\n\n——\n\nHere’s how things went after Thursday’s session closed. \n\n-I realized soon thereafter that I had a flight TAKING OFF at 7:00am (local, PST). This gave me 30 minutes, if we didn’t taxi sooner, to close or set my positions. \n\n-I DID not have WIFI available. Hawaiian Airlines does not provide it. \n\n-6:30am rolls around. I’m frantically refreshing my phone from my airplane seat. Plane starts shutting the doors and taxiing about 30 minutes later. \n-Right at market open, I closed my 600 SPY positions. $42,000 gain. Nailed it. \n\n-My 4,000 ORCL calls were much harder to offload. I closes 400 at market open (at max profit), but the price started dropping like a rock over the next 30 minutes. At about 7:00am (10:00 EST), I closed 2,600 at a minor loss and said fuck it, let the 1,000 remaining calls ride til market close. \n\n-Spoiler: they did not ride. 1,000 expired worthless\n\nThe total “damage” is my portfolio is sitting at $110,000 cash now. That’s $15,000 down from my high yesterday, but still up $80,000 in 3 days. Not too bad, can’t complain. \n\nIf I were able to close all my positions at market open like I had hoped, would be at $160~170k.\n\nHope you guys fared alright. \n\nLinks:\nhttps://imgur.com/2f1euZ9\n\nhttps://imgur.com/AhhWlOK", "id": "bsmbtv", "created_utc": 1558732201.0, "score": 493, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "I found a 5 dollar bill in my pocket, we are all winners today", "score": 718, "replies": [{"body": "I went out to eat for lunch so I contributed to the local economy", "score": 135, "replies": [{"body": "Sucked dicks for FD money.
