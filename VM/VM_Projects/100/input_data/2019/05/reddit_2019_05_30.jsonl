They put a fatass engine on the max which didn't have enough clearance so they moved the engine up. This lead to weight distribution issues at takeoff which they decided to band-aid fix with software so the plane auto corrects the nose. They then didn't notify the pilots of the change on purpose to avoid retraining and to get the max released as quickly and easily as possible.\n\nThese crashes are a direct result of this management's decision making - they wanted to save money and make money at the expense of the safety (and now lives) of everyone on one of those flights.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Hmm...

If someone is an expert, then they should be able to cite public evidence that makes their point. Just saying \"trust me, I'm an expert\" is pointless, since there is no way to distinguish real experts from fake experts when all we have is the person's word. \n\nWeirdly, on Reddit people often do seem to just blindly trust people who say they're experts. I don't get it. The norm is that we don't automatically trust factual claims unless a source is cited. I think the norm should also be that we don't automatically trust someone's claim that they're an expert unless they give some evidence. \n\nAs I said, people who don't want to give evidence can make their points and build credibility by citing publicly available evidence or by citing the opinions publicly expressed by experts. If you are an expert in a field, you should know who and what to cite, or where to look. There is no barrier to you participating and contributing your expertise, as long as you put in the effort to make sure your posts are well-sourced. \n\nThere is also a more gray and nuanced phenomenon wherein some genuine experts do participate on Reddit, but make bad appeals to authority. For instance, there are some topics that experts disagree about. Rather than saying \"here's my opinion (but other experts disagree)\", they state their opinion as if it were just a well-known fact that any expert would agree with. This is damaging because they are using their authority as an expert to mislead people about what the community of experts believes. You have to look at someone's behaviour and ask yourself whether it seems like their goal is to educate people and contribute something positive to the discussion, or whether they're trying to scratch an itch by \"winning\" arguments or bullying people. Expert status is a big stick to whack people with if that's what you want to do, even if it's unjust and untruthful to do so. \n\nKindness is necessary not just because it's morally right, but because genuine kindness sidelines the desire to \"win\" or the desire to put down or harm an \"opponent\". If to change your opinion is to \"lose\", or to give into someone who has insulted your intelligence and your integrity, then changing your opinion is something you want to avoid. But if we want the truth, then we want to be able to change our opinions — because changing our opinions when we learn new information or consider new ideas is how we get closer to the truth.

But this is so wrong. Disagreement doesn't have to involve verbally abusing someone, anymore than it has to involve punching and kicking them. When you insult anyone who disagrees with you, you are actually getting in the way of productive disagreement and turning the discussion into a contest of words and wills that is about winning and losing, not about thinking and learning.
