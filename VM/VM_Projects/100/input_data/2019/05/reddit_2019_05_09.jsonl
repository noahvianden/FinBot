Our game-playing systems do the same basic function as an autopilot but they have perfect world simulators and their worlds are not very complicated.\n\nI think the timeline for L5 autonomy basically depends on whether it just so happens that a dumb system with fast reflexes, multiple sensors, that never gets drowsy suffices without needing the higher level generalization ability of our brains. It basically comes down to whether the universe just happens to work that way. Kind of like how our earlier chess programs were largely brute force but it just happened to be sufficient to beat us (but this wasn't true for Go until improvements to the algo were made).\n\nYou simply cannot create enough training examples to cover all theoretical combinations of driving conditions, and neural nets are extremely bad at inferences that don't basically approximate the training data (i.e. don't generalize).", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": ">I'm 99% certain that depth and object identification can be trained and LIDAR is unnecessary for that. \n\nYou are correct, especially with object identification, I don't think that's what LIDAR's intended job in the first place.\n\nBut solving for depth locationing is a very hard problem using pure cameras. Don't get me wrong, it's very much possible, and Google/MSFT/universities have published many papers on pure-vision based solutions, way before Tesla even started their FSD effort. \n\nBut in engineering what's theoretically possible very often may not be the best approach to implement for a real life project, and this is where Tesla disagrees with the majority of the industry.
