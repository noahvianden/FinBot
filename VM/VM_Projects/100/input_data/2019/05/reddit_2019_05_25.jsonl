That's not a super high premium, but growth isn't as high as it was previously.

I just don’t see how that’s sustainable with what they have planned.  Combine that with Musk making his comment about “10 months at Q1 burn rate” and it leaves me wondering if they won’t get slashed even more.  So yes, the way you layed it out perhaps R&D and capex are adequate now, but I fear they may get cut again.  Tesla has to find a way to solve service issues going forward and that’s going to require a ton of cash.  The faithful are putting up with a lot right now that regular consumers won’t put up with.  I mentioned in another thread I’ve got 3 friends who are die hard Tesla fans, own cars buy merchandise etc, brand loyalists.
