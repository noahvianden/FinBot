No one knows or understands them all, not even the institutions tasked with creating the regulations because there are so many rules and changes happen so frequently and rapidly that no single person can understand it all. It takes a team of experts specialized in individual areas to have a firm grasp on the totality of the situation. Quite frankly many insurers do not *completely* understand how their own policies are to be interpreted. It often takes lawsuits to determine coverage, otherwise insurers are working off of case law and how they think courts will interpret claims. (Coverage and form interpretation is one of the reasons why ISO forms exists and why every major brokerage has a subscription to ReferenceConnect which provides commentary on forms & coverage based on current case law or industry standards. At the end of the day, until challenged in court, that's still just commentary on what industry experts THINK would happen. Insurance law is constantly being updated on a state by state basis. Top 10 largest insurer in the world, Zurich is in court right now for a $100mil cyber liability claim that it has refused to pay for a manufacturer under an \"Act of War\" exclusion because Zurich believes the NotPetya attack on the manufacturer was Russian state sponsored and should be considered an act of war. Seems unlikely they can prove that the Russian govt was involved and not just Russian actors but maybe they know something we don't...)\n\nInsurance is a very unique industry where you have no idea what your cost is until years AFTER you have collected premiums. Claims develop over time. There is also an extremely thin profit margin and insurance is governed by the law of LARGE numbers. Bad years have insurers operating at losses, good years have insurers working on 2-8% on the $1. An operating ratio of .96 is common in the property and casualty market. The industry ran a 1.04 the other year - so it lost 4 cents on every dollar based on their expenses, claims paid, and claim reserves. \n\nLayer on top of those complex operations the fact the insurance companies have to become glorified financial/investment companies who have far more regulations that limit their ability to earn appropriate returns while not taking on too much risk. You have to be adequately reserving claims, managing surplus, and managing the rest of the business simultaneously. You have a business model where you have to be good across many major disciplines - insurance, law, healthcare, finance human resources just to name a few. Not a day goes by where I do not have to wear multiple hats and potentially step into another field that is heavily regulated. Should that whiplash claimant go for 20 chiro treatments or 5? Should this coverage be forced in front of a court for a legal remedy? The list goes on and on.\n\nTldr: To become a functional insurance company you have to raise a ton of capital. What happens when you bet wrong on pricing your first few years in business? Companies also don't know if the ship is heading in the right direction for at least 3-5yrs after the year has closed out and claims have time to develop. They can use formulas and calculate exposure with modeling but those are all hypothetical until everything settles. Many claims are purposely filed by smart attorneys right before the statute of limitations expires so that parties are hazy about the details. Sure you can get the best actuaries but what data are they going to be relying on to place a new risk of autonomous driving that no one quite understands at this point? We have no idea what the actual risk is because there's no actual claims experience out there to mine.\n\nEdit - One insurance professionals analysis of the autonomous vehicle insurance market. This was published before Tesla was just sued for another alleged autopilot malfunction...this one resulted in a death. The other unspoken problem is what happens when someone hacks the car and intentionally takes it over for mischief or to intentionally cause an accident.\nhttps://www.propertycasualty360.com/2019/05/01/changing-gears-shifting-autonomous-vehicle-liability/?kw=Changing%20gears:%20Shifting%20autonomous%20vehicle%20liability&utm_source=email&utm_medium=enl&utm_campaign=weekender&utm_content=20190505&utm_term=pc360", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Very insightful, thanks.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "> Sure you can get the best actuaries but what data are they going to be relying on to place a new risk of autonomous driving that no one quite understands at this point? We have no idea what the actual risk is because there's no actual claims experience out there to mine.\n\nThis last part is probably why Tesla is doing this. There's a lot of unknowns around the risks of autonomous driving so insurance companies are going to be conservative in their assumptions. Tesla has better data on autonomous driving than any company in the world right now, so can probably get a more accurate picture of how to structure an insurance company around this.\n\nAnd ultimately, autonomous driving is going to be safer than humans driving, and will eventually be *orders of magnitude* safer. The cost of insuring an autonomous car is going to be cheaper than a standard car, and if Tesla has their own insurance company, I would imagine the cost to the consumer would vary by how much the consumer chooses to drive vs let the car drive for them. More data that only Tesla has.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Which would make sense to SELL the data and not take on the risk yourself.\n\nIf it was not apparent, I work in the industry advising clients like Tesla (to be clear, they are not my client, I do know who's client they are).\n\nThe entire purpose of insurance is to shift risk from one party to another. Corporations need to look at their TCOR - total cost of risk - and find a way to adequately avoid, transfer, or accept risk in a cost effective manner.\n\nElon is a risk taker. I deal with clients like this all the time. They are the worst clients because they are willing to accept any and all risks rather than strategically finding a cost effective method of shifting the risk to another party and accepting the risks that you cannot cost effectively transfer or that is just native to your industry. Superman syndrome. Gambling addicts thinking they are going to hit BlackJack. Right now they do not have to eat the risk. Personal auto premiums are not that expensive even in the most highly priced areas. Rates are stable and are not swaying most buying decisions for cars in the luxury segment such as Teslas. Saving a few hundred of dollars of premium being a Tesla owner and having Tesla insurance will not drive more sales of Tesla. It just won't be a needle mover to save a maximum of $500 annually. Like I said, we are talking less than 10% profit margins which means most auto policies have less than $100 of margin, so for argument sake I'm saying return more margin than they make.\n\nExample: Let's say the average auto premium is $2,500/annually per vehicle. It's not, it's $941/annually but let's just say for giggles! Profit margin is 10% after claims, expenses, and reserves. That's $250 per vehicle. What's their data give them, a 40% reduction in cost? Not going to happen but let's say it does for this exercise. That's a $1,000 savings. Now we are up to a $1,250 reduction in cost. Tesla gives the policyholder $500/annually back to incentivize them to purchase a Tesla policy. Tesla is left with $750 profit per vehicle. That would work but for this example to work we also had to suspend reality, assume a brand new company can find 40% cost savings and assume that annual premiums were more than double what they are truly a country wide average. \n\nExample 2: More realistic numbers are an average of $1,500 premium, 10% historical margin ($150), and a cost reduction of 20% ($300). Tesla resells the policy for $300 less to incentivize buyers. \n\nIf they sell a policy to every single Tesla owner to ever purchase a vehicle, they're going to eat that risk for $150/vehicle x 550,000 units ever sold = $82.5mil in new revenue? Where else can they better spend their time and money to make more $$$ is the question that should be asked. The opportunity cost and risk is way too high for the potential reward.\n\nThis is like an alcoholic saying they can handle another drink. He is already overextended and the more he focuses on other areas outside of improving their technology and fix their supply chain in terms of cost to manufacture and speed of manufacturing, they should not be taking on additional risk when they are bleeding money. An auto industry consultant already did a tear down of a Model 3 and found an estimated $6k of savings available through improving manufacturing process. That's what they need to immediately attack to become profitable. Getting half of that $6k additional margin on every single vehicle sold in perpetuity. \n\n*Yes, I am aware of their battery plant that is under construction. This was a smart play because it's taking more control of their supply chain.\n\nThis is not the article I'm referencing. The auto consultant that found the specific cost savings was an American but I can't find his piece. This is the German's take on the manufacturing process.\nhttps://qz.com/1294282/the-tesla-model-3-cost-28000-to-build-german-engineers-say-and-it-still-may-not-be-profitable/\n\nTldr: What you are talking about only would make sense if there was no market for autonomous vehicle insurance. There is a market it's just not well developed because so few of these vehicles exist. When they do exist, there will be a market and like all things, over time, costs will become more in line as scale increases.

The argument will become there is liability arising out of the product itself rather than simply the party directly operating the vehicle. That won't make insuring end users easier that will make finding insurance for Tesla itself more difficult. Tesla is going to need to become their own insurance company for their corporate risk, if they have not already (Single Member Captive for those in the industry), with a hard to place reinsurance treaty that puts a manageable stop loss on their claims. I just don't know if there is enough appetite or capacity in the insurance markets to place that risk right now without more data. When you get into such a risky space, you do have to self insure but again that has to do with Tesla's corporate liability and nothing to do with selling personal auto policies to consumers or commercial auto policies to businesses.\n\nThis is not Lemonade where there is a low loss ratio and a well defined property risk. Covering property that is predominantly located in a single location that you can underwrite and have cost certainty on the value of the property and underwrite the location of the risk is very very very different from becoming a casualty insurer and covering property damage, bodily injury, and medpay. There is a property damage component to auto insurance both from a 1st party and 3rd party perspective. The 1st party component is well defined because you know the value of the insured vehicle. The 3rd party component is unknown. More importantly, bodily injury is nearly impossible to reliably and profitably underwrite in a political and economic climate where medical costs and legal costs are skyrocketing year after year and distracted driving has never been a greater problem. \n\nTldr: I love Elon but this would be a bad area for them to play. Best case scenario is they partner with a MGA that specializes in commercial auto risks and they use their expertise to underwrite. Program business is where both insurer and client benefit and is where the market is trending anyway. The personal auto risk does not really have a well defined outline of how they can bring it to market profitably. They will have name recognition and have an application to directly communicate to their clients so they certainly have a sales channel but it's doubling down on their products liability risk. \n\n*I know for a fact Tesla created their own mini insurance company for construction projects. It would be almost unfathomable to believe that they are not also in some sort of self funded and reinsured captive whether it's single parent or multi member for the rest of their P&C risk.

So long as TSLA stays under $265 by next Friday you would keep that $271 premium. So long as TSLA stays under $267.71 you didn't lose anything by writing the call, since the premium covers the difference. But if the price goes over $267.71 you'll probably want to roll the contract forward (buy the current contract back and sell a further dated expiration) and hope that the premium on the further dated contract is enough to cover the difference you owe on the currently expiring one.\n\nSince IV (implied volatility) is really high on Tesla, you can make a lot of money selling covered calls. The danger is if actual volatility (especially upwards volatility) exceeds implied volatility, you can end up giving up gains you otherwise would have gotten with your long position.
