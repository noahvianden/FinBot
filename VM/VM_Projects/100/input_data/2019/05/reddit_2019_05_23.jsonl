Ergo: EVS are destined to dominate ICE car production and sales in the foreseeable future the way cars took precedence ver horses, electric lights over oil lamps and computers over typewriters.  [http://www.ev-volumes.com/country/total-world-plug-in-vehicle-volumes/](http://www.ev-volumes.com/country/total-world-plug-in-vehicle-volumes/) \n\n3) Considering Trump's trade war - this is damaging to the economy worldwide in general. Tariffs increase production costs when a company needs to import parts for its products and increase sales costs when the company needs to import products to sell them. \n\nIn this case, the best position to be in is for the companies to \n\n* produce, and \n* sell their cars in the same country. \n\nWell, isn't Tesla going to do just that with China? \n\nThis is also very good in China because it creates jobs and advances its transition to all EV car transport. \n\n [https://qz.com/1463563/your-next-car-could-be-electric-and-chinese/](https://qz.com/1463563/your-next-car-could-be-electric-and-chinese/) \n\nChina is a massive market for EVs, so it's a great boon for Tesla that it's opening a factory there. This will help Tesla to lower its bottom line (no tariff costs for imports as no imports needed + much lower labour costs), whilst it will also make it much more affordable and competitive. \n\n4) Why exactly China (a very economy-focused country) would want to hurt its own economy? And why would China like to hurt Tesla of all companies? Tesla is not owned by US state. Why would China want to deter foreign investors and hurt its own GDP and jobs growth by making life hard for local manufacturers? I believe, that now more than ever, China has an incentive to attract foreign investors. China sees its prosperity in the economic development, and development of international trade relationships and is heavily invested in the matter:  [https://www.chathamhouse.org/research/topics/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri](https://www.chathamhouse.org/research/topics/china-belt-and-road-initiative-bri) .\n\n5) Analysts and news companies working hand in hand with investment funds love anything that can move the stock - but that's true for both good and bad news. With the 'trade war' it's easy to spread fear, and with Tesla being such a hot stock, it's easy to target them.

Ironically, all short sellers are future buyers. They literally have to buy shares at some point. In fact, considering my thoughts on the above, I believe that short sellers are Tesla's assets because eventually, they will have to contribute to increasing Tesla's price. We need more of them!
