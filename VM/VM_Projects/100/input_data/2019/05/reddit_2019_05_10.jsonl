Each play will be framed as \"what is driving the play\":\"what the play is\".\n\n5/13\n\n* Financial Regulations: XLF 5/17 ATM or very slightly OTM puts\n* 5G Hearings: XLNX, QCOM, CCI, LRCX, AMAX 5/17 OTM calls and probably even 1-3 month out OTM calls at least 4 strikes above market.^*(5G)\n\n5/14\n\n* Boeing hearing on 737 MAX: BA 5/17 slightly to moderate OTM puts\n* Renewable Energy: 5/17 calls on literally any renewable energy companies, maybe even companies that utilize that tech, such as TSLA\n* FCC Hearing With Potential Net Neutrality Conversation: Comcast, AT&T 5/17 moderate OTM puts\n\n5/15\n\n* Drug Price Reduction Hearings: GILD 5/24 strangle if you believe GILD will be able to get in front of the criticism somewhat which will cause unpredictable results, 5/17 ATM or slightly OTM puts if you think it'll go badly\n* Carbon Capture Hearings: OXY and NRG 5/17 calls\n\nNone of these are explicitly day trade positions. If you're feeling lucky, make your play a day or two earlier than the dates I've specified. However, doing so carries significant risk, especially since the market is acting irrationally with extreme volatility due to trade talks. Making plays on these specified days won't be tendie-reaping, but will minimize volatility risk.\n\n\\*5G: Honestly, it might be a REALLY good idea to get into long dated (around September) calls now on these 5G companies to try and make an earnings report play early. Their profit might be down (with the exception of maybe QCOM and XLNX), but their guidance might be so incredibly strong that it causes a massive bump. If I had the finances available, I'd wait about a week or two for trade talk volatility to subside, gauge whether or not normal market conditions have resumed, and get into long dated calls at least 4-6 strikes above market at the first market dip I find.\n\nEdit: I will update this comment the moment I make a play with a link to a comment highlighting any play I make, so I'd set your app to watch this comment closely if you think this strategy is a good one.
