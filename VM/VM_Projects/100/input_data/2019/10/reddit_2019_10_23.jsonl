Now the challenge is to figure out what they were buying and selling. One way to approach this is to look at the side of the quote the order printed on, with the assumption being that bidside trades are seller-initiated, and askside trades are buyer-initiated. This is a variation of the Lee-Ready quote rule cited in their 1991 paper. Applying this model, it looks like the trader bought the Oct 230c, sold the Nov 230c, and the other 2 legs are unclear as midmkt prints. One approach to classify the midmkt trades is to compare the prices to the theo value (we source ours from [ftoptions.com](https://ftoptions.com) in Chicago, they do a very good market-maker style dynamic fit), assuming trades above theo are buyer-initiated and below theo are seller-initiated. That would suggest the Oct 265 calls were bought and the Nov 280 calls were bought (that part CNBC got right). So now the picture looks like a buyer of the Oct 230/265 call spread for $26.69, and seller of the Nov 230/280 call spread for $26.79 - a net dime credit. Using the same theos to calculate the price of this as a single package gives a value of a few cents, which means the fill was near value. There are a few more ways to confirm this- open interest changes for the following day:\n\n|usymbol|expiry|strike|putcall|openint|oichg|date|close|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TSLA|10/18/2019|230|C|5174|\\-5203|10/16/2019|$29.80|\n|TSLA|10/18/2019|265|C|5972|\\-4874|10/16/2019|$1.10|\n|TSLA|11/15/2019|230|C|14196|6036|10/16/2019|$35.13|\n|TSLA|11/15/2019|280|C|7446|4042|10/16/2019|$7.28|\n\nThis confirms the Oct contracts were closing, while the Novembers were opening, and also there is an exchange feed from the ISE that identifies customer buying and selling for each contract. Looking at that we get the final confirmation\n\nISE Customer Side Breakdown TSLA Oct 230.0 Call, 10/15\n\n|Volume|BuyToOpen|BuyToClose|SellToOpen|SellToClose|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5459|\\--|100%|\\--|\\--|\n\nISE Customer Side Breakdown TSLA Oct 265.0 Call, 10/15\n\n|Volume|BuyToOpen|BuyToClose|SellToOpen|SellToClose|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|6143|1%|1%|1%|90%|\n\nISE Customer Side Breakdown TSLA Nov 230.0 Call, 10/15\n\n|Volume|BuyToOpen|BuyToClose|SellToOpen|SellToClose|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5450|\\--|\\--|100%||\n\nISE Customer Side Breakdown TSLA Nov 280.0 Call, 10/15\n\n|Volume|BuyToOpen|BuyToClose|SellToOpen|SellToClose|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|5901|92%|\\--|\\--|\\--|\n\nThis shows (for ISE volume only, but fortunately this flow was nearly all on the ISE) the customer was buying the Oct spread to close, and selling the Nov spread to open (which was confirmed by the open interest changes). I actually found the origin of the Oct spread, sold in mid September near $17 with shares near $245.\n\n||||||||||\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|500|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$17.90|(FT Theo=$18.08)  BID  ISE|10:58:34 AM|\n|500|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$18.15|(FT Theo=$18.43)  BID  ISE|10:57:11 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$17.00|(FT Theo=$17.00)  BID  ISE|11:02:48 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$16.90|(FT Theo=$16.89)  BID  ISE|11:02:42 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$16.90|(FT Theo=$16.90)  BID  ISE|11:02:33 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$16.90|(FT Theo=$17.02)  BID  ISE|11:02:08 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$17.00|(FT Theo=$17.02)  BID  ISE|11:02:06 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$16.90|(FT Theo=$16.93)  BID  ISE|11:02:01 AM|\n|300|TSLA|Oct|230.0/265.0|Call|Spread|$17.00|(FT Theo=$17.02)  BID  ISE|11:01:32 AM|\n\nSo the overall picture looks pretty clear now- On Oct 15th this trader closed a short call spread for a loss, and sold a new Nov 230/280 call spread to open for little out-of-pocket cost.  The point of this is to (hopefully) see shares return to lower levels when they can exit the spread for a lower price. They did get long 6K of the Nov 280 calls- but only as the long leg of the short call spread, which is now $20 deep and trading near $45. The profit figures being tossed around on the long Nov 280s (up $18 \\* 6K = 10.8M) are offset by the larger loss on the short Nov 230 calls (-$35 \\*6K = -21M), which nets out to a hit near $10M on this trade. It is certainly possibly the seller is long Tesla common stock and was using these call spread sales as an income generator - if so the sting is not so bad, but the initial in-the-money strike price of 230 would be an odd choice for a long-term holder.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "That guy just got Rich quick.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "he already had $4million to gamble tho", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "4M dollar isn’t cool.

I started buying tesla shares early this year around February and started to check out this thread since then. I started buying at over $280 at a bad time and started to buy more and more as the price went down in Q1 and Q2. At some point I had more than a third of my total capital invested in this stock an became obsessed. I analyzed all the financial statements, watched hours of both bear and bull cases on YouTube and checked out this thread every single day, even during the weekends when the market was not open but there was still discussion going on.\n\nI was there when we were all hoping for a great Q1 just to find all our investments in the red. I was also there in Q2 when we had faith in improvements and saw better deliveries but terrible profits. I held my ground with an average of $230 until today, because I knew there was going to be a moment to celebrate and I'm glad to finally see it, but it feels bad to celebrate on my own without thanking this community for helping me keep sanity and focus on the big picture.\n\nI found out a few weeks ago that my wife is pregnant so I'm pulling out all my gains tomorrow as now I should not take so much risk with my investments, but it has been a really fun ride.
