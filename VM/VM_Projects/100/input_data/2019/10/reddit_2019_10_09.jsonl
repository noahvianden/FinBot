Market cap / valuation is not an appropriate measure for comparing companies in the same industry.  Market Share, total assets, total revenues, etc. are the appropriate metrics to look at.  \n\nYou said: \"who is there biggest competitor? you don't even know cuz they don't have competition.\" \n\nYou can't prove that by listing their Valuations.  Typically, valuation and market share are pretty correlated - but not necessarily.  [Look at WeWork vs. Regus.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/08/27/wework-is-the-most-ridiculous-ipo-of-2019/#d20cdaa1ad6c)  \n\n>IWG has more square feet of office space than WeWork, earns more revenue, and actually earns a profit. However, IWG has a market cap of just $3.7 billion, less than 10% of WeWork’s most recent valuation.\n\nI would not describe WeWork as 10x the size of Regus - despite it's value being 10x higher (for the time being...).   \n\nLet's compare RSG and WM on some metrics that are more appropriate than market valuation.  \n\nWM has total Assets of $22.7B.  RSG has total Assets of $21.6B.  Very close.\n\nWM has 42k employees and RSG has 35k employees.  I didn't pull trash volumes for a proper market share comparison, but I did look at revenues for various lines of business as a good-enough proxy to make my point.  \n \nWM is engaged in some lines of business that RSG more-or-less outsources, such as recycling and gas-to-energy.  So it's hard to compare the companies total revenue, but in 2018 WM earned $14.9B and RSG earned $10.0B. So even including the revenue from the additional lines of business WM was only 49% larger than RSG, not 100% larger as you have stated.   \n\nIf you compare the companies in the following lines of business you will see they are much closer in size:\n\nCollection Revenue\nWM:$9.7B\nRSG: $7.5B\n\nLandfill Revenue\nWM: $3.5B\nRSG: $2.3B\n\nTransfer Revenue:\nWM: $1.7B\nRSG:$1.2B \n\nI guess I got a little carried away on this - but it kind of irked me that you said basically that WM has no competition, and they are twice the size of the next largest competitor - when in fact they are pretty close, with WM being clearly larger, but by a reasonable margin.  \n\nI am not here to question the validity of the 2x market cap - I don't know enough about the industry or the companies to say one way or the other - but it's a far more competitive landscape than you let on!

I agree with you that at the time that article was written in q1 of this year that if we were just looking at a snapshot in time where we pause everything and if you and I were to go drive those cars I would agree that Tesla wasn’t the best by any means. However I look at it as a 4x100 relay race. Other auto companies stormed down the track with their best sprinters going 1st and giving everything they have to gain an insurmountable lead. The only problem is that the 3rd and 4th men on the relay are the worst on the squad but are in the make or break position to win/ reach full level 5 autonomy. Tesla started slower and more methodical. They took their time manufacturing a car from the ground up. In videos on YouTube I have seen men that have studied cars over time and are perplexed why Tesla would design the internals for example  so different from every other car company. At the time Tesla claimed to increase the safety. After the testing phase done by independent parties Tesla received 5 stars across the board. \nWhen it comes to full level 5 autonomy it can ONLY be done the way Tesla is doing it. If you haven’t watched Tesla autonomy day I encourage you to do so. For full level tests have to be done in the real world. Simulations can only do so much. Tesla has a fleet of cars studying the geography, driving habits, and all the oddities that can occur on the road way. Teslas competitors vehicles will at some point have to do that as well. \nExample, i have been driving since I was 16 an average of 20 miles a day. One time I saw in the distance and tire coming in my direction at an incredible rate of speed. In the split seconds following as it bounced high in the air I was trying  to figure  out which way it was going and which way I needed to go to avoid it. In those split seconds I realized I had to get in the right lane to avoid it. Unfortunately their was another vehicle in that lane and a concrete wall on the right so I froze, hit the break, and braces for impact. Luckily the stupid thing took one more bounce and cleared my truck missing me completely. Tesla’s fleet of nearly half a million vehicles has probably recorded and assessed that situation hundreds if not thousands of times by now. The cars neural net will literally learn what to do in those situations by identifying the object along with the speed and trajectory  of it and react faster than I can look in my side mirror. The Tesla car would have already know that car was there along with the wall and know the only option is to hit the breaks or the accelerator depending on the predicted path of the tire. Without the neural net that can learn like you and I can it’s just not possible. Competitors technology wouldn’t be able to tell the difference in a blank garbage bag floating in the breeze and a tire hurdling down the road at 80mph.\n\nOne problem right now is the lack of knowledge of where Tesla is at in this process. They can’t do the over the air updates to make the car best get at driving by itself until the neural net has seen and learned the amount of knowledge that no driver possesses. It’s not possible for any driver to have driven the amount of miles and seen the different dangers we all face on the road everyday.  As Tesla’s team feels more confident in their tech they will slowly “flip the switches” to allow the car to do more and we passengers and drivers to feel safer as well. At this point no one should be sleeping in their Tesla careening down the interstate. That’s just nuts. Tesla still tells you to keep your hands on the wheel at all times. It makes me sad when someone is killed in a Tesla that was on autopilot. Tesla should not be at fault for that when they tell you to keep your hands on the wheel. That’s like me blaming the company that makes smoke detectors for not putting the battery’s in for me and now my house is burned to ashes. It’s just plain and simple user error in my opinion. \n\nGosh I need to go to bed. \n\nReal quick though, you are right r&d is down this year. In my opinion they have temporarily cut those funds a little to get their feet under them.

And seeing as Tesla & Cruise are about the only ones you can buy today I **highly** doubt they 'test drove' and thoroughly tested all 20 companies self driving cars.\n\n* Even in Tesla & Cruise's case it's not fair to look at what they've released to consumers, because they don't shove out the latest beta versions of their software to everyone. There's a Youtube video on Tesla's channel of FSD doing things that the current models can't do.\n\n* The companies working on this all have good reasons to be secretive about things, and not let someone leak just how far behind they actually are. \n\n* Just because a self driving car can handle situation A well it doesn't mean it's any good at handling situation B. Some self driving cars for example need the entire area to be mapped out down to the centimeter before it'll even work, while others don't. \n\n* On the same note, some methodologies to get self driving cars to work are much more time consuming, or have trouble scaling to make it work anywhere. So just because Company A has the best self driving car today doesn't mean they'll be first to market if Company B came in later with a methodology that can work quicker.\n\n* You can judge how well their methodologies to get self driving sound in theory, but the fact is no one has gotten a level 4 or 5 self driving car to work yet. So you can't say \"Tesla is dead last because LiDAR is necessary for self driving to work\" (as I've seen some 'rankings' do), or \"Any self driving car that relies on mapping the area is doomed to fail\". In theory **all** of those methodologies can work given enough time and money, you can't disprove it until someone else finally gets it to work.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "MongoDB - ticker MDB - has a database product that has quickly grown to become the industry standard.

Rail is cheaper, fast, and eco friendly way of transport that reaches areas that may be inaccessible for trucks or not cost effective (Think transporting recycled steel). \n2.

With potential conflicts in so many nations, what could go wrong buying this stock?\n3.  Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

All a robot needs is maintenance, a technician (almost always cheaper), electricity, hardware and software then you are good to go. Since healthcare is a fortune to pay for, and robots are typically significantly cheaper, developing automation is the smart thing to do.\n4.  Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE: RSG) - The world isn't any closer to a trash less society, this is a simple business model perfect for mega companies. The moat around US trash collection is how regulations on local, state, and federal levels make it a very hard business to get into which costs usually millions just to have dominion over one area. Republic Services is in 41 states and although is 2nd place to Waste Management, offers more growth potential due to Waste Management already being top dog. In addition Republic Service can profit off of trash collection via recycling.\n5. Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) -Being an artisan company  usually making $10 off something that is likely less than $1 to make is a lucrative business. Especially when your brand is worth billions and associated with middle class and up clientele. Starbucks is like the Disney of coffee, they sell the romance of coffee shops with a well proven and established formula.

There's still 98-99% of the future EV market not allocated to any player yet, which will be allocated in the next 5-10 years.\n\nGascar makers that are making 400k-600k or millions of gascars today are in a much poorer competitive position:\n\n- Gascar makers are struggling to enter the EV market, none of the literally dozens of EV attempts so far managed to even approach Tesla's technology - let alone managed to match Tesla's low EV costs. The I-Pace, E-Tron, Polestar 2 and ECQ are inferior in most EV tech qualities, at higher prices - with the Taycan at *much* higher prices, coming in at $150k+ instead of a promised $85k. The Chevy Bolt has stalled out.\n- Gascar makers have ICE legacies and factories making 400k-600k or millions of cars of the wrong type that consumers are already less excited about and will stop buying in the next 5 years. The \"Tesla Effect\" is already measurably hurting premium gascar resale values in Norway and California. \"Peak auto\" is now a thing at Wall Street as well.\n- Gascar makers have no answer to the question of how they can prevent their EV offerings from cannibalizing their ICE offerings, they have no roadmap to winding down their ICE businesses and investment flows. Most of their published business plans rely on fantasies like a slow, 10 years long EV transition with BMW expecting to sell 70% of their cars with an ICE engine ... in 2030. (!)\n- Gascar makers have saturated the ICE market with no growth left, in fact the ICE market started shrinking in a number of key markets last year and this process started accelerating this year. Not only is there no growth potential, there's a very real process of shrinking sales and shrinking economies of scale, while consumers are in wait-and-see mode about EVs.\n\nI.e. the EV transition is a big technological and financial struggle for gascar makers, an \"uphill battle\" that none of them have mastered yet. Comparing Tesla unit sales to gascar unit sales today is like comparing early iPhone sales to the tens of millions of Nokia sales in 2007.
