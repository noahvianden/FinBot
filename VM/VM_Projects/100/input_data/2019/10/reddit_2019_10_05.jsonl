Now some people think thats awful and scary because “debt is bad,” but it really is a tool. Debt expenses are tax deductible, but current earning aren’t, so by reinvesting your current earnings and using debt to finance dividends you actually create a tax shield for yourself, saving money for the company by paying less in taxes and earning more in the long run by reinvesting in ventures that will exceed the interest costs of the debt.\n\nIf you want to learn more I’d read into the Modigliani-Miller Theorem; its really interesting stuff on capital structure!\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani%E2%80%93Miller_theorem\n\nFree cash flow is certainly a financial indicator.
