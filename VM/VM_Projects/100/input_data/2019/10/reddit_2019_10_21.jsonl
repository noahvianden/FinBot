There are hundreds of trades available every day. There is no scarcity of trading ideas.  \n\nThere is no shame in closing out the trade tomorrow, for a scratch, and getting some free education before you start paying for the education by the trade.   \n\n----\n\nSince you are totally new to options, your account may not allow you to undertake spreads, and I will describe a couple below.  They are not recommendations, but more, an illustration of how I would approach the trade. \n\n----\n\nYou have an option ATVI Nov 8 call at strike $55,   \nit has a bid / ask of 2.57 / 2.60\tas of (Oct 24 2019).  \nI'm assuming you paid about that much for it (x 100) for around $260.  \n\nBasically, that means you want, if you hold through expiration, for ATVI to be 2.60 above $55, or 57.60, to break even.  \n\nI see ATVI earnings report is scheduled for November 7 2018. \nSo the expiration of your current position is one day after earnings.  \nThat means if there is an earnings up move, your option will not participate in day 2, 3 and four of the uptrend that you are confident of.   \n\n\nATVI  closed at 55.44, at Oct 24 2019 and has been meandering around $54 to $56 since around September 5.    It was at 83 about a year ago, before taking a dive in October 2018 and another dive at the earnings report out in November  2018, sinking to 48 in November, and going down to 40 in Feb 2019. \n\nAfter the drop in November 2018, the next earnings report in February had a post earnings rise over three days of about $6 from 40 to 46. About 15%  \n\nThe following earnings in May had a several day decline of about 3 or 4 dollars. \n\nAnd the next earnings in August had a four day decline of about 4 dollars. \n\nSo, earnings have been mixed for the last year, with one 6 dollar move up over several days.   \n\n----\n\nYour premise is that ATVI is going up.    \nMy review of the history is it may go down after earnings, or it may go up. \nIf it goes up, maybe that would be 3 to 6 dollars over a couple of days. \nA November 8 option fails to capture a subsequent  follow on move, days after earnings.\n\nOne way to make the most profit is to reduce your risk if the trade is a failure. \n\nThese are the things I would consider, assuming you are correct in the guess ATVI is going up:   \n- Close out the Nov 8 option for a scratch, for the reason stated above.   \nConsider:   \n- Opening a vertical call spread expiring Nov 15, buy a 55 long call and sell the 60 call. This vertical spread costs less than the single long call at 55: about 1.90, as of the close Oct 24.   \nThe max gain is the spread $5, less the cost, call it $2, net max of $3 (x 100). \nMax loss is the cost, $2 (x 100).  If ATVI goes to 75 in a big move, you get the same max gain. \n\nOr Consider alternatively:   \n\nBuying  a debit call butterfly,   Expiring Nov 15. \nBuy one call long, at 55,     \nsell two calls at 60,     \nbuy one call at 65.      \nNet cost, likely around $1.25, even less risk and cost.    \nMax gain, might be similar, around $200 to $300.    \nIf ATVI goes to 75, a big move, the butterfly may have a loss   \nIf ATVI goes to 60, and stays near there for a few days, you may have a gain of around $300, and less if ATVI goes to 57. \n\nThe idea is, these to positions would capture a \"typical\" move of $5 up over several days after earnings, and if dead wrong, the loss is less than the original long call for Nov 8 at 55 for about $250.    \n\nClose the trades before the expiration on Nov 15.   \n \n---\n\nLinks to useful resources: \n\n*Getting started in options*     \n•&nbsp;[Calls and puts, long and short, an introduction (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/9m9u0w/noob_safe_haven_thread_oct_0815_2018/e7di9s8/)    \n•&nbsp;[Exercise & Assignment - A Guide (ScottishTrader)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/cqg536/exercise_assignement_a_guide/)    \n\n\n*Trade planning, risk reduction and trade size, etc.*      \n•&nbsp;[Exit-first trade planning, and using a risk-reduction trade checklist (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/9at2fu/noob_thread_aug_26_sept_1/e4ywq0u/)   \n•&nbsp;[Trade Checklists and Guides (Option Alpha)](https://optionalpha.com/members/guides-checklists)          \n•&nbsp;[An illustration of planning on trades failing.

I was glad that it worked in my favour, but as people say, \"it literally couldn't go tits up\" definitely kept playing in my mind.\n* Both 32P and 30P now hugely in green. Felt absolutely blessed...but now should I hold them through lockup as well? I ended up staring at the stock almost the entire day -\\_- (bad practice, I know! please don't judge a newbie...) almost sold each time it made a new all-time low. I went back to look at BYND around lockup release and noticed that people started to sell off on the day of lockup release as early as the pre-market trading started, and the stock did start to decline rapidly again within an hour before market close, so I decided hold for further gain.\n\n**Nov 6 / Wednesday / the day of lockup release**\n\n* As \"expected\", more sell off pre-market. I got called into a work meeting but I peeked and saw a huge dump at the open. REALLY regret that GTC limit for my 27.5P while I was in the meeting the whole time. But turns out, when I got out of the meeting to check on the stock again, it started to bounce back, most likely due to shorts covering causing a squeeze. And my 27.5P sold at almost the best price for the entire day and ever since! That was complete luck if you asked me.\n* Since the stock bounced back for the remaining of the day and the day after, I closed the 32P 11/15 when the stock was just sine wave fluctuating due to \"low\" volume and was already satisfied with the extra $1 / contract so I locked in profits.\n* I noticed that my 32P 11/15 had more delta profit increase than my 30P 12/20 when compared to the day before, even though they are now both ITM. I wasn't sure why -- the 30P 12/20 seems to have basically lost all extrinsic value despite still having more than a month left (why is that??). So I decided to keep the 30P for now as I think Uber can have further decline still, especially after the 2 small green day followed by a red day despite overall market rallying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestion: Once an option goes ITM from OTM, is it better to keep holding or to exit + switch to another OTM put if one thinks the stock has further room to go down? I assume better to exit + switch to lock in profits first?
