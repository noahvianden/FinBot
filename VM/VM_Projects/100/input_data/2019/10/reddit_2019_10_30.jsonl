It was counting the AMD stock twice. So every time he sold the covered calls, he was *losing* money, not gaining it, and it was money that RH lent to him. But instead RH counted their own lent money as part of his collateral to loan even more money.\n\nSo on this first round it looks like the price of AMD doesn't matter, but the *next* time he bought AMD with the already leveraged money he's using to leverage even more, the price of AMD affected his ability to borrow.\n\nThis created a situation in which the price of AMD needed to be below $2 *or* he would end up owing money to RH for a margin call. That's right, he created a situation where AMD needed to lose 95% of its value or the brokerage would put him in a margin call over *covered calls*.\n\nThis is, plainly, because RH is absolutely retarded.

The margin buying power is always double the value of both cash and non cash assets combined, which gives him a starting MBP of $4,000. \n\n He buys shares of a stock with his starting and borrowed money and then sells a contract for a fixed price per share that says he will agree to sell the stock for $2 a share at a future time. These contracts get instantly bought up because he's agreeing to sell them well under market price. He then uses the money he made selling the contracts to buy up even more shares and repeat the process. Technically he is operating at a loss, but this loss hasnt been realized yet because the shares have yet to be actually sold. \n\nIn the meantime, RH's system is considering the cash he made after selling the contracts AND is still considering the shares he technically sold but still retains when calculating his MBP. This causes the system to think he has far more money to use as collateral than he actually has, and so it let's him continue this process over and over again until he has a ton of cash but a ticking timebomb of contracts that will cause him to lose a lot of money. \n\nAm I understanding this correctly?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Yes", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why can't he use the margin to buy a stock that goes up and make it back?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Can you show how you derived those numbers?
