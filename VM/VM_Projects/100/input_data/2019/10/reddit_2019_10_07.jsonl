In addition there are three ways which influence the spread's value: positive theta decay, delta, and changes in implied volatility (Vega).\n\nHere is where I'm a little confused. With each passing day, will the spread's value decay by the theta amount no matter what happens with all else being equal? Also when at expiration, is the strike price the only thing that matters regardless if the IV spiked after the position was opened? For instance, say a call credit spread was opened when the underlying was at 10 IV. A few days later, IV is now at 90. If the price of underlying did not move and Vega was higher than theta, the positon would be underwater. Now say its the day of expire, the stock has not moved and IV is now 200 so the position is still massively underwater. As long as the stock is below the sold call leg of the call credit spread at expire, will this \"paper\" loss not matter since the spread will expire worthless and thus keep the maximum premium? \n\nNormally I open call credit spreads at high IV (60+) with the underlying at a resistance area with the expectation that the spread's value will decrease due to negative delta and a fall in IV (IV crush from say 80 to 50) then exit the spread with partial gains. If these two variables dont decrease the spread's value then I will hold onto it to allow theta to do its work. I do not normally hold onto a spread to reap the theta decay per day unless I know that the short call will not get \"hit\" and I am confident that it will expire worthless. This is a scenario of the strategy working correctly; to triple team the spread's value with theta, delta, and Vega decay. \n\nThe reason I asked this question is because I'm not sure how to handle the scenario when IV spikes and I am unable to sell the position for a partial gain. In this case, I am forced to hold the position to let the three greeks do its work and hopefully allow the spread to recoop some of its value or let it expire worthless (note only if the setup persists I will hold onto the spread otherwise I will just close for a loss).\n\nBut I made a mistake last week by opening up a call credit spread at low IV (not sure exactly but say IV was ~10). Here's the actual play:\n\nWhen SPX was around ~2870 last week, I opened 100x Oct 9 SPX 2950/2960 call credit spreads for 2.3 credit per contract. The play has a max gain of $23000 and max loss of $77000. Normally I would expect a drop in IV and a small drop in SPX then close for partial profit. But that's not what happened. The position went tits up. In the morning, the position's IV spiked to ~17 and delta went the wrong way so it was at -$33000. At end of day today, SPX came down and now the position is at -$9500. \n\nSo here's my question. Say SPX stayed the same and theta decay does its work per day. BUT say it comes to expiration day and IV jumps to 150 which out paces the theta decay. The position would be quite underwater, but as long as SPX is below 2950 EVEN if IV becomes super jacked, the spread would expire worthless since there is no intrinsic value and all the extrinsic value has decayed away. Also besides rolling out the credit spread, what options do I have to correct this trade? Should I hold onto it since decay is accelerating? What do you recommend?\n\nSorry for the long post but I guess my question can be summed up to this: In a call credit spread, if the underlying is below the short call at expire regardless of IV, will the max premium be collected?

Should I hold onto it since decay is accelerating? What do you recommend?  \n\nRolling the credit spread is a standard move. \nIf you're confident underlying will expire out of the money, just sit tight and wait it out.  \nYou could scale out to reduce risk, recognizing that you're taking partial losses in doing so.  \n\nYou can also roll out in time and \"away\" from at the money, a few strikes.   \nThe usual guide is to do this for a net credit (close with a debit, open with a larger credit).\n\nThere may be other moves to make that may involve delta/gamma scalping using stock, which I have not practiced. Rolling is the primary, easy, and least complicated choice. \n\nMostly, you desire to have confidence in the direction of the underlying's price through expiration, or through the moment you're willing to exit the trade.\n\n---\n\nAt Oct 7 2019\n\nNote that this is a week of potential price volatility. \n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank leaders will be speaking.   \nReference:  \nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm\n\nTrump's administration will be meeting with China trade leadership.   \nReference: \nhttps://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/daily_briefing/daily_pieces/asia_am_briefing/2019/10/07/US-Dollar-Turns-on-Support-as-US-China-Trade-News-Sours-Markets.html\n\nAnnouncements or news from both sources might send markets up or down.\n\n----", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the extremely valuable information.

{"title": "The 4 paths to become millionaire as an autist", "selftext": "So if you google paths to become millionaire, there are several articles with the same typical 4 paths, as an autist, most of them are really hard, but can we become millionaires with any of them?\n\n**1)** The Saver-Investors path\n\nBasically just start really young and do safe investments.\n\n*So, how to become millionaire as an autist with this path?* It's literally the only one doable for us, be young, live extremely frugally, get two shitty jobs that pay at least $70k per year but live with $30k or less, get an autist frugal wife and don't have kids. Invest like $40k a year in safe shit like bonds, ETFs, blue chip stock, occasionally sell puts if you want to \"buy on discount\" or sell out of the money calls, leverage your money to invest in \"safe\" real state, wait 45 years .\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2)** The Dreamers Path\n\nYou have to pursuit a dream in which more than 95% of the people fail miserably and lose everything but pays absurd amounts of money for little effort once you succeed (but requires a lot of effort to succeed). Examples of this path are becoming and actor, singer, football player, having a successful YouTube channel, doing successful start-up. For most of these, you don't have to be smart but you need to have talent PLUS you need to have an extroverted personality that \"everyone likes\", leadership, communication and networking skills, knowing the right people, etc. As an autist, you're the opposite of that and have a weird, quiet, introvert personality that no one likes and no leadership skills or any ability to interact and communicate. You could open a youtube channel but no one would really watch it.\n\n*So, how to become millionaire as an autist with this path?* Don't waste your money in \"safe\" investments that are too slow and gey, just save the $40k until you see a stonk that is about to moon and follow your dream of YOLOing it all in FDs, hope for at least 2,500% return and you'll become millionaire overnight. You get a new try every year.\n\noption 2: be billy boi gates\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3)** The Company Climbers path\n\nYou have to become some executive or CEO of a large company and have a total compensation of like $500k/yr you've worked your entire life for this one company or corporate and are now at the top. As in path 2 you also need an extroverted personality that everyone likes, leadership, communication and networking skills, knowing the right powerful people, public relation and marketing skills, etc. You can do an average job but you want to have the kind of relationship with your boss so they want to invite you to do some drugs in a strip club.\n\n*So, how to become millionaire as an autist with this path?* be born rich, be son of a successful medium-large business owner that will make you CEO when he wants to retire even if almost no one likes you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4)** The Virtuosos path\n\nYou need to be naturally a genius plus formal education and dedicate your life to become an expert in a specific area. Someone among the best in the whole world, who is almost irreplaceable. For example, successful surgeon or lawyer. To be successful in the legal field, once again you need the same likeable extrovert personality as in path 2 or 3 and knowing the right powerful people.\n\n*So, how to become millionaire as an autist with this path?* Well you could be one of the best programmers/software developers in the world. Even then, if your first interview is not technical and you're screened by a recruiter that will ask typical shitty STAR questions, they will choose some other stupid guy that they liked more for the next round of interviews, I've seen this happen in google, microsoft, facebook, amazon, tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, you just wasted your time reading a shitpost with no real useful information on how to become rich, now you can go all in in FDs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Bonus SECRET paths not shown in the articles of manipulated media (CNBC, businessinsider, moneycompulsion, etc.):\n\nThanks to [tradetofi](https://www.reddit.com/user/tradetofi/) for revealing path 5 in the comments:\n\n**5)** The failed Trader Scam Path: Just sell courses, e-books and subscriptions to \"actionable trade alerts\" until you scam enough people to collect $1M.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**6**)  1R0NYMAN's path: Box spreads are literally free money, just collect your free money every few days and trade bigger as your account's size get bigger, if your broker catches you and has to change their whole policy and operations to ban your strategy, just delete the app and switch to another broker until you collect your $1M.
