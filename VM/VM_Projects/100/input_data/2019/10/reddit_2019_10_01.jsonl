The delivery number is positive news for Tesla because it puts demand issues to rest.  There was the scare in Q1 2019 where it only posted 67K deliveries, which Musk tried to blame on logistical issues with getting the cars delivered overseas.  With Q2 deliveries being 95K, the market was re-assured, although questions still obviously remained as to whether that 95K in Q2 was helped by a backlog of orders from Q1, and just questions in general about whether that was just a one-time pop-off that could be sustained going forward.  Thus, now with Q3 posting high 90K's delivery again, that should be satisfactory to put all demand questions to rest for now.  Hence, Tesla was rewarded with a 6% pop in share price based on that leaked delivery figure.\n\nThe question now remains whether Tesla has properly executed on those ~95K quarterly deliveries and converted that into profit, which is important because as it stands their only production facility in Fremont is basically fully saturated at this point so these 95K+ quarters are representative of how much money Tesla can/can't going forward without some major shakeup such as a second factory.  In Q2, the market didn't think they executed.  Musk will have another shot at it in Q3.  Either way, as I said in another thread, there's only so much room to cut expenditures to eek out a profit this quarter.
