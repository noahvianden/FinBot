Capital Inflow to finance sizeable widening in Twin Deficits \n(2.) Federal QE Lite Federal Reserve Balance Sheet Expansion\n(3.) 2 & 3 are unhedged and favor exacerbating frothiness in risk assets and duration, so add in share buy backs and you get some volatility suppression (vs last year a lot of this reversed in October, November, and December) \n\nI think next week we should see a delayed sell off, which would make your position profitable if you were to hold into next week. We basically mean reverted to the upside today. We have moved a little more then 3% in two days from this weeks earlier sell off. We cannot move higher in perpetuity given the large spike in realized volatility, so i'm basically saying we should see another sell next week.\n\nCatalyst for next weeks sell off are end of Share Buy Back Programs as we enter earnings, delayed sell off in volatility targeting strategy on spike in realized from this past week and also there's likely not going to be significantly positive news out of China/US trade deal.  These could temporarily lead to a sell off next week. Once we get next week's sell off, I think we head much higher on all the indexes going into November and December.  In fact I will go out on a limb and say capital inflows into the US market to finance the twin deficits should drive equity valuations in the US to all time highs maybe even touching 3,100 on SPX\n\nThis is in the face of economic data, which will continue to indicate the economy is slowing and moving closer to below trend growth. It's not going to be intuitive it's going to be completely the opposite. We will see risk assets move higher, realized volatility move lower, and equities retouch all time highs.

In my case I sort of follow the Stanley Druckenmiller trade philosophy, so if I see something I like I tend to \"BET THE FARM\" and it can have this great super high profitable returns/profits, but if you are slightly wrong at anytime the DRAWDOWNS are huge. What I mean is I wait i'm patient and when I see something I like I add a crap load of leverage and I take a very large position. This was sort of my undoing in 2018. I had accounts up more then 250%, 70%, 15% all significantly out performing the market, but I'm sort of like Bill Belichick I don't take out the starters if the score is 50-0 in my favor, so psychology can work against you with these sorts of strategies, so knowing when to hold and fold is really valuable. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6LgojkA6bo - Druck on betting the farm\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJzu_xItNkY - Warren Buffet on betting the farm \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXtHYyd9kMM - Warren Buffet on Long Volatility \n\nI don't make any bones about it. I don't trade to be mediocre I create strategies to outperform and I aim for the fences, so I always preface these strategies by pointing out i'm intending to purposely create asymmetric positively skewed returns utilizing directional gamma. \n\n2.) You actually answered your own question, but I'll further clarify. Dynamic hedging whether it's stocks or bonds involves utilizing the Delta throughout the day to figure out how much of the underlying you need to sell or buy. The pace at which the market moves (let's call it volatility) can speed up or slow down the amount of activity needed to hedge the position. In normal non-technical speak the faster the market moves (more volatility) the more delta moves around, the more selling or buying of the underlying is needed to create a delta neutral position. This structural issue is what i'm attempting to exploit. What I hope happens is a lot of people buy Puts on near dated strikes in large amounts of contracts, so it exposes the banks/dealers to more strike risk and a greater need to sell greater numbers of the underlying, which will tend to speed up the pace (raise realized volatility as they seek to get delta neutral by the end of the day) \n\nThis is for any asset class you are hedging if you're attempting to create a hedge with minimum exposure to the market activity. For example one of the new factors driving down realized volatility is the Federal Reserve Warehousing Mortgaged Backed Securities on it's balance sheet. They hold a ton of negative gamma and do not use any delta hedging to reduce their exposure to interest rates. It reverberates through other asset classes suppressing realized volatility and creating a favorable environment for duration as one example", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Reiterate this final sentence \"in fact i will go out on a limb and say capital inflows into US market to finance the twin deficits should drive equity valuations in the US to all time highs maybe even touching 3100 on S&P SPX\"", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Thinking of getting calls at open tomorrow, that are your thoughts?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'd suggest the Nov 15th Puts on the SPY ATM - I feel we are likely to end the week with a sell off tomorrow.

In the strategy i posted above which relates to the last hour trading I am relying on the daily standard deviation using a points system (as opposed to percentages) where I am looking to take advantage of a 4 or 5 standard deviation move from the mean.\nFor example using the DOW typically the mean is like 80-120 points (i don't have the excel in front so this is off the top of my head), so on a day where the DOW points wise moves 4 or 5 standard deviations from the typical mean points wise, after 2pm, I am interested in putting on a position to take advantage of the increase in realized volatility. I realized after reviewing some of the questions it may have been a bit confusing.\nLet's say DOW implied vol is 14 - markets expect a 0.88% movement - Dow is currently at 25,000 (would be +/- 220 points), so we all know realized volatility is almost always substantially below, so the move is likely going to be much closer to 0.4% or 100 points - When i see the DOW move more then 450 or 500 plus points, the daily idiosyncratic risk market makers face in getting delta neutral on a sell off increases. From a points system the daily move goes into the 4 or 5 standard deviation from the typical mean of 80 to 100 points.

You can have increased orders for the Y and increased 3 sales due to Tesla opening up new markets or new models in a particular market.\n\nOf course it can. But to get sales, you need orders. Orders in new markets take months to deliver. Maybe Tesla is using Model Y numbers, maybe not. Who knows.

If they are more or less selling as fast as orders come in, order backlog will always go up if they include model Y orders.\n\nI also think sales numbers need to be looked at with the understanding that not every order is equal, and the main reason Tesla made money last year was because they only sold the highest margin cars.
