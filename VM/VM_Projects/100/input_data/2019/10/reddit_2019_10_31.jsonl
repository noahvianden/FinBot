I'm not seeing it. I can't find actual substance in the grievance of the plaintiffs, I only see drama over leadership style and personalities. Also if Kimbal needed to recuse himself from voting, why did legal counsel tell him he didn't need to? That was also mentioned in the deposition. Elon was the majority shareholder and recused himself in addition to others, Kimbal was a large shareholder in comparison to everyday retail investors but hardly the linchpin in the shareholder vote.
