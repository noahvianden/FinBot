Use lower priced stocks. Not a good idea to attempt to trade options on AMZN, which can move 100 points in one day. Also option spreads: Vertical debit spreads, vertical credit spreads, to limit risk, and the size of the risk. Use high volume options, with small bid ask spreads.  The top 50 in volume are a good place to start out; see the links above about option volume.  Bear in mind that the volume at any single strike/expiration is typically much less than one-thousandth the volume of the stock. \n\n -2. When selling an option short, the counter party is in control of when an option is exercised.  Also, if a trader holds through expiration (generally, it is best to exit an option position before expiration), options that are in the money by $0.01 are automatically exercised. \n\n -3. It's best to have a reserve, to manage adverse moves.  If one were to trade only options, it is a good idea to have in cash 50 to 65% of the account in cash compared to the amount at risk.  You can use margin (loans on your stock) to obtain cash for options; generally it is not a good idea to use leverage (margin) to buy leveraged instruments (options).   Do not be confused by the common mis-naming of required option collateral as \"margin\", it is not margin at all. \n\n -3a.  In your case, there is a conservative trade and position that does not require free cash: you can sell \"covered calls\" using the stock as collateral.  This is no more risky than your present long stock positions.  The concept is to:   \n\nA) be willing to see stock depart from your account and not be concerned about long term gains versus short terms gains on the stock;      \nB) typically sell calls at strikes above the money, in the vicinity of 40 to 25 delta, and above your stock cost basis about 30 to 45 days to expiration; though, when desiring to exit the stock, sell at the money, or slightly in the money, at delta 50 or 55, respectively;       \nC. allow stock to be called away for a gain, or cheerfully keep the premium if not called away, and repeat the process;        \nD. this strategy caps gains in large upside moves in exchange for regular monthly income from non-moves, or moderate up moves in the stock, and like holding stock, has no down-side protection. \nThere are many blog posts on covered calls that can be found about covered calls.      \n•&nbsp;Covered Calls - Project Option   (20 minutes)    \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4suNFhxepM    \n•&nbsp;The 10 Most Common Mistakes Made by Covered Call Writers - Allen Ellman - Blue Caller Investor\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv29FvMvC0o  \n•&nbsp;[Covered Calls Tutorial (Option Investor)](https://www.optioninvestor.com/page/oin/cc/tutorial/)     \nE.

It depends on the situation, the stock, the market regimes, and strategy,  and the like. Variably: same day, several days, several weeks, and several months.  Mostly two weeks to eight weeks. \n\n -6. Your stock broker platform.  The major houses are sufficient.

I call this theta-anti-decay.   The calculated theta decay in this circumstance  typically is not available to the trader, because the influence of the market participants puts a kind of floor on the option price, and may increase the price of the option, even as the stock staying the same price.  \n\nIn the imaginary world of the model describing theta rate of decay, there is a calculated daily rate of decay.   But the day by day market influence on the option price may surpassethe daily theta rate of decay, and counters it with continuing (call it daily for this example) price floor, or price increase that prevents the trader from obtaining the theta decay.   \n\nIn other words,  \nThe extrinsic value is staying the same, or going up, held up, or driven up by the market, and since the number of days remaining goes down each day, the theta rate will also go up each day, and the implied volatility will also go up, as there is continuing extrinsic value that implies there will be a price move.

The nay-sayers are saying no orbital testing until 2nd half of 2020. Musk saying 1st half. NASA has enough faith they have given them a grant to test orbital refueling. I could go on for a while concerning how fast SpaceX is moving.\n\nMusk has stated that Teslas would have no trouble being driven on Mars. He reiterated this just a few weeks ago when asked if Tesla was designing a “rover” for Mars and he answered that simply you could drive a Tesla on Mars. What better type than their pickup that he just said looks more like an APC? Not much would have to be adapted, keeping in mind the passengers can be in pressure suits. They need things like good filters, more stuff pressurized, solid tires, temp. control etc.; some of these are things they are working on anyway and some are being worked on by SpaceX and many other companies.\n\nThe design for the Tesla pickup has been something Musk has been “dreaming about” since he was young. Odds are better that “thing” is something he pictures driving on Mars, rather than taking to a monster-truck rally or a job site.\n\nIt explains Tesla’s willingness (not just a Musk flight of fancy) to break the mold of what a pickup should look like. Demand for pickups is an important part of getting to Tesla’s mission goals. A “crazy” design many people might not want (as Musk has said), looks more desirable if it is also being driven around in the most-watched videos ever seen by humanity (the live streaming from Mars.)\n\nHow the market might react to this plan, I have no idea.
