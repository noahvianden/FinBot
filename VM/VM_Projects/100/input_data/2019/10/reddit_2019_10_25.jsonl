{"title": "Sold a bunch of stocks to buy more TESLA (update)", "selftext": "Original (6 months old): https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/bgi7zp/sold_a_bunch_of_stocks_to_buy_more_tesla/\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHalf a year has passed since the post. I continued to purchase $TSLA stock throughout April and May 2019. My thesis has not changed, nor my conviction. Tesla continue to execute their plans. I am holding long-term but I wanted to provide an update, and a prediction (see further down).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust so everyone's clear: I've been acquiring Tesla stock since early 2016. It's just that 6 months ago, I found myself facepalming so hard at how much analysts, media and \"investors\" were missing or just had plain wrong. I'm an opportunistic investor. I saw opportunity but didn't have much cash so instead of buying with savings, I nuked most of my stock portfolio and bought more Tesla.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe stock is $316.73 as I type this on the back of strong Q3 results.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Results:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n|Purchased|Cost Basis|Gain/Loss|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|22-Apr-2019|$264.17|+19.90%|\n|23-Apr-2019|$262.04|+20.87%|\n|23-Apr-2019|$261.79|+20.99%|\n|24-Apr-2019|$252.63|+25.37%|\n|25-Apr-2019|$248.60|+27.41%|\n|26-Apr-2019|$234.55|+35.04%|\n|20-May-2019|$205.25|+54.32%|\n|31-May-2019|$185.41|+70.83%|\n|31-May-2019|$185.49|+70.75%|\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Predictions:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Short squeeze underway.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Q4 2019 results will be bonkers. Record everything that matters including net profit, production, deliveries, gross margins. This is so obvious it hurts.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- By Q4 2020, Giga 3 should be fully ramped, Giga Europe will be under construction, annual output over 500,000, over $5 billy in the bank.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Unless Elon drops LSD with Joe Rogan very soon, this is probably the last time we'll see the stock under $300.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Stock will continue on a bumpy, upward trajectory throughout the 2020s.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDon't buy the stock because of this post BUT if you have questions about Tesla and why I am comfortable for that one single company to make up the majority of my stock portfolio, go for it. I'll do my best to answer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo you own $TSLA?

I also expect to start seeing some sort of investor recognition that Tesla is a real candidate in the race to autonomous cars.

At the time Elon was forecasting that FSD would be feature-complete by the end of the year and the network would probably be approved 6 months later.  I knew that wasn’t going to happen that fast, but I thought, and still do think, that as soon as consumers have their hands on that (no pun intended), it’ll slap the big investors in the face a bit - like “Hey, this is happening.”  Once robotaxi equations start getting factored by the buy-side analysts at the big firms - watch out.  imo, that has the potential to shoot the stock well past $700.  Maybe over $1000.  With the network approved the stock could go to $4000; I don’t think Kathie Wood is in left field on this.\n\nAll that being said - I remember thinking to myself “What if that doesn’t happen at all?”  My contingency was that I believed that TSLA would be at my strike price even without FSD.  At the time the stock was in the low $200s, which I knew was undervalued to start with.  There was a lot of concern about demand problems and margins at the time.  Demand I wasn’t the least bit worried about, but I did think for a bit about margins.  At the time the Model 3 margin was around 19% iirc, and Elon was saying there was a lot of room for improvement, which I believed.  If nothing else through sheer economies of scale as the 3 ramped.  In addition GF3 was coming along nicely, and I knew they’d be producing cars before Q1.  I think Elon had already stated a 3k/wk run-rate.  And Fremont still had room to expand.  Then there’s the Model Y which is higher margin and there’s tons of demand for, and GF3 which would undoubtedly produce higher-margin 3s than Fremont.  I figured investors would start to worry less about margins.  Multiply that by increased production at the same time - and there’s no reason the stock wouldn’t be over $400.  It would have been at $300 already if it weren’t for Elon’s legal troubles and Q1.  Then there’s the pickup reveal, the start of Semi production, GF4, energy storage ramp, potential short squeeze, etc.  These were all items with a lot of bullish potential, and I figured any combination of a couple of those would make it easy to see $400.  So I was looking at which strikes to buy and I saw $420 and I said that’s the one for me.  Picked them up for $4.69/share avg and right now I’m so glad I did.

If macros stay strong, it could definitely shoot up a bunch more in the next few weeks.\n\nWhat if it's $400 by mid November, or $450 after delivery numbers are released start of January, would you sell (some of) these options?
