{"title": "Deliveries vs. Profits", "selftext": "I've been fiddling with my model based on the latest delivery estimates.  My conclusions are that (i) Tesla has a very good chance to break their delivery record and (ii) they are still going to lose a lot of money.\n\nMy assumptions are that Tesla sells 75,000 Model 3s in the quarter, and a combined 17.5k S and X, for total deliveries of 92.5k.  With that product mix I think ASPs will go down, particularly with the widespread introduction of the SR and SR+ in the quarter, but for purposes of my model I am assuming revenue per vehicle delivered stays flat from Q1 at $59,091.08 per vehicle.  I am also assuming that gross margins in the automotive segment increase by 564 basis points from Q1 to match that in Q3 of 2018 of 25.801%.  Again, I think that is unlikely given the lower cost variants of the Model 3 being sold, but maybe they'll have fewer cars in inventory at the end of the quarter (not sure how possible that is if they are trying to smooth deliveries) and get a bit of a boost from that.  \n\nRegarding the other segments, I'll assume gross profits in energy and storage increase by $15 million, but are slightly offset by a $5 million increase in losses from the services segment (note the losses in the services segment increased by over $50 million in Q1 as they have more vehicles on the road).  I'm assuming SG&A increases about $20 million QoQ owing to increased hiring internationally.  Finally, I'm including $25 million of restructuring costs from the last round of layoffs hitting this quarter and assuming interest expense matches the 4th quarter (even though they now have more debt than during that quarter).\n\nI am not including either ZEV credits or financing costs from their latest capital raise.  I think the first is a pure guess, and I'm too lazy to look up how they have accounted for things like the hedges they purchased in connection with the convertibles in the past.  \n\nSo anyway, I plug all of that in, and even with record sales, no decline in ASPs from Q1, and record automotive gross margins, I come up with a loss in the quarter of ~$50 million.  You are probably thinking, how is that possible?  If they are selling 10% more vehicles than Q3, with the same margins, how can they possibly be going from net income of $254 million to a loss of $50 million?  I am even assuming both SG&A and R&D will be lower than Q3.  \n\nThere are two key reasons, both of which are pretty simple.  First, the product mix keeps deteriorating.  In Q3 they had average revenue per vehicle delivered of almost $73k.  Last quarter that number was down to $59k.  Even with deliveries increasing 10% over Q3, automotive revenue will likely decline by over $500 million ($632.8 million in my model).  At a 25% gross margin, that is lost profits of $158 million.  Second is the services segment.  Additional losses there are almost $80 million higher than in Q3 in my model, and frankly I think that is only going to get worse.  The number of Tesla's on the road is increasing rapidly, and the vast majority of those vehicles are under warranty since they are so new.  In the grand scheme of things, the service business should not be a huge drag on the company, but when they are struggling to turn a profit a hit of $80 million hurts.  \n\nIn conclusion, while the May delivery estimates are certainly an improvement over April (and Q1 in general), I do not think they will be sufficient to turn a profit.  Further, if the company posts a significant loss (a few hundred million is possible if ASPs drop by just $5k per vehicle) despite posting record deliveries, I think investors will seriously begin to question what catalysts will drive profits going forward.", "id": "bx1xfm", "created_utc": 1559737336.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 121, "comments": [{"body": "A loss that small would be spectacularly good.

And CPU power makes a huge difference in productivity if you are working on a large codebase with long compile times (especially C++ which is slow to compile anyway, and in which changing a few headers can have cascading effects requiring a large chunk of the codebase to be rebuilt). A minority, but still a non-trivial fraction, of software developers take home 300k or more. Spending $10k on a machine, assuming it will last three years, is 1% of that. You might have a point if we were talking about a $400,000 DGX-2, but we're not.\n\nThe GPU is a pure waste in this case, but again, who cares? The point is not whether you could get the same performance for cheaper on Windows, it is \"my extremely highly paid developer says this is the tool he wants to use for his job. The price is not enough to matter, so whatever, let's buy it without thinking\".\n\nNot from personal experience, but from what I've heard: macOS is also very common in some creative industries (video editing for example). All the same reasoning as above probably applies. If Pixar thinks there is even an 0.01% higher chance of a movie being finished on time because they bought a few of these for employees who requested them, then it's a no-brainer. I don't actually know whether Pixar uses macOS internally but feel free to replace that with your favorite example.\n\nI think what most people are missing in these discussions is that for a lot of companies this expense just does not matter. It's sort of like how they don't care if you stay in a $200/night hotel on a work trip instead of a $30 youth hostel.
