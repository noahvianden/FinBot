Here are my counterpoints:\n\n1. Tesla is still focusing on growing, rather than profitability.  They are building out manufacturing, sales, delivery, charging, and service networks.  Growing those is more expensive than running them at some steady state.  Despite this, Tesla has had profitable quarters when their volume was high enough and has only been held back from profit in Q1 and likely Q2 because they've had to build a bunch of cars that they haven't sold because they are in transit.  Building a pipeline of 15,000 cars constantly on their way to customers costs roughly $750 million dollars and that is bound to make them look unprofitable while that buffer is built.  Once that buffer is in place and held steady, their profit margins are going to look a lot better.\n2. The at-scale profit margins for GF3 are likely to be a lot higher than for GF1 or Fremont because of the lower costs of everything in China.\n3. The demand and margins for Model 3, even if they turn out to be barely break-even, which is where I think their worst-case will land, still give them enough runway to bring the Y to market.  Regardless of the lackluster media response to the Y, it's going to be a popular and high-margin vehicle.  There are a lot of people who are very excited about the Model 3 but aren't buying one simply because they need more seats and/or greatly prefer the driving profile of an SUV.  When the Model Y test drives begin, we're going to see a shift in the narrative around that car.\n4. Most of the time when Bears want to paint Tesla as unprofitable, they exclude income from credits for some reason.  Credit income isn't going away until Tesla starts losing market share, which shows no sign of happening any time soon.  As long as they produce lots of EVs and major manufacturers aren't making or selling enough, credit income will flow.\n5. Morgan Stanley said on their investor call that everyone in the automation business thinks Tesla has a unique and valuable automation business, so I don't think it's fair to call it \"minimal\" value.  It's unproven, but nobody from Mobileye to Nvidia to Waymo thinks it lacks value.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": ">As long as they produce lots of EVs and major manufacturers aren't making or selling enough, credit income will flow.\n\nI think this is a key point many are missing, if Tesla ramp up volumes faster than other car makers and has  more attractive EVs other car makers are going find it hard to sell EVs in sufficient volume to avoid paying credits.\n\nThe other point people are missing is margins can improve overtime .. for example the base Model 3 is off menu as it is at best around a break-even proposition. Nothing to say that will be the case in 6 months, further down the tack some Model Y improvements can be incorporated in the 3 to further lower build costs.\n\nI am sure some aspects of the Model S/X refreshes are using Model 3 parts and simplified build processes to lower costs and improve margins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally I expect cost savings at cell/pack level to keep happening.. as production volumes scale and China comes  online that further helps income and margins...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I think the key point Bears are missing is they can't expect Tesla to hit problems with Tesla can't solve and it is most unlikely Tesla will run  out of cash before they can solve all the problems. Once sufficient problems are solved and scale is built, Tesla is then profitable, because by definition solving all problems means margins are acceptable. Being at scale means capital investment for expansion is funded by revenues. If Tesla keeps growing, revenues keep growing and they keep solving problems, surely this is a matter of time.,", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Elon Musk is positioning himself to be the richest man on the planet, and he's doing it so by actually doing something good for humanity instead of doing it selfishly on the back of others.
