Even if they managed to get their price point equal to ground beef by weight (which could happen with any combination of ending government subsidies and scale/tech improvements by Impossible/BYND), your standard carnivores aren't going to make a switch. \n\nPeople won't switch for price reasons anytime soon, but they *will* switch/alternate to plant-based alternatives for three reasons: health, ethics, and climate change. Health is the least compelling reason to switch to BYND, because it's really not healthier. Ethics is a quickly growing reason now that animal welfare videos go viral all the time. Climate change is also a quickly growing reason, as people are realizing that their diet is often more harmful to the environment than their commute. \n\nThere is a ton of hype about these new options and I actually don't see it dying anytime soon.

Nobody is question the size of the market for this - really the debate around market size is people debating between 'really big' and 'really fucking big'. \n\nThe real question is *much* more along the lines of 'how defensible is BYNDs intellectual property?' and 'can BYND fill the gap between demand and supply while fighting off competitors?'  BYND is a $10B company, and the *vast* majority of that valuation is based on BYND perfectly executing their growth strat for the next (say) 3-5 years.  They aren't priced for any serious fuckups and they are *definitely* not priced for the entry of competitors.   \n\nI don't cover equities, and I definitely don't get involved in hype-stocks, but I'll share what ppl on the street are talking about:  I had this convo last week - there are two other 'older' tech companies that both hit $10B (nosebleed) valuations and could be proxies for BYND - TIVO and GPRO.  Both of them were 'game changing hype-stocks' and everyone saw the obviousness of the story behind both TIVO and GPRO.  Go pull both of their charts - both of those stocks saw the exact same 'straight up and to the right' stock trajectories....before losing ~80% of their value over the next few years.  \n\nBut importantly, the 'market' for what TIVO/GPRO produce/manufacture has inarguably grown insanely - its just that neither of them were able to fight off competitors.  Nearly every hose that has cable has some sort of DVR, but not a TIVO.  Reddit/Youtube/social media is *full* of video shot with tiny/portable cameras, and video like this has changed the world - its just that relatively few of these videos are shot on actual GoPros; you can get a chinese knock-off for like 1/10th the cost that's 95% as good as the real deal.  \n\nOn the flip-side, you could look at TSLA as a first mover that's worked....so far.  The future is obviously emissionless cars globally, but the question is whether or not we will be driving electric Teslas or VW/GM/F/Nissans.  Or we could look at smartphones: AAPL & Samsung were successful in defending thier market; Palm, HTC, Motorola, RIM/Blackberry, Nokia, etc.....not so much.\n\nThe same is probably true for BYND - plant-based meat is likely to boom over the next few decades; I doubt that many really disagree with this.  And the price will certainly drop - maybe cheaper than the real thing? But the *real* question is how much of this can BYND capture - will plant-based meat become a commodity?
