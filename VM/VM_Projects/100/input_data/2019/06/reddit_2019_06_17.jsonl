First stock I bought with 2/3 of my money was Apple at $99. My other big winner was Amazon at $800. It's easy to feel like a genius when everything is going up, stay humble and know that you ALWAYS have more to learn.\n2. Constantly ask yourself questions about the businesses you buy. It may seem like the standard procedure of analyzing a business, but do it regardless. Also, WRITE DOWN ALL OF YOUR THOUGHTS. All of them. The reason for this is because it will give you an idea of how your thought process has evolved over time. When I first started, I remember my process of analysis was very simplified and not well thought out. I wish I had written my thoughts down however to show my progress. Also, it gives you something you can show other people if they ask for your thoughts. I personally try to format my thoughts into analysis papers with diagrams, graphs, and other visuals just to make it more academic but that's just me.\n3. Read. My reading list would be The Little Book that Still Beats the Market by Joel Greenblatt. Read that first, then read The Intelligent Investor. Finally and if you're up to the task, read Security Analysis.\n4. You are going to learn most when you lose money, remember that. The most important lessons I have learned were from losing money, not making it. \n\nJust remember you always have more to learn. It's fun to make money in a short period of time, but maintain that time horizon. And understand that markets do decline. Seriously. I felt way too smart to think that a dip in the market could hurt me, but holy fuck did October feel like shit.
