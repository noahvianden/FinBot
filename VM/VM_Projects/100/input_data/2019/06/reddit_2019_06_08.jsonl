Their microinverters convert the DC power produced by the solar panel to 64v AC power. The 64v AC is much safer than the usual solar panel output that can be up to 10,000 volts DC and very dangerous to solar technicians and a huge fire risk. Usually the power produced by the solar panel is sent through wires into a garage where a much larger inverter converts the power to usable voltages. The wires from the panel to the garage carry this dangerous current when the panel is producing power.\n\nThe  latest Enphase inverter that will make it to market this year will allow you to use electricity directly from the solar panel without needing a battery backup. Currently you need to have a battery backup in the case of power loss to be able to use electricity from the panels but this is a HUGE extra cost to a solar panel installation. The implications of this on third world nations like India and the entire continent of Africa will be enormous.\n\nEnphase is taking over this market. \n\nClosing price 6/8/2018 = $5.03\nClosing price 6/7/2019 = $16.36", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "I have a hard time seeing what their unique selling point is. ”Use electricity directly from the solar panel without needing battery backup” can mean many things, but this is how most installations work today. Battery backup is often the challenge, simply having solar combined with grid is easier. You never NEED batteries if you have a grid connection. And no, batteries do not neccesarily allow maintaining power in case of outage, rather they generally serve the purpose of cutting peaks.\n\nDanger is frankly a weak argument here, you should have qualified people working on these things either way. There is no reason to have 10kV on the DC side anyway, usually its less than 1kV. \n\nFinally, inverters are not the hardest part of this puzzle. If you want to invest in this area, figuring out what company has the best battery managment system is the key in my opinion.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Their TAM is huge. Every solar panel needs an inverter of some kind. Instead of having a central inverter in a household installation with a complex wiring diagram this inverter bolts onto the back of each panel and then the panels in each installation can be daisy chained together with only one set of wires going into the garage. The way that Enphase inverters are wired in an installation saves hours of labor for the installer.\n\nThe daisy chaining of panels not only saves installation time but is far superior to the current method of wiring panels together in a string which is how panels are normally wired today. In a string installation the entire string will only output the maximum power of the lowest power producing panel of that string. If a leaf or something else (dirt, bird droppings) should shade a panel, the power output of the entire string of panels will be reduced to match that shaded panel. Not so in an Enphase system. In an Enphase system, each panel operates independently.\n\nIf you currently have a solar panel installation that is tied to the grid WITHOUT having a battery backup you won't have any electricity to use if the grid goes down. The way current installations work you MUST have a battery to draw power from if you want power when the grid goes down. This can be very expensive. With Enphase's new IQ8 inverters that are to be released this year, you will be able to use electricity from the panels if the grid goes down WITHOUT having battery backup. This has huge implications for third world nations that install solar power. Third world nations are embracing solar power and are building installations everywhere. Solar panel installations are much cheaper to install to get some power to remote locations and villages because you don't have to build a massive infrastructure first. (Power plants, distribution centers and power poles)\n\nAnd finally, I guess if you don't need a battery, battery management systems don't really matter.
