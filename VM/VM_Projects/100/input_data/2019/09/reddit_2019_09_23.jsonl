The profit in a calendar resides in the long leg, and that leg is valuable to you when the IV rises, and less valuable when the IV declines. \n\nWe are in a moderately high volatility regime, with the VIX around 14 to 20 , and calendars benefit from a low volatility regime, with the vix around 12 or so.  The reason for seeking to place them when IV is low, is if you buy a calendar when the volatility is high, say VIX at 18, the calendars can suffer from implied volatility value decline when SPY goes up and the IV goes down.    If the trade is placed when the VIX is at 13, and the volatility goes up, the calendars will typically gain. \n\nThe Vega for both trades is around 30, which means for every point the Implied Volatility drops, the trade value will go down about $30.    \n\nEspecially with a position with sags in the middle of the strikes.   \n\nGavin McMaster at Options Trading IQ usually has educational things to say.  \nHere is his survey of calendars.

And you may not have to wait to near expiration. \n\nSome traders also will put on a large calendar, out of the money, two or three months out, waiting for a down move, and taking the modest gain from increased IV, and an early exit for a gain, without waiting for maturation.  \n\nAn example of such an idea at this time might be:   \nBUY +10 CALENDAR SPY 100 17 JAN 20/20 DEC 19 280 PUT @1.23 LMT\n\nFor $1,250, and ten contracts  the trade has a Vega of 90.

He really tip-toes on the lines quite often, and the tone he uses is often just slightly abrasive enough to get the other party riled up.
