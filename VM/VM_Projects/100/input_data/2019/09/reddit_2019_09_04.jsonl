BMW has a very solid business model, while Daimler is maybe a bit weaker.

They have always invested heavily in adopting new innovative features. What has changed is seen with the A class.

For the price of the taycan you can probably get a stronger ICE track car and I doubt being green is much of a factor.\n\nWe'll see. It's a nice looking car. I prefer German styling over Tesla. My guess is strong start and then mediocre ongoing demand. Maybe the cheaper models do better but Porsche has to be careful with cannibalization.
