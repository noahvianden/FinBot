The follow-up engine has been installed since 2012 in hundreds of thousands of diesel vehicles of the group - including the Golf, Tiguan or Passat. Also with different models of Audi, Skoda and Seat this engine is used.\n\n> In internal VW documents of the department of technical development of the end of 2015 is described in detail how the so-called \"cycle detection\" works on this engine. Under cycle recognition experts understand a software in the car, which recognizes whether an exhaust gas test is being carried out. Such a software was also installed on the vehicles of the first \"diesel scandal\".\n\n...\n\n> The exhaust expert Axel Friedrich, who had uncovered the first diesel scandal and was an expert in the diesel investigation committee of the Bundestag, comes after review of the VW documents to the result that even with the engine EA 288 is a defeat device. \"The vehicle detects whether it is on a test bench - only then is sufficient AdBlue injected, whereas in normal driving on the road much less AdBlue is used.\"\n\n> In fact, the VW documents also contain a \"description of the SCR dosing strategy in the cycle and outside the cycle.\" SCR stands for catalysts in which urea (AdBlue) is injected for exhaust gas purification.   \n\n> Because of possible violations in the AdBlue injection are currently under investigation by the European Commission - against VW, Daimler and BMW. According to a provisional assessment by the Commission, the manufacturers have agreed \"with the common understanding that they thereby limited the AdBlue consumption and the effectiveness of the emission control.\"\n\n...\n\n> In the procedure before the district court Wuppertal an appraiser was assigned to evaluate the engine EA 288. According to the ruling on the issue, the question is whether this model also includes \"software that detects whether the vehicle is on the test bench for driving through the new European Driving Cycle (NEDC).\"\n\n> Software with this feature is described in the technical VW documents available to SWR .

They are giving auto loans to people who can’t afford them.

We will pay off your current loan or lease today!” \n\nI have made more than $350 a week for a long time, and I have never had an auto loan for half that much, because I know I can’t afford it in addition to all my other bills and obligations.

And that’s a decent interest rate, for a used car for people with good credit. People with poor credit, would lick the sole of my shoe for a 4% interest rate. \n\nBut the auto dealers don’t care if you quit making payments and you’re using outside financing. But they should, because in the name of a sale today, they are screwing themselves out of a sale tomorrow. Tomorrow is coming eventually. How many times can you sell a car to me that I can’t afford?
