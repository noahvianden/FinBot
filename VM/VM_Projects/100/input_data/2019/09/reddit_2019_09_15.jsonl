{"title": "Recession hitting India hard, gonna get a lot worse", "selftext": "So, I just spoke to my Dad in India, he owns, runs a small scale factory there. \nHe told me a few weeks back that Indian news outlets were sending out warnings about a recession.\nToday he told me that the government has accepted that recession has come and have announced that they are looking into measures to control it. Companies have reported a drop in their revenues, sales of vehicles and biscuits(cookies) have dropped and Indian kids love biscuits.\nTo add fire to the rocket fuel, the state I used to live in(Andhra Pradesh),  has recently elected a new party. This chief minister (person who runs the state) is young, inexperienced, populist and aggressive. He suddenly announced after getting elected that all state government contracts will be nullified and put into review for corruption effective immediately, this process has obviously majorly fucked up the supply chain especially as a new capital city was being built from scratch for this state. This review process is very slow and will take years. \nThis has fucked things up majorly. Low skilled labor workers have dropped their request for wages by 30%-40%, India already has very low pay rates for labor, these people will only barely get by as they can't find work and even if they do will be paid super low wages.\nMost of India's population is either middle class or poor, so the spending acroos the country will drop big time.\nThis will be much worse for India than 2008, it didn't get hit as bad during the mortgage crisis because although the real estate market took a hit there too, most people in India have like 50% or more of their savings in black money (income,assets not reported to the govt). This softened the blow quite a lot during 2008 and India recovered quickly, but that won't be of much use this time.\n\nTLDR Recession hitting India, could easily be worse than 2008, especially to the businesses in the state of Andhra Pradesh\n\nShort Indian indexes, companies", "id": "d4fu7m", "created_utc": 1568521304.0, "score": 114, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "India is so keen on having strong stonk market that they have millions of cows and bulls wandering the street.
