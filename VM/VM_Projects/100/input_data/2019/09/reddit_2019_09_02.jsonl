It would cost more individually for each spread to enter, since the long vertical spread's debit is not in the same trade order balanced by the short vertical spread's credit, but you may be able to get in for a net credit over two trades, and having the good luck to have AMZN swing in the right direction.   \n\nThe maximum gain on the position would happen only on a pin, and usually only has something approaching (as in 5% to 15% of max) that value only in the last day or two of the position's life, and if you obtain a pin in the last 1/2 hour before expiration, you may do pretty well, with 50 to 70% of the maximum.
