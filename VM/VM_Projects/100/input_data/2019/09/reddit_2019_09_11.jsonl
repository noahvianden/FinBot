We have a lot of consulting companies who try to grab graduates as soon as possible before more traditional companies get a shot at them.

Those kids are then assigned to work for clients of those consulting companies.  They get an ok salary, but the consulting companies immediately charge between 450 an 500 euro a day for those juniors.\n\nMost of those kids remain unaware, or simply do not care, that so much money is being made on them.  But of those who become aware of it, a lot of them eventually end up going independent.  You start your own company, hire an accountant, talk to a few recruiters and you basically get to pick where you want to work if you're any good.  \n\nDay-to-day, not a lot changes: you basically work for a single client full-time.  If you want a change, you start answering calls from unknown numbers as these are 95% coming from recruiters and you get a lot of them every day.  And you basically decide what's going to happen with the money you're earning (within legal limits obviously) instead of most of it going to upper management of a consulting firm.  I was on payroll for the first 8 years of my career, and have been independent for 9 years now.  I kinda wish I would've done it sooner, though it helps to get to know the ins and outs of the industry before you make that change.\n\nSo, in this case, it's not like being an independent developer who's trying to bring his own products to market... that's a way more difficult way to go at it, though obviously it has potentially higher rewards as well.  I'm selling my time, which obviously doesn't scale as well :)\n\nEDIT: \n\n> What code do you write?\n\nI mostly work on back-ends of distributed systems... my preference is to work on parts that are sensitive to performance and scalability issues.
