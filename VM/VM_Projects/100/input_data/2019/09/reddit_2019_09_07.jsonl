Buybacks should not change theoretical price of shares.\n\nHere's how buybacks work theoretically:\n\nSay you have a company with 1 million shares of stock that have a price of 125, so 125 million total market value.  Assume the value per share is composed of 100 (company value) plus 25 cash that it plans to distribute. Also assume 10 EPS.\n\nThe company can pay a dividend and the stock will decline accordingly, so now for each share you have a share worth 100 + 25 cash.  The company is now worth 100 million dollars but shareholders have 25 million extra cash. P/E goes from 12.5 to 10.\n\nAlternatively, the company can buy back 20% of shares outstanding (200,000) at the 125 price for 25 million.  There are now 800,000 shares still trading at the 125 price.  People who wanted to cash out and sell the stock got 25mn cash while the remaining shares are still worth 100mm (just as they were in the dividend example).  Shares are still worth 125 each. EPS goes from 10 to 12.5 since there are fewer shares outstanding. P/E goes from 12.5 to 10, same as dividend example.\n\nThe act of buying back stock doesn't inherently increase the market value of a company over the long run, but it will shift return from dividends to price return (capital gains) so will have higher share prices with less shares.  They are just a more shareholder friendly (tax efficient) form of capital distribution since the people who have to pay taxes are those who wanted to sell their shares anyway.  If you look at a chart of the dividend yield over time, it has been decreasing, this is partially explained by buybacks. http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-dividend-yield/'\n\nAlthough the number of shares decrease post buyback and EPS increases, you can't keep a constant p/e immediately before and after buyback - the reason is that the company is more leveraged so should have a lower P/E.  Another way of putting this is the company is valued as it's intrinsic value (future cash flows) + distributable cash.  The intrinsic value doesn't change just because the number of shares do.\n\nBuybacks can also be seen as a way of increasing leverage (decreasing equity), and are bad only if companies underinvest in future growth prospects with good ROEs, or become too leveraged and are unable to meet short term funding needs in a stress scenario.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "He does know his shit for the most part.
