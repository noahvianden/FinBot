These things are...related.\n\nA $300k house @ 5% interest vs a $240k house at 3% interest might have *the same monthly price*.  People have higher debt *because* the interest is cheaper.\n\nIf we assume that housing prices directly will correlate to the interest rate (they won't entirely, retirees and investors often buy in cash), and people buy what they can afford monthly based on the payment...\n\nWell, house prices might fall, some people might even be under water, but average monthly costs will not change, because house mortgages are *fixed 30-year mortgages*.  The bank can't raise interest on them just because interest rates went up, so they won't default- they can still make the payments.\n\nSo I'm not actually convinced that raising interest rates will cause any homeowners to default.  I DO think it will slow housing price growth though.  And it may affect some *commercial* landlords who are on variable rate mortgages, but that might be okay.  It will weed out the low-margin landlords.\n\nAs long as interest rates are raised *very slowly* I don't see a huge problem.  It will only affect people on variable rate interest.  Credit cards are literally almost always the maximum allowed under ursury laws, so I don't think it will affect credit debt.  Auto loans are usually short term and many student loans are fixed too.

Equity research analysts are paid off of the service they give to hedge fund and asset managers. This service sometimes can be accurate picks or accurate analysis. But it is often times more about providing tidbits of information that the buyside then uses to build a mosaic on their own investment thesis.\n\nFor example, Canaccord recently met with TSLA senior management for a Fremont tour. They put out a note that was discussed a bit here. That note was incredibly short on details though. As a hedge fund that is a client of Canaccord's (ie you make trades through Canaccord), you reach out to the analyst not necessarily because you agree with his ultimate opinion of whether Tesla is a buy or not. You reach out because you want to know what information he got out of management (and note that most often the info is not material in the sense that it would move the stock, but it is a material tidbit for a complete investment thesis). Did they tell him how much capex would be needed to get above 7k per week? If not dollar amounts, did they clarify what is needed exactly? Did they talk about logistics issues in shipping to Europe? Maybe not specific delivery numbers, but did they shed light on the specific issues that may have delayed deliveries? Which countries? Etc.  Canaccord kept their note short of details so that clients had to reach out and have a call with him (which gets logged as a higher form of service than if you had just read his research report).\n\nAnd so just to reiterate, equity research analysts are paid on how they are able to **service** their buyside clients. This service can, but most often does not, come in the form of an ultimate opinion. The service is more often in the nuances, in the tidbits of information that they get. The service can also be other things - it can be in what they are hearing from other buyside investors, it can be as a sounding board for an investor to debate whether he wants to make an investment in something, or it can be in getting access to the analyst's model, which is maybe a very detailed model.\n\nThis is why JUST looking at the analyst's price target is misleading - the primary value they are getting judged off of is not the accuracy of their picks, it is in the insights that they provide and how much they are able to help buyside clients. As a buyside investor managing hundreds of millions of AUM, you need to come to the buy/hold/sell conclusion on your own.\n\nWith all that said, I wouldn't say any analyst's price target is bullshit. They do spend time in trying to come up with a price target. This won't come as a surprise though - many analysts hold very different views on where a stock is going to go. They get no credit when they are right, and they get blasted when they are wrong. And it's not even how they are primarily compensated. They're also handcuffed - there are a ton of regulations and other reasons for why you might not be able to update your target price to where you actually believe the stock could go. I'll save these for another time. \n\nAs it relates to the link that you provided, I think the reason for all these conspiracy theories comes from the fact that most people do not know how the industry works. I'd say that 95% of any investment bank itself does not even know how equity research/buyside works.  If you work in fixed income, or if you work in wealth management, you probably don't know any of these details. If you work as a stock broker, you're definitely not going to know any of this either cause you're 10 steps removed from it all. And since most people don't understand how the bank works, they're going to come up with theories about ulterior motives behind every action. Sometimes, some of those reports are right. More often, they are wrong.\n\nFor example, Tesla actually hired Goldman last year during their go private fiasco. And Goldman has been one of the most vocal \"Sell\" ratings on Tesla. Did that get reported or discussed? Not really.\n\nAdditionally, equity research analysts are often very strictly separated from banking.

They have access to expert networks over providers like GLG, which lets you talk to an expert for a high fee.

I've actually outlined all the reasons that institutional investors have advantages over retail investors on my blog here:  [https://thenonconsensus.com/about](https://thenonconsensus.com/about)\n\nIf you are trying to get at the ways that institutional investors have an unfair advantage, then yes I agree it is stacked against retail investors. But it would be extremely difficult to regulate these things, as anyone is free to start a satellite imagery business and charge more money for access to that data. Money inherently is going to give you an advantage. And to be honest, I think the regulatory system has gone a long way in at least stopping people from doing insider trading and other shady practices over the last decade or two. The stuff we're talking about now is at the fringes and is not really illegal because any one single datapoint is not a material datapoint.\n\nIf you continue to read that blog, you'll see that I am doing my best to inform people of these disadvantages, and I am trying to distill the talking points and data points that institutional investors have access to that retail investors do not. I've even created a TSLA [earnings model](https://thenonconsensus.com/tsla) and made it public for anyone to access (similar to one that institutional investors might pay thousands of dollars to access from an equity research analyst), but most retail investors will not know what to do with it.\n\nTo be completely honest, the analysis within the institutional investor world is on another level, and retail investors do not even know it. Note that the advantages are not just in their access to information; it is also in the fact that they have spent years analyzing companies and have a strong sense of accounting/finance/economics, and spend 12-14 hours a day further analyzing companies. I don't want to sound conceited, or haughty, but I also don't want to sugar coat this. The debates that institutional investors have are deep in the weeds and get at the heart of the issues that the majority of the trading volume on a company care about. They are not going to be 95% of the things that you read on a company on SeekingAlpha, written by a student that just got out of college, or some guy that manages $5M of AUM and claims to have their own fund.\n\nSo let's tie all this back to the original point.

Tesla has more existential risk than GM, IMO. \n\nTesla's bonds seem to more closely track the stock price, probably because creditors expect that at some point between now and maturity (October 2025), Tesla will have to access the equity markets to raise money in order to fund its growth and/or pay down liabilities. \n\nGiven bondholders don't participate in the upside; they're right to demand more compensation given Tesla's growth ambitions and its willingness to aggressively manage its balance sheet.\n\nIf you're remotely bullish about Tesla, its bonds are a no-brainer at an 8% yield to maturity. It may be an unpopular view here, but I'd much rather own the bonds at an 8% YTM to 2025 than own the equity until October 2025. I think the bonds will outperform the stock.
