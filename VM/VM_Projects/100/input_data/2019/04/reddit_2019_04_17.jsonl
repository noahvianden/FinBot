Mainstream Media is almost 100% dependent on clicks/views for revenue, so they have incentive to sensationalize as much as possible.  \n\nElon Musk's personality certainly doesn't help matters though.  His tendency to almost always be incorrect on time timing of goals feeds the uncertainty.  Remember that Tesla Model X was supposed to be delivered in late 2013, but that initial deliveries didn't happen until late 2015, and volume production of the X didn't happen until mid-2016.

Long story short if the stock hits $460 in the next 2 years then people will look back at Baird and say wow, they really stuck to it, what a track record.

If each charge is 50kwh on average, Tesla pockets about $5 per charge.
