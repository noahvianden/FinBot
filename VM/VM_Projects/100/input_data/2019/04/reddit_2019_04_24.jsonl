The best batteries. Best motors. Best efficiency. Best software. Best charging network. And they just keep improving year after year after year. \n\nSecondly: the competition isn’t even close, and they are failing to produce at the same quantity that Tesla is already doing. Even better, there was a report today that even VW does not expect to be producing EVs profitably until 2025 (am on mobile now, will try to update with the link later). These are the big boys that would crush Tesla, or so we’ve always been told by the shorts.\n\nAnd last, but not least: regulations. At least in the EU, buying gas or diesel cars will become more and more of a problem in the upcoming years (low emmission zones, emission taxes, etc). Say what you want about Europe, but you won’t find a place on earth where you’ll see this quantity of €50.000+ cars driving around on a daily basis, of which a large majority are company cars that get replaced every 3 to 5 years. Those companies are also getting taxed more on their fleet’s emissions as the years go by. The shorts may ignore Tesla’s efficiency benefit because ‘OMG 350 kW fast Ionity chargers’ but fleet managers will look at TCO and efficiency means lower costs, which results in more available budget to throw at the actual cars.  The luxury German brands are going to feel this the most, as they have to keep both their shareholders AND their unions happy (and more EV output means layoffs for them...)\n\nSo no, I’m not discouraged.

Then truck. Scaling energy storage/production. Then maybe even FSD. Incredible roadmap.\n\nAlso important note is that margins were much better than feared.\n\nAll the Q1 pain for S/X sales was:\n- reduced production due to drivetrain changes\n- removing 75kWh from lineup for a bit\n- orders mismatched production \n- sales pulled into Q4 due to tax credit dropping\n- waiting for refresh\n\nThe 3 pain was:\n- expanding to global deliveries\n- increased average time to get a car to a customer\n- added production complexity to handle different regions\n- ramping standard range and other production changes\n\nWhat's my point? These are all temporary issues that caused a bad quarter. #demandproblems? Nope.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Only two of those issues actually affect sales, as far as I can tell.

Model 3 deliveries (+ in transit) also followed production closely. And deliveries obviously can't surpass production (+ inventory from previous quarter). So you can't assume production didn't play a role here.\n\nDecreasing price of course increases demand and undercuts competitors. Not sure what's bad about it as long as it doesn't slam the margins too much. \n\nDemand doesn't have to be infinite for Tesla to make a lot of money. If they made 200,000 S/X a year, we all know they wouldn't sell them all. They just need to hit a sweet spot in demand. By the way they are doing pretty good against other vehicles in their classes.\n\nPeople who say Tesla has infinite demand are obviously wrong. But people who say Tesla has cripplingly small demand are also obviously wrong. So where on the spectrum are they? The numbers (when compared to similar class cars) speak for themselves especially in various countries but we don't have enough history to determine consistency in those numbers for 3. We have a longer history for S/X but we don't fully know how losing the tax credit will effect That yet. \n\nSo yeah the super-bull thesis of unlimited demand is wrong but I fully expect Tesla to find that sweet spot in demand in order to achieve the delivery numbers they are looking for. That's what I think matters. And seeing a lot of price/offering changes recently tells me that Tesla is doing just that. \n\nIf they need to start advertising then I'm sure they will. That can only improve demand. Autopilot has zero marginal cost so they have levers to pull there especially as they keep adding features.

Offering that there were reasons for the lower QoQ production just feels like a distraction from the fact that had production been at Q4 levels for the S/X, Tesla would have been out another (back of the napkin math, ~10k X ~50k [and I feel like I'm being generous with costs here, but tell me if you disagree]) $500 million, because they wouldn't have been able to sell them.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Dude, the actual results matter a lot yes, but the reasons why they got this results are way more important than the actual results if you are going to try to understand what's coming next. \n\nOtherwise you're stuck saying \"well they lost $700M this quarter so they are just gonna keep losing a ton of money\" like a complete doofus.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">but the reasons why they got this results are way more important than the actual results if you are going to try to understand what's coming next.\n\nWhich is why I don't really care about their production problems.

Let me start over.\n\n>For 2 reasons, lidar is bulky as fuck and expensive as fuck.\n\nIf I'm catching a taxi I don't care about how the taxi looks, and I also don't care about how expensive the car is. I care about how cheap my ride is, and that's about it beyond basic comfort factors.\n\nTo be slightly more charitable to your argument, lidar is getting cheaper all the time and is still vastly cheaper over time *right now* than paying a taxi driver. This feels like arguing that there's no way that McDonalds will ever put an automatic register in their restaurants because there's a large upfront cost.\n\n>Besides that it is a \"dumb\" system, it doesn't learn it just reads maps and spots near objects without knowing what they are. \n\nCameras are also a dumb system. They don't learn, they just output information based on vision. The only interpretation in Tesla's AP system happens around the CPU.\n\n>Other companies are far behind when it comes to camera based fsd driving\n\nLiterally every company that is developing FSD tech is using cameras.\n\nData you could be right on.
