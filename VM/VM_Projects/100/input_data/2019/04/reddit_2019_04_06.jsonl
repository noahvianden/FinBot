Shine a light in space and it still loses intensity over distance. If it didn't, we'd be able to see stars during the day, they would just look like pinpoint suns. \n\nDirectional antennae help this however your phone doesn't have the option of using directional antennae. Your speed calculation assumes a constant vacuum however near earth orbit mean most of the signal will actually be travelling through the atmosphere. Still might be better than other mediums like fibre optics however it's hardly a vacuum and you can't use c for your calculations. \n\nWeather is a major problem. Having worked on boats. Even using larger gyroscopic ally stabilized antennae (much larger power output than your phone could do pointed straight at the satellite) there were still plenty of times storms could disrupt communication. Granted the most often cases were when the gyroscopes couldn't keep up with the ship's movement, however there were times in port when we were stable and signal loss was just a consequence of interference. With the drastically reduced power output your phone will have, this would be a real concern. \n\nCities and dense buildings will be just as much a problem as conventional land based services however the only way to get around this is additional antennae. Space based systems don't have the option of throwing up an additional transceiver in problem areas though like they can do in cities. It's cheap to throw a few extra antennae up in the mall and other dense areas that lose signal. Major cities are not going to be served nearly as well as the current means. \n \nLEO constellation systems will be able to improve on latency but there are still going to be major drawbacks. It's far from superior in every way, but added to our current system will add drastic improvements. What you will see is better rural coverage and possibly hybrid systems where cities are served by local antennae and hardwired points and you switch to LEO as you drive out of the city.
