I ran the numbers over in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/bath90/model_3_inventory/\n\nEdit: since the mods deleted my post for some reason, here it is:\n\n\n> I am a little peeved the company has stopped breaking out the number of vehicles in transit by model as they have done in the past. That piece of information is necessary to calculate the number of vehicles the company has produced and put into true inventory (i.e. the car does not have a buyer yet). For example, in the 4th quarter of 2017, Tesla produced 22,140 Model S/X, delivered 28,425 Model S/X, and reduced the number of Model S/X in transit from 4,820 at the end of Q3 to 2,520 at the end of Q4. We can then calculate the change in number of S/X in inventory as 22,140 - 28,425 - (2,520 - 4,820) = -3,985. This makes sense, as Tesla produces more Model S/X than they sell in the first half of the year (building up inventory), then sell more than they produce in the second half of the year (drawing that inventory down). We can then sum across periods to conclude, for example, that in 2018 Tesla increased inventory in S/X by 2,725 vehicles.\n\n> By running the same figures for the Model 3 since the car was first sold in the third quarter of 2017, we find that as of the end of 2018 Tesla had put 6,833 Model 3s in inventory. This number can be easily verified by taking the total number of Model 3s produced (155,662) and subtracting the number delivered (147,819) and number in transit (1,010).\n\n> But now that Tesla is lumping all vehicles in transit into one figure (10,600 at the end of Q1), we can no longer calculate the number of each model type being added into inventory. All we can deduce is that in Q1 6,407 vehicles were added to inventory (77,100 vehicles produced minus 63,000 delivered, minus 7,693 increase in vehicles in transit). If Tesla is following seasonal trends we can assume Model S/X inventory increased - it increased by 2,218 in 1Q17 and 1,373 in 1Q18. But the exact figure matters in determining how many Model 3s went into inventory, which should shed some insight into demand. For example, if 2,000 Model S/X were in transit at the end of Q1, Model 3s in inventory would have increased by 4,460 in the quarter, bringing the total number in inventory up to 11,293. If, however, 4,000 Model S/X were in transit, the total number of Model 3s in inventory would instead be 13,293. Note that the minimum possible number of Model 3s in inventory would be 9,293, which assumes there was not a single Model S/X in transit at the end of Q1.\nGiven how important the inventory build is to the demand picture, I would hope that Tesla would continue reporting vehicles in transit by model type as they have done historically. Obscuring such data is not helpful to investors.\n\n", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "No, those are in transit.
