As far as the additional storage is concerned, we basically need an up-sell to support the vehicle production as well as to full power on Powerpack. Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all of the lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for Model 3 as opposed to Powerpack. So we are essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to continue some level of production on the Powerpack. This year, we think that we will be able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs like current, J.B., like what do you guys think?\n\nJ.B. Straubel\n\n> Yes, between 5% and 10%, something like that.\n\nElon Musk\n\n> Yes. So, there are [indiscernible] in a Powerwall in the car so that translates to a – quite a decent number of Powerwalls. And then we will continue to use cells from variety of suppliers around the world. The Powerwall Powerpack, because I don’t have to go through vehicle [indiscernible] are much more adaptable to using variety of cells from other cell providers. So, we expect that Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year maybe on the order of 300% or some quite high number. Sorry, sorry. Yes, 300, confirming it, 300%.

For example, in the North American Midwest, winter temperatures can easily reach -20 to -30 C, which will reduce rated range by 40-50%.  A Tesla with EPA range of 310-320 miles can be reduced to 155-160 miles of range in severe cold.

I derived ASPs for each of the variants by assuming that customer choice in paint color, interior color, wheel type, and FSD, would amount to about 1000 $US above base price for each car.\n\n30% SR+ @ ASP of 40,500\n\n60% LR AWD @ ASP of 50,500\n\n10% LR AWD Performance @ ASP of 60,500\n\nThis results in an overall ASP of 48,500 $US.  If Tesla is already getting a 20% gross margin on a similar mix of cars when production is about 5k/week, they may have substantial opportunity to reach the targeted 25% GM as the manufacturing process improves and economies of scale get better (assuming that Tesla can expand to 7k/week production at Fremont).", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">with the majority of our orders being for long-range variants of Model 3.\n\nthis is the line I heard that I feel didn't get enough play.

But the lil guys can do no wrong so he's back in soon after!\n\nFeb 19-25: T.L.K.A.J spends time handing out good advice on [r/pennystocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks). \n\nFeb 26: T.L.K.A.J brags about dat SHMP and the upcoming harvest report.

But not to fear, the harvest report will provide \"logic and reason\" to the penny-stock shrimp-catchin' market\n\nFeb 27: T.L.K.A.J demands that the internet release the SHMP harvest report. \n\nMar 3: The harvest report came and nothing happened! In an illiquid penny stock! What?! How?! \n\nMar 4: T.L.K.A.J is calling SHMP a criminal scam.\n\nMar 5: T.L.K.A.J posts about another penny stock, cautioning his colleagues that \"huge news\" might not always result in price movements. Joco almost (ALMOST!) achieves a moment of self-awareness\n\nMar 14-15: T.L.K.A.J goes balls deep in ADBE and TSLA.

He's back to a good starting point if we don't count his student loans or cash advance as debt. Truly the trader of our time.\n\nMar 17-31: T.L.K.A.J makes back an astonishing 50% of what he started with. He has officially earned the title of professional analyst and is spewing advice on WSB from both ends!!! Net value of over $7,000 not counting a $5000 cash advance and neglecting to say we started with $15k.\n\nApr 1-25: T.L.K.A.J \"accidentally bought DIS puts after posting about how DIS was going down. After DIS goes up T.L.K.A.K reveals his long con: He meant to buy calls, but the pesky app changed it on him. It all happened so fast.\n\nApr 26-28: T.L.K.A.J doubles down that he is a good investor.
