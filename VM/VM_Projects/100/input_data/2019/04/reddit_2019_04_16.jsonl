{"title": "QCOM Vs. AAPL settlement. How I lost the opportunity to make $50,000 on a very stupid decision", "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just needed a place to vent, because I just made the most stupid decision in my life, and I can't really justify it to myself or anyone that I know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack in February, I decided that QCOMs case vs AAPL was putting a lot of pressure on the QCOMs stock price and realized that the options are very cheap considering the opportunity for a favorable outcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought 75 April 18 call options with a strike price of 65 for $0.10 each, and till yesterday night I was still holding them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI live in Australia, so I am mostly sleeping during US trading hours. Yesterday, however, I woke up at 4 am and decided to put a limit sell order of $0.06 on my options to salvage my losses given that only 2 days are remaining till expiry, and went back to sleep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wake up at 7 am to go to work, and see the news and realize that my options would have been worth a small fortune and the contract is being traded at $6 each which would have realized a 6000% return for me in 2 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong story short, I lost the opportunity to make $50,000 just because I made a very stupid decision when I woke up at 4 AM! I feel so disgusted with myself and I dont know what to do to feel better. I got everything right but screwed up at the last minute. I feel so angry with myself and having a mental breakdown, and I needed to let someone know what happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do I live myself and go on with my life after that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of those who offered support and understanding of the situation. I truly understand my mistake, and I know I failed because I never really had a risk and an action plan. It was never about trading for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started following QCOM back in 2016 and I knew almost everything about the lawsuits and the risks facing the company. In January and February, when the stock fell to the 50s, I started building my thesis and realized the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTelecom Companies started tolling 5G networks.\n\nPhone manufacturers are introducing 5G phones in 2019.\n\nHuwaei and Qualcomm are the global leaders in 5G modems.\n\nIntel is far behind in 5G technology and the sole supplier for AAPL modems.\n\nAAPL cannot really introduce a 5G phone in 2019 if they don't settle with Qualcomm early in the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiven the above, I was almost certain that the settlement will happen, and when I looked into options I knew the risk/return were exceptional so I decided to take a small position. Unfortunately for me, I got the timing just wrong because I haven't planned on rerolling my options and I took action at a time when I wasn't really aware of the complete consequences of selling my position. When I think about it now, I know how stupid that was, just because the option was trading at 0.03 when I put my limit order, and the only reason my order will be executed at 0.06 will be favorable news. If I analyzed that more at the time, I would have realized that putting the order is the worst possible decision. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA hard lesson for sure..", "id": "be0glg", "created_utc": 1555455592.0, "score": 370, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "I bought a bunch of Disney share about a year ago for $95 and sold them about 1 and a half weeks ago to buy \"Teva\". \n\nI thought that everyone knew that Disney were going to release a top quality streaming service with the capital to drive out competitors.

That leaves about 1b of cash reduction. There are no bond payments in 2020. Tesla has around 10b of debt. After this year that will be reduced to around 9b. \n\nThe question is what do we expect for 2020? Assuming they hit around 30b of revenue this year, next year should be 40b conservatively, maybe 45b. This would imply around 4b of cash flow from operations. This would imply 1b of FCF in 2020. They have 1.5b due in 2021, 1b due in 2022 and 1.8b due in 2025. In effect Tesla needs to generate \\~1B of FCF per year for the next 6 years to cover their debt repayments. If they budget 3b of capex, that means they need 4b op cash flow. They already generate \\~700m per quarter solely from depreciation and stock-based comp addbacks. So they only need \\~300m more per quarter of cash flow from operations ontop of those two adjustments to reach 1b per quarter rate and 4b per year rate. They don't need to be profitable to pay their debts back over the next 6 years. They just need to break even. \n\nIs it likely that in 2022 Tesla will only be making 4b OCF and 1b FCF? I'm expecting their revenue to be around \\~100b in 2022. Applying even a 10% ratio we get 10b OCF and \\~7b FCF (assuming fixed 3b capex, this will likely increase). Once Tesla grows to above 60b in revenue the debt load becomes dramatically less. \n\nIf I'm sitting in Elon's position and I'm pretty confident we can run the company for 5 years at break even and keep the revenue growing nicely, I wouldn't raise either. Tesla could run the company at 30b revenue break-even profit per year for 5 years and still they could service their debts. Also, after this year's debt payments their leverage has already been reduced by \\~10% in one year. \n\nI'll give you another example/trend. 2017 Tesla had 12b of revenue and 2b of losses, 2018 Tesla had 22b of revenue and 1b of losses. In 2017 Tesla's FCF was -3.5B, in 2018 Tesla's FCF was \\~-300m. 2019 should be 28b revenue, $0 of losses, and $1b of FCF.

Deposits I‚Äôd say there are similar levels of customers compared to Q3/4 who are buying already having a deposit. Warranty expenditures are also most likely to be less now than in Q3/4.
