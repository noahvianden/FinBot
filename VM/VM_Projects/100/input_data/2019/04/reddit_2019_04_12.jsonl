Announced in November 1993, the park was to have been dedicated to the history of the United States and was scheduled to open by 1998 with a $650 million (equivalent to $1.02 billion in 2018) planned budget. Amid opposition from citizen's groups, however, the project was canceled in September 1994.The concept was revived in 1997 as a potential re-theming of Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California, when the Knott family offered its amusement park for sale. However, the Knott family refused to sell its park to Disney, largely due to concerns over what Disney would do to the property, and the project was canceled again.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "You think that would have been more affordable than Disney World?

The cars bought today can genuinely appreciate in value if they reach Autonomy first and they have some level, i.e. 2-3 years, where there is no material competition.\n\nThere are more than 1 billion cars on the road now and even if Tesla sells 15 million cars over the next 10 years that still is only 1.5% of the fleet. That leaves a lot of runway of cars to be sold into the fleet.\n\nThe human cost to run a taxi per year is around 100k, 3 shifts of 35k per person. The autonomous Model 3 could completely defray that expenditure per year. If you have a car that costs 45k, and now earns you 100k more than the competing human driven solution, how much is that asset worth? Well, it depends what price you can charge for the autonomous Tesla per mile, i.e. how much of that 100k in price saving compared to the taxi is competed away. Let's say Tesla can charge only 30% of that 100k on top of the costs of running the car. That is 30k per year of extra net income produced by one Tesla car. Assuming a 3-4 year useful life of the car, what is the present value of 30k per year for 4 years. Probably something like 60-80k adjusting for risk factors. That means a 45k Model 3 bought on the day of autonomy is worth something like 100k+.\n\nThis only turns out if the assumptions are correct. But it is possible for the car to be an appreciating asset.\n\nSo the question is why would Tesla sell a Model 3 for 45k if the market price is 100k? Well, right now they aren't autonomous so the market value is lower, however, if Autonomy is reached, the market value of current cars will go up by some amount. I think this is really his point. Right now you are getting a discount because of the unknown, however, if Tesla solves autonomy there will be an appreciation in the value of the car.\n\nThe better the solution, and the more monopoly power Tesla has the more the Model 3 goes up in value. Once they hit autonomy and are selling these cars, either they sell FSD for 20-40k a pop and capture a large amount of the value upfront, or they sell them for 45k and then take a large % of the revenue generated on the Tesla network as a fee, i.e. Apple store takes 30%.

It’s an entirely separate issue to squeeze that performance into a mobile form factor for a low cost; and that seems like Tesla’s main advantage.\n\nThis is why I think Elon is so confident regarding FSD; their bottleneck has been hardware, not software, for a while. With all their training data and intervention data, in simulation they already can see statistical improvements compared to human drivers, but could not deploy this software because it would not fit on the hw2 compute module.\n\nI think they will push FSD NN to HW3 computers later this year, but still requiring driver awareness like today’s AP. Then they will be able to collect data and refine the performance until interventions and accident rates reach nearly zero , and they can give all that data to regulators to prove it works.
