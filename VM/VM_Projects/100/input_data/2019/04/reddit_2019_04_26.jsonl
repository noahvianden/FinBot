Now all the unsafe drivers stay with their current insurance and their premiums slowly go up, up, and away. Kind of a classic adverse selection problem.\n\nLet's say 100 Tesla drivers currently pay $100/mo each at various insurers.

The remaining 80 stay where they are and their premiums jump to $112.50/mo.\n\nNow the choice is to pay $112.50/mo or sign up with Tesla insurance and commit to driving your Tesla like it's a cheap economy car to score a $50/mo rate.\n\n>The second argument would be that autopilot or electric vehicles by fact of no engine in front is intrinsically safer than ICE, but insurance companies are dumb and slow to adapt. I'm a bit dubious about this as a good reason to go into insurance because even true in short term it's not a long term reason.\n\nWell, the thing is that's only a fraction of the expected losses in car insurance.

Despite their amusing story claiming all of the drop was merely due to delivery logistics, it seems that in fact their demand has significantly weakened. They seem to have burnt through what was pent-up for the Model 3.\n\nThe S&X had better margins than the 3, obviously (unless one actually believes the numbers put out by TSLA in which case go ahead and buy the dip), and those sales were hurt the most.\n\nThey showed ~$2.2 billion in cash at end of Q1. On their current course they can burn very roughly $500 million per quarter quite easily, but they also have the cash conversion cycle working against them from the volume decline and they had negative net working capital already.\n\nDebt is tapped out. They managed to get another $500 million on their ABL which helped to save them this quarter but I don't see a whole lot more of that coming. I'm skeptical a convertible could be floated, but maybe if it was crazy dilutive.\n\nSo the question, as it always has been, is equity. Why they haven't raised already is the ultimate question of the stock. My guess has been a combination of weak demand and Musk rejecting giving any discount. That's only going to be worse now with the stock price so low.\n\nAnd they need to raise a lot. I think $5 billion would be about the lowest that would be reasonable to keep them operating as well as leave enough for a reasonable growth story.

The full self driving / robotaxi claims are not credible on the timeframe Musk is projecting (and portions are not credible ever) and with the slashed R&D to boot.\n\nIt's still a longshot, but I think there's a reasonable chance TSLA does manage to go bankrupt yet this year and give me a large payout.

TSM which makes most of AMDs chips presented a bullish forecast for 7nm chips which should mean AMD is stealing market share from intel and their GPUs are going to be used by Google and Microsofts new cloud gaming services which are supposed to debut this year. AWS is also partnered with AMD and clearly Intel and NVIDIA are losing share which to me makes AMD at least a 60-80 billion dollar company which is 2-3x what its worth today.\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AMD/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AMD/institutional-ownership/)\n\nThat's a look at institutional ownership of AMD which is slowly trending up.

Literally the biggest movie in theatre history. It is 3 hours long, and concessions surely make a fortune for them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey're also going to increase # of A-List subscribers (subscription service that launched last year) because of all of this extra foot traffic, which is already way above expectations.

You're acting as if the limitation on Tesla revenue is supply when in actuality it's demand. Tesla can't sell every car it makes, that's why it dropped prices three times and why it ended the quarter with **four billion** in inventory.\n\nSecond, they don't actually have a lot of vehicles in transit. Sales numbers from some countries in Europe have already come in, and it's extremely ugly. Model 3 sales **fell 82%** in Norway and 76% in The Netherlands. Tesla may be trying to push water through the hose, but the customers at the end aren't there any more. \n\nYou expect profit of 500m-1b? Based on what? Your water hose analogy? Tesla couldn't make that much in profit despite stockpiling carbon credits and pulling all high profit margin high end trims forward. Next quarter is going to be worse than this quarter. US sales will be flat and EU/China sales will fall off a cliff just like they did in Norway.\n\n> (Excluding china business where they will run a loss on construction ofc) \n\nThis is shows you don't even understand how a business financial statement is compiled. The headline profit/loss only counts money from **operations**, building a new factory is not an expense that gets factored in. When a business builds a new factory or buys a new piece of equipment, it adds the cost of the factory to the liabilities column(because it's usually financed) and simultaneously adds it to the assets column(because the factory is worth what they paid for it). This does not affect quarterly or annual operating profit/loss at all.\n\n> Tesla finally started properly delivering outside usa.. but it probably takes 1-2 months to get cars from their factory to customer there (ships,customs etc) It led to them basically missing 1 month of sales while the pipes are being filled but it wont be that way next q.  \nAlso they will optomise these routes to be less expensive once their supply chain figures out what the fuck its doing. \n\nNext quarter sales in EU and China will be lower than this quarter. We've already seen massive drops in sales in Norway and Netherlands(which got the first European allocations). Your water hose/lemon stand analogy relies on Tesla being production constrained, when in reality Tesla is now demand constrained. There aren't enough buyers to buy all the cars Tesla produces.

The other is buying put options or puts. Put options give the holder the right to sell a security at a certain price within a specific time frame. Going long on puts, as traders say, is also a bet that prices will fall, but the strategy works differently.\n\n>Say Liquid Trading Co. still believes Humbucker stock is headed for a fall, but it opts to buy 100 $110 Humbucker puts instead. To do so, the Liquid group must put up the $11,000 ($110 x 100) in cash for the option. Liquid now has the right to force Paper, who is on the other side of the deal, to buy the stock at this price – even if Humbucker shares drop to Liquid's projected $50 a share. If they do, Liquid has made a tidy profit – $6,000.\n\n>In a way, it's achieving the same goal, just through the opposite route. Of course, the long put does require that Liquid shell out funds upfront.

Options are financial contracts that derive their value from a specific underlying stock.  There are two types, 'calls' and 'puts'.\n\nA 'call' option is a contract that entitles the buyer to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at a specific price (strike price) by a specific (expiration) date.  After the expiration date, the contract goes poof into thin air and disappears.\n\nAn option costs money to buy, and the price of the contract depends on two things, 'intrinsic' and 'extrinsic' (or time) value.  Intrinsic value is easy to calculate, it's just the amount you would make if you exercised your right to buy the shares right now.  Intrinsic value defines the 'moneyness' of an option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* In the money (ITM) = the call option strike is below the stock price (has intrinsic value).  The farther below the strike is, the more ITM it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* At the money (ATM) = the call option strike is either very very close or equal to the stock price (but still has 0 intrinsic value)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Out of the money (OTM) = the call option strike is above the stock price (no intrinsic value). The farther above the stock price the strike is, the more OTM it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's say you are holding a call option for a stock that is currently trading at $50, and your contract gives you the right to buy 100 shares at a strike price of $45 per share.  On a per share basis, you would be able to buy shares for $45 and sell for $50.  Therefore, you would make $5 per share on 100 shares ($500).  This potential profit is the intrinsic value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore, your call must be worth at least $5 per share (or $500).  The price of an option is listed on a per share basis, and the vast majority of options are for 100 shares. So whenever you see the price of an option in an option chain (list of all the different strikes/expiration dates), just multiply the number by 100 to know how much money it costs.\n\nExtrinsic (time) value is more tricky.  It's described by complicated math (stochastic/partial differential equations).  In a nutshell extrinsic value depends on how likely it is that the option will have some intrinsic value by the expiration date.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The farther out an expiration date is, the more 'time' value the option has, because there is more time for it to become profitable by expiration.  So an option with an expiration of one week will be vastly cheaper than an option that expires in a year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The closer the strike price is to the current stock price, the more it will be worth, because the stock doesn't have to move as far for the option to gain some intrinsic value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Here's where it gets tricky.  The last component to extrinsic value is called 'implied volatility.'  To really understand what implied volatility really is can take some time and some mathematical knowledge.  IV is given as a percentage and it basically is the distance the stock is expected to move (up or down). (edit) theoretically the price of the option depends on IV, but in practice IV depends on the option's price. (/edit) Weird.  The more IV an option has, the more extrinsic value it has.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, OP basically bought very cheap calls that were very close to expiration, very far away from the stock price, and very likely to expire worthless.

So you flip the equation around and use price as an input to calculate the required volatility for that current price.  So volatility is price.

There is a reason some CBOE market makers would refer to the price of an option by its IV.
