So Raven is scratching the top, this indicates that more new features are coming to the S and X. I think new battery technology makes the most sense. Two more things would be new motors and new batteries. With the same chemistry as the 3 and more efficient motors, Tesla could push the range of the S and X to 400 miles maybe. That would be a nice \"one more thing to add to the event\".\n\nThe actual event, the \"Tesla Autonomy Investor Day\" is the biggest puzzle for me. Elon said that they will be feature complete with their self driving software later this year. This means that right now, they cannot launch anything yet. Not even a geofenced implementation of the Tesla Network. \n\n> On April 22, Investor Autonomy Day, Tesla will free investors from the tyranny of having to drive their own car \n\n [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1117096350301085697](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1117096350301085697) \n\nThe event is clearly aimed at investors, he mentions them instead of customers.

Musk is been holding the FSD stick and carrot in front of our faces since 2015, people will not be impressed by a demo, everyone can do demos these days. If this will just be a tripling down on FSD promises, I don't think the markets will react much.\n\nWill this include a creative way of raising cash without diluting the stock? If so, why didn't they raise when it was at $380?\n\nThe other thing that is concerning to me is all the talk about appreciating assets. They seems to be pushing the narrative that the cars will go up in value. Perhaps they are selling the SR+ cars at low/negative margin and will use this as an excuse that future FSD profitability will be priced in. This would effectively be betting the company on FSD, which would not sit well with many.\n\nIs there anything that I missed?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "400 miles is 643.74 km", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "> The event is clearly aimed at investors, he mentions them instead of customers.

It appears to me from all angles that investing exists only as a way for people who already have money to make more money for simply having money. It traps people who don't have money by telling them that unless they can convince some benevolent rich person to fund their ideas they are worthless and their ideas are worthless. The entire system exists as a way to prevent people without money from becoming people with money by forcing them to sell ownership of their ideas to other people.   \n\nIt's actually worse where this system doesn't exists, or exists with a lower capacity. For example people in many Asian countries are very cautious with their money and very risk averse. Wealthy people with lots of money are afraid of losing money, so they buy Gold, put their money in the bank, and very few invest in new business. Young people with great innovative ideas want to sell, wish to sell their idea but there are no buyer, no moneyowner want to part with their money.   \nWhat I want to say is this system exists because it's a net positive for a society/ a country.
