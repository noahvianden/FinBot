Great point, and it raises a question about “growth”.\n\nYou can make a case for the auto business, that Q1 was just an air pocket.

If Tesla achieved Q3 style profits for a year, they’d be fine.\n\nTesla needs to make roughly 350,000 cars to meet supplier agreements.

Take T row for example, they fully dropped Tesla from its growth fund. This issue is less if Tesla can be profitable, it’s can Tesla grow fast enough to satisfy its huge evaluation. If Tesla was trading at a lower price, we would even be arguing. But what’s a growth stock, that can’t expand in the short term?\n\nIt’s not so much a problem with Tesla, as it is with how the equity is priced. If Tesla slows down to become profitable, the narrative is dead. But Tesla is having to balance cash flow, and growth. \n\nIt’s getting harder to make the case they can do both.

Even with 50% previous take rates as an estimate it's only a 16% increase in sales, but possible loss of sales due to higher prices.\n\nSo why do this? Tesla wants the data. They want people using AP as much as possible, all the time and they will eat the couple million in profits now for the data. The move to make it cheaper wasn't for profit, but data.\n\n2) The removal of the LR RWD Model 3 -- their longest range Model 3, most efficient and it's gone. Why? because GF1 isn't up to full 2170 cell capacity and they need to free up more cells so they can sell more SR+'s with AP. Each 2 LR RWD they don't sell is 3 SR+ models they can sell now, so it makes sense to allow them to up capacity. \n\nIt also might be to make room for enough surplus to service the S&X refresh demand and upgrade them to the new cells. Once capacity is full, I think we will see the LR RWD come back to the mix.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "1) I just think they didn't want tons of people buying their lowest margin Model 3 without Autopilot.

Let's say the new take rate was 50%, this new  rate only gets them 16% more profit compared to before. but possibly looses them sales.\n\n> The LR AWD gets better margins\n\nWe always knew this, the motor is the only difference and it's cost is less than $1,000, so most suspect it gave them an extra $1,000 to $1,500 in pure profit over a RWD version depending on the price difference.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "See my post above, I’d make the claim the AWD gets worse margins.

Someone remind me why anyone takes ARK's takes seriously?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This \"analysis\" seems to spend more time looking for the \"right\" answer (Model 3 is cheaper) than analyzing the numbers.\n\nFor example, look at how they [calculate maintenance costs for the Model 3](https://i.imgur.com/riJk1c2.png). They took the per mile maintenance estimate for the Camry, subtracted a penny, multiplied by 35%, then added a penny back. \n\nWhy? Who knows. The assumptions about Camry maintenance were made using some [AAA pamphlet](https://exchange.aaa.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/18-0090_2018-Your-Driving-Costs-Brochure_FNL-Lo-5-2.pdf) that said 7.25 cents/mile for compact sedans, so it's not like they put any real thought into that number in the first place. Every honest person would tell you that maintenance costs on a Camry are significantly lower than the average car, but ARK is happy to say it's just \"average\" because it helps their case.\n\nNow, how about insurance? Well, they claim to use Edmunds for insurance costs for the Model 3, except Edmunds TCO doesn't have the Model 3 yet ([here, go look!](https://www.edmunds.com/tco.html\n)). I tried to back into their numbers, and it looks like they took the insurance cost for S or X and assumed it would scale proportionately to the Model 3 based on MSRP.\n\nSo, for example, if a $100K Model S cost $1,000/yr to insure, a $35K Model 3 would cost $350/yr to insure. That's a patently stupid assumption, since that's not how car insurance works. A lot of the price of car insurance has to do with *other people's cars* you might hit, which does not change based on the value of *your* car.\n\nFinally, they used the price of the MR car, but after that they only refer to it as the LR car. So who really knows what they did?\n\nThis is amateur hour financial analysis at its best.

Here, the maximum loss is the amount of difference between the premium *paid* on the lower call, and the premium *recieved* on the higher strike.

Maximum profit is generally achieved when the price of the underlying goes above the higher strike (intrinsically at least, not accounting for vega, theta, or rho changes).\n\nA credit vertical call is sort of the opposite, in that it's the otherside of the debit transaction (you're selling someone the same spread you'd have bought in the above example). You'd buy a higher strike, and sell a lower one. Here, the max profit is the difference between the premiums, and the max loss is the difference between the strike prices times 100. A 55-50 credit vertical call, with premiums of 1 and 1.5 respectively, would have a maximum gain of 50 dollars, and a maximum loss of 500 dollars.
