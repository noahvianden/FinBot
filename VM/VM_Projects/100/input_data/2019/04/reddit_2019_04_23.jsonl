Negative cashflow doesn't necessarily mean that the firm is in a trouble. All these accounting valuations are a weak indicator of company that utilizes intangible assets. Tesla isn't a normal car manufacture company. This company is half tangible asset based and half intangible based. It's a hybrid company, don't just calculate the company as if this was some real estate deal.\n2. Tesla still have enough resources to raise money if they want to. One bank not letting a company loan money is nothing. At the end of the day, Tesla is expanding and growing. I am assuming you wouldn't have invested in Amazon during the early days because they were pretty much insolvent...?\n3. Not sure about dumping their own stock like crazy, that's like nothing compared to how much shares are out there. lol. Of course, the face value of shares sold is going to be higher since Tesla's stock price have went up dramatically within the last \\~10 years. Many executives usually sign a 2\\~5 year contracts where their stock options are accumulated and they can cash out at the end of their contract. This doesn't necessarily mean that they don't work for the company or they are about to quit. Many executives can cash out at the end of their contract term and still continue to work and sign another stock option contract, work for another 2\\~5 years just to cash out.

Full disclosure: I have a medium sized short position on Tesla since January (planning to keep it up until the company is in the ground actually), so I am not a fully neutral bystander.\n\n1. It actually does in regards to how overleveraged the company is. Make no mistake, the investors day recently was only there to funnel more money out of peoples pockets, because as it stands their current cashflow does not allow them to pay back loans and bonds due in summer, let alone the one eoy. Even the GF3 deposit was eaten up instantly and seemingly isnt avaiable anymore for upcoming bond and payroll payments. capital expenditure were seemingly cut completely for now, simply because there is literally no money left.\n\nIf you actually believe this company isnt a financial, mismanaged mess, I dont know.. I honestly dont, By those standards there would probably not exist a single, financially in trouble company out there.\n\nThe bit about (in)tangible assets is just nonsense honestly. Legacy carmakers hold way more intangible assets, while also being healthy in cashflow and other tangible assets. I honestly dont even know why you would assume that legacy carmakers have less?! Its not a hybrid company, its a mismanaged company.\n\nThere is a reason Elon has just effectively canceled 4 new product lines (which he promised shareholders before, since they were supposed to expand on Teslas marketshare), and the Panasonic/Tesla project in China is somewhere between canceled and \"on thin ice\". \n\n2 . Well that remains to be seen. If one of the bigger banks cancels on a previously done deal, therefore effectively stating they fear for the companies ability to pay back the loan, its usually not exactly a great sign. Of course Elon can always hustle some more in China: Like I said, where the money is coming from remains to be seen, if its coming. \n\nAlso: I dont know what Amazon has to do with this. I am obviously not making an argument against a growth oriented company thats losing money in its early days (have plenty of those in my portfolio), I am making an argument against a company that is severely mismanaged, while also already showing signs of stagnation (See last Q nrs, next Q will probably be even worse)\n\n3 . Again, I am not making a big deal about insider trades (selling, especially), but about the fact that prominent higher up executives and outspoken believers have recently reduced their position by 95%.

If so, who from?\n* What will happen to the value of existing vehicles on the road when Tesla achieves FSD?\n* What will happen to company valuations of ICE manufacturers who haven't transitioned ALL new vehicles to electric AND full self driving when the first EV manufacturer achieves FSD?\n* What will happen to Tesla's net profit when they \"turn on\" their robo taxi fleet, taking 25-30% of all user-owned rides, and 100% of all Tesla-owned rides?

Initial phone screening with HR went well, so they scheduled a phone interview with engineering management for the following week. When I got on for the interview, they told me that instead of a Process Engineering role in the battery charging area (the one I had applied to), they wanted to interview me right now for a position in Quality, and this was actually the QA management team. I told them I really wasn't interested in Quality (I did QA in a previous life and it sucks), but they tried to convince me anyways and started going into all the benefits to working at Tesla, I can work my way into the Process Engineering role, looks good on a resume yada yada yada. \n\nAfter finally convincing them that I *really* wasn't interested in a QA position they said alright, the Process Engineer position isn't actually available right now, but if it becomes available we'll let you know.

I told them I wasn't interested.\n\nWell, they eventually got Model 3's out of the door and revenues looked good, but now the Model 3's are all crapping out.

These are typically classified into binocular cues that are based on the receipt of sensory information in three dimensions from both eyes and monocular cues that can be represented in just two dimensions and observed with just one eye. Binocular cues include stereopsis, eye convergence, disparity, and yielding depth from binocular vision through exploitation of parallax.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Im just gonna address your bullet points and not provide an opinion on the stock.\n\nIs Tesla's data lead (2 orders of magnitude and counting....360k vehicles on the road right now sending training data back to base at every driver intervention) unassailable?\nNo.\n\nDoes Tesla have the best, cheapest and most energy efficient self driving computer?\n\nFor now.\n\nHas Tesla built custom software for their custom hardware which will provide efficiencies no one else can match unless they too build their own full self driving (FSD) hardware and software?\n\nLike every tech company is currently working on?\n\nWill Tesla be first to achieve (FSD)?\n\nDepends on your definition of FSD.

I simply don't believe that a product demo type marketing presentation actually means all that much when it comes to self driving.\n\nAVs are a last 1% problem.  That's a cliche, but it's true.  It's not *that* hard to put together something that looks pretty good but isn't all the way there.   We've been seeing that for years.  Nothing in the presentation actually indicated a true timeline to me, which is what really matters.  \n\nAs a side note  on the subject of timelines, I would have really liked to hear the subject matter experts (who I really liked btw) give their predictions.  I respect some things about Elon, but frankly when he gets up there and says \"FSD in a year!\" I just roll my eyes.  He plays fast and loose with the truth and stretches the definition of \"optimism\" in his forward looking predictions.  In my experience, listening to both the sales people and the experts try to answer the same question can be very illuminating, because the tech experts tend to be both more pessimistic and more accurate.  \n\nI also work in tech, and I'm very used to going to conferences and listening to pitches of things that look cool and sound like they're making great progress but never materialize.  There's *so* much cool looking tech out there that never actually turns into a real product (or at least not by the first people who try).\n\nFundamentally, for me to get interested in self driving comes down to 2 related things: a real, verifiable timeline for when it will be ready, and *data*.  The last one is essential, and Tesla just hasn't provided any in a meaningful way.  \"Success\" in self driving is a question of statistics and not a list of features or tech.  \"Fully automated miles safely driven\" is the end all, be all of AVs.  Features, tech, and demos are not evidence of accomplishment in a last 1% problem.  \n\nAs far as the specific presentation goes, there were a fair few things in there that I didn't find particularly impressive.  I thought Elon's overly confident predictions and outlandish claims of \"free money\" if you buy a car came off as pretty desperate.  \"Cash flow neutral\" and an apparent pivot to substantially increased capital investment in FSD at a time when their existing plan would require a lot of capital for the Model Y, S+X refresh, etc makes me nervous.  I also don't particularly like how cagey they seem to be about providing meaningful Autopilot data - accident data for highway miles with vs without Autopilot would be very informative.\n\nThat said, I really, honestly did find the tech stuff and in particular their experts very impressive.

There is a reason why companies use sensor fusion, there is no one size fits all solution for computer vision.  Bosch has radar units that are capable of detecting objects ex: cars, people, signs.  However, radar is useful for longer range detections.  Once we get in the danger zone (inside 20 meters), we need to have LiDAR and cameras to help out.  The main benefit of LiDAR over cameras is that it is computationally incredibly expensive to create a point cloud mapping of depths between two stereo images.  To create a 3d point cloud with cameras you need to take the distance between the two cameras, the size of the image, and then calculate the distance for every pixel.  Something like a Velodyne LiDAR will create a 3d point cloud much less computationally expensive.  Also, the width of the cameras directly correlates to how far it can detect distance accurately.  Now, what happens with your fancy camera or LiDAR at sunset or sunrise you may ask?  Well they become completely useless because the sun overloads the sensors on both.
