That's the old way of doing this business, and it's the reason why cars have not progressed as well as they could have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConventional car companies typically have god awful software, and they focus almost entirely on the hardware which means any changes that need to happen such as adding a button, need to be done on hardware. This is obviously very costly, so they just wait for a new range of cars and add it to that instead. This is profoundly dumb to do in the modern age. It's true that not many consumers really care about the current state of their product, you tend to just get used to it. But introduce a massive improvement and they'll want it - demand for better products has never stopped, if it did we would still be using horses for transport and candles for light.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not the first time a company has moved a hardware-focused product to a software-focused one. When Apple introduced the iPhone, they put the keyboard on software, because you don't need it all the time. It's an important change because it makes iteration on the product far cheaper. You build the software, press a button and your product instantly improves - no recalls, no waiting for a new product range.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla has done the same, they put almost all of their interface on software, which means they can release an update to every car they've every made, that adds a feature the customer wants, or improves range, improves performance etc. How much cheaper is that than recalling a fleet of cars, or producing a whole new range of vehicles? Not to mention the customer experience...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn top of that software, there's FSD. Something that will enable them to compete in a hugely expansive market. Not only that but the money they make from a single car sale is not where it ends. It is likely that most Tesla owners will add their car to the Robotaxi fleet, which means Tesla will receive a 25-30% revenue share. I'll say it again - Tesla will make money from their cars driving themselves about. They sell a car, it drives about and pays them. Not only that, but they own their own fuel stations. Sure they might not make any money out of them yet, but when Superchargers are powered entirely from solar and have café's with merchandise and whatnot, Tesla can turn those stations into another revenue stream. The more cars they sell, the more customers are using their charging network. And lastly they'll be introducing their own insurance. This is significant too because they will have the best data available compared to anyone else in the industry on how people drive. They might even offer cheaper options if you put your car in locked-autopilot mode, who knows. Point is, they can offer a product that is far better than anything else - consumers will choose it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn all of these areas: EV tech, design, software, charging network, autonomy/taxis, customer satisfaction.. Tesla is ahead of everyone else. It all boils down to whether the consumer will want to wait years before they're able to buy a sub-par autonomous EV, or just buy a Tesla now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI say it's the next Amazon not because of the markets they're in, but because I fully expect Tesla to be trading at $1,000 within 10 years.

{"title": "My Autism - A Personal Story", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - I took out a personal loan for 12k. Lost it all. I took out a second personal loan for 20k. Lost it all. I took out a 3rd personal loan for 35k and managed to make back all my money.  Moral of the story, keep borrowing until you get it right.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood afternoon my fellow Autists,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decided to make a post about the perils of options and stocks. I started options trading last summer while watching MU gains and MU profit porn. I jumped in with about 2.5k (which came from a reimbursement check from work). So rather than pay off my credit cards with it, I'm like, \"Let's see if I can turn this into some big gains!\" Well, I turned it into 5k and was super excited. Queue \"Stormy Weather\" and a substantial loss. Well shit. Here comes another reimbursement check, let's see if I can double down. Queue a shitty earnings report. So I took my losses, transferred what I was supposed to pay my reimbursement checks towards to a 0% interest credit card for 18 months and am currently paying that shit down. I took a break from stocks in general for awhile, until the imfamous December 24th period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy dad had just given me 300$ for Christmas, and I transferred that and 100$ into my Robinhood account. Decided to buy calls on SPY on the 26th and instantly got 400% gains and was realized it was super easy. I thought to myself, \"Only if I had more money, this could have been substantial!\" So, I was in calls for a bit, riding the trend upward, but was drinking the bear kool-aid, and kept losing money here and there on puts. And finally, I log into my American Express account and see I pre-qualify for a personal loan of up to 15k. Now, at first I'm like, \"That's a stupid idea.\" I've read your warnings, I've seen the loss porn, and all that jazz and thought, \"Nah.\" Well, it pops up a few times, and at this point, I'm making some good moves, but my account is still less than $5,000. I've been playing AMZN when it was swinging between 1600 and 1700, making a double amount here and there, but I wanted more. So finally, I dip my toes into it and sign up for 12k personal loan from AMEX. My goal here was to buy AMZN calls when it was around $1600. I did - and made a few thousand, but my total losses from all time was around 23k. I ended up losing the majority of that personal loan trying to time the top. So I did what any autist does, and kept doubling down on some stuff. I took out another personal loan through Lendingclub for about 20k+1600$ origination fee. After that, I did my riskiest play to date (other than gambling) was buying 25k worth of weekly NFLX 370$ calls and selling them for 31K. That was awesome. But that got me banned from Robinhood due to day trading and not finishing above 25k. (Just prior to this, I had 20k with of IWM puts when it was 158, expiring 2 weeks out. If would have held, they would have been worth 90k+ when it dropped to 151 the following week.) So I was mad at myself for that and wanted to make another big play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI transfer my money into my etrade account, and while I wait for funds to settle, I'm watching AMZN rise from low 1600s. If I could trade in Robinhood or had my money been settled there, I would have all in'd some weekly AMZN calls. I had to watch it rise to the 1700s and miss out. I wanted revenge. Queue that Monday when SPY rose from 271 to 278 in a single day. I did the autismo thing and bought weekly puts near open when it was 274 and watched 20k turn into 10k in a single day. I wasn't worried - it has to go down eventually right? Nope. So, I sold my puts and my account value turned into about 2k. I now worked on a strategy to earn back my money. After calculating how much I could afford in monthly payments, bills, and what not, I calculated I could take on one more personal loan payment. I wouldn't be as retarded this time, though. I got rejected from a couple of places, but SoFi - bless their retarded souls, decided they would give me a 35k personal loan. Had I not been approved of this personal loan, I would have cut my losses and just accepted my fate of 3 years worth of personal loan payments. A few days later, 35k landed in my account. I paid off some of my other personal loans, through some money into savings, and transferred about 30k in Etrade. I swore off weeklies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI purchased about 30k worth of $BB stock and JAN 2020 calls prior to their earnings and made about 20k. I sold some for profit on that day, and lost about 10k the next day when it decided to drop. I pulled out about 5k, made some payments, and then tried to play AMZN and NFLX again, and lost about 5k there, but I didn't gamble the whole farm.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThree weeks ago, I stumbled on \"I pick stocks and options so you don't have to\", and read through it. I decided to follow u/SoRefreshing on his TWTR play and bought some $36 strike and $41 strike calls for June 21st for a total of 27k. The day before earnings, Monday of this week, my account value sat at 19k and I was down 8k from that play. Earnings came out and I hit a high that day of 52k that day, and ended up around 48k. I sold some for profit, withdrew some money, and let it sit a day. Next day rolled around, I said fuck it, sold  75% of the rest, rolled others out to September, and bought some $FB stock and 5k worth of calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday, around 2 PM, I decided one more yolo, and through everything (except 15k worth of TWTR Sep calls) into $FB calls. Today, I consider myself lucky. Hope you enjoyed my retardation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis morning, I withdrew about 10k from my account, sold some stuff off, repositioned some things, and now I'm sitting at around 73k in my etrade account.\n\nHere is proof.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/kXO8LER.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/kXO8LER.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Blah blah blah, gambling problem. I appreciate the concerns. Because you guys are the angels on my shoulders, I withdrew a total of $65,000 today - with $17,400 left in my trading account.
