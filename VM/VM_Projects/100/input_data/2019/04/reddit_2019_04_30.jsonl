Their sales were *well* below predictions by that time, and they were already frantically cutting costs and pulling demand levers to adjust.\n\nThere's been a lot lately that falls into that category.  \"Teslas sold today are appreciating assets\" was another.  I also have to wonder why he gets a pass on \"just being wrong about the timeline\" with promises where the timeline is the only relevant part of the promise.\n\nI've given Elon the benefit of the doubt about that for along time. I'm bearish, but I admired the tenacity of his optimism and vision.  But it's pretty easy for habitually overoptimistic promises to turn into lies, and I wonder how far he has to go before we make that call.\n\nThe markets already have, though.  When autonomy day with all it's outlandish promises came and went without budging the share price, the message was pretty clear: investors simply don't believe a word he says any more.  \n\nAs an aside:  there's nothing erratic about it.

They ran out of parts to build enough 75D and 100D cars, but hadn't ramped up the new components (powertrain, suspension, etc) for the refresh that they unveiled last week.  My estimates are that being unable to build Model S and X at the same rate as the past 2 years, cost Tesla 900M $US in revenue.  \n\nIf Model S and X sales volumes rebound over the next few months, I think that will be strong, but not conclusive, evidence that a botched transition from pre to post-refresh components caused last quarter's unexpectedly low sales of S and X.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> Alternatively, investors also didn't understand much of what was presented at Autonomy Day.

They can't evaluate it themselves, so their evaluation depends in large part on whether they trust what Musk said it meant.  They didn't.  That's in contrast to past events and reveals, where Musk would make similarly sweeping promises and would be believed.  \n\n> Even if people don't believe Musk, I think it would be hard to dispute that Pete Bannon and Andrej Karpathy are very well respected experts in their fields.

I watched the presentation and came away very impressed, and especially impressed by them.  I gained a lot more respect for the no-lidar approach than I did before, and I'm pretty skeptically biased on that front.  \n\nBut... the promises I'm talking about are more related to the concrete business case did not come from the experts.

The experts talked tech, Elon talked timelines.  The investors could have the utmost respect for those experts and still not come away impressed if they thought Elon was not being truthful.  \n\nThat actually brought up one of my strongest immediate reactions to the presentation:  I really, really wish we'd gotten to hear the tech experts discuss timelines and feasibility in detail.  I've worked in tech for a long time, and it's fascinating to hear the technical team and the sales team try to describe the same thing.   You learn a lot from that, even if the tech types are forced to stick to the party line.  They're usually much worse at lying.  But more often, they're simply not willing to risk their reputation giving predictions that they don't believe to be supported.  \n\nIt would have been very interesting to see how one of them might have attempted to convey \"one year out\".

But a lot of places make you install all new breaker panels, disconnect, and a separate meter for the generating unit.  If you have a separate meter for the solar system, you can’t consume your own power “according to the meter” and the rate you are paid to generate is less than the rate you usually pay. Look up “net metering” if you care to know more.\n\nAlso we have to follow the NES, which is different from your IEC standards. So we have to have certain features you may not, for instance we need to be able to shut down the DC system. “Rapid Solar Shutdown”, makes us have to run either micro inverters on the panels or more expensive string inverters capable of shutting down the DC lines. \n\nAll of that combined with low power prices make home solar not very attractive. Also the US has much more unpopulated areas, so we don’t traditionally need to build small PV systems on our houses.

Then they break that disc up into each individual cpus.\n\nProblem is that each disc has defects, if any of the cpus on the disc are in an area with defects they have to be tossed. Because Intel uses big chips, if even one tiny area on it has a defect the whole chip is lost, with amd the chip is split into chiplets which allows them to have a much better yield.\n\nThe main reason for intel not moving to the 10nm node and instead sticking with 14nm for so many years is that their yield for 10nm is so bad its not cost effective for them to make them at a full production scale.\n\nNow ofc they could switch to a chiplet design like AMD but that would require them to completely change their architecture and take years plus money.
