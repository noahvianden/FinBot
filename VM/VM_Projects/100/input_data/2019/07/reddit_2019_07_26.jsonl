A third failure in August 2008 pushed SpaceX to the brink of bankruptcy.  **It wasn't until the 4th and final attempt, in September 2008, that a Falcon 1 reached orbit, about** ***5 years after*** **Musk said SpaceX would have an orbital rocket.**\n\nThe same has played out with many of Tesla's products.
