{"title": "Seems the wallstbets guys are way more successful then most of us here", "selftext": "Part of it may have to do with survivorship bias and the use of riskier strategies and also because they have so many members that it's a statistical certainty that whenever a stock makes a huge one-day move that there will be at least one member on that sub out of 20k+ active members who has a pur or call  position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I think there is a underlying method, although I have not tested it,  to how so many members on that sub are able to turn a few hundred or thousand dollars into fortunes overnight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe idea is, for low IV stocks , such as dow 30 stocks, you buy far out of money vertical calls 10% or more OTM before earnings reports. The spread should be as tight as possible but you can turn $50 into $5000.  So Disney is reporting earnings on august 6th 2019. You would thus buy the 160/162.5 vertical call. Obviously  this will expire worthless most of the time but the expected value over a long enough period is positive.\n\nThe second strategy is to look for mid and large cap stocks that exhibit parabolic moves (such as a 300+% rally in a 1-year period( and buy put options that expire after earnings, in the hope that the company fails to meet the overinflated expectations and tanks, yielding a huge profit despite the IV already being very high.  Or stocks that are overpriced. Such stocks can be found using a screener and sorting by greatest yearly performance. Unlike above,  you don't want to make this a vertical because the downside is potentially much  more unlimited. Do not use this method on internet and tech stocks, which tend to hold up well, but rather on things that are susceptible to being fads or prone to regulation and competition. So this would be commodities, apparel, biotech. So for example, LYFT reports earrings on August 7th.
