Some methods that may or may not work anymore include funding a checking account with a credit card (sometimes it triggers as a cash advance/cash equivalent and would not work, and sometimes banks have limits to how much can be funded with a credit card, typically around $500-2000 or so).

Not really worth the time/effort in my opinion, but there have been success stories of people making lots of money.
