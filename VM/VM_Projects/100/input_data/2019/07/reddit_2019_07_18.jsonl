OP responded and provided his full position in a screenshot within the same post, indicating that he shifted his position down to protect against the possibility of NFLX falling on earnings.\n\nNFLX earnings came in well below expectations, and the stock tanked over 10% after hours.\n\nDespite the drop, the adjustment yesterday resulted in the above gain for OP.

So if your option is worthless because the stock it's tied to went the wrong direction, you don't have to do anything. \n\nWhen you sell, you are \"short\" and have an obligation. You have to react to whether or not another person exercises their right in the contract. \n\nThe most dangerous options are short calls that are \"uncovered.\" An uncovered call means you obligated yourself (by selling [i.e. being short]) to selling a stock at a certain price without already owning the stock. That means if you are exercised against, you have to deliver the stock to the person on the other side of the contract and since you don't already own it, you have to go out and buy it on the open market. \n\nIf your contract says you have to sell for $100, what happens if the stock goes up to $200? Well, to cover the option, you have to go out and buy it for $200 just to sell it at $100. Theoretically, the potential loss on an uncovered call is unlimited because there's no definite ceiling to how high a stock can go. \n\nAll options have a price called the \"premium.\" The premium is kind of like the price of a lotto ticket and goes to the seller of the option. So ideally for all option sellers, the option expires worthless and the seller gets to keep the premium. All option buyers hope the stock goes the right direction and they can exercise their option to make a profit. If the option expires unexercised because the stock went the wrong direction, they only lose out on the premium. \n\nSo option buyers can lose a lot of money by buying dumb options and nickel and diming themselves to death through premiums (like buying a bunch of scratch offs at the drug store and losing them all).

The value of these option contracts is loosely tied to the difference between the agreed strike price and the current trading price of the stock if you were to execute your option to buy or sell at that price. \n\nExample- you buy a put on ABC stock @$100 that expires in a month. ABC stock then goes down to $99 a few days later. You execute your option to sell 100 shares of ABC to whoever sold you the put, and they are forced to pay you $100/share, or a profit of $1/share over current market price. Alternatively, you could just sell the put contract itself for a similar value of around $100 total since that's the intrinsic value.

You're betting that a price we reach a certain amount by a specific period of time (often the end of a week but not always.)\n\nIf you think the price will go **UP** it's a \"call.\"\n\nIf you thing the price will go **DOWN** it's a put.\n\nYou then purchase contacts at a price that's based on supply and demand. High risk is often cheaper but has a higher chance of failing, while low risk tends to be more expensive (sometimes being so expensive they become unprofitable). Also, these \"contracts\" are generally sold 100 at a time. People can buy those contracts from you, or you can execute them at the price you determined.\n\n> A shitty example with numbers pulled straight out of my ass: \n> \n> Let's say you really like X Corp. X corp is currently valued at $20, but you think their next earnings is going to be huge for them. You think the price will EASILY make it to $25 by then. So you buy 30000 contracts  at .56¢ each for a cost of $1,580. \n> \n> A few days go by, and X Corps' stock has been rising steadily! The earnings report is a mere week away and they're already at $24.50 a share! Because the option you \"bet\" on is far more likely to happen now, your contracts have a greater demand, therefore making them more valuable. You check what they're trading for and wow! they're trading for nearly $3 an option.  You have 30000 contracts so that means they're now worth $90,000! You've finally got the tendies! \n\n> You then have two choices: sell them and take the money...or keep waiting and see if you can make even **MORE** money. You decided FUCK IT and decide to wait and see just how many tendies you can get!\n> \n> Except, OH NO! The CEO of X Corp was caught hitting the slopes off of the back of a Russian hooker who then revealed that the company was in dire straights! The Stock PLUMMETS! It's now only worth $17.50! Your bet is almost guaranteed to not happen, so the demands for your contracts are practically worthless, now trading for a mere .02¢. This means your contracts are now worth a small $600. You can choose to sell your options (if anyone will actually buy them at this point, OR, if you somehow have the money you can exercise your contracts which would buy 30000 shares of X Corp at $25, even though their shares are only worth $17.50.\n\nYou are then poor and numb to the money you lost...so you say FUCK IT and invest all your remaining money in Y Corp. After all, it's a sure thing, right?", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks that was probably the best I’ve seen it explained and cleared it up for me a bit.  Some questions.  In your scenario if you kept the options and it hit 25.. are you selling it to someone at that point or is it more “you won the bet” and you get the money from everyone who took you up on those 30000 contracts?  \n\nSecond.  At the end of your scenario if you can’t/won’t sell your options at the .02... if you don’t exercise your contracts what happens? \n\nThird.  You start out buying contracts at.56... but at the end you would have to pay $25 per contract of those 30k? So 750k dollars?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Very good questions, I'll try to explain.\n\n1. First thing to remember is that the contract price ≠ the stock price. The contract price is determined separately according to the supply and demand for your contract. If you keep the option and it DOES hit $25 or higher you can either exercise the option (aka, buying the 30000 shares at $25 a piece even though the stock is worth more...keep in mind that still means spending $750,000.) or you can sell your contracts to someone else who wants to/can exercise the option.  \nIf the end of the option comes near and you bet on $25 but X Corp is worth $30 you can still buy the stock for $25 because that's the contract you bought. The exchange that you wrote the contract with has to eat the loss. The contracts in this case aren't worth $25 dollars though. They would probably be worth a lot though because they're essentially free money to whomever executes them. But the people willing to buy them are still going to want to make money, they'd never spend $25 per contract because they wouldn't make any money that way.\n\n2. If you can't/won't sell at the .02 the contract simply dissolves and you lose all of the money.\n\n3. Again, the contract price ≠ the stock price. At the end the stock may be worth $25 but the contracts may only be worth $2 or $3. This is still a big win for you, because you bought them for .56 so you've more than doubled your money. Since you bought the option contracts, your value is tied up in the contracts, not necessarily the stock.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Ahh.  That makes so much more sense now .

This lets you profit off shares even if you can't afford the actual shares (i.e normally you'd only profit if you could actually buy the shares the contract entitles you to, but that would require you to be able to buy and sell $5000 of shares. Instead of scrounging up $5000 to actually buy the shares, you can just sell the contract to someone who does for more than you paid for them - this is attractive to the other person because it's free money to them as well)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The brokers (market makers) buy and sell between investors.  The purpose of options is for hedging.  You own 2000 shares of Company X,  you might take out contracts at a relatively low price to minimize your potential losses.  Similarly, you bought 1000 shares of Company Y because it gives a decent dividend, and your grandpa swore by it.  This dinosaur is pretty much flat with some ups and downs but nothing too volatile, currently trading at 11 dollars a share.  You might decide you want to bring in a little extra money on the stock by selling contracts with your stock as collateral (covered calls).  Some shmoe off of r/WSB thinks he knows something and buys 10 contracts to buy 100 shares each of your stock at 12 dollars and he pays you .50/share for the contracts.  As the stock doesn't move much you don't get to charge too much for the contract based on its volatility, so to get .50 cents a share you picked an expiration date 2 months down the road (the more time the stock has to move, the higher the value of a contract).  Low and behold the little moron from the internet was right, the company just landed a major contract and the stock surges all the way up to 12.30 by the date the contract expires.  So now your contracts get exercised and the stock is called away.  You get paid 12 dollars a share x 1000 shares for a cool 12000 dollars, but the stock was worth 12300!  You got screwed! but wait, don't forget that when you sold the contracts it was for .50 a share.  So we add that 500 on and bam! You can rebuy your position and keep that 200 for a nice weekend at Bernies.So the various prices in our example are 10.00 the price of the underlying stock at the time the contracts were sold to open.  50 cents per share credit for the contracts, 12.00 \"Strike price\" the price that you agreed to sell for on the \"expiration date\".  There is also the \"break even price\" of 12.50 where it is a wash.  If the price goes higher than 12.50 you actually lose money.Now nowhere is it written that either the buyer or the seller of the contracts have to stay involved until expiration.  Either party can exit by either buying the same contract (essentially paying to transfer it to someone else) or in the case of the buyer by selling his contracts early.  So this financial instrument is a lot like roulette.  Fairly even odds, but the table is slanted towards the house (in this case the market makers who make their roll by buying low and selling high and \"scalping\" the difference between bid and ask prices.)  Since it is a lot like gambling, a lot of degenerates do just that.  Instead of using options to hedge their investments they just buy calls and puts (way better margins with a lower chance to profit) and normally lose money steadily.  A few poor unfornate types actually hit it big once in a while, and then they are hooked and are destined to eventually lose big, either by throwing a bunch of money at a contract that turns worthless, or even worse, they get frustrated that those guys selling calls and puts seem to \"win\" more often and they decide to sell a contract that they don't own the underlying stock for.  This is called a \"naked call\" and it produces the white whale of losses, unlimited loss potential...  For this example I'll use and actual stock.  Lets suppose that you decided that BYND meat was going to go all Lyft right from its IPO and somehow you were able to sell calls early on (normally calls/puts aren't allowed on new stonks).  So you sell a bunch of in the money calls (where the strike price (say 55 dollars) is already below the current stock value lets assume it was at 58 dollars) because those are worth a lot more.  You sell 10 contracts for 5.00 a share and pocket that sweet 5 thousand dollars.  (10 contracts at 100 shares a piece 5 dollars/share).  Rather than watch the market you go spend that money on a vacation to thailand and when you next check your account you see that the fake meat stock is now trading at 170 dollars a share.  Your contracts make you liable for selling 1000 shares at 55 dollars a share.  When the contract exercises someone out there pays 55,000 dollars to your brokerage who then buys and 1000 shares at 170 dollars a piece and passes you the bill for the difference.  You pocketed 5000 dollars, and now have an account worth negative 110,000 dollars.  Good times.

Being able to watch current shows the next day with no ads, movies, and Hulu originals (they’re not that great to be fair) is a huge draw and now Netflix is going to be more expensive than Hulu with no ads. ($12 vs $13)\n\nYou make some good points and I don’t really have the data to back up what I said based on who watches what, I just think a LOT of Netflix subscribers came for the shows that are leaving and the originals just don’t have the roots to keep them there.\n\nEdit: Netflix does have some popular originals I don’t mean to say that they don’t. Stranger Things, Bojack Horseman, Narcos, Ozark, etc. are definitely big money and big viewer shows but I’m just not sure they can keep making consistently good series that draw in new subscribers.\n\nEdit2: These are both fairly quick edits and no one has responded but I only used Hulu as a comparison as the main competitor.
