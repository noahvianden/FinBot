Not to mention they're forgetting some key rules of economics.\n\nThe fact is Taxi Drivers are **NOT** going to just quietly give up their livelihoods to self driving cars. They'll fight it tooth and nail every step of the way, and they're actually quite influential in that area. The whole Taxi Medallion system was put in place decades ago to protect the taxi drivers and artificially limit their competition (which is why taxi services are so horrible in a number of places). And look at all the areas that ban Uber & Lyft and other ride sharing services. Sure some people will just ignore those laws and illegally operate a taxi/ride sharing service anyway, but guess what? It's pretty easy to see a car with no driver.\n\nAlso, despite what you might think, a lot of people are still not comfortable with the idea of entrusting their life to a self driving car. Seeing a car with no driver in it is going to freak a some people out for a while. And just a few FSD accidents are going to make big headlines about the 'dangers' of self driving cars, taxi drivers are going to be the biggest spreaders of that FUD. Some politicians are going to want to stand against FSD or slow it down just to cater to those voters. \n\nThen there's a pure economics of it. If you already have taxi medallions or a taxi business then sure, a say $100,000 car could replace 1 taxi driver employee and pay for itself easily. That math is easy to understand.\n\nExcept there's already a huge flaw in that logic. The average salary of a taxi driver (as of 2012) was a measly **$22,820** [according to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicabs_of_the_United_States). Obviously taxi drivers make tips to, but the taxi driver's company doesn't make those tips, and lets be real, who's going to tip a robot? \n\nOf course, while human labor isn't as expense as you might have thought, a robo-taxi can work longer hours, so that is a plus, but that brings us to the next problem. Demand for taxi's isn't a static amount all day long. There's rush hours on the road when everyone wants to get to work, or get home from work. Other times of the day the demand for taxi's is much lower, so having a FSD taxi willing to work more hours doesn't necessarily mean it'll find customers wanting a ride. And lets keep in mind, if your FSD taxi is your main car you're going to want to go to work and other places during some of those busier rush hour times, so that right there reduces your income potential from your own FSD taxi.\n\nBut even that oversimplifies the math too much. If literally every Tesla owner buys FSD and uses their taxi to give taxi rides to people when they aren't using it guess what? The supply of taxi's will be WAY too high, which will drive prices down a lot. \n\nUber actually has this kind of a problem in certain geographical areas. Uber pays drivers a certain amount of money for recruiting other people to work as an Uber driver. Because of this system it was literally **MORE** profitable in some areas to recruit competition for yourself then it was to give Uber rides to other people, because there were way too many Uber drivers in the area. The same is going to happen with FSD taxi's if EVERYONE tries to make money off of it, and no one in the government stops them from driving up the supply like this.\n\nBut how many taxi's are there in the US anyway? According to google **[233,900](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=how+many+taxi+drivers+are+there+in+the+US)**.\n\nSo yeah, adding say 50,000+ FSD taxi's to the US would have a BIG impact on the taxi market. Taxi drivers would all get less passengers a month on average. And Tesla sold 95,000 cars last quarter, imagine what it would do to the market if all 95,000 of them had FSD and owners used them at least part time to give out rides? Taxi drivers and taxi companies have good reason to fight hard against FSD and throw FUD at it.\n\nElon would have good economic reason to charge $100,000 to $200,000 for FSD in Tesla's for this alone. If too many Tesla customers use their taxi's for FSD they'll compete against Tesla's own FSD taxi's, and make them less profitable by flooding the market quicker. Not to mention his taxi business would risk serious political & social blow back for hurting the legacy taxi companies.\n\n**Conclusion:** I think there IS a lot of money to be made in FSD cars, but NOT in FSD taxi's. There's money to be made in FSD taxi's sure, especially if you're the first to the market with FSD, but not as much money as most think. I think the real money to be made is in selling FSD to consumers & promoting it as a driver safety feature.

By some accounts they're further ahead than Tesla.\n\nWaymo and Uber are using LIDAR.  They don’t have what’s needed to train their vision network.  And vision is what will be needed to have FSD.  So their progress to date is largely irrelevant.\n\n>I'll happily bet my house that Toyota will still be around in 50 years. They're one of the few that I'm confident will survive just fine.\n\nI tend to agree.  Toyota is big enough that they can still catch up.  VW will also be okay I think.  But big auto in general is a very low-margin business.  And they have an entire empire built on this weak foundation.  Electric cars take batteries and they’re gonna have to start investing serious capital right -now- to have an EV pipeline in place before ICE cars get the rug pulled out from under them.  The majority of existing auto simply won’t survive.  They’re gonna wait until their ICEs aren’t selling anymore, and then try to make deals with 3rd parties for massive amounts of batteries.  And they’re all gonna do it at the same time.  Battery prices will skyrocket, and the vehicle manufacturers will be left with no option but to burn through their cash pile until they’re insolvent.\n\n>I'll happily bet my house that Toyota will still be around in 50 years. They're one of the few that I'm confident will survive just fine.\n\nThis is kind of like saying that as soon as someone else makes a good EV, Tesla will not sell any more of their EVs.  The market is so huge that there won’t be any competition between FSD cars for quite some time.  Only once the market reaches saturation will prices start to decline due to competition.  Given the huge demand for FSD that will exist - this could take 5-10 years.  (In the future, people will rarely own a car unless they have a specific need.  They’ll just ride-hail everywhere.  It’s easier and it’s cheap)\n\n:)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "My counter offer: I’m willing to sell my Model 3 back to Tesla for no gains for me ($$$ I paid - $$ I got back from feds) tomorrow.

I lost potentially that $40-$50 but not any more. \n\nTo me it seems clear that in a larger account you can play much cheaper options and save your account when your trade goes against you.

That is if you aren’t into the even safer multi-leg options strategies and are only buying one-way directional contracts. But in the case of probably most options traders, they’re probably buying calls or puts.

Now, what would Elon do next with Tesla? I say, set a trap for the people he hates. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla has been one of the most shorted companies over the last years and [Elon is tired of it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-16/musk-calls-tesla-most-shorted-stock-ever-technically-it-s-not). The amount of [pure bullshit](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/06/04/teslas-going-to-have-to-restructure-says-blaine-capital.html) the bears have been spreading has been insane. With the expiring tax credits, he knew long in advance that Q1 2019 would be a relatively bad quarter.  He played this by first lessening profits in Q4 of 2018 by increasing CAPEX. He then kept up CAPEX and production in Q1 and had over [10 000 cars](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-q1-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries) in transit at the end of the quarter. All to make a loss and make it look like demand was waning. You all know the stock was pushed down to $178 with shorts at more than 30% of stock value. Shorts of $10 billion is more than 10 days of the normal trading volume. At such volumes, one great bull trigger and the shorters will be FUCKED!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow in Q2 he stepped on the gas, reduced CAPEX and production and sales are higher than ever. As analysts have seen the sales numbers  TSLA has moved up 40% to $250. The shorters are getting squeezed, they can't get out and are hoping for a loss in Q2. Something that will not happen.
