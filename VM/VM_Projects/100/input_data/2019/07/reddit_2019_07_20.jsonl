Debt is literally free money because theft (aka government taxation) is reduced.\n\nBut you ask *\"pkkiller69, what about the liquidation value of the enterprise? what happens if the firm goes bankrupt?\"*\n\nMy response: google sunk cost fallacy you fuck\n\nBut you ask *\"pkkiller69, what about pension liabilities, legal liabilities, deferred tax liabilities?\"*\n\n**-Pension liabilities:** these can stay underfunded forever, you don't need to pay your employees, only promise to pay them\n\n**-Legal liabilities:** courts are run by the corporate class, do you think that they ever lose a court case when they have skadden or davis polk? Do you think that they do not stack juries? Trial of your peers my ass. Just ask OJ how $ influenced his outcome\n\n**-Deferred tax liabilities:** have you ever read an income statement, have the prior year's DTAs ever correlated with the cash income tax paid in the current year?\n\nPersonally, I think its best to buy all these \"electronic\" businesses. They don't need to pay wages -  they just pay their employees for free with warrants and options. They don't need to pay for real assets - they can just set up a website and start \"value creation\".
