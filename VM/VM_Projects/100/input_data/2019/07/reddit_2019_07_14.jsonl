{"title": "How to Profit Off the Area 51 Raid", "selftext": "Reddit has recently been taken by a storm of memers who wish to suicide themselves into Area 51. I'm here to tell you how to profit off of it.  \n\n\nFirst, long airlines. How are people going to get to Area 51? They're going to have get there somehow. I would recommend Spirit (SAVE) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) as they both have hubs at McCarran International Airport (Las Vegas Airport). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran\\_International\\_Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarran_International_Airport) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, car rental companies. They all have to make at least an 80 mile trek out there, most likely more. The two I recommend are Hertz (HTZ) and Avis (CAR).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird, the A-10 ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvIJvPj\\_pjE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvIJvPj_pjE) ) uses AIM-9 Sidewinders, AGM-65's and Mark 77 Bombs. The AIM-9 is made by Raytheon and Ford (RTN & F), the AGM-65 is made by RTN as well. The Mark 77 bomb as far as I can tell was made by Rockwell who was then bought by Boeing  (BA). But we're not going to touch Boeing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore, in my Wallstreebets expertise, I recommend the Area 51 ETF to be made up of:  \nSAVE, LUV, HTZ, CAR, RTN, F\n\nLong for profit.\n\n\nEdit: okay, I get it.
