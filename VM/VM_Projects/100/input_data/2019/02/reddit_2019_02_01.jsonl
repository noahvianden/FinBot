When there's a large event happening (i.e. ER coming up), people's willingness to pay for the option goes up because there's a lot of uncertainty and people are betting on big moves.  After the event itself happens, the uncertainty has been removed and people's willingness to pay for the option goes own accordingly.  In your case, the ER is the event, and after it happened, people knew the price was gonna be around 148, and it no longer makes sense to pay a lot more than that for a 148 call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's why you see a lot of people playing the run-up to the ER, rather than the ER itself, because the ER itself is guaranteed to suffer from IV crush, while the IV is steady and perhaps even increasing in the days before the ER event.

If you are ITM already it won't cover your loss as it will be cheaper now, so you need to go much further in time - 6 months from now to collect enough credit. Second problem - it might take the stock very long time to drop to your price again, or it might never come back.
