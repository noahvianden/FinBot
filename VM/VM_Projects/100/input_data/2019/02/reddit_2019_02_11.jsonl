I'm a software developer and my LLC pays for my truck so it is a tax write-off. What's your top marginal tax bracket? Take that right off the top of your lease.\n2. On the topic of sales tax, sales tax is added to individual payments after interest is calculated. If you buy a car sales tax is added into the loan and you pay interest on that tax for the life of the loan.\n3. *Assuming you are getting the same car regardless of financing method* (which admittedly most people don't), leasing is a lot cheaper.

If you're free of bankruptcies and repos, it's much easier to get approved for a lease because the payment is lower.\n6. You can negotiate the interest rate on a lease (money factor), especially if there's a dealer markup (there almost always is). You can't really negotiate interest rate on a loan with a bank outside of getting multiple offers.\n7.

{"title": "Investing in Cannabis: a brief overview of a true YOLO opportunity", "selftext": "We are all extremely lucky to be witnessing the end of marijuana prohibition in the developed world. This is a market that will forever change the economic landscape for the countries involved in bringing about a legal marketplace. For investment purposes The Marijuana sector is comprised of two main markets at the moment IMO. There is Canada and there is the United States. \n\nIn Canada marijuana has had a strong country wide recognized legal marijuana system built for corporate control since the introduction of the MMPR in 2013. Provinces and their national govt have been in lockstep throughout (mostly) and this has created stability for investors. This has led to companies such as Tilray and Canopy Growth Corp and a few other small corporate entities sucking up Billions of real investment dollars from individuals and even [Fortune 500 beverage companies](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/canopy-growth-closes-5-billion-constellation-brands-investment-transaction/). Accordingly this resulted in a gross overvaluation of these companies that operate legal cannabis operations. Take a look at these [financial reports](https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/financials/) and tell me if this seems like an effectively managed and run outfit. No one cares about what I see as fairly obvious poor management and at its peak this company was worth over 10 Billion in market cap.\n\nIn the US everything is fragmented by unique state laws. The one unifying law is the schedule 1 status that dictates federal illegality. This is where opportunity for us lies. Due to this status that’s purely [fucking stupid](https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling) investment banks and corporations such as the one that gifted Canopy 4 Billion can not reasonably invest into these companies that are in many ways far outperforming Canopy at the time of that multi billion dollar investment. All while existing in far more attractive markets once the concern of federal interference is lifted. Imagine investing in UBER or Facebook far before a bank or large stakeholder gave them billions of dollars in return for a large interest of the company. This is where the marijuana industry is at in the United States. You can invest before the banks and financial institutions.\n\nI don’t want to go into too much detail about the Canadian market but the point is that the entire nation is comparable to the state of California with absolutely none of the branding potential due to many different factors. Canada may lead in the international market opportunities but its apparent that that is slowly developing and not as attractive as Canadian companies may hope it to be [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/monazhang/2017/11/07/global-marijuana-market-31-billion-investors-cautious/amp/). imo the US is a far more attractive business space for cannabis due to available expendable income and branding potential. \n\nAt the end of the day investing in this sector is about finding the next McDonald’s or Starbucks. Anyone can sell a cup of coffee or a shitty cheeseburger (or mediocre weed). Yet here are two mega billion dollar corporations that have billions of people across the world addicted to their product. This is what I’m looking for. As someone who is pretty experienced trying different quality weed;  in my opinion the company that takes the lead is going to be about delivering quality of product (unlike Starbucks and McDonalds) and the leader is far from established at the moment. \n\nI was going to make this a lot more detailed with more links but I’m going to leave a lot of the digging to you. Most of the info you need is going to be in the corporate documents. You should take the time and learn to read 10-q, k, and all corporate documents when making an investment of this length. I’ll start taking profits after large institutions begin making sizable investments similar to constellation’s. Could be a year, or 5. I really can’t say with certainty but I do feel it’s coming sooner rather than later with bipartisan legislation such as the [S.T.A.T.E.S. Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/STATES_Act) being introduced. The political aspect of this is continuously moving in the right direction and there is strong indication that big banks are pushing the right people towards cannabis reform with Trump signaling his support as well as other traditionally conservative (towards drug policy) politicians.\n\nCredit to u/CannaVestments for this quick [overview](https://imgur.com/a/dpv4qVi) which is accurate to my knowledge.\n\n\nEdit: This following link is an updated (continuously) version of the imgur link by u/Cannavestments \n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bgogg22ba76j65a/US%20MSO%20DD%202019.xlsx?dl=0\n\n(TCNNF) The one I like the most is Trulieve [link](https://vimeo.com/313083903). They dominate the Florida market with over 500k sq ft of grow space and soon to be 30 dispensaries. No other company dominates a region like trulieve and they are doing it in one of the most attractive marijuana markets in the world with tourism and retirees everywhere to give them their expendable income once full legalization comes into effect. Financials are attractive [link](https://www.trulieve.com/investors). The only public company in the entire industry worldwide with financials that look like an actually profitable and compelling investment. More than that is their philosophy of business. They don’t make massive acquisitions. Their 4 million dollar investment in Massachusetts (100k sq ft cultivation license + 3 dispensaries I believe) can easily turn into 4 million a quarter in roughly a year. This is good for shareholders which btw is majority insider controlled and locked up until July [link](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/trulieve-cannabis-corp-announces-voluntary-lock-up-agreements-with-company-founders-804831853.html). Right now fully diluted the company is valued around 1B in market cap. Compared to peers this is a steal. Canopy saw 10B and this company had better revs last reported quarter in 2018 (annual report due on April 30) not to mention strong profits and all the other important metrics that put its peers to shame. Compared to canopy’s valuation you can see why I’m so excited about this opportunity.\n\nI think the fear for investors here is the market is immature and people are doubting they can hold onto their lead. Florida has previously capped stores to 30 and many other operators had yet to build out. Trulieve however just won an important suit that has ruled that cap unconstitutional [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-ne-judge-marijuana-dispensaries-cap-20190204-story,amp.html). I think it’s too late for competitors and it’s trulieves market to lose based on government and legal actions recently. The cost to entry is high and every other competitor is operating in debt and making acquisitions that cost hundreds of millions of dollars instead of organic growth. \n\nThe other issue is that they don’t have the license getting skills in other states and will have to make large acquisitions going forward, which may be true but I think patience will reveal opportunity like in Massachusetts. They will target cheaper license getters or struggling license holders without the means or knowledge to buildout and use their profits while their competitors struggle with debt. This is my yolo essentially. I’ll diversify but due to share structure and insider control as well as the other factors this is the most attractive company in the US by a large margin imo. I think anything under $15 is a good buy and don’t think it stays under $20 much longer.\n\n(GTBIF) The next one I like is green thumb industries [link](https://investors.gtigrows.com/investors/overview/default.aspx). This one has been making acquisitions that have been [massive](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/11/13/1650439/0/en/Green-Thumb-Industries-Inc-GTI-Expands-with-the-Acquisition-of-Integral-Associates-Nevada-s-Top-Cannabis-Operator.html) but they aren’t stupid moves unlike some of its peers (medmen) who have spent egregious amounts on unestablished license holders. They bought a [company](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/essence-cannabis-dispensary-awarded-new-licenses-to-expand-to-california-300768648.html) that afterwards won a very unique and competitive license in West Hollywood. They also won a very competitive and valuable license in [New Jersey](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/12/17/1668365/0/en/National-Cannabis-Company-Green-Thumb-Industries-GTI-Awarded-Cultivation-Processing-and-Retail-License-in-New-Jersey.html). This is the key to long term growth in the industry while maintaining shareholder value. A license can cost a few million vs buying a license holder which can cost tens of millions or hundreds of millions depending on development so whoever has the best license getters in the industry are going to be at a serious advantage for long term growth. Financials aren’t horrible compared to the rest of the sector and they are positioned well in Illinois with around 100k sq ft in grow space. Illinois just elected a pro legalization governor. Market cap is around 1.5 B. overall I trust this company and its branding efforts (rise dispensaries) to make it an established player in the market. They are however in buildout mode so financials might not look as pretty this year and dilution will be happening and therefore will see good buying opportunities this year imo. I’d be happy to pick some more up around $7.\n\nSomething to keep in mind when doing your own due diligence is these m.s.o. (Multi state operators) like to count their unbuilt licenses as if they exist. In Florida for example, it seems companies were granted 30 dispensaries by default so a lot of mso, without even building out 1, have greatly inflated their dispensary numbers. Focus on who actually has the most buildings functioning and distributing product. That will tell you who is ahead. I personally am focused on companies that dominate an area which doesn’t necessarily mean they will have the most dispensaries-just the best locations to saturate a market. \n\n(CURLF) I don’t like curaleaf [link](https://content.equisolve.net/curaleaf/news/2018-11-26_Curaleaf_Reports_Third_Quarter_2018_Financial_and__29.pdf) because of overvaluation (mc around 2.5B) but it’s probably wise to pick up a piece of these guys when the opportunity arises. They were early in New Jersey which is a very attractive market and bring in significant revenue. They have 20 operational dispensaries in FL and over 650k sq ft of cultivation space across all states they operate in according to their investor presentation. It will be telling if they can make a significant dent to trulieves footprint in Florida or if they will be The Burger King to trulieves McDonalds. Trulieve has maintained over 60% of market share in Florida so I question Curaleafs potential to outcompete competitors in other states as well. They also are initiating a share [buyback](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/curaleaf-announces-launch-of-share-buyback-program-300760620.html) which at this stage is a huge red flag while green thumb is acquiring serious license getters and Florida competitor trulieve is opening 6 stores in the upcoming few months. I’m looking for a strong dip in the upcoming year and might buy some around $4.\n\n(Acrgf) Acreage has made some dumbfounding decisions that include millions of dollars of investment in the state of Iowa which has only legalized cbd and in general have fairly unattractive locations including Oregon and Maine [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/oregons-weed-glut-what-happens-to-excess-pot-697985/amp/). They also missed the boat in Florida and look a little desperate with this [acquisition](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/acreage-holdings-enters-florida-medical-cannabis-market-with-67-million-acquisition-natures-way/) made recently. Imo They are b listers from my due diligence (Burger King might be too much of a compliment) but they’re the best politically connected [link](https://m.benzinga.com/article/12716495) and are well positioned financially to be a force in the sector. Already distributing in Jersey (125k sqft cultivation facility) which is big. If I see stupid moves I stay away especially if they are already overvalued [link](http://investors.acreageholdings.com/file/Index?KeyFile=395942626) but this should definitely be on your radar (also has 100k sqft cultivation in NY) . This thing trades strong and I think a lot of big money is behind it. I will probably diversify and pick up some when an opportunity presents itself. Hoping to have an opportunity to buy around ~$12-15 because I don’t think they are deserving of a market cap of more than about 1.5B at the moment and currently are trading around a 3B market cap.\n\nAnother thing is to do your due diligence in each states cannabis economy as each is incredibly unique. Right now Oregon, Washington and Colorado are not business friendly (in terms of helping a balance sheet look nicer) even though Colorado and Washington are very attractive revenue wise. Some states limit monopolies or have no limit in dispensaries/cultivation which reduces economic upside at the moment. Maryland has a limit (cant find a link so might need to fact check me on this) on how much one company can own of the state which will be interesting to see how it’s upheld as the market merges. Cali has overtaxed everything so the black market continues to be very influential there but whoever takes the lead in this state (medmen currently) will be a formidable force as the black market slowly fades from existence. Nevada is a good economy due to limiting the licenses given out and flower prices were rising for a while. Vegas is huge from a branding perspective. Green thumb is the leader here after their big acquisition. Jersey is just getting around to implementing medical expansion (thanks to fat bastard aka Chris Christie) so companies there haven’t even capitalized on that population density yet. Most of this is really common sense and comes down to basic supply vs. demand economics. The northeast especially, where there are tons of non smokers without access to quality black market connects are going to pour hundreds of dollars into brick and mortar stores each month imo so I’m paying close attention to Mass/NJ/NY in the coming year to see who takes the lead there.\n\n\n(MMNFF) Medmen is garbage and idc to go in depth on why [link](https://equity.guru/2018/05/28/medmen-goes-public-tuesday-three-executives-will-make-money-deal/). It would be a lengthy write up. They have the best market penetration in Cali so far and I do think they will be relevant in 10 years but investment potential isn’t as attractive as their peers. Insiders sold out for a reason in my opinion [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/marijuana-retailer-medmen-acquires-pharmacann-for-682-million-2018-10). this acquisition is going to take a decade if not more to pay off assuming it does. Just horrible mismanagement of shareholder value IMO. \n\n(CRLBF) Cresco labs are Chicago based and have focused their efforts in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ohio [link](https://investors.crescolabs.com/investors/overview/default.aspx) Management seems to be top tier but I think it’s a little pricy at the moment (~2B) for what they own. The main guy sits on a committee with newly elected Pritzker in Illinois (140k sq ft cultivation in IL) and they will be major players I think [link](https://investors.crescolabs.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Cresco-Labs-Co-founder-and-CEO-Charles-Bachtell-Appointed-to-Cannabis-Legalization-Subcommittee-of-Illinois-Governor-elect-JB-Pritzkers-Transition-Team/default.aspx). I’m looking to diversify with these guys when an opportunity presents itself. Hoping for a chance around $5.\n\n(ITHUF) Another interesting company is Ianthus [link](https://www.ianthuscapital.com/investors). They recently merged with MPX and imo it has legitimized their future. Ianthus holds attractive licenses in NY and FL but has no proven growth or brand perception. Mpx on The other hand has strong brand perception (although recently they’ve been getting poor reviews on products) and proven growth and also holds some attractive licenses in AZ, MD, and NJ among others [link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pressofatlanticcity.com/news/two-new-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-coming-to-atlantic-city-vineland/article_8bceb880-437d-5d4e-ab89-7429c53d7fc5.amp.html).\nTogether I think they will be a value buy at some point. Unfortunately both don’t have enough operating capital to fund their growth and will need funding to execute and fulfill their potential. when an opportunity presents itself I’ll buy a small piece for diversification. I’m looking for sub $3 myself.\n\n(HTHHF) There is also Harvest Health and Recreation [link](https://www.harvestinc.com/industry-experience/). Not very familiar with them but they seem to be strong license getters and have good reviews. Definitely overpriced at the moment. I’ll look for a buy op under $4. \n\n\nA company to look out for is Columbia Care [link](https://www.col-care.com). They have a huge presence in the northeast and have yet to go public. Won a New Jersey license recently. \n\n(DXBRF) There is also Dixie brands [link](http://dixieelixirs.com/ir-dashboard/). This is where long term future is in the industry. Beverages are a socialized means of getting fucked up. The beverage leader will normalize getting high. Right now that’s Dixie. My concern here is this is decades away from normalizing. I don’t think the market for drinks is as attractive an investment short term as the actual infrastructure to grow the plant. Also my opinion is established brands such as Coca Cola will simply come in and have better brand recognition immediately. Nothing Dixie or any edible manufacturer is doing is necessarily a secret or patentable from my understanding so all the big beverage players have to do is hire the right people and they will immediately dominate a company like Dixie. \n\nSomething else to look out for is investor presentations and revenue forecasts. I’ve seen quite a few but the one that stands out the most is acreages that was just absolute bullshit. Do not under any circumstance trust guidance from companies. I think revenues will grow slower than most will admit but the market will continue to overvalue these companies as we get closer to large capital investing in the US cannabis space. Companies that have established presence in growing markets such as Trulieve I’ll trust far more than unestablished companies with poor footing like Acreage to give accurate projections. At the end of the day there are too many variables in a completely new market segment to rely on company projections.\n\nOther ancillary companies for “safer” investment include Scott’s Miracle Grow (SMG) which I think will dominate the self grow industry as well as the commercial growing infrastructure based on some of their recent acquisitions. The other sector I’m somewhat familiar with is mass spectrometry. Labs to test marijuana composition are going to be a huge need and mass spectrometers and liquid chromatography will be in high demand. I know Waters (WAT) specializes in spectrometry. Also (TMO) Thermo Fisher and (PKI) PerkinElmer for laboratory needs. I haven’t actually done my due diligence on these guys financials and fundamentals though.\n\n\nThat’s it I think. Some smaller players exist but these are the big boys that have the most growth potential. If you have a thought, question or comment about anything I’d love to hear it, especially if you are familiar with any of these companies or have your own personal insights to share. There will likely be more relevant companies that go public so I’ll keep my eyes open and let you know if I see anything worthwhile. I’m looking forward to the market consolidating when bigger money gets to join in. These are just my opinions so do your own due diligence and best of luck!\n\n", "id": "apkd46", "created_utc": 1549915669.0, "score": 1069, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 184, "comments": [{"body": "Loved the post.

Might give Cali a run for its money (or lack of).\n\nAnd I’m looking at cgc from a numbers stand point. An effective company doesn’t waste money. If you do your due diligence on a company such as trulieve and look at financials you see a well run machine that isn’t wasteful and is financially efficient with a profitable business model in a much more difficult medical landscape in a much more cannabis unfriendly environment. CGC has always been in a very similar position to Trulieve which has no rec numbers either but still strongly outperformed the Canadian company.\n\nQ over q numbers look horrible because they cooked the books growing too fast and inefficiently so as to build their assets. CGC is the government play and I don’t buy that they weren’t integral in writing the legislation themselves. That company is oozing with government connections.

That would negate your statement that American companies are overvalued and support buying a company like trulieve which trade at 4x future earnings. I don’t really think you’ve done you’re due diligence into the American sector if you think these companies are overvalued. Some of these will be worth 20B + and yes multiple will be IMO.

Trulieve completely dominates the state in every way, they’re orders of magnitude ahead of the competition.  They must have great lobbyists and lawyers because they’ve kept the barrier to entry into doing business in Florida ridiculously high to ensure they maintain their virtual monopoly with (full vertical integration), and also won a lawsuit allowing them to open more dispensaries.  This week home cultivation in FL took a major set back with Joe Redner losing to the state on appeal, which means the only place people are getting their product is from dispensaries (which trulieve has 60%+ market share).  They’re making strategic acquisitions and are strong in markets that will be huge once they mature and feds reschedule.  Many of their grows are multi tiered, meaning their 500k sq ft is actually probably more like 750.  Their operations are state of the art and their team is strong, I know them personally.

I believe they’ll be gone by 2020 latest which will leave Hawthorne as the only real show.  Hawthorne is selling direct to commercial cultivation, which is a pivot from their traditional model of selling only through hydroponic stores.  Commercial is a huge market and they are bringing a level of professionalism and technology that is unparalleled by anyone else in the industry.  They’re in every retail hydroponic store as well ensuring they’ll dominate the home growing market.  We’ve traditionally been at a 75%/25% ratio Hydrofarm/Hawthorne in terms of purchasing for the last decade.  We’re probably at 90/10 now Hawthorne/Hydrofarm because Hawthorne has stepped it up across the board (catalog offerings, service, pricing, logistics etc) while hydrofarm has floundered.  \n\nOne op didn’t mention that might be worth looking into is Grow Generation.  They’re trading on the pink sheets now, but hear me out.  They’ve raised quite a bit of money and have made some extremely strategic investments over the last quarter.  They bought 3 very influential stores recently, chlorophyll in Denver being the most important.  They’re on pace to do 100m in sales this year without any other acquisitions.  They also bought out BWGS inventory at liquidation for like 10 cents on the dollar.  This was not something they planned for and came spur of the moment.  Mother fuckers beat us to it, we were gonna buy all the inventory.  Classic case of big bank taking little bank.  This is going to pump that bottom line HARD.  They’re going to beat revenue expectations by a mile, mark my words.  These guys are sharp and they’re buying up all the stores (and more importantly the human capital along with) that are players in the market.  They’re purchasing proprietary brands and starting to have the ability to source product direct from manufacturers in huge volume, bypassing traditional wholesalers like Hawthorne, and adding all that profit to the bottom line.  They looked rocky last year but are really starting to the put the pieces together, build a team and marketshare and execute on their plan.  Shit I might sell them my business and go work with them.  This is one to watch.  Let me know before you guys go full blown autistic though so I can buy some calls.\n\nAnd op was dead on about MedMen.  I wouldn’t fuck with them with ops dick and any of you losers pushing.  They’re a fucking dumpster fire that could’ve been a gold mine.  \n\nDixie is going to get snapped up by a major brand once we get rescheduled.
