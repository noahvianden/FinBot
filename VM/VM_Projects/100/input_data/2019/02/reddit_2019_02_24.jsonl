If they can stream at like at least 3440x1440 at 60fps, if not 100+ FPS, with ultra low latency... then maybe, but its more likely to be at like 1080 and 30fps at most and with some lag, which is awful for most games in this day and age on PC, and barely acceptable on consoles.\n\nConsole gamers seem to have a fetish for owning physical copies, which is probably smart. While PC almost always has options to allow for re-downloading games on Steam and elsewhere, consoles and their games have a finite lifespan for network support; i.e. physical copies allow you play as long as you have a working console, while your purchase of a digital copy on console may become null once network support for the console sunsets.\n\nA \"Netflix\" of gaming also has content curation issues too. Newer, more popular games will be largely available, but less popular and more obscure games may not make the cut financially (like how licences come and go for content on Netflix and you see movies and shows being dropped and added all the time). It leaves you up to the whims of the curators and game that you would normally play through in your \"Steam backlog\" (essentially the backlog of games that gamers have from buying many games they don't plan to play immediately, due various sales on content and such), may not always be available.\n\nIt may work well for controlled tests with small groups of users, but scaling it up likely won't work as well. Then there are the network bandwidth caps and throttling that ISPs artificially introduce to charge users more fees, which will make users less and less interested in a streaming option. Video may be acceptable at a compressed level, but it takes a lot more to stream a game due to the constant back and forth to update the game state.\n\nVideo really only uses your download speed (the often advertised speed) and most consumers aren't aware that their upload speed is often much, much slower (often at only around 10% of their download). Upload speed is just as important as download with streaming games, because rather than passively receiving data with little to no interaction, you are now needing to constantly take input from the user update the game state and then send that data back to the user.\n\nMicrosoft is also targeting a streaming for the next gen Xbox too (rumors say that they are trying for a streaming only model; originally the Xbox One wasn't even supposed to use discs as seen in the original announcement for it), but its unsure it will ever see the light of day.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hopefully true.

There's also some new techniques emerging that will likely help with this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DPRt3AcUEY\n\n> 25Mbps is not enough though is it?\n\nIf it's enough for netflix, it's enough for gaming.

There's edge computing and then there's what the big guys like amazon and Google are doing. They aren't just dropping a sever into a network closet and calling it a day. They are taking the same approach to what they did with youtube to make it able to deal with viral videos. Most people can't do this because they don't have the network to support it. Google has POPs within a few miles of the vast majority of customers and dark fiber routes back to their DCs which they fully control.\n\n> Let's take a distance of 1600km , about 1000 miles as the closest datacenter.\n\nThe closest DC is more like 300-400 miles and the closest edge site where the video rendering would be happening is more like 10-30 miles.\n\n> Light travels at aroud 186 miles / 300 kms per millisecond\n\nThe speed of light through fiber optic is 124 miles per ms, not 186.\n\n> that means about 5 milliseconds latency just for light to hit the datacenter.\n\nWhich is irrelevant. The time it would take for light to hit closest compute node in a network closest would be ~.25ms or .5 round trip. Though this is ignoring overhead which would probably double or triple that number.\n\n> See why this isn't as good as they say it is?\n\nNot sure who's saying anything about \"how good it is\", but I don't see any major issues.

I don’t think any of us needs to “get a grip.”  The irony and suspicion is overwhelmingly present in this situation.  What might he have been alluding to with such detail down to the manufacturer and the f’in date???  You stats on planes in the sky is cool or whatever but it only further confirms and reminds us just how shady this post was.  Whatever job title he claimed to have is 100% irrelevant in regards to his post.  The relevant aspects of his post were the words “Boeing”, “this Saturday”, and last but certainly not least “something will happen.”  No single person can predict a plane crash?  Really?  Seems like he literally did exactly that.  I have a tiny feeling that Bin Laden and his cronies probably were able to predict not one, but multiple plane crashes in back 2001 including the time in which they would happen, and exactly where they would happen.  Remember that?  Were you even born yet?  I’m just saying.  I would be willing to bet that multiple authorities would be heavily interested in such a post so I guess it’s a good thing you likely do not work for any such authorities as you would tell your co-workers “get a grip...there’s no way some man planned, coordinated, and funded planes flying into buildings...there’s at least 13,000 planes in the sky at once guys so just drop it.”  The reality is that ANYONE in the world affiliated with ANY type of organization could have been at the other end of that post.  It’s not so much that we are all conspiracy mongers with foil hats.  It’s more like that post LITERALLY claimed, warned, or alluded directly to the fact that something will directly impact Boeing and it will happen Saturday.  Well by golly a fuckin Boeing plane crashed...this Saturday.\n\nNot out of the question for some of us realists to want some type of answers or explanation from him directly.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Theoretically speaking, one of these bastards in the sub could have put out a mark with their mad tendies. \n\nEdit: Who the fuck am I kidding?
