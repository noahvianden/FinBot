So I would recommend investigating funds that have shown good performance in the recent downturn - and also have a look at their top holdings by company and by sector. \n\nI would certainly try and pick up an emerging markets fund, as long term view would support the idea that these counties/ geographies  (India, South America, broadly speaking...) would hopefully enjoy continental growth with the development of their people.\n\nThere’s a case to be made about passive vs active management. Personally I think a mixture of both is adequate and manages for risk very well and should give you a good return if you get a good selection and balance. \n\nI’m not sure how things work in the Us but I would try and pick up accumulation units of a fund. This will mean dividends are snowballed up and reinvested, instead of being paid out.\n\nUltimately, they key for ensuring risk management is through diversification. Fair enough, you can plough it all in to a S&P500 tracker and enjoy a decent change of strong upside. But you a prisoner to the single line of passive management.

You are down with it with no chance of a bounce back. \n\nThe market would come back, eventually - but that’s money you may have lost and may take a while to return. \n\nIf just be wary and remind yourself that past performance is not an indicator of future success.
