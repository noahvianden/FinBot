Revenue growth and cash generation are the two most financial metrics. Tesla is likely to generate enough cash internally from here on than they need (they may raise more to grow faster although) and they will continue to grow their revenue 60% per year for the next 5 years or so. That would be roughly 2.5 to 3 million cars produced in 2023. Tesla is likely to reach 4-500k this year. 8-900k next year. If we assume 900k and 3 years to ramp to 2.5 to 3million units depending on mix. That’s the same ramp rate Tesla reached from Q1 to Q4, I.e. 9 months. But they would have 3 years to do so (end of 2020 to 2023). \n\nThis also completely ignores upside from autonomy and other potential products such as solar roof. If autonomy works, that’s about 7k of straight net profit per car and could move Tesla’s net margins from 5-10% to 20-25%. 200b revenue at 20% is 40b profit. What PE is reasonable for a company with that profitability and growth matrix. 30-40x? 30x would make it a 1.2trillion dollar company with about 20x stock appreciation from today. \n\nEven if they only hit half that profitability, I.e. no autonomy, they will be worth 10x based on above growth numbers. \n\nFor perspective Tesla almost produced as many cars in 2018 as it has done in every year its been around for. If this continued for the next 5 years they would make 8 million cars in 2023. So I’m already accounting for a steep deceleration in their growth rate.

They can do 100k S/X and 350k Model 3 at Freement. You think they'll be producing 7k a week in China next year?  The company is hoping to get production started this year, and are targeting an initial production rate of 3k a week.  Model Y production will be essentially nothing in 2020 per the company....\n\n> If we assume 900k\n\nOr we could assume a realistic number.\n\n> and 3 years to ramp to 2.5 to 3million units depending on mix.\n\nSure, they'll just increase production by 2 million cars a year in three years!  No problem!  Again, where are they going to produce those cars?  The company lost $3 billion over the past two years ramping from 100k per year to 350k per year of production.  How much are they going to lose going from 350k to 2.75mm? \n\n> That’s the same ramp rate Tesla reached from Q1 to Q4, I.e. 9 months.  \n\nNo, they increased production capacity by about 200k on an annual basis over that period.  And they lost $1 billion in the process.  You are talking about increasing production by 10 times that amount.  \n\n> If autonomy works, that’s about 7k of straight net profit per car and could move Tesla’s net margins from 5-10% to 20-25%.\n\nThis is assuming that a company like GM or Nissan (who are in discussions to partner with Google) doesn't beat Tesla to the punch.  No way does Tesla get away with charging 7k for features that come out years after they are available on other cars.    \n\n> and could move Tesla’s net margins from 5-10% to 20-25%\n\nTesla is already charging tons of people 5k for EAP, and their net margins are nowhere near 5-10%.  \n\n> 200b revenue at 20% is 40b profit.\n\nLOL at 200b of revenue.  GM sells 10 million cars a year and their revenue is less than 150b.  And as mentioned, Tesla has not shot at 20% net margins, they would be thrilled hitting 10%.  \n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla is likely low-balling the guidance. It matters less whether they hit 400k, or 500k, as to the run rate output that they hit at the end of the year. I'll split out my estimates based on a per factory basis:\n\n2019:  \nFremont - 400k total  \nChina - wild card, potentially 30-50k.\n\n2020:  \nFremont - 400k total  \nChina - 350k  \nGiga 1 - 50k\n\n2021:\n\nFremont - 450k total  \nChina - 500k  \nGiga 1 - 400k\n\n2022:   \nFremont - 500k total  \nChina - 700k  \nGiga 1 - 700k\n\nEurope - 50k\n\n2023:   \nFremont - 500k total  \nChina - up to 1 million (may need two factories for this)\n\nGiga 1 - up to 1 million\n\nEurope - 300k.   \n\n\nTesla has said that they \" are targeting annualized Model 3 output in excess of 500,000 units sometime between Q4 of 2019 and Q2 of 2020\".\n\nTesla increased production from 34,000 units in Q1 to 80,142 in Q3. This is 2.34x in 6 months. If Tesla hits 800k units produced in 2020 (which is very much dependent on China) this means they have 3 years to 3x to 2.4million units. This would mean that from the end of 2020, Tesla would need to grow their annual production by 55% per year for 3 years. \n\nThey could do this with 3 or 4 factories:\n\n* Fremont: already scaled mostly, and potentially could be scaled further past 500k with more capex. \n* Giga 1: all that needs to be done is a building built, and the lines set up. only 35% of Giga's original design is currently being used. New 'squares' will be added on as they need more battery production/car lines.\n* China: This is mostly a cut and paste job from their already designed factories. It will probably be designed in a modular fashion like Giga 1, and will facilitate a fast build out. \n\nEven if Tesla only gets to 2 million units, and not 2.5million or 3 million. That is still unbelievable growth.   \n\n\nI didn't say the autonomy thing was in the bag, it's a massive upside that Tesla has, that no other Automaker really has (other than GM, but their technology is the same strategy as Waymo). Waymo/GM require LIDAR and so if Tesla is able to solve it without there will be a ridiculous cost advantage. The current Enhanced Autopilot sales are probably about half of the cars, but this is expected to dramatically decrease as people buy the SR version, and the vast majority of sales (say 70%) need to be the short range version for them to hit 2.5 million volume at ASP of 42k.   \n\n\nYou are also completely ignoring the solar/battery business. The battery business should continue to grow very very well. This year it was 200% growth on prior year (3x) and guidance was for 2x, but Elon mentioned they are aiming for 3x. The real inflection point comes when Tesla can reduce the cost of batteries about 30-40% at the product level for PowerWall. At this point, everyone will want to buy one + solar as it makes economic sense to do so. At this point, they can borrow as much money as they want, and roll out as many battery factories as fast as they can. The market opportunity here is astounding. My estimates are that something like 10-30% of global GDP is spent on energy. @10% that's $6 trillion per year of electricity/gas/oil/coal etc spending. 1% market share of that is 60b, and that doesn't account for any global growth. \n\nRevenues in 2023 could look like this:  \n1 million Model Y - ASP 42k  \n700 Model 3 - ASP 40k  \n200k Model S/X - ASP 80k  \n600k trucks - ASP 60k  \nAutomotive revenue = 122m  \nEnergy revenue \\~50B (this year was around 1.5b growing to 50b in 5 years would be a 100% growth rate per year. \n\nOther revenue fills in the rest. I remind you that there are \\~80m cars a year sold in the world. Tesla would not have even 3.2% of the global market to get to 2.5m sales.  \n\n\nThis would represent about 55% CAGR over the next 5 years. If Tesla only gets to 100b revenue by 2023 that would be 35% CAGR in revenue.   \nIf you take 5% net margin at the 100b revenue level, thats 5b net income. 30x PE for a 35% growth company nets you about 3x stock price to today. This is ignoring any benefits Tesla might have from Autonomy, scaleable software advantages, battery advantages etc. They may be able to generate more like 10% net margin, and then it's a 6x. At 200b revenue & 10% net margins, its 12x. Add in autonomy profits from FSD/Tesla network? You might get 20-30x your investment in 5-10 years. There is a chance that that happens, not saying large, but maybe 5-10%. This is why I'm investing in Tesla because the upside opportunity is MASSIVE, and everyone underestimates Tesla in the long term. No one would have expected them to get to this point. They have established a trend of smashing long term expectations. I do not expect them to stop now.   \n\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Tesla is likely low-balling the guidance.\n\nSo you think the company is lying, got it.\n\n> Tesla has said that they \" are targeting annualized Model 3 output in excess of 500,000 units sometime between Q4 of 2019 and Q2 of 2020\".\n\nGuess what?  They also said they were targeting annualized Model 3 output in excess of 500,000 units by the end of last quarter.  But then again, as you noted, the company does tell some lies....  \n\nYour revenue numbers are, frankly, a dream.  600k trucks at $60k a pop?  Sure!  \n\nJust LOL at your assuming about the energy business growth rate.  Sure, they'll totally grow 100% per year for 5 years!  No problem!

I’ve completely ignored the semi truck, the roadster and any other new product lines Tesla comes up with in the next 5 years. I’ve also not included any revenue from potential FSD/Tesla network. \n\nToyota sells 10 million cars a year at a revenue of 250m. That’s an ASP if maybe 22k. The average transaction price of a car in the USA is 35k, and there are 17 million cars sold a year. Implying that ~ 8 million are sold above that price. There’s also the fact that you need to adjust the ASP for the PV of fuel savings when comparing to an ICE car. It depends on how much you drive but for anyone that drives a long way per day, for example if they are commuting 200 miles a day, an EV is substantial cheaper than an equivalently priced ICE. For the average person the present value might be 3-4K of savings. \n\nYeas growth is likely smaller in 2019 as there will be no new capacity coming online, or very little. 2020 will see the China factory running at 500k annualised rate at some point and Giga 1 making Model y’s at maybe a similar 250k annualised rate. It’s quite easy to see Tesla double cars produced in 2020 vs 2019. \n\nIf we would have had this conversation 5 years ago when Tesla’s revenue was 2billion a year, would you have thought that they would reach 22billion in 2018? The answer is no. 200b revenue in 5 years is optimistic and requires Tesla to execute extremely well. But even if they hit half of that, it will still prove to be a good investment. At this point Tesla is not going ‘bankrupt’ they will pay off the 920m and have another 500m due in Q4. There’s then about 2 years until the next large debt repayment. Tesla will succeed solely on its ability to out innovate its competition. Frankly I think it’s too late for the majority of EU/USA car companies to catch up. China will be Tesla’s real competition in 5-10 years.

If the business didn't shrink last quarter I'd have an easier time getting on board.\n\n> I’m sure their ASP is around 60k.\n\nNot quite.\n\n> Yeah service and other was about 8% of revenue this Q.\n\nThey have negative margins in that segment, so the more it grows the more it drains earnings though.  That is actually something to keep an eye on as service requirements will increase as they get more cars on the road.\n\n> I’ve completely ignored the semi truck, the roadster and any other new product lines Tesla comes up with in the next 5 years.\n\nSemi timing is a bit of an unknown, but I can certainly see that making a positive contribution down the road.  The roadster is a niche product that has been around for over a decade and doesn't move the needle much at all.  I'm not sure what other products they will develop in the next five years, but I doubt they will be bringing in 10s of billions a year if they aren't even on the drafting board now.  \n\n> I’ve also not included any revenue from potential FSD/Tesla network.\n\nThat good, because there is not much indication that will exist by 2023.  \n\nNot going to debate about the production numbers.
