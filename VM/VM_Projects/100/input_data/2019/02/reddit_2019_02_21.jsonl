Tesla is a company that is valued most appropriately by where they are likely to be 5-10 years from now, and the market's willingness to do that sort of thing can vary tremendously. It failed to do so with Netflix back in 2012, and what you saw with that is a price:sales ratio that EXPANDED every year for 7 years which defies the typical logic you would expect from laws of large numbers where the expectation is slowing growth.\n\nBut this is reminding me how dumb it is to try to time the market.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I bought a 290p and a 295c, because I don't think it will just hang out in between them.

I've been saying this for awhile now. Most stocks can be boiled down to where one variable is half the story, and for Tesla that is the cost of producing that 3. Given the Y is essentially a copy, and if you presume 1M unit sales between the two of them, then every $1,000 of cost is 1B$ in profit differential.
