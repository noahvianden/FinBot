How is that healthy?\n\n\n>in addition to the fact that they over 3bn in net income since '98 as well.\n\nNet income is easily manipulated by capitalizing expenses and many other accounting tactics...take a look at the book \"Financial Shenanigans\" by Howard Schilit.

No business that has negative cash flow from operations can survive long term. Eventually debt will come due and they won't have the cash to pay for it, and won't be able to finance it more because they have too much debt and not enough cash flow. If it helps your understanding, think of it in terms of your own finances: if you start a business selling widgets and it costs you $10 to create every widget but you can only sell them for $3, your business itself makes no money. You can remedy this with financing by taking out a business loan, but that loan has a due date and eventually must be paid back. No matter how you look at it, unless you either raise prices or cut costs your business will never be profitable, even though you can create the illusion of profitability by stuffing all the cash from your business loan in the bank and using some of it to invest in improving your operations.\n\n\n>I wholeheartedly disagree with your statement that NFLX cannot continue as we have over a decade of information that proves your statement wrong.\n\nWell time will tell I guess! The last decade has been a massive bull market and until very recently was graced with extremely low interest rates. Companies like NFLX took advantage of that and have enjoyed spectacular growth because of it. There is however a difference between a company that enjoys spectacular growth in the quality/diversity of their business (e.g. AMZN) and a company that enjoys spectacular growth in the illusion of revenue and net income they've created (e.g. NFLX).\n\nAnyway, we're all entitled to our opinions.

I'm not comparing NFLX to Enron, just saying that you're being duped if you believe Netflix is actually making money and you're ignoring operating cash flow, valuing the business based on the amount of cash on the balance sheet and their net income and speculating on whether their content investments are going to pay off. \n\nI don't disagree that NFLX is here to stay. All I'm saying is it's ridiculously overvalued and has been for years. The average investor doesn't look at the reality of a business's financials...they look at EPS, net income, and revenue growth. ALL of those things are very easily manipulated and it can be done legally and within GAAP, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a facade. Yes their assets have grown, but their assets are valued with a huge amount of discretion from management and are very difficult to value and liquidate. That affects their credit standing and their ability to continue to fund their growth with debt. Just take a look at their [asset/liability distribution](https://i.imgur.com/NKDgYu1.jpg) showing that over 80% of their asset base is intangible ... how do you liquidate an intangible asset? How does Coca Cola accurately value their brand name? It's generally not a good thing if 80% of your asset base is made up of assets that you just slapped a value on and said yep, this is worth $x because that's what we think.\n\nAnyway, this will be my last post on the subject but I really do suggest you read the book I mentioned above. Even if you don't agree with me, it's a really great book and will open your eyes a lot to how easily things like net income, EPS, revenue, assets and liabilities can be manipulated, and why things like operating cash flow and free cash flow are so important.\n\nCheers!\n\nEDIT: And BTW I 1000000% agree about TSLA also - though I think TSLA is much more likely to be using accounting games than NFLX is.

FAANG as a whole is overvalued. the entire SPX is arguably overvalued right now compared to fundamentals. since NFLX doesn't have a clear competitor as a business, I think its pretty difficult to conclude that the current valuation is ridciulous. I think at this current moment you have to say that its current valuation is reasonable. if NFLX were to start missing estimates for multiple quarters, I could start to lean more to poor valuation.\n\nif we want to go into speculation, their assets must be pretty close to market value since we are talking about recent financials (2-3 yrs) and IMO NFLX is using good business practices so NFLX is under the impression what their buying is undervalued. I think that is some useful insight into their opinion on the future of the entertainment space. NFLX would know that because they've been in the business as long as they have, have the talent to draw better conclusions on the future, and have a history of success adapting to do well in the market. here's a fun experiment, if NFLX charged all of its users 50$ / mth, would you think the company was at fair value? what if they charged users 100$ / month to match cable? at what price point is NFLX max? what price would they have to charge in order for them to fair valued for you? \n\nI'll definitely check the book out and I have really enjoyed our chat.

In that sense, sure, NFLX is a fair value assuming they can maintain their current operations and growth levels. The main issue I have with NFLX is that currently, based on their financials alone (not based upon any speculation, asset valuation, etc), they are burning way too much cash, have way too much debt, and it's getting worse. If you bring speculation into the picture then things definitely change.\n\n> if NFLX were to start missing estimates for multiple quarters, I could start to lean more to poor valuation.\n\nAnd that's what the above would lead me to believe could easily start happening in the near to mid-term future. Time will tell on that, but they've gotta do something to get that cash burn and debt under control or they're going to have a hard time getting financing to keep their growth going as it has been. And at the same time ... is meeting estimates really the most important thing? NFLX could continue masking poor operations for years and continue to meet estimates, but IMO that only means it will be a more violent fallout in the end.\n\n> here's a fun experiment, if NFLX charged all of its users 50$ / mth, would you think the company was at fair value? what if they charged users 100$ / month to match cable? at what price point is NFLX max? what price would they have to charge in order for them to fair valued for you?\n\nThis is a good point but also again a speculative one - because at $50-100+ per month they would surely lose a large number of subscribers to other streaming companies like DIS, AMZN, etc which have positive cash flow and more diversified income streams, and would in this event also have much lower prices. IMO given NFLX's current situation raising prices too much would be corporate suicide.
