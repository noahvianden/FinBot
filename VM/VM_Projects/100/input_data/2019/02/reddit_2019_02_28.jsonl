Some years back, a good $10 million idea could do wonders for us (witness our investment in Washington Post in 1973 or GEICO in 1976).

So making some BIG assumptions, let's say the ES6 has an ARPU of $55,000, and they do 1.5x the annualized deliveries of the ES8 (60,000). Let's also assume ES8 deliveries stay around the same rate as they are now (40,000, though this number is likely to increase far more). \n\nThey'll deliver 100,000 vehicles in 2019, for a revenue of just under $5.9 billion (what is that like 6x revenue growth?). This is also right in line with the estimates from JAC and NIO regarding their annual output. Remember, Tesla is only projecting they'll do 500k across their product line _this year_ as well. Tsla marketcap is 50bln, NIO marketcap is 10bln.\n\nSo all that being said, if earnings go well I could see 20-30% upside from where we're at now ($12-$13). The IPO lockup is a bit of a dark horse, but just because people _can_ sell doesn't mean they _will_. Given the huge number of people that have yet to buy a car in China, NIO has a huge base of people to sell to and could easily outpace Tesla as early as 2020 in terms of deliveries and production.
