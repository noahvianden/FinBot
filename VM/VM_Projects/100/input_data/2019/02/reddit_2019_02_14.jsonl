When you are investing what you want to understand is how the asset has performed historically (in this case $ / sqft, cap rates, etc.) and identify mispricings based off of the reasonableness of where the asset is priced today vs. what the base rates of historical metrics have been with plus ups / minuses for high probability future impacts to those metrics. This is an informal baysean type of analysis proposed by investors like Seth Klarman and Michael Maubisson. What you look for is a margin of safety with respect to the current metrics and price with respect to the historical range of metrics and prices. The difference here is that there was a “new paradigm” that created a need to believe that 1) Amazon would move its HQ to NYC, 2) it would not split its headquarters as previously mentioned and bring all 25k employees to Long Island City, 3) that a significant portion of the 25k would move to Long Island City and not Manhattan and Brooklyn, and finally 4) that additional rental supply would not be developed until the market rates were driven down to the stable long run cap rates (it would stand to reason that if there were outsized rents to be earned in Long Island city that developers would build up the area until the excess economic profit pool was depleted back to normalized levels). What you are proposing is that all of the four things above were a given, that there was indeed a new paradigm in New York area rents, and that the buyers ahead of the demand wave were investing based off of first principles instead of pursing a land grab and bidding up condos (this is the key difference bw investing and speculating).
