For reference 4Q was 7.2bn. 3Q was 6.8bn. what happens to the growth story when you have both sequential and year over year declines in top line revenue? \n\nAre all the hopes of Tesla in \"Full Self Driving (TM)\"", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla needs to increase deliveries \\~17% at similar ASP on Q2 deliveries of \\~95k (this assumes all revenue needed comes from car sales). This is \\~111k vehicles in one Q, i.e. an additional 16k vehicles.  China has the capacity for 3k per week, which is \\~36k per Q. If you back out the delivery bump of 7k and add 3k more to transit. This gives you an additional delivery required of \\~26k. I.e. once China is running \\~ 80% capacity they will likely exceed revenues. This is likely to happen \\~ Q2 or Q3 2020.\n\nAlso, these figures ignore any incremental battery storage/solar revenue. Energy and storage revenue has been mostly flat over the last 12 months. Solar deployments have been decreasing and this has been hiding the fact that energy storage revenues have been growing. Once solar starts to reverse and battery storage keeps growing, it will start contributing to revenue growth. \n\nAlso, Tesla is still likely to post annual growth from 2018 to 2019 because Q1 and Q2 were materially lower in 2018 vs 2019. We're sitting at $10.9B revenue for 2019H1 vs $7.4B for 2019H1. 2018H2 was $14.1B. 2019H2 should be at least $13B. This would take them to $23.9B for the year, compared with 21.4B in 2018. That would represent 16% growth after a year in which they grew 82.5%. Tesla tends to grow a lot in one year (as the new factory or product line comes on) and then grow more slowly in the second year as they normalise production. The argument that 'Tesla isn't growing anymore' is kind of myopic and one-dimensional. You need to look at the long term trajectory and decide whether they are going to continue on a similar trajectory. One interesting anecdote is that even in a 'greenie state' such as California tesla only has 5% of the total automotive sales. The car market is so large that Tesla doesn't need to take 50% to justify anywhere near close to its current valuation.\n\nAnother point is that of cash flow. Tesla's cash flow profile over the last 12 months has been quite good, and it remains to be seen how that changes over the next 12 months. If they can maintain FCF+ and good operational cash flow (to support capex), it is likely the stock moves higher even if they aren't posting 50%+ revenue growth. annually.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "first I want to thank you for a well thought out comment and information. I would counter and say that you are relying on ASP's staying the same as Q2, which we see is not the case per EU delivery date, and second deliveries increasing 17%. Tesla went up roughly 5% over their best quarter before Q2, which was Q4, so I  find 17% a huge jump and unattainable. Furthermore the production of the factory can't prodcue that many vehicles, even 7k a week which is not the case yet wouldn't get them there (and including 15k a Q of Model S and X). \n\nSo if you get china running well, a big if, you have massive obligations to the Chinese government in taxes you need to account for, not sure you are doing that. Also that 80%\\^ capacity line is pulled out of nowhere. \n\nWill annual growth metrics matter when sequential and y/y growth metrics are negative. If tesla is negative growth in both 3Q and 4Q on a year over year and sequential basis do you think people will care about cumulative annual growth? especially for stock so looked after. You are also making a BIG assumption saying 2H 2019 is going to be at least 13B. I find it hard that they will eclipse 11BN. Year over year by half will look very bad when you compare 2H 2019 to 2H 2018, so another very bad data point. \n\nI think you taking cumulative growth rates at the end of 4Q is much more one dimensional than me by modeling out each quarter and comparing both y/y and sequentially. \n\nFurthermore, saying the car market is so large is one of the worst arguments someone can make. I make my own cheese, well the cheese market is huge so I should capture 1% of that... (fyi i don't make my own cheese)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, saying they were cash flow positive is factually correct but shows a lack of understanding in the manufacturing business, which tesla is in. They have severely underspent on CAPEX not just for their production facilities but for any support facilities like service centers and superchargers. Superchargers over total vehicles that need charging keeps becoming a smaller raio every quarter, that does not bode well for customer loyalty. The fact tesla spends less on CAPEX than depreciation should be a red flag to everyone who knows anything about the capital intensive business that tesla is in (they manufacture cars they are not a tech company). Tesla's main cash balance is a function of them raising capital, not of operating leverage or a great business model. Because you expect so much growth what is your 2025 ebitda expectation? or p.e multiple? what growth do they need to have for the next 5 years to get to a 12x ebitda multiple (which would be unrealistic but lets call it that multiple) at today's share price? also revenue growth matters until someone needs to become profitable, which musk said he would be, but has failed to do so", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "ASP will continue to decline slowly over time, I'm expecting that. I only used the 17% as an indication of how far Tesla is away from all time revenue highs. If you look at Tesla holistically they are 13.8% away from all time revenue highs (Q2 compared to Q4). It is unclear what the max production out of Fremont is. Nummi produced ~450k cars out of this factory at its peak, so Tesla is currently operating quite a bit lower than this (348k annualised). I expect they can get up to ~100k per Q production out of Fremont, maybe even more if they expand paint-shop & put Model Y there. \n\nTaxes owed to the Chinese government won't move the needle. The profitability of the China factory will be substantially higher than Fremont. This is the second time they are building Model 3 lines, and history tells us that Tesla learns over time. \n\nSequential made no difference in Q1/Q2 2019 when they posted massive growth numbers compared to Q1/Q2 in 2018. Why would they matter all of a sudden? It depends who the investors are. I'm looking at Tesla as a 10-20 year investment, so I don't really care what the quarterly numbers are. What matters to me more is firstly product, and secondly, whether Tesla has the financial ability to grow their production & infrastructure. I'm expecting Tesla to continue Q2 mostly into Q3/Q4 which gets you to $13B. An assumption of $11B assumes either a large delivery drop or a larger ASP drop than ever experienced. \n\nYou can model each quarter, but you can't ignore the reasons why. It doesn't matter if Tesla has no growth in 2H2019 if you're a long term investor. What matters is the trajectory and what will happen over the next 3-5 years. \n\nThe argument of TAM is not a poor argument. It gives you a sense of how much market cap the market can sustain. It's not to say that Tesla will get X market share, but it gives you an indication of how much market dominance Tesla needs to achieve its valuation. \n\nAgain, Bears now love to argue against the 'facts', which is what they criticised the Bulls for doing prior to 2018H2. The fact is that Tesla has reached FCF+, and OCF+. Which is the first time they have reached this on an annual basis. Capex could go either way. Maybe they are being more efficient with their capex expenditure now that they have established all of their product platforms, or it could be that they are underinvesting. We won't know for another 12-24 months.\n\nIn terms of my expectations, I expect broadly the following: 1. Tesla will continue to have the best in class EV based on underlying technologies, i.e. battery tech, motor tech, software and integration. 2. They will grow materially from here. I originally expected ~3m vehicles in 2023, but this is looking like it will be closer to ~ 2m vehicles in 2023. EBITDA/PE modelling is like taking a stab in the dark, but I would expect their P/S ratio to stay around ~2. \n\nThe way I see Tesla is that i'm buying two things: 1. the car business, 2. free options on battery storage, solar & autonomy. If they hit autonomy first, it's a $1T+ company. Solar/battery opportunity is horrendously large, i.e. 20-30% of worlds GDP is spent on energy. Tesla only needs to be able to keep the machine turning and they will be successful.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Did you see how the stock reacted after 1Q and 2Q, financials mattered, for growth investors not as much as they could cling to y/y... that comp is now done because it will be negative. Why would a growth investor hold on to a firm expecting to shrink? Which it will do in the 4Q as well. Why does everyone think giga 3 will be profitable? Because Elon says so? He said Fremont would be, and the model 3 would be, and neither of those are true. He said solar city would be, not true again. \n\nYou are already seeing a worse mix, and therefore worse margin in the Eu, why do you assume 3Q would be better than 2Q? There are no data points that I am aware of that show that. If you’re a long term investor what growth happens now has a meaningful impact on later because of compounding estimates, you may say Tesla is the best product (debateable) and I the best position to win EV (debateable) which is the future (debateable) which I would say is a debatable argument. I would argue they don’t have the financial strength to get there, which is more like what we are arguing now. I will say the TAMand % argument is generally weak: I could make up any scenario and extrapolate TAM and a share, the difficult part is discountingthe likelihood of the event, which no one really talks about. \n\nFinally, I will give you that they were fcf+ in Q2, barely, and operating cash flow positive (though if you’re not accounting for CAPEX what are you really doing) but I would push back and say they severely underspent on CAPEX and if you talk to anyone I the industry it is a bad sign to do that. They can not sustain at 200-300 mm in maintenance CAPEX let alone talk about growth CAPEX. In a capital intensive business - car manufacturing - there really isn’t an invest and then you’re done spending money, there is a constant amount of investment you need to keep putting back into the business, this is not a Saas business. They recently lowered their CAPEX as well. My overall point regarding the fcf and CAPEX is this: they pulled out all the stops to print a decent cash and CAPEX number but if they keep doing that they will drown themselves in production and services issues. Again, this is a capital intensive business, they are a car manufacturer, they are not a tech company. Study any auto oem or talk to literally anyone involved in manufacturing and they will say the same thing regarding investment \n\nJust seeing your edits now: Mercedes, Audi, and Porsche are now coming out with fully developed vehicles whereas the s/x/3 are older and not as sexy now. Tests on realized range are actually worse for Tesla than both jag and Audi, so I would push back on your assumptions in that regard as well. I also don’t think 0-60 times or range matter as much as people here like to say it does. I also think using a sales multiple is a bad metric, you rarely hear any real investors talk sales multiples. \n\nWe can talk about the second thing you buy another time, it’s getting late, but I would be cautious of solar: most solar locations from an efficiency standpoint have been reached, incremental solar investment may not be as large as the last 10 years - coming from the top renewables analyst at Lazard.

{"title": "U.S. created 501,000 fewer jobs in past year than previously reported, one of the largest revisions ever", "selftext": "From [MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-created-501000-fewer-jobs-as-of-march-2019-than-previous-reported-2019-08-21):\n\n> Aug 21, 2019 10:42 a.m. ET WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- The U.S. economy had 501,000 fewer jobs in March 2019 than previously reported, government revisions show, suggesting that hiring was not as strong in the past year as it seemed. Hiring was weaker in retail, restaurants and hotels. The annual revision is much larger than is typically the case. The preliminary revision in 2018, for example, was just 43,000. Every year the Bureau of Labor Statistics updates its figures based on unemployment data that nearly all employers are required to file with the states. The current revision is one of the largest ever.\n\n***\n\nAnd now some interesting commentary from three weeks ago from [John Hussmann](https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc190805/):\n\n> It’s also important to recognize how strongly economic data tends to be revised, in hindsight, around recession turning points. For example, in the originally reported data for May through August 1990, as a new recession was emerging, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 480,000 total jobs were created (see the October 1990 vintage in Archival Federal Reserve Economic Data). But in the revised data as it stands today, those figures have been revised to a loss of 71,000 jobs for the same period.\n\n> Consider early 2001. A U.S. recession had already started months earlier, but first-quarter GDP growth was initially reported at 1.2%. Based on final revision, that same quarter’s GDP growth is now reported at -1.1%. The vintage data shows that non-farm payrolls were initially reported with a gain of 105,000 jobs during January-April 2001, while the revised data now shows a loss of 247,000 jobs.\n\n> Likewise, by early 2008, the U.S. was also already in recession, but first-quarter GDP growth was initially reported at 1% growth. That figure was only later revised to -2.3%. The non-farm payroll reports were already deteriorating, with a cumulative job loss from February-May of 2008 of 248,000 jobs. Still, those initial reports pale in comparison to the revised figures, which presently show a loss of 550,000 jobs for the same period.\n\n> Given that the ISM and Fed survey data are subject to little if any revision (depending on the series), and there is a strong correlation between that data and subsequent job growth, it’s very possible that recent employment data may be revised after-the-fact.", "id": "ctnr2q", "created_utc": 1566424516.0, "score": 107, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "I just quit my job to follow my passion.
