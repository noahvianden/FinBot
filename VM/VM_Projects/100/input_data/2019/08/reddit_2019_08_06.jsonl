Sells hundreds of Box Spreads on RH using Margin, gets paid a credit for each box spread, so his account goes from next to nothing to having tens of thousands.\n4. Proceeds to withdraw 10k in cash, because why the fuck not?\n5. Forgets that options come w/ this little thing called assignment risk and that yes, if a Box spread gets held till exp it's risk free... but that's not how option selling works... bc, ya know... assignment risk.\n6.
