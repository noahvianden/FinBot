Even at 24 months - it's still very good and far above the avg (by about 3x).    \n  \n\"What happens when relations between China and the US sour for the foreseeable future? Is that good for the global economy?\"  \nNo. it's not good for the global economy but it is good and has been needed for decades for the American economy. It will cause destabilization while everything finds a new equilibrium. The China problem has been around for long before Trump but Trump is the only one with the balls to stand up to it.   \n  \n\"I'm unsure why Trump supporters believe that what he is doing is a net positive for the United States considering China owns a huge proportion of our debt and is a key factor into our own corporate profits and consumer affordabilty.\"  \nForget intellectual property. It's important but not for this conversation (fiscal responsibility). China owning our debt is also a problem but if they wreck the debt - they also spite and hurt themselves - as they lose the value also in that debt.   \n  \nWhen we import far more then we export (due to cheaper goods) as is the current case. We are slowly killing ourselves and putting us into a death spiral of our own choosing (for those cheap goods). When we send all our money away, it's permanently gone from circulating in our own economy and new money needs to be created that didn't exist prior. If money was to stay local instead, it circulates locally all the way down to the many individuals that it circulates amongst. An example is a laborer produces a good such as a watch in America, he spends his money on new (hopefully local) supplies to build a new watch, for his family on things such as food and entertainment. That dollar moves to his local grocery store, local bar or theater or whatever that person does. That same dollar now helps all those other people it travels to such as the bar owner, theater owner, grocery store as they spend it themselves etc and spins and spins locally. It saves the middle class by staying local. When it goes to China on the other hand, it's gone. New money needs to be created to circulate and that's done by doing some new service every time. This causes a race to the bottom as that laborer needs cheaper labor and forced to buy cheaper and cheaper products because and razor thin margin is needed to keep afloat.    \n  \nTrump applying tariffs does hurt everyone in the short term - including Americans (in the form of higher prices - theoretically comparable to what it would cost to make locally). The tariff is a tool to bring an equal playing field amongst cheaper foreign countries by putting american created goods on the same price point as cheaper foreign equivalents. The taxes of those tariffs should get re-circulated just like Trump gave a huge payout to US farmers within the last week or 2. This should encourage and spur local businesses to create the goods so that we can keep money locally and circulate locally and helps in the long run if this actually happens.   \n  \nThe macro problem is that the US is the the most expensive country in all facets. We spend more to live and our goods cost more to create. We cannot compete on creating goods at cheap foreign labor prices but we also have to get money from somewhere. Not everyone can be bill gates or jeff bezos. If we did lower our costs of goods then we would have to lower the standard of living in this country. This is why foreigners want to come here to work - they make more then they make in their home countries. Many times, they send a fraction back to their home country where that same dollar goes much farther.   \n  \nSeparately, by allowing cheap illegal labor locally, we also cause a race to the bottom on those wages. Yes, no american wants to cut grass for $8 an hour. If there wasnt that cheap labor then the rates would be forced to rise to an equilibrium that would be good for both labor and job function. Of course a boss will hire the cheapest labor he can get. This helps the boss but not so much the employees and certainly not the middle class (or most people). This causes wages down as that boss can find work cheaper that he would if he was forced to use only local labor.    \n  \nyou can try and pin it all on Trump but I think your view just isn't wide enough nor seeing the whole picture.

The crash began in Hong Kong and spread west to Europe, hitting the United States after other markets had already sustained significant declines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell exactly 508 points to 1,738.74 (22.61%). In Australia and New Zealand, the 1987 crash is also referred to as \"Black Tuesday\" because of the time zone difference.\n\n***\n\n**Wall Street Crash of 1929**\n\nThe Wall Street Crash of 1929, also known as the Stock Market Crash of 1929 or the Great Crash, was a major stock market crash that occurred in late October 1929. It started on October 24 (\"Black Thursday\") and continued until October 29, 1929 (\"Black Tuesday\"), when share prices on the New York Stock Exchange collapsed.\n\nIt was the most devastating stock market crash in the history of the United States, when taking into consideration the full extent and duration of its after effects. The crash, which followed the London Stock Exchange's crash of September, signaled the beginning of the 12-year Great Depression that affected all Western industrialized countries.\n\n***\n\n**Black Wednesday**\n\nBlack Wednesday occurred in the United Kingdom on 16 September 1992, when John Major's Conservative government was forced to withdraw the pound sterling from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) after it was unable to keep the pound above its agreed lower limit in the ERM. In 1997, the UK Treasury estimated the cost of Black Wednesday at £3.4 billion. In 2005, documents released under the Freedom of Information Act indicated that the actual cost may have been slightly less, £3.3 billion. At that time, the United Kingdom held the Presidency of the European Communities.\n\nThe trading losses in August and September were estimated at £800 million, but the main loss to taxpayers arose because devaluation could have made them a profit.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "!Remindme 6 months", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is why I set my IRA to just add another 1/52 in value every Friday.
