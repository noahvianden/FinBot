You can use government funding, for subsidies and bailouts to trade war affected industries.  Or you can use Americas economy itself as a metric by saying your economy can war of attrition the other.  Neither of those are true.  You don't have unlimited government spending, and if it crosses a certain threshold, even GOP members will gladly start to stab you in the back.  And the economy is a measure of country spirits, and the more it tanks, the angrier the population will be and eventually that also crosses a tipping point where you will lose all political support.
