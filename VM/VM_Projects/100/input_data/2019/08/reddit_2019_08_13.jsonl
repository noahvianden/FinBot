When either of the two tech companies that were part of the original Hewlett Packard tech conglomerate are in the news, shares of oil services company Helmerich & Payne (HP), which actually trades under the ticker symbol \"HP,\" often moves in the same direction. PC company HP's ticker symbol is \"HPQ\" while Hewlett Packard Enterprises trades under \"HPE.\"\n\nSnapchat parent Snap (SNAP) and tool maker Snap-on (SNA) often get confused. Newly public web conferencing firm Zoom Video (ZM) and Zoom Technologies (ZOOM), which is a thinly traded Chinese wireless company, are often mistaken for one another.

Mango Man wont ever give them a good deal. Despite his reputation as a \"dealmaker\", everything we've seen indicates that his idea of a \"good deal\" is one where he swindles the other party, not create an optimal outcome that both parties feel is fair and mutually beneficial. That's how he sells it too, he doesn't say \"swindle\", but he talks pretty openly that the goal is to get as much from them while giving as little back.\n\nSo his plan is to do to China what China's been doing the US for decades.

In fact, Americans have been enjoying an incredibly luxurious standard of living (by global standards) that would be absolutely impossible if China, with its massive pool of cheap labor, didn't exist. It's the reason everyone has a cell phone and buy t-shirts like they were candy bars. The standard of living here is more or less an illusion created by global labor cost disparities, nothing more.\n\n>But of course you're for it when America loses, you just dont like it when China loses.\n\nI don't give a shit who wins or loses, I just want free trade because that's what's most economically efficient and mutually beneficial.

The British Empire was not the most powerful in the world around this time however; the navy was marginally larger than that of France, while the army was nothing all that special - and rather small all things considered. This doesn't take away from the American victory in the revolution - but it's important to put things into perspective.\n\n-The pirates were from the Barbary States in North Africa, not in Somalia. Furthermore, while some some nations paid \"protection money\" (including the US at first) many others were protected by treaties, while other powers chose to use more punitive measures to dissuade attack. The US did not begin their attacks until 1801 - it was certainly not the first action you undertook.\n\n-The Great Depression affected every nation on the planet. It was also over by the time WWII had kicked off, so you can't really use it to claim that the US was in a weakened state when Japan attacked. The US Pacific Fleet took a beating, but it wasn't wiped out; no aircraft carriers were lost and 6 of the 8 battleships damaged in the attack were restored quickly. You should also remember that the US didn't fight WWII alone. In the Pacific most of the Japanese forces were concentrated against the Chinese, not the Americans.
