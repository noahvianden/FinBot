This is why bubbles crash so rapidly.   Whether it is tulip bulbs or bitcoins, people in aggregate (the herd) run for the exits when they are scared of losing value on paper.\n\nThis is what appears to have happened to TSLA after the Q1 results.  People became scared.  The mainstream media runs fear-driven clickbait articles to get ad revenue.  More sellers than buyers drives the price down.  Bots pile on to take advantage of the momentum.\n\nIt's not just TSLA that suffers this.  NVDA (chipmaker nVidia Corp.) was trading at close to $290 last year.  A single bad quarter, combined with a mini-panic at the end of 2018, quickly drove NVDA down to $127, a loss of over 56% of market cap.  NVDA hasn't recovered.  It's still trading in the $160-$170 range.  AAPL was down nearly 40% in the same time span, although it has recovered more than NVDA.\n\nI believe that TSLA only recovers when uncertainty is lifted.  Primarily, this means stable manufacturing and sales operations of its automobiles from factories on 3 continents, consistent growth from existing and new markets, and balance sheets that the risk-averse finance types can't find much fault with.  More clarity in the capabilities of the Full Self Driving systems would also help.\n\nTSLA at around $220 today, down from the highs of $370-$380, reflects the risk and fear surrounding this company.  If you believe Tesla has a bright future, the time to buy is when others are fearful.  I expect that the drama will continue for at least another 2-3 years, and possibly 5-7 years.

NVDAs inventory from the crypto bubble was only cleared this quarter. Investors don't like having literal extra billions of old inventory. In the case NVDA had real competition from Vega their margins would have been decimated and it would have been a possible inventory crisis/writedown. NVDA is not back to those SP levels because while margins have been kept above expectations, datacenter growth is alarming for their current valuation. The margins let investors feel safe to wait a few more quarters for ultra high margin datacenter parts to hit the balance sheet as promised.\n\nYour post has some fine high level ideas about crowd behavior, but no mention of the balance sheet.

You can either join the profit-taking crew, or sit patiently and see if it runs back up while your contracts time-decay. You also have J powell to contend with at 10 AM and IDK if CRM's stock has any exposure to interest rates or not but it's a confounding factor.\n\nPersonally, I'd take my profits as soon as possible and be happy with them, but try not to panic-sell if it dumps right away.

The total came out to $51,387,134.88 worth of GE, most likely by an institutional investor (possibly the hedge who was in on the short? That is not for certain.) Culp and his insider cronies have bought over $3M in stock since the Markopolis accusations, and banks associated with GE have also began purchasing which results in the current buy walls between 8.18 and 8.00.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/iK6MoBx.png](https://i.imgur.com/iK6MoBx.png)\n\nThe volume of puts that have been placed between now and Sept 1st are massive.

It would be much more difficult to control and recover price in midst of a crash and possible spiral, so they put up the Wall of the North that only a fucking zombie dragon or tens of millions in short/sale volume to break thru. Beautiful big dick move.\n\nGE will get hazed and pay for its crimes, I think that is inevitable. However, if you're holding on to 8/23 or 8/30 puts, you might wanna consider this behavior in volume because it seems that it may take longer than expected before GE takes a hard boner in the ass.
