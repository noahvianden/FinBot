I do not think this will be the case. Since the previous recession, we have undergone a technological revolution, and I believe are just breaking the surface and will have a lot of growth this coming decade. This is important because there is a lot more growth possible and also because this has itself influenced how the market works. People know almost immediately when something is going on in the world, whereas previously we either didn’t have access to this and it caught us by surprise or we weren’t able to find out until watching the news later. This is powerful and we live in quite a different era. For a recession like we had previously, we wouldn’t see it coming. It could come tomorrow, or it could come 20 or 50 years from now.
