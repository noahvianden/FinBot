Microsoft and Google are definitely around par imo; both have extremely durable competitive advantages, high interoperability, and superb, absolutely irreplaceable products. Not to mention great management and other positive factors. I’m a little more iffy about Google due to pending and potential lawsuits in the EU and now in the US, which may hamper the stock price at least temporarily (compared to Microsoft, which has much less scrutiny over it), in addition to increased data privacy laws which, if it worsens, could reduce Google’s stranglehold over the online ad industry.\n\nAmazon is also a great business, but their risk profile, antitrust/anti-competition lawsuit risks, and exposure to macroeconomic conditions worry me. I’m personally somewhat bearish on short term (now - 1 year) macroeconomic prospects, bullish on medium term (2-4 years) macroeconomic prospects, and bearish on long term macroeconomic prospects (5 years out), so that also impacts my opinion. I think Amazon will remain slightly lower than average for the next while especially after their last earnings + macro condition, while Microsoft will continue to do well (in terms of share price).\n\nApple is VERY exposed to the trade war and macroeconomic conditions, and they’re in the middle of a huge transition. I.e. hardware to software.

As long as the market continues to do well, I see this trend continuing, and think it’s undervalued despite its PE moving from up a few points in that span as well. Their last earnings call was optimistic, highlighting growth in all the areas of business that need to perform well in the future. Their gaming sector lagged a bit, which I’m not a huge fan, hopefully they figure that part out. \n\nDisney on the other hand, has traded sideways in the same span. Up until the reveal of their streaming service. Their leadership is promising though and their recent acquisitions within the last 5 years have been transformative. The next few quarters are going to be extremely important for their future. I think Disney is undervalued at this point, and the other day was an excellent buying opportunity with their earnings miss. Once they get all their recent additions squared away, it’s going to take off. The only real concern I have coming up is when their CEO plans to retire in 2021 I believe, I’ll need to see what direction they are heading at that point, but I’m happy to hold until then and reevaluate.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I would buy a company that is inherently highly diversified.
