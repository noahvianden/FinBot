The Loony Tunes are all saying that demand in the Netherlands will be gone next year because the incentives are lowered.  The particular incentive that caused such a demand spike in NL is for company cars.  The difference is that the benefit-in-kind percentage goes from 4% to 8% in 2020.\n\nYou know what the percentage will be in 2020 for ICE cars? 22%!\n\nSo... buying an EV as a company car will still be much more _favorable_ than buying a ICE vehicle in the Netherlands in 2020.\n\nCan anyone explain to me why Tesla demand in the Netherlands is supposedly gonna vanish in 2020, given that the benefit-in-kind tax for ICE cars is still a lot higher than it is for EVs?", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "It’s a straw mans argument.

But more importantly, it will ban the **use** of ICE cars in Amsterdam in 2030. And other European city centers are coming sooner, e.g Rome in 2025.\n\nSo if you're buying a car today, you need to be thinking that you may have that car 10 years from now, and that an ICE might be quite restricted on where you can drive it.\n\nPeople used to worry about 'range anxiety' with EVs. I'm going to coin a new term 'destination anxiety' for ICE. If you're buying an ICE today, you may not be able to get to everywhere you want to go before your next vehicle.\n\nAnd even if you want to gamble on the laws getting delayed, or if you're rich enough to get a new car sooner than every 10 years, you need to consider that these laws will eventually come.
