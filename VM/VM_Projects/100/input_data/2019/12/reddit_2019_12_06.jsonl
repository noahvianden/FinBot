The first  claim is:\n> In a computerized system mounted on a moving vehicle, the system including a camera mounted on the moving vehicle, wherein the camera captures in real time a plurality of image frames of the environment in the field of view of the camera and transfers the image frames to an image processor, a method for detecting and identifying a traffic sign, the method comprising the steps of:\n\n> (a) programming the processor for performing the detecting of the traffic sign and for performing another driver assistance function;\n\n> (b) first partitioning a first portion of the image frames to the image processor for the detecting of the traffic sign and second partitioning a second portion of the image frames for said other driver assistance function; and\n\n> (c) upon detecting an image suspected to be of the traffic sign in at least one of said image frames of said first portion, tracking said image in at least one of said image frames of said second portion.\n\nThis is basically the old school computer vision method of object detection. They explicitly define a so-called partitioning step, which I'm guessing corresponds to running the object detection and classification on a set of two-dimensional sliding windows of various sizes. Today these methods are taught as programming exercises in a beginner's course to Computer Vision on Coursera, and can be played around with on a two/three-year-old consumer GPU.\n\nTesla's method is slightly different and more computationally intensive by 2, maybe 3 orders-of-magnitude. As [Andrej Karpathy explains at a PyTorch conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBklltKXtDE&feature=emb_title), Tesla's model architecture is more modern, where a single network appears to accept the entirety of the input image. That network is the input to a set of other networks, each with its own specialization for object detection and classification.\n\nAt the time the patent was submitted (end of 2006), the hardware required to do this in real time on images with full resolution (and at a fast enough rate for FSD-ish reaction times, as Tesla's system does) was all but unthinkable without a supercomputer. Mobileye/Intel will have a very hard time asserting patent infringement here.

The patentable piece is how, specifically, do you make it all work?\n\nMobileye tries to address some of this by talking about frame capture and NN. That's fine, but that's also quite obvious in today's world. Their patent will be defendable with Mobileye's specific NN and other tech implementation.\n\nThere's the classic meme that goes:\n\n1.
