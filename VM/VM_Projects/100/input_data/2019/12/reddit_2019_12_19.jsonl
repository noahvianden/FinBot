{"title": "$1k+ per week - And they say an early winning streak is the worst thing that can happen...", "selftext": "I have only started getting serious about trading and investing in the last 6 weeks.\n\nBefore that, I spent a lot of time consuming every bit of info I could. Up to this point, I have always been more likely to invest my money back into my own businesses. Now, as I get older, it's time to expand the horizons...\n\nAs I have been learning, I have been fortunate to be riding a very bullish wave.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This week's positions...](https://preview.redd.it/my7x2cjb6o541.png?width=165&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d45e0c12136cd9f2ff5c6d53111da3c7c8e6cf2)\n\nThe positions (as in the above image) I take are fairly simple.\n\n**For example, this week with $AMZN...**\n\n* **Monday -** I felt confident in a continued rise in the stock and started with a solid position and executed a 2 contract put credit spread (1745/1740) for $230 in credit.\n   * After a day, the position held strong - AMZN shot up, and since I now have some \"house money\"  for the 1st one that would likely hedge my position...\n* **Wednesday -** I executed a 2nd put credit spread (1777.5/1775) - 3 contracts for $210 in credit.\n   * After the 2nd position looked like it could be in trouble with AMZN taking a dip close to my 2nd strike price...\n* **Thursday -** I executed a 3rd put credit spread on AMZN (1770/1767.50) - 3 contracts for $159 in credit.\n   * Why? I still felt good about my other previous positions but decided to take advantage of the dip raising the premiums at a lower strike than my second position. I also decided this would further hedge/strengthen the position to profit.\n\nAs it stands now, these are all highly likely to expire at close tomorrow for some good profits in my pocket. Of course, anything can happen...\n\nWithout dissecting it, you can see, I did the same thing with TSLA - riding the wave up for some premiums.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith a progressive positioning system, I have been averaging net gains of $1k-$2k per week from an hour or 2 per day in real involvement. I realize that's not (well - depends who you ask - lol) a lot but is what I am comfortable with in risk/reward at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Please do** ***NOT*** think I share any of this to brag or to boast or to pretend I know anything about what I am doing. I understand that this is a good time in the market. Truth is, I know nothing. As a matter of fact, I am sure I am probably doing it wrong. I only know my tech markets (as a tech entrepreneur) and know the most basic of probabilities (from being a big fan of playing craps for many years - haha) and I certainly appreciate the concept of being \"the bank\" in this strategy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUltimately, I hope to keep learning and practicing consistent options trading positions - even when the times are not so bullish and am trying not to get over my head with any of this. Like the title says - an early winning streak can create a false sense of confidence and lead to bad decisions. I'd love for any of us here to be the exception (if possible).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are still reading this far - you rock!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe real purpose of this is to express my gratitude to this community.

On the other side, a call debit spread would benefit from an increase from the stock price, but the volatility would decrease as the stock price goes up so you get no benefit there.\n\nA great example is where an option seller sells options way out of the money before earnings or an FDA announcement.

I think Q1 will likely beat Q4, so I'm really hoping for a so-so Q4 that'll get us back into the mid, or even low $300s if there are macro headwinds.\n\nThey could just as well surprise in Q4 like they did in Q3 though with extra reg-credits, 110k+ deliveries, increased margins, more FSD revenue recognized, FX tailwinds, etc. Or even if Q4 is so-so, 2020 guidance and sentiment around Giga 3 and Model Y could be too strong and we don't dip. One can never be sure in the short term.\n\nOh and also, S&P inclusion after Q1 is very likely. That alone has the potential to send us over $500.

That's a huge amount of buying pressure if his math is accurate, and if it happens.

One other catalyst I believe may cause the SP to pop is battery investor day. The SP decreased after autonomy investor day in April 22 but there were other things going on at the time (model 3 ramp primarily).

Overall I'm feeling pretty good about Q1, but nothing's certain.\n\nYeah I'm also super pumped up for Battery Investor Day. I think it could be massive, but the market rarely reacts much to Tesla and Elon forecasts. Autonomy Investor Day is just one example of that. So I'm not super counting on it to boost stock price, although I'm sure it'll make my financial models look much better once I update with Battery Investor Day info.\n\nGood luck! Premiums are very steep atm though. Looking at Sep'20 options, I think you'd be very happy to double your money with them. 3x or more returns look close to impossible, because they require a SP of \\~$650. Considering the risk involved with options, the risk/reward ratio doesn't look great to me atm.\n\nAnd you also have to compare it to simply owning the stock.
