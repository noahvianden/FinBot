I might just play a really small strangle so I profit either way since I expect it to tank or fly. More on the tank side though. /r/teabagsonfire told me to check out Camelot331 and he says they're closing 80 stores in December alone which would be bad news for the price. However, they are estimated to lose .90 per share so if they could manage to lose .60 and raise guidance with the shady tactics they are pulling we could see a huge rally before the fall to bankruptcy.
