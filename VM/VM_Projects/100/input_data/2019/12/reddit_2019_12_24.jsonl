I see DIS going through something similar in 2020.\n\nMy bull thesis on FB when I first started buying at the end of 2018 was that it was simply too cheap at around $145. That was when they were having all these privacy scandals. I think FB is basically what Tesla would be 5 years from now. They are very similar: (Phase 1) Not understood by mainstream media; (Phase 2) Built impenetrable moat in its market; (Phase 3) Acquiring companies to bolster its moat; (Phase 4) Critics debate whether it's a sustainable business model; (Phase 5) Bear thesis non-existent, making boat loads of money, and becoming so big the government starts messign with you. FB is basically at Phase 5, while Tesla is at the end of Phase 4. Facebook's Libra shows that they are still ambitious, and I think digital currency / payment platform can take FB to the next level. There are just too many possibilities for FB simply due to its user base across Facebook, Whatsapp, and Instagram.
