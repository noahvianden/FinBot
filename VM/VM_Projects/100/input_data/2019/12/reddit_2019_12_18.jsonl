The question was how much...\n\nAll things considered, IMO at least short term, this is actually a very good sign for Netflix...\n\nThe fact that a media giant like Fox can come in, offer everything they offer on Disney+, at half the cost of Netflix, and only take a hypothetical 6.5% of the share away should be more than acceptable. If this number was 40%, then I think there is cause for concern.\n\nFox offering Disney+, ESPN+, Fox, Hulu etc. in a low cost bundle is great... but my who wants to navigate and manage 3-4 separate accounts on 3-4 separate apps. It's just a pain.\n\nIMO - This is saying that an overwhelming majority of those who use both don't see the value in only having Disney+. Could this change over time as the platform evolves? Sure. But the survey at least is showing that they have a long way to go.\n\n>In fact, Bank of America found that, compared to its prior survey, overall cancellation intentions for Netflix fell slightly to 4% from 5%.\n\nPositive for Netflix.\n\n>“Our survey and company reports suggest healthy U.S. adoption of Disney+, but we are encouraged that most early Disney+ users do not see it as a substitute for Netflix,”\n\nPositive for Netflix.\n\nDisney+ has a TON of opportunity as a byproduct of Fox. But not in its current form.\n\nIMO - The best part about Netflix is that it's unmistakably one platform. You know what you're getting, and they're focus is there. It baffles me that Fox offers,  Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+, Fox Sports etc. on separate platforms at different prices. Yes, they bundle them, but it's still separate services to browse/log into and manage just to get fox owned content.\n\nJust consolidate it into one with separate tiers/price points. Make it one service which can be navigated all at once. Let me multi-screen a Disney movie for my son while i watch a live sport (s) off to the corner. Let me jump out of a Marvel movie and right into live TV without having to exit an app and boot another or change inputs to an apple TV or another device.\n\nIf this were the case, good chance i'd drop netflix. But i flat out refuse to have to deal with managing separate streaming apps with different accounts and different billing cycles. It's just some bullshit.\n\nAs a side note/edit: The playstation vue/Netflix combo was as good as it current gets for me. Once PS Vue closes, i'll probably just replace it with Youtube TV.

Most immigrant investors who use the EB-5 program invest in a targeted employment area (TEA)—a rural area or area with high unemployment—which lowers the investment threshold to $500,000 or $900,000 after November 21, 2019. The EB-5 program is intended to encourage both “foreign investments and economic growth.” The EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program is one of five employment-based (EB) preference programs in the United States.Applicants have the choice of investing individually or they can choose to work through a “larger investor pool via regional centers (RC)”, which are federally approved third-party intermediaries that “connect foreign investors with developers in need of funding, and take a commission.” Regional centers are usually private, for-profit businesses that are approved by the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. By May 1, 2017, there were 883 USCIS-approved regional centers and by 2014 the “vast majority” of EB-5 visas were “granted through regional center[s].” By 2015, the EB-5 program had become an “important source of capital for developers” and for the regional centers.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "For Herbalife the answer is hispanic women.

They all have major flaws at present. \n\nOnce you've listened to any of the first three on good equipment it's really hard to go back to the compressed/highly stylised sound of Spotify. \n\nThat said, Qobuz (which sounds the best and is definitely fully lossless as files range typically from 44Mb to 120Mb depending on 16/44.1 all the way up to 24/192) has major issues with both it's app stability and functionality.

Too many compromises. \n\nTidal - noticeably better than Spotify sound, app works well (mostly, although far too many updates that rarely change anything) however very much centred around hip hop and Jay-Z's friends and basically a business model that tells anyone else to go fuck themselves. Further, I don't think it sounds as good as Qobuz (considerably better) or Amazon HD (marginally better and perhaps a matter of individual taste - Amazon has more detail and volume while Tidal has more warmth). Oh and it's £20. Too expensive for compromises. \n\nI'm currently on Amazon music HD but only because of the price point as a Prime customer. It's £3 more than Spotify and for me, the sound is most important. I want to hear what the artist wants me to hear. It comes at a cost. I don't get Spotify's wonderful discover weekly playlists or the community element. \n\nTLDR: nothing is perfect (yet) the competition is definitely hotting up and deals are everywhere (tidal latest is £5 total for 5 months for example which is mental)  As someone who has been deep in the digital music scene since a few weeks before  Linkin Park  famously used illicit Napster to promote their first album, Spotify only need to release a lossless plan at a £14.99 price point and I think they'd absolutely destroy the competition.

Quite a few albums I love have MQA versions, which again, is probably mostly snake oil. Yes, it is expensive, but for me, personally, I don't find $20 to be deal-breaking. My biggest problem is inability to shuffle my library, or just sane library management. So I use Roon. \n\nI understand the price point of Amazon HD. I'm not a Prime user, so I won't save much, but I'm sure the quality is great. I might sign up for a trial and check it out. Hopefully their desktop support is good.

Worth a free trial though just to hear the sound though! \n\n2. Oh I don't doubt Tidal's ability to offer plenty of MQA diversity. It's more about how their homepage is designed. Its always a generic \"hey check out this new album by the latest L'il such'n'such that you've never heard of because you're not in school in anymore. I mean it's bizarre enough that they promote so many hip hop artists that surely mostly appeal to adolescents and then charge £19.99, a price that surely most adolescents can't afford (if they plan to do as much underage drinking as I did growing up anyway!). Also correct me if I'm wrong but Tidal do not pay smaller artists well at all in terms of 0.cents per listen. I believe Spotify are best in that regard but my info may be out of date on that.\n\n3.

Plus detachable cables are always awesome! If you like the closed back design for privacy/sound and want something a bit more portable I can vouch for the new Dali io-4/io-6 (the latter is ANC with 30 hours battery, the former is 60 hours battery, yeah 60 hours and imo sounds marginally better) best thing about them is that they have usb C charging, detachable cable port and the option to take them on the move/around the house with Bluetooth 5.0.

Designers are opinionated and have a hard time coming to a consensus. Even when they do agree they might all be wrong anyway. Even when the data says they are wrong, they can be very stubborn. But very little in design is ever black & white. \n\nSometimes you need one person to drive a vision and direct. But few organizations are comfortable with that. The best designer in the room isn’t always the one making decisions. And the designer who takes the reigns and starts driving a specific approach is rarely popular for it.\n\n2. Data can be misleading. Most organizations are terrible at collecting good data. Or they collect a lot but can’t distill it into actionable insights. Or it’s just plain hard to interpret data correctly. Sometimes you know users are doing something but you don’t know why. You can ask them but they all say different things. Or usually users don’t know what they want. They say they need a feature, then you take it away and they are better off without it. Or they think they know why they like something, but they don’t know. Users are wrong plenty of times. \n\nDesigners also can interpret data in different ways. Having metrics isn’t enough. Having feedback isn’t enough either. You could have plenty of both and interpret the data completely wrong (I’ve done this).\n\n3. Good designers are hard to find. How many schools are there for it? What do you study to learn it? It’s like music. You could know everything about what makes hit songs so popular, but chances are you will never manage to make a hit yourself. Some people just get it. Not many. And in an organization, nothing guarantees you won’t get your decisions shot down by someone else. \n\nI think you need to understand human behavior to be a good designer. But I haven’t met many people who understand it. And I don’t consider myself to be a good designer.\n\n4. No one wants to just copy the winners. You imitate Spotify or iOS to a degree. But you have to do some things differently. Can you do some things better? Maybe not. Maybe the winners just figured out the best approach, and anything you do to differentiate is to your detriment. \n\nThere might be other reasons.
