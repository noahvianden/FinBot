{"title": "Robinhood identified this trade as \"High Risk\" and closed it automatically on my behalf, costing me $1500. Can anyone explain this to me?", "selftext": "On 12/26, I sold 19 **cash-secured** AMD Puts at a strike of $47 for $36 each. I collected $684 for this trade and was OK with AMD dipping below $47 and my purchasing of 1900 shares as I am bullish on AMD right now, and planned to sell calls at $47 (or higher) going into earnings and 2020.\n\nInstead, RH took action on my behalf automatically, buying the 19 contracts back at a cost of $77 each; this cost me $1,463.00. Now, instead of owning AMD @ $47 and having earned $684 for selling the Puts, I've net a loss of -$779.00.\n\nWhy did Robinhood automatically close this position for me? Regardless of where AMD is today, that automatic action cost me $1,463.00 that I did not approve of.\n\nI've emailed RH to understand why, but the responses so far have not been helpful at all. **This is not a spread, it was not purchased on margin, it was cash-secured.**\n\n\\---\n\n**Response #1 (From Robinhood):**\n\nGood morning,\n\nThanks for reaching out and I hope you are doing well.\n\nWe’ll review your spread 60-90 minutes before closing on your spread’s expiration date. At that point, a few different things can happen:\n\n* If both legs are in the money, we’ll assign and exercise them.\n* If both legs are out of the money and are not at risk of being in the money, we’ll let your positions expire.\n* If one leg is at risk or in the money, we'll close the spread, or match the option with another form of collateral (like cash or stocks) and let you exercise it.\n\n*Keep in mind that the Risk Check occurs about an hour before market close on the date of expiration. Risk Checks cannot be opted out of.*\n\nYou can check out our [Help Center article on expiration procedure](https://support.robinhood.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005656423-Expiration-Exercise-and-Assignment) for more information if you’re curious. Otherwise, just let me know if you have any other questions. I’m here to help!\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Redacted\\]\n\n\\---\n\n**My reply:**\n\nHi \\[Redacted\\],\n\nThanks for responding. However, the trade in question was not a spread, but rather 19 AMD $47 Puts, which should've obligated me to purchase 1900 shares of  AMD @ $47/share.\n\nInstead, Robinhood automatically purchased back the Puts I sold, at a cost of $.77/share, or $1,463.00.\n\nWhy did Robinhood automatically buy back my shares an hour before market close? Was it an error in Robinhood's logic, attributed to the fact that I also had a credit spread on AMD open at that time?\n\n\\---\n\n**Response #2 (from Robinhood):**\n\nMy apologies for the confusion and inconvenience. I can provide clarity.\n\nI can understand your situation but for the time being our system will pair the contracts as a spread.\n\nIf one leg is at risk in the money, then we will close the spread.\n\nWe are aware that we can improve the option sell out process and I will use this situation as feedback.\n\nRobinhood calculates upper and lower bounds for options positions.\n\n***If your option’s strike price falls within the upper and lower bounds, your position is considered “at risk” of being in the money or is in the money, and we’ll place an order to close your position.***\n\n\\*\\*How we calculate the upper bound:\\*\\*Last trade price + (1.5% \\* Maintenance requirement \\* Last trade price when the risk check is run)\n\n\\*\\*How we calculate the lower bound:\\*\\*Last trade price - (1.5% \\* Maintenance requirement \\* Last trade price when the risk check is run)\n\n**Example:**\\* You own an XYZ 1/1/2020 $10 Call\\* XYZ's last trade price when the risk check is run is $9.97, and the maintenance requirement is 25%.\n\nThe upper bound would be $10.01 ($9.97+\\[1.5%x25%x$9.97\\]) and the lower bound would be $9.93($9.97-\\[1.5%x25%x$9.97). Since the call falls within these bounds, we'll close the position.\n\nI hope this clears things up! Let me know if you have any follow-up questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\\[Redacted\\]\n\n# EDIT #1:\n\nAbsolutely none of this trade was performed on margin; it was cash-secured.

It’s how they attack people that they can’t control.  Then they get a chance to criticize the way the accused responds. Sometimes that response is the only thing they get to leverage to increase their control.  This includes charges of obstruction of justice, when the original accusation is baseless. \n\nThe best thing about “innocent until proven guilty” is the personal freedom to live your live in innocent, simple bliss. But a close second best  is that it hobbles the ability of narcissists to control wide swaths of the population. (Those are the same things, I know.) That second point is increasingly relevant when you realize that narcissists tend to gravitate to political power throughout their otherwise ineffectual lives.  \n\n(By the way, a key indicator is the phrase “the magnitude of the accusations”. If you ever hear that phrase, be forever 100% on guard against whoever said it. They are advocating abandoning ‘innocent until proven guilty’ for their own ends. Their friends can make gigantic accusations against anyone, including you, with zero effort on their part. Then they pick up that accusation and run with it.
