There's still a contract involved, they simply advertise the terms.\n\nWhy companies get cold feet is three reasons; \n\nThe first is their existing patents will get to be used, this is the reason big companies with a lot of patents don't want to strike this deal with Tesla. They are stuck in the mind set that they can make more money from their own patents that people have to pay to use, or better yet no one but they get to use making their cars more valuable on the market since they are unique. Traditionally this mind set has been correct, however we haven't seen another mind set use widely so there's no proof if this is the best mind set, it could be we just don't know really.\n\nThe second is future patents. Again, big companies know they will have more patents in the future and who knows what kind of crazy revolutionary shit one of your engineers might come up with. It's a gamble. For small companies it is usually the fear that they will eventually have something worth money, but it's not usually their fear it's their patent lawyers fear on their behalf. See a comment else where in this thread where another person and I spoke about just such an event.\n\nThere's the third and final part which affects big companies the most, and future fear for small companies as well, and that is everyone else being allowed to use your patents. So if you agree to the terms and sign the contract you're telling Tesla that you want their stuff bad enough that you're willing to give them rights to use your stuff, past, present, future, and are willing to give those same rights to everyone else for all patents that you use on electric vehicles that use their patents. Based on how I read this that means there's a few things going on here. \n\nThe first is that you have two types of vehicles, and patents associated with those vehicles. You have vehicles of any type that use Tesla patents at all, and those vehicles that don't use Tesla patents at all. Let's say you have patent 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. You Agree to let Tesla use all 5 patents regardless of which ones of your own you use on a new vehicle that includes Tesla patents, and then Tesla hands you all their patents, let's say T1, T2, T3, T4, T5. Now let's say you make two new vehicles. Vehicle A uses patents 1, 2, and 4. Vehicle B uses Patents 1, 3, 5, T1, and T2. Tesla still has rights to all your patents regardless of how you used theirs, that was the deal. But you've also told Tesla that you agree to let anyone use patents of yours from cars that include their patents. So that means all the patents on vehicle B, 1, 3, and 5 are now public use because they are on a car touching T1 and T2. However patents 2 and 4 are not public use because they aren't touching any Tesla patents.\n\nIf you sue anyone and try to stop them from using patents 1, 3, and 5 then you have breached contract with Tesla and they revoke your rights to use their patents. At this point it would go to court because there's a few different ways it could play out, and the specifics of the contract might cover it ahead of time. The first way it could play out is all existing patents in use by both parties may continue for those specific vehicles but otherwise all new productions can't use any patents because the contract is broken. The second way it could play out is Tesla is allowed to leverage royalties or other fees on all existing cars that use their patents at fair market price. This could end up being incredibly expensive. No matter what way it plays out though it's going to cost a mountain of money in lawyer fees when it's all said and done. So again many companies would rather not risk all of this.\n\nAs for whether its enforceable I would say yes. The company is going to have its lawyers go over the contract and understand its terms well enough to sign them. If they try to fight them they might find some kind of a loop hole to get out of it, but they would likely still lose the Tesla patent rights in addition to the incredible court costs. This is why companies haven't agreed to Tesla's terms yet. There's quiet a bit of unknown in addition to the fear of outside third parties, mainly big competitors, using their current patents.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "My company actually looked at using some of Tesla's patents.

From humble beginnings (Mr Hu applied for his first patent in a half-built bungalow), China accounted for 44% of the world’s patent filings in 2017, submitting twice as many applications as America, according to the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Companies, mostly Chinese ones, sue each other over patents in China more than in any other country.\n\n>When foreigners do litigate in China, Rouse, a law firm, says they have a higher win rate in patent cases than domestic ones, and are awarded more damages overall. Such fines are low by international standards, but are improving: Alfred Dunhill, a British luxury brand, won a $1.4m payout in October over trademark infringement by a Chinese menswear brand called Danhuoli. In January, the ip court system was bolstered by the establishment of an appeals tribunal at the Supreme People’s Court in Beijing.\n\n>The more inventive it is, the more protection benefits China. Huawei was the world’s biggest filer of international patents in 2017; whatever misgivings there are about its loyalties to the Chinese state, it is hard to doubt its commitment to innovation. An executive at Alibaba notes that as Chinese firms expand globally, particularly in South-East Asia, they, too, suffer from having their ideas ripped off, making them keener to protect them. As China’s economy weakens, says an executive of Beiqi Foton Motor, a vehicle manufacturer, his firm will need to protect its patents from rivals even more, to guard its share of a shrinking market.\n\n>Executives admit to gaping holes in the ip system, particularly in inland regions where local tribunals are subject to heavy-handed interference by provincial governments keen to shield local copycats. That is why some ip executives in China accept the rationale behind American arm-twisting. After all, they admit, if it were not for American pressure on intellectual property, China would not have come half as far. That is not to say they approve of Mr Trump’s bombastic approach, which adds to the sense that America is trying to stifle China’s rise.
