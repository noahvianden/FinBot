I find companies beaten down and buy low, sell for a quick profit.\n\nI’m in CRWD, SPWR, SIG. look at all 3 of those companies and they are all at fairly low levels right now. I’m buying all 3 of those stocks now. I just bought SIG at $19.99 today and $20.20 (10,000 total cash). Can’t tell you when SIG will turn, but I’ll gladly collect $715 every year until those cap gains come in my pocket.\n\nI’d predict SIG hits $40 within 2 years, easy, while getting paid to wait. Not trying to pump SIG, but I’m just trying to paint you a picture of my investing strategy. \n\nI’m -18% down in CRWD... I’m -11% down in SPWR.... Not a problem, both of those companies are doing good, so I’m just waiting for them to turn. \n\nI’m also loving TAP right now. \n\nThat should help you get a feel for how I invest. I don’t let swings scare me, I just average down and wait, as long as there is nothing fundamentally wrong. Do not invest in a company with fleas.\n\nI bought GE at $31 and sold at $29 due to the company being inherently broken. It was a huge bullet I dodged! \n\nCrwd growing at a 89% TTM clip.... CRWD will easy go back to $70 and I’ll sell for a couple grand profit, even while I’m -18% down with an average price of $59\n\nHope that helps!\n\nEdit: I also listen to conference calls on my way to work. You’ll be able to listen to management and be able to tell if they are bullish or bearish on their own company.\n\nI’ll never forgot in mid 2018 Bob Iger (Disney ceo) started to get mad at everybody asking him about Cord cutting and he got mad on a conference call ‘I’ve already talked about that! No more questions about cord cutting. I’ve said we have a plan in place and we’ll execute!”\n\nFrom that moment on I knew Disney would turn around the bearish narrative. I learned though to not trade Disney, buy and hold that name.

Perhaps they made a really autistic play that resulted in a sizeable gain or loss, were mentioned on the news, or did something memorable.\n\n- **Thread of the Year**\n - Awarded to the creator of the most notable thread of the year. Perhaps it was shenanigans by the mods, a reaction video/post, a funny story or meme, etc.\n\n- **Play(s) of the Year**\n - Awarded to the user who made an unlikely trade, or series of trades, that resulted in a gain. Perhaps a ticker that isn't mentioned much, a very low probability of success play, inversing WSB, or predicting (and profiting) off of a major movement, or a series of plays in which a user parlays most or all winnings into another play that works out. \n\n- **Most Overall Realized Gain of the Year**\n - Awarded to the user with the highest realized gains of the year. Some traders may not feel comfortable with sharing this, so the award winner may not be the true highest gainer on WSB for the year.\n\n- **Most Gains from a Single Play**\n - Awarded to the user with the highest dollar gain from a single play. \n\n- **Most Percent Gain from a Single Play**\n - Awarded to the user with the highest percent gain from a single play. \n\n- **Loss of the Year**\n - Awarded to the user with a significant loss from a single play. Does not necessarily need to be the highest dollar amount of loss. It could be a notable loss where someone takes out and loses a loan, for example, or loses what was once a winning position (maybe the company went bankrupt overnight and someone was all in).\n\n- **Meme of the Year**\n - Awarded to the user with the \"best\" meme of the year.

{"title": "The Rise and Fall of MartyMoho", "selftext": "/u/MartyMoho is one of the true original gamblers of WallStreet**Bets**.\n\n\n The Legend of MartyMoho begins on March 23rd, 2017 when he posted a [$1,000,000 position in Micron](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6100ug/1m_in_mu/) (MU). This was roughly 55% shares at a $26 price average, and 45% calls split between ITM and OTM.  \n\n\nMicron held an earnings report later that day and the results were much better than expected. Micron delivered, skyrocketing afterhours over 10%. Marty woke up the next morning up over $600,000.  \n\n\nWhat made this even more impressive is that Marty was not some ultra-rich billionaire with a highly diversified portfolio of assets. No. Micron was the only company he owned, and this was his entire portfolio.  \n\n\n[“Ah, well, I've only owned $MU or its derivatives for almost two years. I swing traded $AMD a little fall of 2016 but essentially that's all $MU”](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/82gu6q/my_adventures_in_mu/dv9ypbe/)\n\n\nMarty continued to hold positions in Micron over the next year, and his account reached a peak value of [$2,500,000](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/86e49c/1_year_after_1m_in_mu_23m_in_mu_calls/) from his original $200,000 in September 2015. A 1200% gain.\n\n Marty wasn’t finished though, the money, the shitposting, the endless call outs of Jim Cramer on twitter (@MartyMoho) wasn’t enough for him and in true wallstreetbets fashion, he needed more. \n\n\nOn March 22nd, 2018 Marty bet all $2,300,000 on $MU calls set to expire over the course of the next several months, a majority being OTM. $MU was trading at $54 that day, and his strikes were all between $50-$80.  \n\n\nMarty remained optimistic as $MU hovered around the same price over the next several months. But on August 30th, 2018 Marty started losing hope. On this day he made his final ever comment on reddit:\n\n[“I don't know, I expected at least a partial run-up but it's not materializing at all. If it doesn't pop after ER like it did this time last year, I'm pretty f'd”](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9bo1re/psa_mus_fy18_ended_today_tomorrow_is_fy19/e5exeux/)\n\n\n$MU was trading at $53 when he made that comment, theta was killing him. But it didn’t get any better for Marty. $MU fell 40% over the next few months, all the way to $30 as his calls were expiring. $2.3 million lost, as the strikes were so far out of the money that even if he had sold, it would have been too late. They were worthless.  \n\n\nThat was the last comment Marty ever made online, his Reddit, Twitter, and Stocktwits all stopped being active between August 30th and 31st, 2018. No one knows for sure what happened to him, but the speculation remains. One thing is for certain though. As quickly as he rose, he fell, and the legend of Marty is now just that – a legend.", "id": "eaujdv", "created_utc": 1576384655.0, "score": 1197, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "2.5 mill is the kinda money where he coulda had a dividend portfolio and easily made 100k a year with his ass never getting up from the couch (but fuck that r/investing shit am i right) these stories always fuckin get me,\n\nwith these options ride ups you keep winning till one day you don’t, then it’s unfortunately $rope gang and wsb immortality", "score": 620, "replies": [{"body": "Shitty 2% ally account for $2.5M is $50k/year.
