For example, if you sell a call with a $500 strike price & buy a call with a $550 strike, if TSLA goes to $501 you lose $100, at $502 you lose $200, but no matter how high TSLA goes, you can't lose more than $5000: ($550 - 500) x 100.\n\nIf you own 100 shares, sure, you could sell a call, and you'd be completely covered. For example, you could sell a call with a $600 strike price. Then as TSLA goes from $400 to $600, you make $20 000 from your 100 shares. If TSLA goes above $600, you won't lose any money, but you won't be able to make more than $20 000.\n\nAnother way to hedge could be to sell a call that is less likely  than one that you already own. For example, if you already own a call with a $400 strike expiring June 2020, you could sell a call with a $600 strike also expiring June 2020. As long as you own the $400 call, you can't lose money if TSLA goes to Mars. But with owning a $400 call and selling a $600 call, just like with owning 100 shares, your gains are capped out at $20 000.\n\nIt can be nice to make a few extra bucks from hedging. And you can even put the money back into TSLA shares or towards TSLA calls that you believe in! Honestly though, for all of the effort it's been for me to try to make a few extra bucks from hedging, I think I'd rather just keep my strategy simpler, be a pure Tesla bull and not limit my gains. When surprisingly great moments like these past couple months come around, sending TSLA from $250 to $400, there's no limit for me, and I can purely cheer for $420 and beyond.

I've definitely seen relatively often some stocks ping-ponging between both of them, and it's sometimes really obvious that bulls or bears are defending their support or resistance in those instances when the second it goes a cent above or below them you see the contrarian volume drastically increase and keep it in range.

Everyone always talks about the $BECKY index and how it outperforms the S&P, without any data to back it up. And now there is a new $TONKS added in the mix. It‚Äôs time that r/WSB officially decides on what makes these indexes and starts tracking them religiously.\n\nI made an application that tracks $TONKS and $BECKY in real time, and as of 9:30am this morning it is operational. The index and the individual stock prices are updated every 60 seconds, and the graph is updated too. I‚Äôll maintain this and add weekly, monthly, and yearly graphs as time goes by.\n\nTo calculate the index price of $TONKS, I took the list that /u/TheGlennDavid put together. I multiplied each stock‚Äôs market value by the percentage weight, and added them all together. I then divided that number by an arbitrary number to get the price down to $404.04 (The price $TSLA closed at yesterday). For $BECKY, I took 14 $BECKY stocks that people mentioned a lot and added their market caps together. I divided that by an arbitrary number to get the price of $69.00.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any feedback or if I should add/remove any stocks from the indexes or if I should calculate the indexes differents. I‚Äôm autistic so idk anything about index funds other then they‚Äôre boring. I can also add a $CHAD index, so lemme know what stonks belong there.\n\nThis is only the beta version. I want to officially start tracking this on January 2nd, and start the decade off right with the two hottest indexes. This gives us time to decide which stonks we want to make up the index, and how we should calculate them. Also in the future I wanna use Black-Scholes to develop options pricing for these indexes ;)\n\nPlease roast this idea and my choices of stonks, and I‚Äôll make this better. The 2020s will be the decade of WSB.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZgG5JNffElQK_UICs9V4xwd1L4N7Yumfb_Pzj-GaVF0/edit?usp=sharing\n\nEDIT: I'll replace ULTA with LVMUY in $BECKY, and replace Twitter with Pintrest (I agree twitter isn't used that much)\nHow do I not have MTCH??

David Ham,[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_nuts#cite_note-vice-3) owner of YourNutz.com, said he saw a pair of custom truck nuts at a rally in the 1980s, then in 1996 began manufacturing and selling plastic truck nuts commercially. John D. Sallers, owner of BullsBalls.com, says he was out driving his 4x4 off-road when someone yelled: \"Go Ernie, show'em you got balls!\", which inspired the idea and he began selling them in 2002. The two men sold Truck Nuts through the late 1990s and 2000s, competing both in the market and in private, exchanging angry phone calls and emails. This conflict escalated into public relations wars, social media conflicts, posts on review sites, blog attack posts, and finally leading to legal [cease and desist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cease_and_desist) orders.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_nuts#cite_note-vice-3) [*Vice News*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_News) wrote a story about the feud called \"Balls Out: The Weird Story of the Great Truck Nuts War\".[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_nuts#cite_note-vice-3)", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "God bless America.", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol wtf, beautiful", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "The Dollop did a podcast about it...
