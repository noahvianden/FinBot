Additionally, Jonas believes Tesla’s Gigafactory in China could perform better than anticipated and reach a production rate of 450,000 units per year by 2024/2025.", "id": "e6padu", "created_utc": 1575586716.0, "score": 373, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "420 funding secured", "score": 236, "replies": []}, {"body": "Weak.

I’m more bullish than just about anyone but that seems like the opposite of conservative. I wouldn’t say impossible but I’d say $0 is just as likely. \n\n\nMy best case scenario:\nIn 5-10 years the energy side of the company could be huge. If they can pull off the longevity and capacity claims that have been floated, it’s going to be a game changer. With the solar roof, a significant amount of energy production and storage will provided by Tesla. Both solar and batteries are following cost curves so sales could absolutely go exponential. With electric vehicles, energy demands will be going through the roof which will compound this. \n\nIf they can pull off autonomous driving by late 2021-2022, they will likely have at least 2-3 years of a monopoly on the market. It won’t be perfect since human drivers will still exist but if Tesla charges 70% of the rate, allows you to have the car to yourself, and provides a safer and more reliable service, they won’t have trouble selling fares. The only employment cost would be for people to clean cars, resolve issues, etc. The cars are also crazy cheap to operate. \n\nAround the same time, they will be targeting the goods transportation market. The cybertruck could basically serve as a self driving U-Haul truck that comes to you whenever you need to haul something. Furthermore, the semi could completely change the trucking industry. Autopilot is already almost flawless on the freeway. By the time the Semi actually hits the road in large numbers, drivers on the freeway would basically be there for legal purposes. \n\nBeyond Tesla, one of the most interesting things could be the price of oil. With the fracking boom, we saw what potential there is. A flooded market shook producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia hard. It even fed into the collapse of Venezuela. Demand falling could have the same impact but potentially far worse. If producers start going under and the supply collapses, that would send gas prices through the roof. That would then cause demand to crash and you get a vicious cycle. Major powers could fall. \n\nAnyone that says they can put a price target on that potential is wrong. If they misstep at any point, they could implode. If there is a major software glitch that causes a bunch of crashes, not many people will want to hop in one. If there is a breakthrough in fusion, the energy sector could die in a heartbeat. If another company beats them to autonomy they would go from a monopoly to instead catching up. \n\nIf things go perfectly then it will be the most valuable company on earth. Musk is probably the only person that could pull it off but even then who knows. It’s really a gamble but with 20-1 odds on a coin flip. I’ll take those odds any day.\n\nEdit: Lol, half a paragraph ended up in the middle of another one somehow...fixed!", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol.

I try to stop her from eating stuff because you know - could be rat poison or whatever, but she's always way ahead of me - crunching on five week old discarded hot pockets or whatever the fuck.\n\nAnyway, she's super thorough, so throughout her journeys (which she takes the lead on) she points out a lot of coins and bills along the way, just by virtue of me always needing to look on the ground and try to stop her from killing herself.

But if you're looking for a real life 30 year mortgage with 20% down, you'll be saving for a long time to make that first home purchase, because the prices are so high. That's why you're seeing people talk like 3% down is normal - people are essentially having to leverage 30x just to buy. \n\nAs an example, I rent an apt in a 2 unit 3 story wood frame building. It was built in the 50's, has knob & tube, asbestos singles, lead paint (explains why I'm on here), the works. Fucking thing is $2 million when last appraised.  This building would be called uninhabitable if built today, would require hundreds of thousands to bring up to modern code, and would take a fuck ton of money and time to demolish and rebuild, but because powpow doesn't want to turn off the faucet, it's $2 milly, good luck first time homeowners lmao. \n\nHouses also aren't just a one and done deal. You buy a house, now you need to pay for: broker fee, RE tax, PMI, Insurance, Maintenance, and on and on. You're on looking at 5%+ in other related shit even if you own the house outright. 5% of a house that's tripled in price more than makes up for any piddly reductions in mortgage rates. \n\nFinally, since interest on mortgages is tax deductible and the proportion of interest vs other costs has shrunk over time, the decrease is less than your headline 45%. Also, nobody wants to live in a shoebox 1940's fixer upper, so of fucking course sqft are going up, which really is the main reason for the difference being so dramatic.
