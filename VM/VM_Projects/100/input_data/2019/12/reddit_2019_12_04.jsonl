After that its anyones guess but I'd take a look at the competition. \n\nThe classics are Soulcycle etc..\n\nBut I believe you have the LT winner in Zwift (still Private) that is basically a pure play subscription software model where you can use a TV, iPAD or iPhone & play bike videogame raceing against other riders or runners all over the world. The cost is owning a bike, a smart hub (cheap ones are $200) and $14.99/month (not $40 month like Peloton) or if running you can use an Apple Watch or a tracking pod you put it on your shoe that costs $30-$200 from cheapest to most expensive. What happens when you are done with your Peloton? It rots in the corner. What happens to your bike with Zwift? You put the rear wheel back on and ride it like a bike and wow you didn't sink $2000+ into a clothes hangar if you don't want to pay the $40 monthly fee anymore. They are also doing Zwift Championship races already like e-sports.\n\nI've never tried Peloton, went to a Soul Cycle knockoff once and it was lame but Zwift is actually a lot of fun and very video game esque and great for training for running/biking. It'll appeal more to the younger, athlete market not the old boomer or rich, bored wife market plus since its all software the company will have superior margins and a much more dedicated demographic, the hardcore athlete. \n\nPeloton is a fad and an expensive one so get rich on it while you can because can anyone name all the succesful publicly traded exercise equipment manufacturers?
