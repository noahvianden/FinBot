The narrative that you are getting already from the bears is that this isn't impressive relative to 7.2B$ in Q4 (which annualizes to 28.8B$). My operating profit estimate is 1.6B$ which also rather coincidentally is about 4x Q4 (lower in 1H and higher in 2H).

Choices of where you want to take op.ex might vary but it's likely to exit 2019 at 4500M$ and if you take that to 6500M$ to support the Y then all of this nets out to 5340M$ operating profit per year which is a low multiple on a 50B$ market cap for a company still early in the EV and autonomy transition and filling out their product lines.

Points that stuck out to me:\n\n1) Total deliveries of 360k-400k vehicles in 2019 is not a good number.  With 100k S/X deliveries, that means Model 3 deliveries will average well under 6k a week over the full year.  Remember, Musk said investors can be 100% certain the company will be producing 10k Model 3s per week by the end of 2018.  \n\n2) Total automotive revenue per delivered vehicle dropped from $72,800 in Q3 to $69,700 in Q4.  I expect that number to go back up in Q1 as international deliveries will initially have higher pricing, but the price cuts in the US and eventual drop in ASPs once backlogged demand for the AWD variants is satiated in international markets will pressure that number from Q2.  \n\n3) Following on the previous point, total automotive margin dropped about 150 bps in the quarter.  This pretty clearly shows the impact of selling the MR Model 3.  As with revenue per vehicle delivered, automotive margins should improve in Q1, but be under renewed pressure in Q2 (and the second half of the year generally).\n   \n4) The company is doing a great job controlling costs.  Remember they spent $1.137 billion on SG&A and R&D in Q2.  In Q4 that has __dropped__ to $1.024 billion, savings of over $100 million per quarter.  The latest round of layoffs should keep those costs in check going forward as well.\n\n5) The energy business took a big step back.  Revenue dropped almost $30 million Q-o-Q, and gross profit from the segment declined $26 million.  That segment is very volatile though, so I am not reading much into this at all and expect growth going forward.\n\n6) Services and Other still has negative margins, and as that becomes a bigger part of the business it is becoming a bigger drag.  Gross losses in that segment increased by $18 million in the quarter.  I am not sure how this will develop going forward - it seems like the company needs to invest even more in service.  However, in general the losses here are not particularly material at the moment.\n\n7) In my model I have a little note next to the \"Restructuring and other\" line item that says \"(one time?)\" from when that was added in 2Q18.  Well, now they have had charges in the past two quarters and said there will be another big one in Q1.  Time to delete that note I guess.\n\n8) Obvious, but total net income for the year was a loss of $1.063 billion (though only $976 million was attributable to the common stock).  If they are only making profits of $200 million per quarter it will take a while to recover those losses.\n\nQ1 is going to be difficult for Tesla as they'll be hit with (i) one-time restructuring charges, (ii) lower pricing in the US and (iii) a delivery lag as many vehicles will be in transit at the end of the quarter.  Q2 will benefit from those AWD international deliveries being made, so should be a good quarter.   Second half of the year will be interesting.\n\nEDIT:  Missed a big one!  \"Customer deposits decreased sequentially by $113 million in Q4  to $793 million as we continue to work through our Model 3 backlog\".  If those were all Model 3 reservations coming off the books, that would be 113,000 reservations.  But only 63k Model 3 deliveries were made, so either (i) there were about __50,000 Model 3 reservation cancellations in Q4 alone__ (and that is assuming every single Model 3 sold in the quarter was made for someone who had a reservation, which we know is not right) or (ii) there were some relatively significant cancellations for the semi or roadster.

They may even see more than that, but it's a solid guess that they can hit and surpass.\n\nIf you pick one period in the growth curve where it flattens you can always make a 'no growth' argument. Tesla has historically shown big jumps in revenue as new products are introduced after which the growth rate slows.\n\nDuring Q4 Tesla made \\~61k Model 3 and 25k Model S/X. This is about 4700 per week Model 3's, and 1900 per week S/X. Their guidance is for this to effectively continue for the whole of 2019. However, you must consider more variables.\n\nTesla is likely reducing Model S/X production (at low end) and pushing people to high end of Model 3. This will improve cash flow and margins substantially as a $70k loaded Model 3 has much higher margins than base Model S. Also, some people will be pushed to the higher price in the Model S, further improving margins.\n\nTesla improved their Model 3 production in Q4 by \\~15% on Q3. A further 15% improvement in Q1 would represent 5400 per week, i.e. \\~70k Model 3's. Model S/X will likely be down, as guided in their letter. So they might hit 85k total production.\n\nQ2 is likely to have a similar level of Model S/X but with further improved Model 3 production, i.e. another 5-7%. They are also having significant margin compression, Q1 saw a $2,000 price drop, and an effective $1,875 increase b/c of tax credit. This is 6% of Model 3 price. In addition to this, they are moving slowly down the ASP curve in the USA.\n\nTesla is attempting to maintain profitability whilst having substantial ASP decline. For example, in Q4 the ASP reduced 5%, yet, Model 3 gross margin was stable. Tesla will continue this process and introduce cheaper models when necessary to saturate the factory output (which they mentioned in their letter).\n\nQ3/Q4 is where things get interesting for production. It is likely that Model 3 is running at 91k sustained quarterly production in Q3 just in Fremont. Add this to 18k S/X or so, and you get about 220k cars for the second half of the year, ignoring China output. This matches with maybe 170k for the first half of the year. Elon mentioned that they could hit up to 500k cars this year in the call, and it is likely they are sandbagging guidance somewhat. If in Q4 China produces a material run rate at EOQ, i.e. 3000, then 2020 will become much more interesting in terms of total units produced. 2018 was 250k, 2019 lets say 400k. What is the stock at in Q4 when China is ramping, Fremont is fully ramped and producing 400k per year with good efficiencies?\n\n2020 estimations. It seems quite probable that something like 200-400k cars can be produced in China during 2020. 200k cars would represent 3846 per week. Fremont took about 12 months to hit the 4300k per weeks sustained figure from first production. China will hit this rate more quickly. There is also the Model Y production at Gigafactory which will be faster than Model 3 because of the fact that 75% of the parts are the same. Model Y in 2020 could be 100k units, primarily in the second half. This gets to to a potential output for 2020 of: 400k Model S/3/X from Fremont, 200-400k from China and 0-100k Model Y at Giga. This gives us a range of 600k to 900k units in 2020.\n\nSo the question for the stock price is really as follows: what value will the market put on the PV of future Gigafactory 3 revenue and Model Y (i.e. 2020 and beyond) revenue during 2019. As we get closer to the ramp of these products clearly the PV increases. The point really is that it doesn't matter so much what the real deliveries are this year, more that what is the step change in growth rate in 2020. 2017Q4 to 2018Q4 was 120% revenue growth. And even if 2018Q4 to 2019Q4 is muted. 2019Q4 to 2020Q4 will be similarly high as 2017Q4 to 2018Q4. The stock price in 2019Q4 will more represent the expectation of growth in the next year rather than the growth from 2018Q4 to 2019Q4.\n\nAlso, don't forget energy will start to become part of the narrative as that continues to show outsized growth. Autonomous also has extreme upside.\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Congrats bulls.
