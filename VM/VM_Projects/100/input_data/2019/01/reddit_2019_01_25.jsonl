TA will give you good entry and exit points and will often allow you to apply a systematic strategy to trade with - which is better than blindly buying or emotion trading. Investors will win and lose trades, but disciplining yourself to sticking with a strategy is what makes traders successful. As long as you win more than you lose and you properly size your plays and manage your risk, you'll do okay in trading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for the current state of the market, it's left a lot of smart people and even the most experienced traders speechless. Think of it as a modern prime example of the age old fight between market rationality and your own solvency. Some other TA people I follow predicted a large technical bounce in January - which is due to the sheer amount of selling we witnessed almost all of December. Earnings have not been that great to be honest, major names have guided down and missed. The macro economic factors that plagued the past three months haven't really changed, but many believe that to be priced in. A month of rallying is just as believable as a month of selling - in which case we saw both of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, the harder we rally, the worse the next correction will be. Dead cat bounces can definitely be deceiving, but the market just doesn't forget about 3 months of crashes that brought many big names down 50%. Look at any chart, V shaped recoveries are extremely rare if any. Look at our first taste of correction in Feb last year. We rallied for a month only to retest lows in late March and early April again. This was needed before we continued our bull run for the remainder of the year.  Even if you want to believe that our economy is strong and we'll return to a bull run, there are some fundamentals that we need to reapply first - one of them being retesting the strength of the bottom one or two more times and rallying out of bear market territory. This will probably take months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA lot of people, including myself, have taken some damage trying to time the top too early. Key to surviving as a bear is to hedge frequently by selling short term puts/ buying short term calls, and locking in those profits to help cushion the losses on longer dated puts. Never let your puts get to less than two weeks expiration, theta will destroy you.

Inflation was over the 2% target, closer to 2.3%. The balance sheet still needs to be reduced. They need to get ahead of it and sooner than later if they want to stay firm at 2% inflation. While economic growth has slowed slightly, it is still considered modest to moderate. Increased leverage because of low rates outside of banking may also be cause for concern, but since the overall risk profile has dropped significantly, raising rates will not present a systemic risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why they wouldn't raise rates now**:  A lot of the slow manufacturing growth is in auto-sales and energy. Auto-sales are flat because demand is flat despite 0% extremely loose lending practices (which has been the case for years.) energy manufacturing is suffering because of low prices, though the macro effect of oil has diminished compared to historic effects due to domestic production. The flip-side of low energy prices is lower input costs, but that's being offset by higher cost of freight and other input prices. This last part could be seen as a result of inflation, which would mean that raising rates now would be better, so maybe this last bit belongs in the \"why they would\" column. Tariffs are starting to take effect for input pricing in some sectors. Political uncertainty was also cited as being an issue (the federal government was still shut down at the time), though these fears may have been ameliorated slightly due to the temporary deal in place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What the fed is paying close attention to**: international market instability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOdds I think rates increase this month: 15% ^(This is the one I'm playing because I'm a degenerate autist.)\n\nOdds I think rates increase by march 60%:\n\nOdds I think rates increase by June: 90%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, if you guys haven't seen this shit check it out:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF1YX7NWH7Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF1YX7NWH7Q)\n\n*Interview with Powell in Jan 14.*\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook\\_20190116.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/BeigeBook_20190116.pdf)\n\n*Beige Book Jan 16*\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20190125a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20190125a1.pdf)\n\n*SNCP 2018 for Q1 and Q3 released Jan 25*", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I do think some the most emphasized line items of the presser will be corporate and national debt.
