Its almost like modeling a binary event.  Are they going to be more dovish or hawkish than what the market is expecting.  Your inputs would be economic data and inflation data and even the stock market itself as well as the rates to get a sense of what the market is expecting.  Trading it on a hunch is what I did personally.  I never said that I modeled the fed minutes cus to me its not worth the time but I would say its certainly possible.  In my job I have attempted to model much more obscure events. And sure we can argue correlation vs causation and how impactful the model is but the fed is supposed to make decisions off of their dual mandate and you can certainly model that with the goal not being to model what the fed will necessarily say but to model the likelihood of their interest rate projections and then to trade off of that if the market is mispricing that", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "thank you", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’m sure that you could use NLP to find some underlying relationship between the fed minutes and stock movements.
