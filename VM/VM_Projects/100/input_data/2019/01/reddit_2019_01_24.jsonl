As far as chips are concerned, the data centers are where the big money is.\n\nFurthermore it has a lot to do with the way amd uses infinity fabric to make multichip dies function as a single chip.  It keeps yields high and costs down so they are able to charge less money for roughly equal throughput when framed against intel's offerings.  One thing that made me chuckle in the call was when he said something to the effect of \"since shit's getting cheaper in the CPU space, we couldn't charge a kidney for our shit anymore\" which is what ryzen did and has been doing to upset the CPU space both for the PC and data center markets.\n\nIntel's data center chips are extremely difficult to manufacture because they still make monolith chips which have a low yield and very very high price tag (9 thousand a piece back when I was following this stuff closer).  So picture a single chip that needs to have x amount of cores and they all need to perform to x specifications.  If a single core fails to meet the specs, the chip needs to be binned down to a cheaper price point, and that binning process keeps going further and further down all the way to the PC platform.  The way that ryzen circumvents this is by only needing to make 8 cores work on a single chip then glueing it to other 8 core chips to make 32, 64 or whatever core count they're up to now.  When Intel needs to have ALL 32, 64 cores to pass inspection simultaneously, on the same die, to have a marketable chip for the server space.\n\nOne thing to note is that Intel picked up Jim Keller to design a new chip for the company and he is one of the best minds in the industry for designing chips.  He is somewhat of a hero at amd for designing the athlon 64 (I believe it was) and it was so superior to intel's offerings at the time that intel had to license the 64bit tech from amd back in the day before x86 came about.  Jim Keller came back to amd I think in 2013 or 2014 and he headed the development of a new chip which was later released as ryzen.  So look out for Intel about 2 years from now, as I fully expect Jim Keller to blow the hinges off the CPU space again but this time it will be from team blue", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the wise words *looks at username*...friend.", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It will pull everybody down but AMD's report will pull AMD back up.

Announced continuation of $0.36/share dividend and focused on rewarding shareholders (in spite of [Moody's downgrade in 2018](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moodys-downgrades-starbucks-ratings-on-concerns-it-is-borrowing-to-reward-shareholders-2018-06-20)). 2019 guidance was reiterated with no change, but missed slightly on some expectations; operating margin also expected to be down \"moderately\" for FY 2019. Growth was largely fueled by Americas, with China posting only +1% in comps this Q despite growing store count by 18% compared to last year. CC heavily reiterated the point of \"playing the long game\" in China, and also discussed growing $BABA and UberEATS partnerships. Concerns may arise from any slowdowns in Chinese consumer spending and economic weakness.*\n\n-----\n\nFeel free to suggest links / additions in the comments below.\n\nDon't forget SBUX is a key component of our [WSB white girl ETF $BECKY](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/agdzpj/current_performance_of_the_white_girl_etf_ytd/), which has been outperforming SPY this year.", "id": "ajgnm9", "created_utc": 1548361638.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "I hope the CEO gets on the call and starts with: whats up my niggs.\nThen, quits ", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "ATH tomorrow baby!
