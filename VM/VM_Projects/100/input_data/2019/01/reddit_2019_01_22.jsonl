Their growth is expected to slow down for the next couple years so the recent drop was justified. With a decrease in earnings growth you should expect wall street to give a decreased valuation which is what we have seen with the earnings multiple dropping to about 20. \n\nWith the current growth forecast I dont see this as a bargain, but rather a fairly priced company if not overvalued. The reason you saw NVDA run so well the past 5 years was due to averaging about 40% yoy growth, and since growth is expected to diminish the P/E came down to reflect that.\n\nWhen the company's past performance was similar to its current projection we consistently saw a valuation of about 15 P/E.
