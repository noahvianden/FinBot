This story is nearly as old as markets themselves. Every credit expansion in history has been followed by a period of deflation. The more exaggerated the credit expansion the worse the subsequent period of deflation. The credit expansion does not create real new wealth it merely redistributes it from the last to receive the newly created credit to the first. Who receives it first in our system? Government, Wall Street, and other big corporations and players with the easiest access to that credit. And where have you seen the greatest increases in prices? Exactly where you would expect. Sectors with significant government subsidies such as healthcare and education, government debt, and equities. Who were the losers? The people who don’t have exposure to financial assets benefiting from the inflation. Over half the country doesn’t own any stocks. Over 80% of financial assets are held by 10% of the population. 43% are held by the top 1%. Kind of explains the increase in inequality doesn’t it?\n\n At the end of the credit cycle you can either let the deflation proceed or you can reinflate the bubble. Deflation is just the opposite of the inflation. It’s not the boogeyman as is uncritically accepted conventional wisdom. Since most of the population doesn’t have any exposure to the the stuff that benefitted the most from the inflation they aren’t hurt nearly as bad by the deflation as the top 10% and above are. I’m not saying this period is sunshine and roses for your average joe but it’s not the end of the world. You know who it is the end of the world for? The elites. The politico-economic establishment that saw a massive increase in the concentration of wealth and power in their hands during the inflation. There are currently over $9 Trillion of negatively yielding government bonds worldwide. Negative yields would never exist in a free market. They only exist because central banks have been price insensitive buyers of this debt for a decade. Who in their right mind would buy peripheral European debt at the same same yield as a US 10yr if the ECB wasn’t putting a perpetual bid underneath them? So what do you think happens to these bond when the ECB stops buying them? Their prices will plummet and the banks and other institutions that hold them will suffer and likely fail. After 2008, central banks didn’t reinflate the bubble (which was caused by the same exact thing, artificially suppressed interest rates and credit expansion) to save your average joe, the did it so the economic establishment wouldn’t have to lose their shirts. \n\nThe credit cycle *is* turning and there is going to be a choice just as there always is. Deflation or inflation. Deflation will ultimately mean a redistribution of wealth from the establishment that has relentlessly siphoned it off from the rest of society for the past three decades to everyone else who has been left behind in stagnation. Reinflation will only result in an ever greater concentration of that wealth. It’s nearly inevitable that the route of reinflation will be taken short of a full blown revolution. I’m not even sure if they will be able to blow it back up this time but if they can the monetary expansion required this time around will be so massive that it will likely result in a hyperinflation that destroys the currency.

Like I mentioned in another comment - Apple customers are not going elsewhere to upgrade their device, their consumer # grew, the # of first time iPhone from android users went up.  The problem is Apple and other companies (Samsung etc) have devices that are good to withstand 3 year cycles now, I imagine Samsung will see the same decrease in sales due to this phenomenon, but as always Apple is the popular brand to pick on. Apple still has the same user base that is still tied to an ecosystem so they will still make their $10/mo on AM, $5/mo on storage, their $x/mo on app purchases/other subscriptions. They will still have people buying iPhones, just on 2-3 year cycles instead of 1-2 year cycles.   \n\nPrice aside, there isn’t anything in any of the new flagship models of any competitor to justify an early upgrade.   Last years model is that good and this years model will be just as good.   To avoid this Apple and others would need to drop their performance and quality of the phones to ensure they need to be upgraded.   It’s funny, when a phone doesn’t last 2 years people are like oh man that company doesn’t know it’s customers and then when they make a phone that lasts 3 years it’s the same thing - I really don’t think the price kept people back from buying a new iPhone it was the price combined with the fact the last set of phones still rock.   Even if the phone was $800 vs $1100 it’s still $800 more than anyone needs to spend and next year, cause they didn’t spend $800 like they used to every year, they can afford the $1100 phone. \n\nBack to amazon - yes it is creating a service for the consumer, however, it’s also destroying an existing service.  How many stores will you see close down because of amazon? Toys r us, target in Canada, Sears, Lowe’s, Rona. All seeing decreased sales and store closures.
