Problem is the new engines are bigger (bigger fan diameter). They increased front wheel length and moved the engines further forward plus higher on the wing. The wheel change resulted in a slight back angle of the plane when on the ground, no real issue and as far as i know, no one notices. The engine move though, during climb-out (time after take off and climb to cruise) the new location of the engines resulted in a change of flight characteristics to the plane compared to the other 737 variants.  The change was big enough for Boeing to develop the MCAS system. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat this did was automatically adjust the elevator Trim to account for the engine performance. The result was a plane that had the same flight characteristics to the pilots. The system seems to be simple, a little wind vane near the front of the plane stays lined up with the airflow thus giving an Angle of attack reading that the flight computer can compare with other readings to determine what trim to add. Problem being, if this simple sensor (possibly in conjunction with other information) can result in the flight computer quite literally flying the plane straight down. Now the symptoms of this would be identical to known training items for pilots to stop...meaning, runaway trim procedures. These are well known procedures to pilots; but i question how frequently pilots practice these or are even looking out for. During climb out the Trim wheel (next to pilot knees) is constantly spinning and making noise automatically in all aircraft. I hypothesize it is not unreasonable to assume that a fault in the MCAS system would go unnoticed for a period of time or be somewhat tricky to quickly diagnose. IF trim gets too far out of alignment, as i understand it, it can negate the elevators flaps ability to overcome. So if this system goes haywire and pilot doesnt stop it, it can result in a flight condition that would only be save-able if the pilot manually re-trims the plane.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think people assume that it is easy to blame pilots on this...however Boeing didn't do themselves any favors. The did not notify pilots of this system \\[article link\\]([https://leehamnews.com/2018/11/14/boeings-automatic-trim-for-the-737-max-was-not-disclosed-to-the-pilots/](https://leehamnews.com/2018/11/14/boeings-automatic-trim-for-the-737-max-was-not-disclosed-to-the-pilots/)). Another issue was the pilots could not over-ride this system by doing what all pilots are trained to do in case of an emergency: Aviate (Aviate, Navigate, Communicate). Meaning, as a pilot, if you are in an emergency situation, your number one priority is fly the damn plane. In theory, if the plane is pitching nose down, you pull back on the stick and it should correct the issue assuming nothing is physically damaged on the aircraft. This malfunction apparently would not be solved by this philosophy. It had to be diagnosed and switches flipped to make it stop. The thinking seems to be, \"well, if this system malfunctions, the pilots will use the already established procedure for runaway trim. So no real need to let anyone know.\" That begs the question though...why not tell them anyway? That is the $$ question. Why not make it known this MCAS system was built into the plane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is why i think this whole thing could end up being a big issue for Boeing financially. It has to do with \"Type Rating.\" I don't know shit about what regulating bodies use to determine what classifies an aircraft with type rating. What i do know is it takes month(s) of training for pilots to become certified in a different aircraft \"Type\". If the 737 max was classified as a different \"aircraft type\" than the older 737 models it would have had huge financial implications to airline companies when deciding between the A320 neo and 737 max. Boeing was able to have the 737 max stay under the current 737 type thus only a minimal (3 hours as i understand it) training for pilots was required. What if the reason they did not disclose the MCAS system was because without it, the 737 exhibited different flight characteristics than older 737 aircraft that it would have necessitated a \"type rating\" thus incurring significant costs to airline companies? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf that is true, how does the 737 max get un-grounded? Will world wide regulatory bodies accept a simple flight manual change to include the MCAS system with a brief pilot training? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill they require boeing to completely remove the system? Would that result in a new type rating which would require an entire training regiment to be developed which could mean the Max stays grounded for months?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr will they require changes to the MCAS system to alter how it fails? Would this mean new flight tests to test these changes? How long would it take to do this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what do you do as an investor? I would think if the MAX is grounded more than a week things could get bad for Boeing. They are making some 42 737's per month in Renton WA. I dont know how many are MAX's but if they are unable to deliver completed aircraft they are going to start to run out of room. Will companies cancel orders? I really doubt it. They would have to go to the back of the line for the A320 and the 737 max is a better aircraft (when it doesn't fly itself into the ground, which it wont be doing anymore). Boeing may need to take it in the wallet though...airlines may ask for compensation from Boeing if the pilots need increased training than was advertised. Boeing may also have a bad quarter for missed deliveries. Long term I dont think much of this but short term Puts may be profitable in the coming weeks.

This is insane.\n\nIf I told you, you'd be angry with ~~me~~ ~~Boeing~~ aircraft manufacturers all over the world.\n\nOk... here's how this goes.  You've got separate silos of teams of people who all have input to the production process, most of them coders.  The 737 line is a well tested air frame.  About the only thing you can do to \"improve it\" is add better engines, lower its weight and improve the flight control software.  That last part... the software.  It's got a lot of moving parts.  You've got the people doing the hydraulics.  You've got aerodynamic instrumentation.  You've got avionics.  You've got people modeling the physics and aerodynamics.  You've got people developing automation.  You've got human factors people. You've got people packing it all up into a bunch of little glass displays or possibly a heads up display that pilots can easily and quickly ascertain \"situational awareness\".  How do you bring it all together and, perhaps, more importantly, how do you do **software testing**?  Just throw it all together in an aircraft and go for a test flight?  \n\nHell no.  That shit is *super* expensive.  You use simulators.  Simulators have a very unique problem that's typically identified during the training of pilots.  It's called \"Negative Transfer\".  That's when things happen (or maybe don't happen) in the simulator that don't happen (or maybe do happen) in the real aircraft.  It's basically a loss of simulation fidelity that results in behaviors that don't map to any kind of reality that happens when you're flying the actual aircraft.  Pilots learn things they shouldn't when negative transfer happens.  The most obvious case of negative transfer that I can think of happened with an air force pilot who did a C-17 performed an airshow demo that he practiced in a simulator first.  He then went out in the real aircraft and flew the exact profile he had practiced in the simulator and ended up crashing the aircraft because some boundary control surface behaviors weren't accurate in the simulator.\n\nWell, I've got bad news for you.... the exact same thing happens to automation and flight control engineers.  Software testing passes code in the simulator because of negative transfer.  In this case, it's not because anyone is flying these aircraft at the edge of their limits, but, rather, because something exceedingly simple happened, like the failure of a pitot static system airspeed indicator.  Now, if you look at the nose of a 727 Max 8, you'll see a plethora of aerodynamic instrumentation protruding from either side of the nose of the aircraft in some of the cleanest airflow that happens on that shape as it moves through the air.  So, why one instrument failure produces the results we're seeing is the billion dollar question Boeing needs to answer/fess' up to.\n\nWhat's painfully obvious is that Boeing (vis-a-vis the FAA) is not requiring full flight testing of all code modifications to the aircraft's systems.  Probably a little handshake deal between industry and government.  That shit is all fine and good as long as the industry holds up their end of the bargain and goes through extraordinary measures to make sure their methodologies are safe... god knows those in government are there because they couldn't hack it in industry, so I don't really expect them to be competent.  What I expect from government is for them to acknowledge their limitations and not make the kind of deals with industry that result in catastrophic outcomes.  In short, I expect government to insist that Boeing do actual flight testing of their software products and lots of it.\n\nSo, Boeing, how many git commits does it take before you quit testing in a simulator and actually go fly the code?", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "This is the other reason I read this fukt sub.
