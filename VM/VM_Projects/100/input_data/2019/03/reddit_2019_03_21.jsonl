Part of my job consists of me overseeing our payroll department. Roughly 90% of our employees do direct deposit but there are still a couple dozen that take home physical checks. They’re usually older and their reasoning is they like having cash, spend less/track better when they have all their cash on them, or because they don’t trust the technology.

How they pay their rent/mortgage, bills, and other stuff I have no idea. I know they cash their checks at stores, some go the really old school way of going into stores with cash to pay bills (not sure if it’s wiring money or money order or something else but they get it done somehow), and others are simply reckless with their finances so they don’t really have any bills because everything is pretty much blown on booze, scratch tickets/gambling, child support, fancy toys/gadgets, and such.
