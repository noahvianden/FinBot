People act like this is a one year project. It was a 15+ years project. The tax incentives are contingent on whether Amazon fulfills their end of the bargain.\n\nThe city isn't creating tech jobs like these. NYC is primarily a financial sector market. Adding these tech jobs in a location that desperately needs some commercial activity would have been perfect. Sets a great example and precedent for other tech companies to start migrating towards NYC if there are more talent available.\n\nRents are going to keep going up. Amazon wouldn't have prevented that. This area has been increasing at a high rate because of its proximity to Manhattan. Though I do see a concern here, this happens in any developing market. It's simply a trade-off that provides a long-term benefit.\n\nYou're missing the part where additional commercial activity would increase. As I've said, I live minutes away from the proposed location. This area was primarily for factories and warehouses which have been abandoned. It was recently designated as an opportunity zone.

There is no lump-sum payment, no money available to NYers right now, and Amazon aren't getting anything in return if they aren't providing results. The idea that there are too many negatives for Amazon's arrival that it wouldn't make sense is simply a poor argument. Are you implying that high paying jobs shouldn't exist because it would drive up rent prices? What if there wasn't any tax incentive? How would that prevent rent prices if Amazon still chose to have their HQ2 here? Did you know that New Jersey and Maryland also proposed a $7 billion tax incentive to Amazon? The taxes provided simply dwarfs the negatives - which so far, has primarily been the rent prices increasing.

The tax incentives aren't actually contingent upon anything really. While you're right that the 3 billion isn't a lump sum, 500 million of it is, and the remainder is a tax credit of $100,000 per employee regardless of what those employees are paid, or how many are hired. That's pretty insane. That said, I never even mentioned them in my original comment, so I don't really see what you're arguing with there. \n\n2. Yes and no. While NYC doesn't have as many tech jobs as silicon valley, there are still quite a few. Google's office here in Chelsea already employs 7,000 and the new one opening in the village will employ even more than the existing one. And California and Washington are the only states in with more tech job growth than here. There are almost 8,000 tech firms in the city alone and it's the fastest growing sector in the city, regardless of whether Amazon is here or not. \n\n3. Rents will continue to increase, yes. However, any big employer like that will give landlords an excuse to pump up rents more than they might have otherwise. As a landlord, I've done it myself. The location in particular poses an issue because it's not Manhattan. If they were opening HQ2 in Tribeca or FiDi, then nobody would have had a problem where rents are concerned since it wouldn't have had the same sort of affect. \n\n4. Commercial activity would not really have been all that affected because there's already plenty of stuff to do in LIC, and most of the workers would be commuting from outside the area, or already live in the area. Southern Connecticut, Long Island, Manhattan, other parts of Queens and Brooklyn. Sure some new commercial activity would happen, but it would be minimal. \n\n5. Yeah, they offered more, but they have to. This is New York, not Baltimore. It's objectively better in basically every way. Amazon greatly exaggerated both jobs and tax numbers. Amazon themselves would be unlikely to pay any taxes even without the incentives, as they have been doing and a good portion of the workers at the facility would likely be receiving services, not contributing to them.

All businesses come under increasing pressure to improve cash revenues as diminishing cash operating cash flows make business unable to extend credit to each other. Eventually, cash flow pressures will push firms to default on debt bank debt in addition to trade credit defaults. \n\n\n**Reduced revenue & profit (inventory write downs):** the value of COGS becomes greater than sales because customers don't have the cash to pay. Customers who bought on credit will default. The reduced income to the business makes it hard and eventually impossible to service debt as the value of debt payments (as a % of revenue) continue to increase as revenues decrease. As business revenue decreases, companies keep slashing prices to stimulate sales and this becomes a spiral to the bottom. \n\n\n**Reduced consumption &  unemployment:** As firms face reduced operating cash flows and are less and less able to secure either bank debt, bond investors, and trade credit, they resort to increasing headcount reductions to make up their shortfalls. Now, former-employees have asset backed debts (houses and cars, etc) and revolving credit accounts which they can no longer pay because there are no longer jobs for them. They also can't afford spending much beyond necessities in order to survive until they can get work.

There is some research indicating that this effect is quite weak, and becomes weaker with later rounds of QE. The main effect might be on confidence, but that wears off too. \n\nTo the point that Keynesian policy is now impossible. Keynesian economics is usually countercyclical fiscal policy.
