In certain circumstances wind flutter interaction with the AOA probes could cause intermittent compliance flags to the MCAS system causing nose down overtrim. Due to the transient nature of the signals the stall redundancy routine would not be triggered (transient signals of under 10-15ms), which would otherwise cross reference other flight parameters for validation, so a single point of failure became possible through the AOA probe, leading to progressive nose down trimming with no associated stall or comparator warnings. Only when the nose down trim reaches the stops does the stick shaker and associated stall cacophony come on, causing utter confusion as airspeed is progressively increasing, pitch falling, STAB TRIM is fully nose down, and any nose up elevator input seemingly produces no effect due to the massive stabilizer force. Seeing how the MCAS architecture wan't briefed to pilots, the massively confusing and contradictory warnings, the response to such a situation, especially in high workload phases of flight can easily lead to the unfortunate events we saw in Indonesia and now Ethiopia.

Best bet is we'll see all the background information come out in the inevitable class action lawsuits for negligent homicide and criminal negligence, along with conspiracy, possibly even involving FAA leadership, as there have been reports of ex-Boeing executives occupying oversight positions at the FAA... (not forgetting that the current SECDEF is an ex Boeing executive...) This will definitely be a case to follow once it all unravels, hopefully with no more deaths.\nInteresting to see that even after multiple 1st world countries have grounded 2/3rds of the fleet, the FAA, which in such circumstances would be logical to follow suit, has explicitly declared that a grounding will NOT happen.
