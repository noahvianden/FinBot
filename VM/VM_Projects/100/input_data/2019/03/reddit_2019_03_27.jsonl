At the time of his firing, morale was a disaster and the company was in dire straights.   Jobs was legendary for how abrasive and downright nasty he could be, and *not* just in the aggressively perfectionist way his career was later known for - just plain meanness, and self destructive pettiness towards teams he was not on.  The Apple II was Apple's breakout product, and, to paraphrase Woz and others, Jobs treated the team like shit and constantly sabotaged them because *he* wasn't personally very involved in that project.\n\n The original Macintosh, Jobs' baby, was a financial debacle that nearly killed the company.  Jobs' trademark attitudes of perfectionism, huge emphasis on engineering, desire for closed systems, and love of bombastic marketing simply did not work given the company's position and resources.   The Macintosh was a flop.\n\nUpon ditching Jobs, they made the changes that Jobs was unwilling to make.  They also, frankly, were a lot more pleasant to their employees than he was.  The Macintosh II, a product developed mostly *without* Jobs, represented almost everything he fought against - an  open system, color instead of higher resolution black+white, etc.  They designed the product in secret from Jobs, and demoted him (essentially the firing) in order to release it over his protests.\n\nThe Macintosh II was one of the company's most successful products ever.  After his firing, Jobs started up NeXT computing.  Have you ever heard of them?  I wouldn't be surprised if you hadn't because the company was a disaster for all the same reasons why he was fired.\n\nJobs himself has called his firing one of the best things that ever happened to him.  He came back far more mature, and with a market situation more appropriate for his approach.  \n\nNo company is ever one person, and one person alone.  Even the titans of industry are sometimes not the best fit for a given moment, and sometimes they need to be reined in.  Musk is human.  Humans sometimes go down the wrong path and refuse to change.  Humans have breakdowns.  It is perfectly plausible that at some point in the future Musk's current all encompassing role at Tesla will not be the best fit.  That is why boards exist.

And even without actual groupthink in play, many Internet posters find dismissing an argument much quicker and easier than evaluating it. In addition, the term \"concern troll\" focuses not on what the person is actually saying, but on some alleged agenda.**\n\n>**Thus, if misused, it is the perfect refuge for someone who has no counter to the actual argument: simply ignore the points made, allege some other position, and then accuse the other person of lying if they deny that that is what they're really saying.** It's a combination of straw man and argumentum ad hominem: make up something to attack, and ignore their actual points on the basis that since the points were made by someone acting in bad faith, they need not be addressed. \n\nI don't want to get in the middle of your beef with /u/flufferbot01.
