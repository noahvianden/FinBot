The aim is to improve the statistical likelyhood of success trade, reduce losses on bad trade and increase gains on good trade. Its not guaranteed profit.\n\nI know a lot of people likes to quote Efficient Market Theory on why TA bad, but EMT is only true when time frame is large enough. On shorter time frame the market is irrefutably inefficient - this is why when bad news come out, share price doesn't instantly drop to where it should be in a gigantic red 1m candle, but instead develops a series of bear flags as greedy investors bet on reversals at the flag area. It is also the rationale behind pump and dumps, which shouldn't exist if the market is efficient. Technical analysis (Or rigorously, one school of TA) aims to find these inefficiencies and profit from it.\n\nAlso, as your time frame gets larger and larger, fundamental changes tend to overpower technicals because technicals are limited to short terms. This is another reason why I never used TA on time frame larger than a year.\n\nto elaborate on my second point, basically i m saying TA isnt all that reliable. It gets things wrong and fails all the time. But what it does is it increases correct prediction, on average. Here i'm not taking about TA predicting \"if the price would go up or down\" - i mean it predicts \"When the price will go up or down, and by how much\". I can confidently tell you, in the absence of fundamentals (I.e. short  time frame with no price catalyst) TA is definitely better at predicting the latter than a random guess. TA players like myself use this to advantage and profit from it.\n\nIt is also worth noting there is zero guarantee that the prediction from TA is correct. It merely tries to increase the statistical likelihood of good trades vs bad ones, and help you come out on top as you place more and more trades.\n\nPs. It should be noted that effectiveness of TA is proportion to liquidity, and liquidity is probably the biggest issue with TA. As your position size increases, your existance starts to impact short term supply/demand and therefore break TA. Its why those youtube technical traders usually dont have huge account size despite been super successful (Usually they have ~30k to 100k in their account). It also provides a good reason why they wants to give away their money making secret, because 1. Profit from selling courses is comparable to if not higher than trading and 2. Persuading more people to join the market increases liquidity and therefore increases their chance of successful large position trades.\n\nps2.
