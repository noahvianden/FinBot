{"title": "I'm an astrophysicist (read: data-scientist) and I perform my own (simple) stock analyses: comments welcome! (March 15, 2019)", "selftext": "This is my second post of this series! If the community finds this useful, I'd be happy to continue posting (perhaps daily?).\n\nExplanation: my approach is based on simple moving averages (SMA). Typical analysts use either the 50-day or 200-day SMA, but there is value in averaging over other periods as well. My approach is to run a loop from 200 to 10 days, and for each period compute the SMA, it's derivative, and second derivative. I then plug in today's date, and take weighted averages of the current SMA and its derivatives. The average derivative is essentially the stock's \"velocity\" (in %/day), and the average 2nd derivative is its \"acceleration\" (%/day\\^2).\n\nThis approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations on financials, etc. It is simply based on the history of each ticker. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite ticker added, just let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMarch 15th update: thanks to all of your feedback yesterday, I've made a few improvements:\n\n1. I changed the minimum SMA to 10 days instead of 5 (this is to be consistent with the target date predictions) thanks u/kotixa for inspiring this change\n2. I am now taking weighted averages, instead of applying equal weights. The weights are set as the inverse period used to calculate the SMAs. This essentially weights recent trends higher than long-term trends, similar to the momentum-based strategies suggested yesterday by u/velos00 and u/yebidepoj\n3. I added target prices and % change for 10 trading days in the future incorporating up to the second derivative. This should help to track how well this strategy is doing at predicting future moves, and to define entry/exit points. Thanks to suggestions by u/hcasaomlitter and u/kotixa! This will enable backtesting in the future (also possible now if anyone wants to look at the source code and run their own historical tests).\n4. A quick note about backtesting, which has been a frequently asked question: while this needs to be done more rigorously in the future, a quick example from 10 days in the past predicted an 8.5% rise in the sum price of the top 10 listed tickers. The actual rise was closer to 5%. More historical testing, and tracking of the comparison of predictions to actual performance in the future, are certainly required!\n\nMarch 16th update: github link to source code: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\\_optimize\\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)\n\nCheers!\n\nDisclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these \"predictions\" will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.\n\nUpdate: Wow, thanks for the excellent response everyone! And to the kind stranger who golded me (I've never been golded before!) I will do my best to keep this service going in the future! To make matters easier for mobile users, in the future I will post the top ten in the main post and the full list in a comment.\n\n1 --- GH --- price = 101.5 --- sma = 67.3 --- d/dt = 1.55%/day ---

I can think of several ways in which volume information could be used to strengthen these types of models, but I'm not sure I'd be saying anything you don't know or haven't tried already.\n\nOne possibility would be to validate or invalidate your model's predictions based on how volume is changing (increasing or decreasing). For example, it is generally assumed that a price increase that is accompanied by an increasing volume is a sign that the trend is likely to continue in the near future. But a decreasing volume is seen as a sign that the price movement is about to reverse. I have observed this correlation in intraday price movements, however, I'm not sure if it's also true over a period of several days. Looking at finviz.com charts that display daily volume information, it kinda looks like there is a visible correlation for short periods of a few days. Changes in volume typically anticipate changes in price (ignoring external factors/catalysts like news and such). It appears that volume and price movement are more highly correlated in shorter time windows, which is also why I think this information is worth testing in a model like yours.\n\nTo implement this, I dunno... I guess you could try to calculate the avg volume and its rate of change (a % or possibly velocity or acceleration derivatives like you do for SMAs) in the last 5/10 days and compare that to the trailing 30 or 50 days or so. See if significant changes in recent days correlate with your model's predictive accuracy. I'm not sure if this makes sense lol.\n\nAnother thing that could be investigated in your model is a potential correlation with the trailing 5 or 10-day difference between buying volume (trades at ask price) and selling volume (trades at bid price). But I'm not sure how to get access to this type of data...\n\nAnother potential use of volume could be simply checking if there is any difference in the accuracy of predictions made for high volume stocks and low volume stocks. Intuitively it seems that higher volume stocks should be more predictable, but maybe one might want to just use a measure of volatility for this rather than volume... not sure.\n\nJust some ideas to test/backtest...", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for sharing your experience!

It began by studying various \"indicators\" used by traders and realizing that it's all just basic maths under the hood, sometimes dated due to pre-computer constrains (and lasting \"faith\" in tool X or Y). Examples like the Ichimoku or Madrid (\"ribbons\" of MA).\n\nIn particular, I tried to identify periodicity patterns and rate of change, which took me very close to what you do. My questions were very basic: can I identify a 5-days (1-week) period in the data to confirm popular belief and media cycles? 1-year? are there notable \"events\" related to time, price and/or volume? (I tried to factor these 3 because together they form the only primary data we get). etc.\n\nDiscussing this with much more seasoned traders, and people better at math (including computer heads), I was served the three following remarks:\n\n- using past data means you're \"lagging\" more as you go back further; which ultimately defeats your identifying current trends, so timing is essential. \n\n    Most indicators aim at reducing the lag (like advanced MA using exponentials and weights), but you're an astrophysician, you're used to look back in time. You know what I mean and the implications for the model: have circumstances changed enough? Your CBR not so much, but the 2010's versus 1980's in terms of economic environment may be _sufficiently_ different to throw models off unless we could compensate — but what's a 'Hubble' constant of stocks exactly? Rates? Growth? hard problem. \n\n    _(edit: I've seen interesting research on sentiment analysis using machine learning, dataset being e.g. newpapers headlines or twitter nowadays, which is possibly even a predicting stock market indicator in an of itself according to some; could be used as a supplement to bullet 3 below. The logic is so simple it hurts: people depressed generally leads to stock market down or consolidating within the next 3 days on average; conversely happy sentiments tend to indicate gains or reversal from bear; but I'm pretty sure I've never seen actual statistical significance in public stuff, understandably so I guess)._\n\n- average-based methods will only ever yield a <1SD (inferior to 1 Standard Dev.) positive or negative performance given enough time (actually limits to +/- 0 the real stock value, given infinity). That's mathematically obvious I suppose, and is only false in the real world because so far stocks go up historically (and we introduce trend \"bias\" in the model as I suggest below). Average-based methods are basically trend-following, good when trending and random otherwise; allowing automatic piloting for _investment_ (long-term), not trading per se. Too chaotic to use over short periods, like swing trading, which is done with the \"nose\" more than maths.\n\n    I've personally confirmed this with backtesting many variations of my methods (the most advanced would use a first-degree derivative to decide which MA-length to trust most, triggering extra-sweet calls, but over time, you just rejoin the trend; you can even \"accelerate\" time by going more granular — it's all very fractal with increased randomness/noise as you zoom in.\n\n- There are mathematical models that work, none proven (used by companies, proprietary, [some famous for it](https://youtu.be/gjVDqfUhXOY)). \n\n    Arguably, the best chance we've got (as small fishes) is using machine learning to brute-force your fine-tuning of a \"good enough\" model to a particular stock/index. Essentially find the statistical troughs and peaks of your fitting functions parameters empirically by crunching billions of variables through a simple-enough logic (compute constrains to train enough neural nets within human time, to get a decent one eventually; afaik these are NOT happy with polymomials or anything even remotely intensive, so we need to abstract _a lot_, uncomfortably so at first). \n\n    This is as close as it gets to identifying 'constants' (parameters for the model/indicator). Imho, taking cues for people who've tried a lot of things over the years.\n\n    Haven't tried that yet because I lack the skills for now; however I've spoken with a few people who told me they have decent returns with such custom models (but you really need to train 1 for each ticker). We're talking beating the market by anywhere from -5% to +25% approx (there will be bad years especially if the stock tanks and you don't shift your model to favor shorting or put options; identifying the trend is clearly priority #1 upon which to build the \"direction\" (long/short) of your calls logic, essentially modelling \"bias\").\n\nThat's it, not much time right now but I find this all very interesting. I'm pretty sure your approach is good because everything tends to confirm that stocks behave like a natural growth phenomemon, comparable to biology or physics indeed. However, I find that it's good to keep an eye on the macro and, as a human, keep ultimate control over the system: turn it off or on; tune it more or less aggressively, reverse the identified trend manually, etc. \n\nA computer remains pretty dumb in otherwise crystal-clear situations for human beings (like a typical high when you _know_ it's time to sell even if all models and pundits scream otherwise; that's actually confirmation to run the other way in the twisted world of trading). And these key moments are very much when average-based model fail spectacularly and loose all the gains they're able to accumulate when trending. \n\nBe extremely careful of trend changes (sudden reversals, false moves, etc) if you're going that route, hence my macro outlook (I don't necessarily mean \"fundamentals\" i.e. emotional stuff, sometimes just looking at charts tells you the probability of a trend change is becoming too high to bet on). Be freaking reactive when you, as a human, know enough to direct your system.\n\nI'd suggest this one obscure YouTube channel which is very atypical and I think comes from an institution who uses a comparable model: [Ciovacco Capital](https://www.youtube.com/user/CiovaccoCapital). I like his thinking, analytical and rational above all.\n\nI'm very curious about your experience and observations. Next hypotheses, etc.\n\n____\n\nEdit: one last thing. \"Hedging\" is the perfect complement to form a sustainable investing system using such a model we've discussed. It's a way to \"insulate\" your investment from the trend; which seems stupid until you remember that the rule #1 of investing/trading is \"preservation of capital\". Not gain. It's a complex topic and I'm nowhere near qualified to explain but the gist of it for your use is that we systematically hedge our positions by taking opposite-trend insurance (if we tank A we make it up from B, most of the time we'll simply profit from both using the model in 'reversed' modes). E.g. gold (short) + DOW (long) (oversimplified example).\n\n____\n\nTo sum it up, ITT:\n\n1. decent model to gain within trends, fine-tuned to 1 ticker\n2. within a general hedging strategy (to validate deployment of the model on value X, Y, Z and tactical assets allocation, i.e. how much in each X Y Z).\n3. human awareness to navigate trend reversals and sometimes force bias (either increase hedging when uncertain, conversely increase bias when confident)\n\nis bound to work over enough time (1-3 decades) because it's just sound investing, AI-assisted to act alone as a 1,000 man team productivity-wise.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "can you send the source code to me as well?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "PMd!
