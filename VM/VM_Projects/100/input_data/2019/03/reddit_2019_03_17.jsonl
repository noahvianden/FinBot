{"title": "I'm an astrophysicist and I perform my own (simple) stock analyses based on kinematic principles: comments welcome! (March 17, 2019)", "selftext": "Third post of the series! Thanks for everyone’s wonderful feedback so far and to the r/stocks moderators for their excellent support! This post reflects Friday's moves, and I am posting today (Sunday) in preparation for the upcoming trading week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play.  My script runs a loop from 50 (previously 200) to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's \"velocity\" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its \"acceleration\" (%/day\\^2), and the third derivative is the “jerk”, or change in acceleration (%/day\\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.\n\nThanks to all of your feedback yesterday, I've made a few improvements since my last post:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. I cleaned up my source code for public consumption, which can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\\_optimize\\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)\n2. Most importantly, backtesting! This has been a frequently asked question, and is without doubt an important undertaking. While more rigorous backtesting is always warranted, here’s what I have done so far: Taking SPY, DIA, and NDAQ as test cases, I ran a loop over the script (included as backtest.pro on github) and tested the predictions against the actual data. I examined mainly the directional accuracy (whether the price goes up or down), and used these to tune several of the parameters: namely how many derivatives to include in the projections, which max/min SMA periods to include, and how to optimally weight the outputs from different SMAs.Going back 1000 days and predicting 10 days into the future, this script was \\*on average\\* 61% correct at predicting the direction of change for SPY, DIA, and NDAQ. I think this is pretty decent, though of course far from perfect. Other sets of parameters that I tested typically yielded between 50-55% accuracy. For comparison, see [this](https://hackernoon.com/i-spent-20-minutes-trying-to-predict-the-stock-market-with-ai-these-are-my-results-59d48c7a388a) machine learning approach that generated excitement from the financial crowd with 54% accuracy.\n3. I am now including a relative strength index (RSI) column in the table to help identify when a stock is overbought/oversold. A typical strategy is to consider RSI>70 to be overbought, and RSI<30 to be oversold. I try to maintain a portfolio of stocks between those values, although it’s possible for an RSI to remain over 70 (or below 30) for a significant period of time. Take any predictions for stocks with RSI>70 with extreme caution as they are likely to experience a reversal!\n4. Based on the results of the backtesting, I have changed the maximum SMA from 200 to 50, and have included the third derivative in the price projections.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\\_Kinematics\\_of\\_stock\\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)\n\nCheers!\n\nDisclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.\n\n————————————————————————————-\n\nSMA = simple moving average, RSI = relative security index, tgt = target

and the price is how close it is to the opposing team's goal. \n\nThe ball moves up and down the field as it changes possession, and these motions can be pretty complicated from second to second.\n\nLet's take a running average of the ball's position over (for instance) one minute timescales, and you might see that one team has possession of the ball more than the other, and that it tends to go in a single direction with a more consistent velocity (this is the first derivative of the position or price with time). \n\nFurthermore, the velocity could be changing (the second derivative, or acceleration), and the rate of change of the velocity could also be changing (the jerk, or third derivative). \n\nIf we average over a useful time-frame such that one of these values does not change very significantly, then we can describe how close the ball is to the other goal in time with a simple formula (the kinematic equation). \n\nLet's say the jerk is zero and the acceleration is constant. Then the position of the ball can be written as X = X\\_initial + (initial velocity)\\*t + (1/2) (acceleration)\\* t\\^2 , where X is the position and t is time.\n\nThat is essentially what I am doing here, except that I average over several time periods to compute the position and its time derivatives, and then combine these in a way that gives more weight to periods with shorter timeframes, so that older (and presumably less relevant) trends affect the outcome less significantly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully this helps, I'd be happy to try further if necessary! \n\n&#x200B;", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "As someone currently studying astrophysics, this is an incredible description of what's going on.

But say you were to apply your principles to a random walk. From what I can gather, you are taking some derivatives of SMA, and then looking for periods in which they don't change. On a random walk, you'll find such periods, but they don't actually mean anything, since all motion is random.\n\nNow, of course, stock price action isn't 100% random. However, I personally don't believe it's governed by any sort of kinematics, either - at least, not by any that are easily described. Kepler was able to describe orbits kinematically because they did not deviate from those kinematics. Stocks, on the other hand, deviate based on truth, fiction, and every rumor in between.\n\nThe holy grail of technical stock analysis would be to find a set of data sources and a correlated algorithm that accurately predicted future movement without ever having to modify those parameters. This has led to the idea of using machine learning in the algorithm to constantly tweak parameters, allowing evolution but not requiring human intervention. Naturally, this leads to lots of backtesting to \"prime the engine\", so to speak, to determine a \"good\" set of parameters. This is actually where most novice quantitative programmers make their biggest mistake, which is assuming that by fitting their parameters to enough backtests that their algorithm will outperform in the future.\n\nThe problematic assumption here is that the market operates in the future in the same way that it did in the past. This is patently incorrect. Between evolution of sectors, change in monetary policy, the fickleness of human nature, and any number of other factors, the way the market works is constantly in flux. Your assumption about the underlying kinematics of the market assumes the direct opposite.\n\nAll of that said, there *are* individuals that make use of technical analysis quite successfully. This is, to my mind, likely a case of monkeys and typewriters; however, from my observations of the analysis done by a few of the more successful ones that actuality post on Reddit, several tickers, especially indices, do seem to obey certain \"rules\". However, these rules are mostly in terms of probability, eg \"the stock will probably land in range a or b in two days if no news regarding x and y comes out.\"\n\nIf you're interested in more algorithm based applications, you could try r/algotrading. However, they're a small community of pretty much exclusively amateur quants, so you probably won't get into any in depth applications.\n\nIf you're interested in trading based on quantitative methods, some members of r/thewallstreet employ a few with reasonably good results. Quite a few more use a mix of technical and qualitative analysis.\n\nGood luck to you with your trading!

I started playing with my own technical analysis about a year ago. My findings and strategy basically evolved along the following:\n\nFirst, I was fitting polynomials to long-term charts.

Adding a single sine function to the model captured most of the variations, which got me thinking that over extended timeframes many companies' stock prices actually follow rather smooth curves.\n\nThis led to largely abandoning the polynomial and sine-fitting in favor of SMAs, which are faster and easier to calculate, and do not include arbitrary choices such as the amount of time to fit, how many terms in the polynomial to include, how many sine functions to include, etc.\n\nThe only arbitrary parameter left with SMAs is the period, which I've now attempted to reduce the effect of choosing a specific period by taking SMAs over multiple periods and then a weighted average of their derivatives.\n\nAs for statistical significance of SMAs and RSIs, etc., I agree that any one metric is probably not very significant.

I determine their 52 wk HL, set a median price, then buy 15% of the stock's cash reserve when they fall 5% below it, and increasing amounts up to 45% if it falls further. When the price rises to 5% above the median, I sell 10% of the holding, and progressively more if it rises higher, up to 30% for a 15% rise.\n\nThis ensures that I always have a holding if they go above 15%, but keeps cash in my reserve.\n\nIts a very simplistic plan, but allows me to play. I usually allocate $1000 reserve for every stock I select.\n\nWhat I would love to find help with is to set up an automatic trading platform, that I can set up my rules in, and let it trade by itself. I know there are brokers that have api's that will allow this, but I simply do not have the programming skills to make it work.\n\nObviously in such a platform one's rules would have to be carefully tweaked to ensure one does not run out of cash, and to have stop-loss rules to save the bacon. \n\nMy fantasy is to have an ML component that might help with the tweaking, such as the percentage steps in the buy/sell framework (ie, for a particular stock, instead of 5% steps, perhaps 6 or 7% might be more relevant), but that could be a little farfetched.\n", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Really interesting.

Would it be possible to tweak the output of the 10 day price target, or providing a range, based on volatility? Could be either the stock's volatility or the market volatility.\n\nMy thought here is that the commonality of your positive samples (those that hit the price target) had normal market volatility. If your calculation is made during periods of high volatility, then in essence, the market would need to remain volatile for the next 10 days in order to have a high probability of success. \n\nI'm very interested in seeing the success rate when incorporating an absolute 10 day target (w/o volatility) and an adjusted 10 day target (w/ volatility) to get a 10 day price target range.\n\nFor instance:\n\n>1 --- GH --- price = **97.98** --- sma = 73.0 --- d/dt = 1.88%/day --- d2/d2t = 0.356%/day^2 --- d3/d3t = 0.0919%/day^3 --- 10day tgt = **163.6** = 67.0% --- RSI = 70.5\n\nMaybe an extreme example, but the stock has doubled in March so there is a lot of recent volatility. At some point in the future, this stock will eventually return to normal volatility and if it begins happening within the next 10 days, it won't hit that target. However, if you also had a calculated 10 day target that assumed the stock would return to normal market volatility and provided another 10 day target calculated by historical volatility, say 110.86 (I'm providing a random price target), then your 10 day price target would read a range from 110.86-163.60.
