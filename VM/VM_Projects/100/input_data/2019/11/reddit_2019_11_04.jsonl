For vehicles priced over 40,000 euros the grants will rise to 5,000 euros.\n\n> The government wants to have 10 million electric vehicles on the roads by 2030, part of an offensive designed to turn round the German car industry's perceived laggard status in e-mobility compared to its rivals in the United States and China. \n\nIt'll be interesting to see whether those grants will be restricted to cars made in Germany (although I think that'd be illegal according to EU laws).\n\nAlso interesting: a lot of bears keep pointing out that the Dutch subsidies will be reduced as of 2020, but as this shows, there are quite a few interesting markets left that need to jump-start EV adoption.  If this goes through, except Germany to become the new market to follow like we do with The Netherlands now.  Expect France to do something similar in the upcoming years as well.
