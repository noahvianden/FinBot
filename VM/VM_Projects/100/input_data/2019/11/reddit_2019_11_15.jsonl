Again, I refer you to the Forbes article, Tesla objectively spends $0 on advertising.\n\nThink about it this way, they spent some amount of money on the SpaceX launch event (marketing costs), but they had to spend $0 to actually ensure people saw it (advertising costs). Auto companies plan numerous PR stunts all the time (marketing costs), but then have to spend additional billions to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. to ensure people actually see them (advertising costs).\n\nAnd sure, they may have been the only company to have the opportunity, but in what way would that increase their costs beyond providing the car at cost? SpaceX was going to launch a concrete block before they decided to use the Roadster.\n\nRegardless, you asked why they plan their events the way they do, and my answer was that because they have been incredibly effective.
