This will.”\n\n> Hackett said it will turn a profit because the vehicle “creates the passion that follows with Mustang” and prices start in the mid-$30,000 when U.S. subsides on electric cars are factored in. “So it’s attractive to customers.”\n\n> Ford is building it in Mexico because it had an open factory there and it needed to be overhauled to build an electric vehicle, Hackett said. “As we start to adopt more electric vehicles — we had capacity down there, we had no capacity in the United States — we’re going to have electric capacity here in the United States.

They’re still avoiding questions regarding whether it’ll drive like a Mustang or not, only claiming that it’ll “inspire” you like a Mustang.\n\nHonestly seems like Ford built a wagon, added plastic cladding, lowered it, and called it a day since then they could call it a crossover for the masses. It’s like half the other crossovers on the market, except most sit slightly higher than sedans/hatches/wagons do. In this case, you don’t even have the “benefit” of added ground clearance since Ford clearly wanted to engineer around the high centers of gravity that plague crossovers.\n\n... and even then it’s doubtful that this thing will drive as nimbly as a Mustang. The Model 3 feels quite heavy as it is around corners, despite being one of the most well-rounded cars on the market, due to the immense weight of the batteries underneath. There is little chance this Mach-E drives anywhere near as well an actual Mustang with the bloated weight of a crossover body. Hell, people complain even now that the current Mustang is too bloated and heavy around corners.\n\nThe reviews are going to be brutal given the “Mustang” branding.
