Their presentation style felt like a bad copy of what Apple does at its launch events.  It doesn't feel genuine. \n\nAs for the car itself, I looked at Ford's press kit, and the spec sheet states that limited deliveries of the Extended Range model start in late 2020.  For most customers, this is realistically a 2021 car.  They are targeting 270 miles EPA range for AWD on a 98-99 kWh battery pack, 150 kW charging, and mid 5's 0-60.  Model X Long Range (all Model X are Dual Motor) rates 328 miles EPA on a similar size battery, up to 200 kW charging, and mid 4's 0-60 *today*, and **Model X is a class size up** from the Mustang Mach E.  It's bigger and bulkier, but still has superior performance metrics despite this disadvantage.\n\nThe Tesla-bashing rang hollow.  The copying of practically everything (OTA updates, front trunk, dual display layout from the Model S/X) said to me that this is a company that is trying to catch up, not a leader.  Nothing said in this presentation made me think that Ford was conducting this reveal from anything but a position of competitive disadvantage.  \n\nI understand why Ford chose to market the Mach E under the Mustang brand to get attention, but I think that was a mistake.  Why not make a Mustang Mach E that is an actual high-performance sports coupe, with a convertible option?  Mustang Mach E sounds about as silly as Nissan selling a GT-R LEAF or Skyline LEAF, or GM selling the Bolt as a Camero Bolt.\n\nI will give credit for Ford recognizing that electric vehicles are the future.

For instance, we've heard many stories of existing electric cars being anti-sold at dealers, such as BMW i3 and GM Bolt.\n\nSecondly, the tax credit will not be much of a boost for them. According to [evadoption.com](https://evadoption.com), Ford has fewer than 84,000 EV tax credits left before it starts to phase out. Likely, the next year and a half will trickle that down closer to zero through the same hybrids that have already dropped them down to less than half of their 200,000 allotment. Once dealers cooperate and start actually selling the \"affordable\" versions (40k+) their tax credit won't help consumers much. \n\nFinally, the main question is, who is this car's demographic? We know that traditional pickup truck drivers (arguably Ford's most important demographic) isn't going to buy it. Secondly, we know Mustang enthusiasts won't want it.
