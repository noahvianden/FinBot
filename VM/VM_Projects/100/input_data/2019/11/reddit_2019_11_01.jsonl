I don't think we will look back at the Y as the most transformative Tesla, or the coolest, or even the best. I think it will be viewed as the right choice for the right time. Tesla is spending very little building out these lines and the ramp will be much smoother thanks to the similarities with the 3.

Basically, I think of it like this: Tesla has just built a truly amazing platform for the Model 3. It's the best in the industry by far. For their next car they have two options: build a compact SUV on the same platform that will sell 150,000 units a quarter at scale, or build a larger SUV on a new platform that will sell 200,000 units a quarter. The first option requires much less R&D and capex, and it is much more likely to have a smooth ramp. The second option can be paired with a pickup truck.
