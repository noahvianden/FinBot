I'm about to try and explain this super simple without premium's and all that shit. \n\nFor example, you buy the option to sell 100 shares of XYZ stock at $20 a share to Bob. Expiration date is 1 week from now. \n\nBob's mindset is I want XYZ stock to go up from $20 a share to $40 a share or as high as possible. Why? Well, if in 1 week, XYZ has risen to $40 a share, the price of buying 100 shares would be $4,000. So in 1 week, the value of this operation of buying 100 shares in XYZ costs $4,000, but Bob has an options contract guaranteeing he can buy something that's worth $4,000 now for only $2,000.  Good play by Bob. He buys those shares and immediately sells them. Think about it. I buy something for $2000. It's worth $4000 if I sell it. I pocket $2000.\n\nBut lets say that doesn't happen. In 1 week the share price of XYZ goes down to $10 a share from $20 a share. Bob has a contract. He's gotta buy your shit.  Now you are selling something to Bob that was worth $2000 a week ago that's now only worth $1000. Bob agreed however to pay you $2000 for these shares, which makes him mad, because they're actually only worth $1000 now since the price per share has dropped. You just sold somebody something for $2000 that's only worth $1000.. Bob is pissed, you are happy.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you, that explains it all.
