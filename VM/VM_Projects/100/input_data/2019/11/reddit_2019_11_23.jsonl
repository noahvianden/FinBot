If Tesla had made a more normal-looking truck, it would have had a small share of a small sub-section of that market (aka electric pickup trucks).\n\nNow this design is a much smarter way to approach it:\n\n-not many people would've bought an electric Tesla pickup anyway, but now in addition to some of those people, other people may consider buying it. People who may not even need a truck, but who want to get it just for the badassery of the thing, or its originality. Or the low cost alone may attract buyers who would not have considered buying a pickup in the first place. A big deterrent to buying a truck is the fuel cost, but since electric motors are so efficient it's less of a concern.\n\n-another thing to consider is I'm pretty sure this design has some super-efficient engineering benefits behind it, AKA they'll be able to make a good profit off of it, even at a low price. Less parts probably and other things. Which would have been more difficult with a more traditional-style truck.\n\n-this unique styling is something that sticks in your mind.
