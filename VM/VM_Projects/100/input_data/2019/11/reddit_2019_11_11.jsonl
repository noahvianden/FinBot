A lot of it was driving through the Netherlands and Germany (the majority).\n\n2 observations:\n\n- I didn’t see nearly as many Model 3’s in the Netherlands than I expected to. Still saw a shitload of Audi’s and BMW’s though.  As great as Tesla’s sales have been there, I think there’s quite a bit room left in the market once those Audi and BMW leasers need to replace their vehicle in the next 2 or 3 years.  Sure, the incentives for EVs are going down, but it will still be better than a gas or diesel car.\n- Germans on the Autobahn are just batshit crazy.  Obviously, I’ve seen them do 200 km/h for longer stretches before, but that was mostly in summer weather.  This weekend, I’ve seen plenty of them doing in heavy rain and even this morning on a wet autobahn at 3 degrees celcius.  It’s like a certain part of the Germans drive as fast as they can, whenever they can, and a large other part just drives fairly normally.  Unfortunately, the latter part appears to be the one that’ll have more difficulties in affording the Model 3.  The group that can afford it (and easily, considering the number of Porsche’s and Mercedes AMG’s and Audi RS6’s and BMW M5’s I’ve seen), will probably just not be interested in them I think... As great as Tesla cars are, doing long stretches of 200km is definitely something you’ll have to give up unless you want to spend a lot of time at superchargers.  EDIT: of course, that also means the majority of this group won’t go for the German EV’s either, because they offer even less range! ;)\n\nIn short, I expect more sales from the Netherlands to come over the years, whereas I think it’ll grow _very slowly_ in Germany.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "That's why Tesla should do something about Model S and X.\n\nI know that Elon said that Model S is mostly sentimental thing, but c'mon - not everybody wants fully autonomous vehicles.

It’s only fine as long as you stay in the right or middle lane, being _very patient_ to move between lanes when you absolutely don’t see anything coming up from behind you.  Even then, overtaking someone on Autopilot is tricky because due to EU rules, the lane switch needs to be completed within 5 seconds. Obviously, this 5 second rule also applies when you try to move back from the left lane to the middle lane.  During those 5 seconds, you’re quite likely to get flashed by someone that ‘came out of nowhere’ due to his speed.\n\nI gave up on Autopilot in Germany after about 10 minutes...
