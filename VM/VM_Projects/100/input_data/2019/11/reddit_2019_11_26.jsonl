This will cause the market to drop by a few pennies.\n\nSeparately, if the market dips during the week, it is fine to invest your weekly scheduled amount during then if you like. Often, people say invest your scheduled amount at the same time each week, but people often like to feel like they are optimizing and will ultimately do whatever they want (me included). I figure that as long as you are getting your weekly amount into the market at least sometime during the week, then it's not a big deal exactly which day you pull the trigger. Plus, you get to feel like you are optimally timing the market and that is a good feeling.\n\nAlso, if you are having feelings where you are often worried about the price and checking it, then you have too much invested. Start with investing only the amount which you don't care about losing, at least in the beginning. M1 allows you to start with just $10 and many people give it good reviews. \n\nRemember, at some time in the future (no idea when), the market will drop by around a quarter to half. It's done it many time before and will many times again. When this happens, a quarter to half of your savings could disappear and it may take several years to come back. You need to be prepared mentally. Do meditation, alcohol, or whatever works for you to wrap your head around this. Back in 2008, people joked their 401k's turned into 201k's for a good reason. :)\n\nIf you want to protect your savings a bit, then I recommend heading over to https://portfoliocharts.com/ and learning about asset allocation.\n\nYou may want to check out Joseph Carlson's you tube channel if you want to head down the dividends path.

It's not what I would have written, but even were he not a mod I would not remove any of his comments for rule-breaking, that I've noticed. Let me state how I understand this situation, the reactions, and why things aren't going well, and then we'll see if that makes sense. Paging /u/HighDagger as well for awareness.\n\nFirstly, the situation. The quote you gave was large but well-structured, and theoretically contains all the information needed to come to any conclusions on this topic. \n\n> ...obtain the pre-approval of an experienced securities lawyer employed by the Company (“Securities Counsel”) of any written communication that contains information regarding any of the following topics:\n\n> • production numbers or sales or delivery numbers (whether actual, forecasted, or projected) that have not been previously published via pre-approved written communications issued by the Company (“Official Company Guidance”) or deviate from previously published Official Company Guidance;\n\n> • projection, forecast, or estimate numbers regarding the Company’s business that have not been previously published in Official Company Guidance or deviate from previously published Official Company Guidance;\n\nThe above quote contains your bolded sections, which you rightly state are the points of importance.\n\nThe first point of contention was whether or not \"Reservations\" or \"Orders\" are covered under this document. As was pointed out several times, the word \"order\" and \"reservation\" are nowhere in the document in their intended meaning. The argument was then made that they are therefore not covered under the agreement.\n\nRather than address this, I saw multiple comments consisting of \"they are too covered\", \"no, show me the word\", \"they are though\", etc. (paraphrased). This helped nothing, exacerbated tensions, and generally started things going downhill. I would put the blame on both you and /u/caz0 equally for your parts in this, as you could have *at least* gone through the rigamarole of explaining things as such:\n\nP1: \"Orders or reservations are covered under the agreement.\"\n\nP2: \"No, they aren't specifically addressed.\"\n\nP1: \"Ah, but 'Projection, forecast, or estimate numbers' are, therefore they are.\"\n\nP2: \"They aren't a projection, they're solid numbers, therefore no.\"\n\nP1: \"But their only value (besides the nominal payment, which is another possible argument) is as a projection of future demand, so that might still be included.\"\n\nP2: \"Oh, I hadn't looked at it that way. Do you have a source to back up that leap of logic?\"\n\nP1: \"No, I can't find one. I suppose this argument is unresolvable.\"\n\nP2: \"I suppose so.\"\n\nThis was, as far as I can tell, **almost the entire argument**. If people hadn't started throwing accusations, /u/caz0, or actually tried to clarify their position effectively, /u/allihavelearned, this might not have caught fire like it did.\n\nNow then.\n\nThe second crux here was the topic of communications being pre-approved, and what form that approval had to take. The interpretation of \"the pre-approval of an experienced securities lawyer employed by the Company (“Securities Counsel”) of any written communication that contains\" was ...debated... on whether or not this requires explicit permission and oversight on every tweet, or whether it could in some cases be applied by topic.\n\nIn essence, can a Tesla lawyer say \"this topic of information is not problematic under the agreement, so feel free to tweet on it. Let me know if you want to add additional details first though\"?\n\nThis is a question about a hypothetical conversation, pursuant to a hypothetical breach of agreement, which would then have to be pursued (not guaranteed) by the SEC, and which that organization would then have to prove in court - which they've already tried to do once and gotten burned for. In short, this is so far in the weeds you can't even see the sunlight anymore.\n\nStating \"[there is no wiggle room](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/e1vh68/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_november_26_2019/f8s1m9n/)\" as a fact when it is **indisputably** your opinion, and (unless you have a background in law I'm unaware of, entirely possible) almost certainly an underinformed one, is a problem. Note I'm not trying to put you down here, my opinion is almost certainly even less informed. But you have to at least have the self-awareness to state opinions as opinions, interpretations as interpretations, and facts as facts. On a personal note, that's a major aspect of my job. When I present information, I have to be very certain I have drawn the line between facts, interpretations, and assumptions. So this kinda touches a nerve.\n\nSo when people started arguing about whether or not there was wiggle room, your stonewalling of this point definitely did not help matters. [For example](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/e1vh68/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_november_26_2019/f8s9ch9/):\n\n> > The way the agreement is written, it doesn't explicitly require that every tweet is approved separately.\n\n> Yes, it does.\n\nThe document states they require pre-approval, not the terms and means under which that can be granted. That seems (at least to my eye) to be left largely to the discretion of the approving authority (lawyer).\n\nFurther, [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/e1vh68/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_november_26_2019/f8sfzjl/), where you assume what is meant by \"bulk approval\" when it seems obvious to me that there are other interpretations, [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/e1vh68/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_november_26_2019/f8sfgq7/) where you seem more interested in playing \"gotcha\" than acknowledging that the importance of an ever-changing number might be more opinion than fact, and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/e1vh68/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_november_26_2019/f8s9a4u/) where you assert a difference between a written communication and its contents, and then act as if that is a universally understood and accepted definition.\n\nAll of those linked above demonstrate what we mean when we say that you aggravate the situation. You pick your definitions and perspectives, and then argue that things are factually true where they reasonably are ambiguous. You assume that others are working by your definitions, and refuse to acknowledge that the meanings behind them are mutable, or that you might be misinterpreting them. In short, and apologies for breaking rule 5: you argue like an asshole.\n\nThat's why these threads keep catching fire around you, and why you more than anyone else in this subreddit get into intractable arguments over minutia and never seem to find a resolution. Stockbroker used to get into similar ones, generally exacerbated by his apparent knowledge of financial norms and the lack thereof of the people he was arguing with.\n\n At the very least, for the sake of the sanity of us mods, please learn to say \"I think it's this, but I can understand why you might think otherwise.\" If you restate (with empathy) your understanding of the positions of others, you might find better luck narrowing down the points you actually disagree on. Because in this case, everyone was reading the same text. Everyone was seeing the same words. Insisting they're just missing the wording helps nothing, and just leads to me writing frikken *pages long* comments trying to clear up the matter.\n\n*Breathes*\n\nHopefully that makes things clear.

Similarly, if Elon asks the attorney whether it's OK to tweet how much he likes his shiny Model S without pre-approval, and the attorney replies \"go ahead, that type of tweet does not require pre-approval\", then again that's not pre-approval for \"I like my shiny model S\" tweets, it's guidance from the attorney.\n\nSo if Elon were (hypothetically) to ask the Tesla attorney whether it's OK to tweet factual accounts of the number of orders received without pre-approval, and the attorney were (hypothetically) to reply \"orders received do not require pre-approval, but if you want to add a new estimate of production timing or numbers, then that needs pre-approval\", then the communication would not be pre-approval, but Elon could use the guidance to tweet order numbers without pre-approval, because the attorney had informed him that pre-approval is not required for tweets on that topic.\n\nSo the attorney is permitted to provide Elon with guidance on which tweet topics do or do not require pre-approval, in accordance with the settlement, and such guidance is not itself pre-approval as described in the settlement.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}
