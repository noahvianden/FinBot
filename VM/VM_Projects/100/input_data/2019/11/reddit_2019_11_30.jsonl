However, most of the market is people who passively invest and know nothing so many peeps were still crushed.  Housing values had been falling for more than a year preceding the bear market and this made people think the stock market was independent of the housing market but it was just that the financial firms had been been keeping quiet about how insolvent they were.  They hadn't managed to escape the housing sector at all.  The shit doesn't hit the fan as soon as you smell the shit.

The economy just builds up tons of excessive bubble bullshit.  That's all you have to look for.  However, don't be like one of those idiots permabears.  You have to understand that the bubble can build up to a big ass size before it actually blows.  It doesn't pop when it's merely big - it has to be ridiculous.  Right now the market is overvalued but it's not truly ridiculous yet.  Also, money printing is everything.

This could renew optimism into year end\n\n\n2. China retaliates Monday and trump looks at the market sitting at all time high and thinks “I got free house money to play with” and sends tariff man tweets out and December follows through with tariffs.. if December 15th tariffs go through, I doubt we go to 3400 or high on spx. \n\nBottom line: a lot of different ways this could play out.. however, what we know for certain is, this market is sitting at all time high.

If you can manage to hold long into year end the least you could do is hedge your position... puts are really cheap with VIX at lows and implied volatility nearly non existent.. the options market does not show anticipation of a recession or a crash coming in the near term.. people are still buying tons of upside and not really hedging like they were coming out of last December sell off.. if you look at options market in January through March, puts outweighed calls almost 2:1 some cases 3:1.. back then, people were nervous and the market continued to run up.. personally I see a lot of exuberance and lack of pessimism.. people can say what they want but we are at least or near 2 standard deviations away from 200 DMA. That’s roughly 96% of the observations in data.. we have gone 10% since middle of October with no pull back of 2-5%. This market could go straight to the moon into year end, but if I wanted to bet, I’d say we stay flat or head lower into year end unless trump makes a deal with China..\n\n\nFor a deal to happen, trump has to feel like he needs to win for his election.. currently, I don’t think he feels like that at all..
