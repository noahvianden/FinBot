It's just that spacial awareness is way back at level 2, maybe stretching into 3 for really good implementations.  LIDAR gives very good spacial awareness.  It's the best sensor for that currently... it's just it's not going to help solve the -really- hard problems that truly hands-free, steering wheel-free driving in unknown environments is going to require.  Once you solve THAT, then you are most definitely identifying everything in the cars surroundings very accurately at a minimum.  So, you don't need LIDAR.  If you need LIDAR, then you aren't accurately identifying everything and you're going to fail. \n\nWe're a lot closer to turning multiple cameras into 3D positional data much like LIDAR than we are to level 5, by the way.  It kinda works already... and it'll get a lot better.\n\nYou think LIDAR is important, and intuitively it really does seem so.   It's just not, not for level 5.... because the really hard vision and analysis problems you have to solve for level 5 gives you that information anyway.\n\nAm I an autonomous vehicle technology expert?  Well, no.  However, I have actually used LIDAR-based depth sensors in projects... and I was co-founder of a factory automation company for a short while.  We planned on using SLAM algorithms and either LIDAR or stereo (quad or hex arrangement) cameras to build autonomous warehousing robots.  I personally favored cameras long term, but figured LIDAR would get us a product out the door faster.  Unfortunately, my partner kept pushing much less ambitious projects and (more importantly) wasn't really funding anything remotely like he was supposed to be.

But being able to pull your own weight and cover the predominant, necessary expenses of a household goes a long way in actually being able to keep a woman, maintain respect, and solidify your position as the head of the house. If you want the \"my boyfriend is a lazy loser, so I'm cucking him with my boss/coworker whom I actually respect as a man\" type relationship, then go for it. Mind you, being a student entering a highly lucrative field does not apply, as she'll see that as an investment in her long term future. \n\nThat said, if you're banging out chicks left and right, don't want the girl for the long term, and are rotating between relationships every 3-6 mos, having her pay at least half of everything is totally doable. She may even pay your way if you're a particularly attractive dude that she doesn't feel like she should have. But again, it's only really good as a short term strategy. Eventually, she'll resent you and the relationship will go downhill. Speaking from experience as being both being the \"daddy provider\" type and the \"nah, you pay the tab\" type. Both are extremes that just don't work. Middle ground is much more doable/reasonable imo.", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "Mine was more of a joke. Been dating for 5 years now.

She was in the pod school on campus, and we split things pretty much 50/50, leaning a bit in her favor at the beginning. Dated another girl in engineering when I was younger, and that was where I was trying to act more as a \"provider\" before and during medical school. Stupid choice, especially when you literally have no money, going into debt etc.\n\nI guess I'm mostly talking about dudes that think they can just go on forever with no job or a part time job, being carried by their girl. It's totally unrealistic long term and bound to fail. Now the opposite would be totally fine, especially if the expectation is that the woman will start having children and help run the household etc. Women just have different expectations of us in that way.

As long as you want it, and you're willing to work hard, you'll be ok. But I just so happen to be one of those (very few) people that decided to leave and carry my hefty debt along with me. Luckily it's government debt, which has various relief programs to allow for a reasonable repayment plan.\n\nI could write a novel (literally) about all the things that came together over a couple years to lead me to leave (I had been considering it since the end of first year), so it's hard to answer this briefly. I'll just put some bullet points down.\n\n1. Crazy dramatic relationship that involved fighting for hours almost every day for nearly 3 years. With the (now) engineer.\n2.

Little sleep, which on top of making you less effective also acts as a catalyst for further mental deterioration.\n11. Probably the weirdest one, but as long as we're being honest here: Found myself getting addicted to dopamine-inducing activities, such as sex/masturbation. I'd either fuck her or jack off at least 3 times a day. Even started drinking regularly at one point for like a month when things got really bad -- girlfriend left, failed a class (later retook it and made an A). Nothing crazy (maybe 30-50ml scotch per night), but this was *way* out of character for me (I never drink, like at all). My theory about this is that dopamine is required in the pathway to produce epinephrine/norepinephrine. Therefore, a constant state of high stress exhausts your dopamine supply, leading you to do more activities that will drive production of dopamine.\n12. Realized I didn't need the money and status to feel like I mattered, though literally everything I had ever been taught from the age of 3 on up begged to the contrary. And in fact, I was willing to not only give up money and status, but also to put myself into the completely opposite scenario -- an absolutely abhorrent financial situation (just with the amount of debt accrued over the past 3 years), in order to change my life for the better. On paper, this sounds retarded. But in practice, it was the best decision I ever made for my own personal well being.\n\nThere's probably a few dozen more, but those are just some I can come up with off the top of my head.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wow, thank you so much for the insight. One of my fears as well is the lack of support system as I've always been a loner and don't have any friends.

I really don't have any backup plan, so I'm putting all my eggs into this and hoping for the best.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No problem. I'm sure it'll all be fine for you. Just know it's a really tough thing to go through, so whatever you gotta do to mentally prepare, do it. Take it as seriously as anything you've ever taken in your life, because it's gonna encompass 80-90% of what you do from here on out, until you're actually practicing (and maybe even then, if you decide to work a high hour field). Try not to get distracted by other bullshit. A hobby or two is fine (I did the gym), but try not to do things that'll put on additional, unnecessary mental strain, because it's likely you'll be operating at full capacity already. This means trading may have to go on the backburner -- it was seriously mentally taxing to deal with the ups and downs of that while at the same time dealing with all of the stress of med school -- not a good combo *at all*, and it's not really worth risking your career for imo.\n\nAlso might want to get your partner ready for a lot of physical/mental absence. The stress/lack of sleep also will fundamentally change your psychology -- you may become more irritable, agitated etc. during certain times. Not always, but sometimes. It's a pretty grueling process. So if she's used to having you around a lot, doing a lot of things together, puts a lot of responsibilities onto you, you might wanna talk about scaling that back so she's not surprised later when you are literally incapable of doing all the things you were able to do before. I met my first med school gf when I was a senior in college taking a super easy class load, going out all the time, having sex all the time, and generally just being crazy in love...you can imagine there was a serious adjustment that needed to occur when I entered med school. But hopefully your girl will be kind, patient, and supportive in a way that my partner at the time couldn't be.\n\nBut yeah, if you're a smart guy, just do your work and keep pushing. Friends will come -- people in med school are mostly just really nice nerdy types, so they're easy to talk to/make friends with. The key? Just don't leave. You might think about it sometimes, everyone does. But just don't do it (I know, ironic coming from me, but if this is what you want then this applies). Do things that you enjoy and try to learn things that excite you but also create proficiency -- i.e. maybe join the club that pertains to your specialty of interest, or just whatever you might find interesting (my last girlfriend was the star of her suturing club and loved it). These are some things I've noticed that the quote unquote \"successful\" people in med school do.\n\nAlso, it's never too late to study a bit here and there for boards.
