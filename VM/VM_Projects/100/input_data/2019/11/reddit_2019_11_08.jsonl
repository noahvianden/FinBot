But the HW3 ‘FSD’ computer won’t be enough to get regulatory lvl5 approval.  It’ll have to be the 3rd-Gen ‘HW4’ computer.  There’s just so many things for the Neural Net(s) to map, that even the new HW3 chip won’t be enough.  Also part of my prediction - Tesla will upgrade MCUs on the S/X to the new MCUs needed for HW3/4.  They also will find a way to replace the cameras and wiring on the relatively few HW2 cars.  HW 2.5 owners won’t get a HW3 retrofit, and will instead need to accept less-capable cars while the HW3 cars continue to get updates.  They’ll be the first to get the HW4 retrofit.\n\nLate 2020 the HW4 chip should be in production.  Anyone have any guesses as to what a fleet retrofit like this would cost Tesla to accomplish?  Sounds like it’d involve ~1M cars.  They could hire temporary technicians just to get it done.  Let’s say it takes an hour of labor and they pay the tech $20/hr.  Then the HW4 computer costs them $80 each.  That’s $100M, and say 6 months to get them all done.

I just really believe that FSD will require a step beyond even what Elon assumes will be needed.  Being over-optimistic will come back to bite him a little on this one I think.\n\nThere’s just so much data for NNs to process that will go into FSD.  Traffic cones are just a start.  Hand signals, turn signals, recognizing if taillights are missing that might otherwise be giving a signal, recognizing damage to a car and assigning that car a higher ‘danger’ setting, recognizing aggressiveness of each vehicle, recognizing each type of animal and thus knowing how they might behave, scooters, homeless, snow, rock slides, flood water, etc.  I’m really thinking that even HW3 won’t be capable.
