Edges as sharp as a knife, and the stainless steel only accentuates that.  Christ a knife literally is stainless steel.  But black, especially matte black, mutes this, mutes the edges, softens them.

If World war 2 can be associated with heavily armored battleships and large cannons it‚Äôs like a boxing match. Modern Naval warfare is about team dodge ball. One hit kills.

Other nations build what can counter nations with equal technological prowess, but the US builds what can easily allow it to take poor people from its home land and scream at them to enhance obedience while rewarding people for doing marathon runs more than people who save lives in combat.

Posing as a meritocracy but thinking that a federally accredited degree is Weaving and Knitting makes someone more worthy of leadership than a cognitive reasoning score that outperforms 99.999% of the population shows that the focus is on expendability. Why risk that which is a severe loss to lose when you can risk what‚Äôs already worthless and therefore gain? That‚Äôs the philosophical stance and it‚Äôs gone to the point of HURTING people who are actually worthwhile.  \n\nI agree though. The US isn‚Äôt on the losing ground despite spending so much.

Compared to other batteries, they are very costly, but have an extremely long life and high energy density, and so they are mainly used as power sources for equipment that must operate unattended for long periods of time, such as spacecraft, pacemakers, underwater systems and automated scientific stations in remote parts of the world.Nuclear battery technology began in 1913, when Henry Moseley first demonstrated the beta cell.
