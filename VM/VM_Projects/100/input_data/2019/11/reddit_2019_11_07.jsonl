{"title": "It's scary to trade options on amounts of money that feel large.", "selftext": "My portfolio is now at about $800, which is an achievement for me considering I've put $850 into the account over time and lost about $600 while I've been learning.  So I've just about broken even so far, but now that I have this much money in my trading account, the idea of trading with this much money is daunting to me. (I know it's not a lot to trade with from some people's perspectives, but from my perspective this is the most I've ever traded with since starting)\n\nEvery move feels too risky, as such I'm trying to figure out what the best approach would be to proceed.\n\nI think approaching this with a diversified portfolio and low-risk moves would be the best plan of action for gradual growth and limiting potential losses.  I don't want a big chunk taken out of my account at this point, and I'm more than happy with small gains over time.\n\nBut I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this fear of trading with a large (by your standards) amount of money, or making large trades.\n\nThis last move that made my money back was a move in reaction to seeing the share value of TSLA spike up in reaction to   recent news.  At which point I opened an ATM call (with what was my entire portfolio) and in the same day I made back the money I had previously lost as I closed the call within a couple hours. (I did not want to hold overnight for fear of the share value going back down and the share value had seemed to calm down.  Consequently, I sold on a near-high point when the share value had been flat-ish for awhile)\n\nIn essence however, how do you trade with what feels like \"a lot\" of money to you?  What constitutes too much risk?  Have you ever experienced this fear of trading with a \"large\" amount of money?  What moves do you make to still make upward progress with your portfolio, but without having this fear? (or having less fear at least)\n\nThank you for reading this post, and thank you in advance for your reply if you decide to leave one.\n\nHave a nice day!", "id": "dt21uo", "created_utc": 1573152051.0, "score": 94, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 100, "comments": [{"body": "Position sizing will answer most of your concerns", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!

Let me tell you, it’s really tough to manage risk. I haven’t found a magic formula yet, but so far I can tell you what has helped me;\n\n1. Divide and conquer. Divide your account into as many small options positions as you can, when your signal for entry triggers. Do not use all your capital for 1 single position. Go for uncorrelated trades, if possible. \n\n2. Only trade liquid options and stay close to at the money. \n\n3. Take any windfall amount quickly. Don’t get greedy, don’t rationalize holding longer. The goal is to make the most money with the least amount of time spent in the market.\n\n4. Ideally, get at least 2 contracts so you can scale out on a gap up (for longs). \n\n5. The best time to gamble is Thursday afternoon for Friday weekly expiration. You can get a lot of things “on sale”. I usually look for options .20-.40 on momentum and mean reversion trades. If you get a gap in your direction the next morning, take 1/2 off. I expect those trades to either go 100% or go to 0. My risk is the amount I pay for the options.\n\n6. You can also manage risk by trading with equity instead of options, or even by using later dated options. \n\n7. Lastly (well not really, I have more but I’m done for now), consider using spy puts (calls) for an overnight hedge. I want to experiment with using a 1/3 account size spy put hedge and 2/3 of my account in call positions. You just have to find the right strike and expiration for the put... the goal is protection against trump tweets and adverse trade war news.

I experimented with this a little over the summer. I would buy a few cheap OTM spy puts to protect my account. The issue was, it was hard to know when to exit for optimal protection (I would exit too soon). Also, sometimes my positions would all be down, and the market would be up (that tends to happen when I go for the “knife catching” trades). So the spy put protection just added to my losses.

Imagine you'd either go long or short and write down on a piece of paper what limit price it \"should\" have filled you at (typically in the middle between BID & ASK). Later, exit the trade (mentally) and write down how much you would have sold it at (most likely at BID on the exit).

First of all let’s address the geo-fenced part. \n\nFSD is a problem that a 99% reliable solution that works everywhere is still borderline useless and will literally cause millions of accidents each year if widely deployed. On the other hand a 100% reliable solution that works in even just 1% of the locations will be extremely useful for those places. Waymo’s approach relies on geo-fencing for sure, but imagine them deploying driverless taxis just in the largest 20 metropolitan areas in the U.S within the next few years, how much revenue/business do you think they’d be getting? For a company like Uber most of their revenues come from places like SF, NY, LA, etc. Imagine them shipping geo-fenced taxi fleet without drivers to just NY, SF, and LA within the next 3 years. That alone would be making them tons of revenue and kill Uber/Taxi in those areas.\n\nSecondly let’s discuss the “minivan” part. This is probably the bigger reason why Waymo’s business is worth more. The fact that Waymo is *not* an auto manufacturer means they can go for the platform play, and sell their solutions to all the other automakers out there. Despite many people’s belief on this sub, Tesla is unlikely to become the *one and only* automaker on the planet, or even one with a majority marketshare. That means the majority of the global car market are also the potential market for Waymo. Today it’s installed on a Pacifica minivan and next year it may be sold to Honda to be installed on the Accord. Selling a FSD package incurs much, much higher margin than the car business itself, thus why even if Waymo’s tech is behind (it’s not), it would still have higher financial upside. This is also the reason why MobileEye was sold for $15B, despite that their tech may not exactly be industry leading.\n\nFinally I don’t believe Waymo is worth more than Tesla.

They know they will be throwing away some of their current work once pure vision based approach takes over one day (and they have plenty of people working in parallel on that approach without a doubt), but if they can deliver something of great value in a shorter time frame, throwing away some work is a completely acceptable cost to a company with the resource Waymo has. \n\nWe have one saying amongst engineers, that is **pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil**.

They default, which causes huge stress on the financial sector, which then fires its people, who then default on their payments, and it causes a race to the bottom as banks stop lending to consumers and corporations, who need that liquidity to operate and continue to make payments. It's a side effect of hyperspecialization of labor/knowledge, high levels of leverage and debt at all levels of society, and improper evaluation of risks. It's what happens when the entire country begins to operate like WSB.\n\n\nRecessions are stopped by some big technological development or macroeconomic event that props up earnings (think post WW2 earnings boom) or by artificial activity to stimulate the economy by the government or the Fed.\n\nWhen you see credit spreads widen, that's when you know a recession is impending if not already there. It means that lending institutions have begun to evaluate the same old stuff as much riskier than it used to be, and they usually only do that when they've already taken heavy losses.\n\nIf you want to see the next recession coming, look at bond markets.

{"title": "Hi, I'm the guy with 1.2M Ford. Update and AMA I guess", "selftext": "**EDIT: Do not harass /u/MoonYachts, he was allowed to post the screenshots and talk about the position. If he hadn't made the post I wasn't ever going to and you all would have never got to enjoy it.**\n\nFirst a clarification, /u/MoonYachts was not the one with the position, he just took my screenshots and posted them to the sub. I didn't have any problem with that since I didn't do this trade for the attention or karma or anything like that.\n\nAlso another important point to make is that I levered up last Thursday, not the Monday that the post was made.\n\nAnyways here's a few interesting points\n\n1. I had zero contact from RH since last Friday until today. I got an email last Friday telling me to expect a call on Monday, however it never came.\n2. My account was restricted Friday at open, it became \"disabled\" around noon on the same day. I'm not sure what the difference is, you'd have to ask RH. Also that same day I was hit with a $91,000 margin call.\n3. I did not sign an NDA, I was never asked to sign an NDA. I was not contacted by the SEC, FINRA, or any other regulatory body, and vice versa. I really want to emphasize how little communication I received from RH.\n4. Today RH closed out the Ford position, I'm not sure of the specifics however it wasn't that complicated of a position anyways, any competent trade desk could get out relatively easy. If anyone is curious about the Apple position, it was assigned on Friday, which was the plan anyways, so its not a big deal. Any other position in the screenshots MoonYachts posted were from before levering up.\n5. I am banned from RH. Their email said that if I am carrying a negative balance I have 60 days to pay it off. I am not carrying a negative balance so I'm doing a money transfer to my bank and an ACAT transfer to TDA. I can't speak to what happened to the other uses who did this since they made far riskier plays than me with the leverage they gained.\n6. Matt Levine's coverage is the only worthwhile thing I've read on the trade. The trade isn't that interesting its just big numbers. I will take exception to the line saying that I did this to amuse my Reddit friends, as I only read WSB on occasion, however it is a fair generalization.
