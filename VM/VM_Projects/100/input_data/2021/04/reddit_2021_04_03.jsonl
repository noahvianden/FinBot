But I sell 4 contracts of QQQ calls. 1 contract is naked because I hold other stocks, such as MSFT, GOOGL, FB, but I don't have 100 shares of them. I make sure the total market value of other stocks are approximately equal to the value of 100 shares of QQQ.\n\nI sell UNG (natural gas) call spreads and long UNL to hedge it. UNG is in long term downtrend due to contango. This is 7% of my portfolio. \n\nI long SLV (silver) and sell very long dated covered call (600 days) because I have a large position which is 40% of my portfolio and silver is more volatile than QQQ. I don't want my portfolio to fluctuate too much.\n\nI also sell BLOK (blockchain) and ARKK covered calls. These 2 ETFs have very high IV. Selling options is very profitable.\n\nI also sell KWEB (China Internet ETF) covered calls. This position can diversity my portfolio.  The reason I don't choose ASHR ( China 300 ETF) is that I think technology has more upside potential, and the IV of KWEB is higher than that of ASHR, which is good for selling options.\n\nI long VXZ, VIXM and XVZ to hedge my position. These mid term ETFs decay slowly than VXX.\n\nI bought USO (crude oil) when it was very low. I used to sell ATM call. Now I sell ITM call. This is very different from QQQ calls or other ETF calls. US stock index, China stock index, precious metals are bullish in the long term. Crude oil futures has contango. USO (not the crude oil itself) is in long term downtrend. That's why I sell ATM and ITM calls for USO. USO is 2% of my portfolio. \n\nGME is 0.5% of my portfolio. I sold strike 20 and 120DTE put when the IV was 300%.  This position is profitable even though the stock has dropped significantly, because the IV dropped a lot too.\n\nMy portfolio value is 500k.

Wayyyy better as an audiobook because his snarky humor comes across better (he’s my favorite author that I don’t like to read). Be wary though, you might end up like me wishing you understood the higher level maths. I listen to all of Talebs works yearly, and get new insights each time depending on where my mind is at. The deep truth is that once you really learn understand Taleb, you realize you need to be buying calls as well as selling them.\n\nTrading Options at Expiration by Augen and Trading Options on Corporate Earnings News by Shon and Zhou are both a bit dated but good to read through once. The latter basically gives you the insight that price moves correspond with earnings news less than half the time (eg. more likely to drop after good earnings news).

I'm from europe, we use CFD here. I'm on the broker etoro and i explain all there as well. \n\nBut here is a rundown of my Analysis before i dive in. I try different strategies, there is so many that work you're better off finding your own way but you need to know the basics.\n\nMy way is top down so i start from economics and daily Orderflow sp500 analysis to industries to individual stock. Here you go. I also don't just trade stocks but also Commodities, Futures but i do those rarely atm the Q1 profit is all stocks.\n\n1. Industry Research \n- What industry are we acting in?\n- Is it different from previous industries that I've traded before? \n- Whats the avg market cap, price, pe ratio etc of companies in this industry, is there any company that stands out with abnormalities or anomalous patterns? \n- Who leads this Industry? \n- Who is the most powerful in this Industry? \n- Who is the innovator in this Industry? \n- Are any mergers rumoured in this Industry?\n\nThere is more questions i ask my self but this is a good start. \n\nThen i make my conclusion and choose a company out of the Industry that i consider the most attractive.\n\nWhich brings us to the Next step. \n\n2. Company Research \n\nYou will have touched this in the previous research but now we dive in deeper!\n\n- Fundamental research and Analysis:\nYou can learn more about this on investopedia.com if you don't know where to start.\n\n- Institutional Analysis: \nWho is invested? Any notable institutions that are actively trading? Blackrock, Vanguard, Fidelity aren't really a big deal since they invest into 90% of the market.\n\n- Technical Analysis:\n Simple price action analysis, does the price fit to the rest of the Industry?\nWas the company volatile in the last 3 months? So we can check beta and obviously the chart.\nSupport and resistance| RSI| MACD |Volume| There is many more helpful indicators but start simple because you need to understand what you're doing and fancy indicators won't help you, if you don't understand.\n\n- Order flow/Option flow/Volume flow analysis:\nAt what price was the highest volume? \nWhat is the Point of Control? \n(You can see it with volume profile indicator on yahoo finance charts for free) \nVWAP are similar to moving averages just better, as it includes volume but it's more detailed in it's style as it includes volume. (It can act like a magnet if it's too far apart from the current price)  There is a lot more here but it gets very advanced very quickly so let's stop here.\n\n- Monte carlo simulation: \nDefinition \n[a model used to predict the probability of different outcomes when the intervention of random variables is present.]\n\n- Financial Metrics such as: \nDCF Analysis, Return on Equity Analysis, Price to book ratio, Price to earnings ratio, Return on Assets. These can also be compared to other companies in the same Industry. \n\n- Current EPS and estimates.\n\n- Current Revenue and estimates.\n\n- Deep product analysis and research:\nQuality assurance, Product Value Analysis, Plausibility of product? (Must be thought about with new products and especially in Pharmaceuticals), Use case of product? What value does it give? Would you buy this? Do you think many people would buy it? Is it B2C or B2B? Is it a physical product? Is it part of a supply chain?\n\n- Leadership Analysis: \n\nIs the C-Level led by experts in the field, do they have a plan? \nAre they innovative?\n What achievements do the employees have especially c-level? \n\n- Quantitative Analysis\n\n- Sentimental Analysis:\nWhat do other traders think? What is the Sentiment around wall St.? \n\nThen make a conclusion\nEstimate a price range? And trade in the range.\n\n3. Trading Strategy\n\n- WRITE a plan for every trade. This can help reduce emotions as when you have the plan in black & white it will remind you to stay calm.\n\n- Collect  researched companies in a watchlist and have alerts for the right price, different indicators (this can get very complicated), generally the right setup to be ready to trade.\n\n- Trade in the previously established range, understand the range, breath the range. Bollinger Bands can help you understand the range better too.\n\n- Watch out for breakouts either side buy and sell, a breakout can always bring high profits and high losses understand the risks when you trade on breakout and calculate probability beforehand.\n\n- Use tools available to you to trade safer, sl, tp, orders etc but use in a way in which you trade safer and more Profitable.\n- Once in a trade set alerts at certain prices and re-evaluate your position not to get caught in mistakes even after that research, strategy. Re-evaluate does not mean get out of the trade it means look at your strategy and if money was lost try to get out the best way you can. WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? Everyone makes mistakes except the people that cheat.\n- Hedge with uncorrelated assets especially important if you are shorting.\n- Try to not use more than 10% of your portfolio on one Asset \n-  Manage the max amount of % of an asset you want to have and also the minimum amount.\n- Check out this awesome video on portfolio management on youtube from MIT\nhttps://youtu.be/8TJQhQ2GZ0Y \n\nI hope this helps you to find your way.

Be advised, I’m biased since my wife works for GM on the business/supply chain side. But comparing the Hummer to the Tesla cybertruck is ridiculous. They are two different vehicles from two very different companies. \n\nFirst, GM is going to have 30 different electric vehicles by 2025. Every car in their lineup will be electric plus new models. It’s not just the Hummer, which will be a specialty product, but all the trucks. Their main line of trucks sell like crazy. The Silverado and Colorado will likely be the competition to Cybertruck. The Silverado line alone sells more units than Tesla sells for all its vehicles. \n\nAs far as companies, GM sells like 7 million cars a year versus Tesla’s 500k. GM has a supply chain that reaches globally. They have plants all over (this could be also bad since brick and mortar costs, labor, ect) which allows them to shift production. They have connections with hundreds of companies for parts and resources. It’s insane how many companies my wife can contact for bids when GM needs a part for a car coming out in the distant future. \n\nAnother issue is government contracts and/or other business contracts for vehicles that GM can leverage and Tesla can not. GM, being so large, can offer cheaper products in huge numbers. So if the US government wants to completely faze out its gas fleet and go electric, who do you think will be able to produce so many to meet this need, GM or Tesla?  \n\nI guess what I hope people take away from this is that OPs accusation that “GM doesn’t stand a chance” versus Tesla due to the high price of the Hummer is very myopic and lacks insight into the full spectrum of auto manufacturing. Even my little rant doesn’t do the justice that my wife could.

I've been a lurker for 2 years and only created this account recently. Anyways, I want to hear some people's opinions on here about two different strategies I've been mind juggling for a while now.\n\nThe strategy of never selling is simple and what I pretty much stuck with since I started investing until recently. I think it's best to never sell if you plan on investing some money here and there into some long term funds or ETFs. But recently (late last year before this massive rotation) I sold profits on a few stocks that I did really well on and reinvested into a bunch of other things. I was doing really well on all of my picks, and with these past 2 months all of my precious gains disappeared. Of course, hindsight is a bitch, and I wish I had taken profits on most of those and then bought the dip because I still have a strong conviction. Which leaves me thinking about a new strategy, specifically for my volatile growth stonks.\n\nThe strategy of profit taking would have me taking some profits here and there if I make a certain % amount, and then keeping that cash as buying power for dips, bears and rotations. I think this works really well with volatile growth stocks because volatile growth stocks have shown to be able to run up anywhere from 15-50% in a single day or even more depending on the stock. I don't have many stonks like those, but I do have stocks that rally and pullback. If a certain sector or security I'm invested in grows a significant amount in a couple weeks or a couple months, it will almost definitely pullback soon after.

Additionally, unless I've missed something, Apple still uses AMD for their graphics, but like with Intel on the CPU side, they could lose this source of revenue soon. It just depends on how successful Apple is at cutting out the 3rd party processors and replacing them.\n\nThe only issue I see as unique for AMD is that they still lag behind on some of the lower end chips. As high as the tech world is on AMDs new GPU and the higher end Ryzen CPUs, most PC builders don't have a 5-10k budget. For now, Intel still gets you better performance for your dollar on the CPU side but the margin is closing.

Also why share margins and positive influence to the brand from technological advantage.

Also there is a question, how fast can equipment for factories be made and are there enough top level managers to deliver on a few other factory level projects simultaneously.

Still I have problems to see how this business opportunity could lead to addition of over 1t in valuation, I think Tesla by itself (financially and regarding demand) can scale auto production as fast as scales global battery production for at least few more years and market pretty much prices that in. Energy probably is not priced in but we will need at least few more years to see meaningful results at the scale adequate to current market cap.

In combination with the USMCA trade deal of 2020, the US will see 250B in investments per year for 8 years in infrastructure spending. We take a look at how Autodesk is a core benefactor of the economic models that govern these investments. I expect Autodesk to triple in size by 2024.\n\n[Autodesk Revenues](https://preview.redd.it/aj4qbyf05zq61.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfff18884011a16bded7ba20d46e3772fad4a6fe)\n\n# Purpose\n\nTo be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts tend to run head-to-head with Wall Street analysts. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.\n\nPart of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation OR incentivize cooperation.\n\n\\- Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**\n\n\\- How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**\n\n\\- What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**\n\n\\- Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**\n\n**-** What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(You are here)**\n\n\\- Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? *(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)*\n\n\\- Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? *(Roblox DD in Progress)*\n\n\\- How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?\n\nAt the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that’s why I’m sharing my writing. I’m not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.\n\n# The Employment Problem\n\n>The **Fourth Industrial Revolution** (or **Industry 4.0**) is the ongoing automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices, using modern smart technology. Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A Skill Gap Problem](https://preview.redd.it/sbi6dmoy6zq61.png?width=711&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cad0f9dc367ce723290f7ae65f97f702812041d)\n\nUltimately, the US is doing a pretty good job at maintaining  its engineering and architecture sectors, but there has been a glaring issue with a skill-gap that effects certain regions more than others. This is largely due to the strained relationship between increase automation vs. difficulty of learning the new tools associated with automation. People get left behind, especially when employment is lost in one factory and a worker is left to join another manufacturer with different standards, machines, or tools. In a nutshell, the barrier to entry for sustainable employment in the industrial sector has gone up in almost every facet.\n\nTools like Autodesk sit at the heart of these kinds of problems, where being able to understand and utilize a tool like Autodesk will dramatically increase your ability to get hired. In the information age, skills associated with Autodesk are ultimately as valuable as learning how to code in software or knowing the value of legislation and finance in other white-collar sectors. Autodesk lags behind these competitive sectors because the nature of industry it exists in with high capital expenditures.\n\nThe problem is a bottleneck problem, and solving the bottleneck will produce a far leaner and more efficient pipeline for industrial productivity, employment, and societal satisfaction.\n\n[Autodesk's recognition of its role, alongside organizations like Adobe.](https://preview.redd.it/kvm8z2md8zq61.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6d865498e39ddeff11d800b4e8e904d6137539c)\n\n# The Education Solution\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ly24pppuezq61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ab25ce2945104acb0f3c4d3816cb713db1af238\n\nThe reality here is that the education sector is also a slow-mover where shortcuts carry heavy competitive consequences. Another big element in this process is that high-level skills are ultimately dependent on adoption and communication demands. We need adaptable engineers to be familiar with a fundamental skill set that speak similar \"languages\". Autodesk has generally positioned itself to be one of those tools in a similar way that organizations like Adobe has positioned itself.\n\nWhat I believe will happen is that the incentive of certifications and accelerated programs will increase dramatically as a way to boost lucrative employment and adoption of skills. These training programs will effectively become tickets initiate a good career.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mj3rk4a2gzq61.png?width=2528&format=png&auto=webp&s=bde08f5487ed3afdd3a760fc1b3d7a019eb89ca6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xib18z21hzq61.png?width=638&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bb74a3b31dda0b750b0cb19fdfc4f97a2a4515b\n\n# AutoDesk's Role\n\nAutoDesk targets the EAC sector (engineering, architecture, and construction), so it helps to think about AutoDesk as software that can handle large scale developments focusing on the nature of smaller designs like intricate screws or cars. There is a lot of work that must be completed, with a strong societal demand. This can range from multi-year developments of hospital building in rural areas, or the construction of off-shore windmill farms. This inevitably creates a powerful compounding effect with employment and Autodesk's subscription model and increasing mobile capacities.\n\n\\- As employment increases, subscriptions begin to increase.\n\n\\- As subscription increases, projects of scale are adopted.\n\n\\- As projects of scale increase, employment increases.\n\n\\- As employment increases, the length of subscription increases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vk4hin3cozq61.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=b569a74582ac2699904727002ae3663f530a95c7\n\nThe following is a list of Autodesk's relationship with various opportunities in the near and longterm.\n\n\\- **LEED architecture certification in civil sectors with Autodesk's architecture platform, Revit.**\n\n>**Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design** (**LEED**) is a green building certification program used worldwide.

Transfer agent shows that E-Trade has registered 300 shares, and E-Trade’s records show that u/bvttfvcker has 200 of those & u/Fook-wad owns 100 of them. \n\nNow u/bvttfvcker requests paper stock certificate, so E-Trade transfers registration of those 200 shares into u/bvttfvcker’s own name (not E-Trade’s name). \n\nWhat I don’t know is - what does this mean for u/bvttfvcker’s ability to further trade or sell those stocks?
