You are a great community and I would really like to hear your opinion on a specific topic. \n\nHow do you hedge your portfolio?\n\nOf course I know how to hedge by buying for example put options but I’m more interested to know how you do it practically. \n\nI have a portfolio of round about 100k split among 20 stocks. Since I don’t want to hedge every stock separately I checked my beta to the S&P and it’s about 0.9 but for the upcoming discussion let’s just assume it’s exactly 1. \n\nMy idea is now to buy SPY puts which are currently priced around 400 USD. Each put implies a multiplier of 100 meaning 40k. So let’s say I need 2 puts to cover my portfolio (it’s actually 2.5 but that shouldn’t matter). \n\nI don’t want to hedge my portfolio perfectly. It should be more like a worst case insurance so I’m willing to allow a decrease of round about 10%. The easiest way to hedge my portfolio would be of course to just buy 2 puts on the SPY with a strike price 10% lower than the current price but I’m not sure if this would be really smart. For several reasons / questions:\n\n1) the delta for these two options would not be 1 when being close to the strike price. I.e. a down movement of 15% would not protect me for the 5% difference (as I said my strike would be 10% below current price) but only on maturity date. Doesn’t sound to me like a good protection so should I buy more puts to increase my delta?\n2) what maturity should I choose? Shorter maturities mean lower deltas but longer maturities mean higher prices. \n3) what would be the best rolling strategy? Should I wait until expiration or should I roll already earlier? Should I even only buy puts with the same maturity or should I split? I.e. one 3m put, one 6m put and one 9m put?\n\nThat’s why I’m wondering how you hedge your portfolio and if you maybe can give me some advice for the best strategy. \n\nThanks already in advance.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "IMO, people spend too much on hedging. If your time horizon is long enough to average out short term losses, don't bother with hedging. I don't hedge anything I plan to hold more than a year.\n\nIn practice, portfolio hedging is a dance of correlation and probability. It's not something you just fire and forget, you have to constantly fuss with it, since correlation and probability changes constantly.\n\nYou figure out the weighted correlation of your portfolio and then choose inverse correlations of some weight that accounts for the probability of loss. Like you wouldn't go 1 to 1 in hedging, that just means you will constantly average out to 0% gains. Instead, if a loss of 50% is only 10% likely, you only want to spend 1/10th of your portfolio's value on an inverse asset that will make 50% in such an event.\n\nMore about portfolio hedging here:\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/trading/hedging-beginners-guide/\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050615/what-are-most-effective-hedging-strategies-reduce-market-risk.asp\n\nhttp://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/2019/4/30/f6x8itvuj55k3sh07zsq05vhhb6qd5", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Wheel SNDL or buy and sell covered calls?

The important characteristic is IV Rank or IV Percentile, where present IV is compared to historical IV for that security, as _in general_ IV is mean reverting.  If the present IV is higher than historic levels, expect IV to revert to the mean (go down) meaning premiums will go down (calls, puts, lose value moving forward).  If IV is below historic levels you can expect it will go up so premiums will increase.\n\nMind that IV is only one component of what prices an option, you can have IV go up (Vega) but the stock move against the option (Delta) and the value of the option goes down, or vice versa, or any combination of the various greeks.\n\nIf you see an option w/out a \"Last\" it hasn't been traded.

Think of IV as an error rate. The higher IV is, the more likely you are going to make a mistake and spend an excessive amount to acquire that asset. Like if the real value is $5, a 300% IV means you might spend $15 and think you are getting a good deal.\n\nIf you are going long, you want to enter at the lowest possible IV and then hope that IV increases in the future.\n\n> The program says that they have had 0% change, but the B/A spread is a big gap and there's nothing on the 'Last' column, so am I right in assuming that this means that no one has sold contracts for those parameters?\n\nZero in the volume column would mean that.

A contract can drop -50% from the opening price on one day and recover to +10% from the opening price the next day. That's not unusual.

So that's $2 ITM. Something to get into the habit of doing is looking at the delta of that strike. Knowing how much delta you are paying for gives you a sense of the risk/reward for a long call. So then instead of comparing $2 ITM, you can compare 60 delta (or whatever it is), even if the price of the other stock is $333 or whatever.\n\n> Now my understanding is that your break even price for 98.00 is 101.50 and your break even price for the stike of 105 is 106.50.\n\nCorrect, but you should not care about the break-even price, because it only applies at expiration. You should not hold options through expiration. You should care more about the delta you are paying for and how much gain on your money you have made before expiration. If you paid $3.50 for the call and the next day it is worth $4.00, you just gained 14% on your money, even if expiration is a month away.\n\nMore about break-even irrelevancy here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m0m7at/monday_school_your_breakeven_isnt_as_important_as/\n\n> What benefit other than paying less for the strike at 105 is there. Wouldnt it always make sense to buy ITM calls rather than way OTM calls?\n\nOne thing is delta per dollar. If the 98 call buys you 60 delta for $3.50 and the 105 call buys you 40 delta for 1.50, you can compare the delta per dollar. \n\n98 strike = 60/3.50 = 17.14 delta per dollar\n\n105 strike = 40/1.50 = 26.67 delta per dollar\n\nSo on strictly the delta per dollar basis, the 105 strike is the better deal. But delta is not the only consideration. The 98 strike has a higher probability of expiring ITM, which means it has a lower risk of losing money, all else being equal.\n\nThere are other considerations, like IV and theta decay, but this is turning into a long reply, so I'll leave it as homework for you to do on your own.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the great reply man  when I get a free reward I'm coming back and giving it to you.

Here's my working and reasoning:\n\nIf an option with 7 DTE has an annualised volatility of **50%**, and an option with 14 DTE has an annualised volatility of **70%**, then after 7 days what would the theoretical expected volatility of the 14 DTE (now 7 DTE) option be?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn 7 days, the 50% option would be expected to move 50/sqrt(52) = 6.93% on average.\n\nIn 14 days, the 70% option would be expected to move 70/sqrt(26) = 13.73% on average.  \n If it has moved 6.93% average in the first week, then what would its average move (x) be in the 2nd week?  \n 13.73 = sqrt(6.93^(2) \\+ x^(2))   \\*See below for how we can assume this is how to add volatilities  \n x^(2) \\+ 48.02 = 188.51  \n x^(2) = 140.49  \n x = 11.85% average move in the second week.  \n 11.85 \\* sqrt(52) = **85.45% volatility expected** for the second week.\n\nSo, if modelling spreads with 50% volatility for 7 DTE options and 70% volatility for 14 DTE options, then we would need to assume the 14 DTE options would have a volatility of 85.45% after 7 days.\n\n\\*How we can assume this is the way to add volatilities:\n\nIf we add 5% volatility for 2 separate weeks, what is the volatility for the 2 weeks?\n\nUsing annualised (52 weeks, sqrt = 7.21):\n\n5 x 7.21 = 36.05% annualised\n\n36.05 / sqrt(26) = 7.07% for fortnight\n\nAlso, sqrt(5^(2) \\+ 5^(2)) = 7.07%, which is the same.

With valuations for the market, as a whole, near historic highs, buying SPACs at or near NAV can provide a favorable risk/reward. Because the SPAC holds in trust safe securities, its NAV should not deviate too far from $10, given the opportunity for arbitrage there. In other words, the downside may be limited. On the other hand, if investors become enthused about an announced deal, we are seeing SPAC shares trade well above NAV. Of course, as the share price increases above NAV, the cliched margin of safety declines, and the risk becomes more like that of any other stock.\n\n>From one perspective, SPACs are seemingly more democratic than traditional IPOs, where investment banks control supply and retail investors are typically only able to transact at levels far higher than where the IPO is initially priced. SPACs, on the other hand, often (but not always) give retail investors a shot at owning a position closer to the $10 price.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "If the SPAC dissolves because it's not able to reach a deal, I think they at least give your initial capital back, right?", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Yep plus interest.

The way that I think about it in the context of my portfolio is that SPACs purchased at IPO or around trust value are the same as fixed income products. Worst case scenario you make $10 + gov't bond interest. It's a good place to park cash.

But the basic idea is that when you buy a share of a SPAC at the IPO for $10, that $10 is put into a trust and it gains interest. The SPAC isn't allowed to do anything with that $10 before the closing of the merger (they use the cash as part of the consideration in the deal along with a PIPE (quick google search on that will explain as well)).\n\nWhat is so attractive if that you can never lose your initial $10 investment (now if you buy the sharers after the IPO at $15, your downside is $10, but you could still lose the $5 premium you paid).\n\nIn order to close the merger the SPAC holders need to vote - yes/no. No matter what you vote, you have redemption rights up until a certain date where you can redeem your shares for trust value ($10 + interest)... now if the shares are trading ABOVE trust value, you would just sell them in the open market for that price. But if they're trading at/around trust value you can redeem them for that value.\n\nSo what u/adatausb is trying to say is that if you buy it today for  $10.01, you have the opportunity to participate in the upside (people like the merger, stock trades up) but you don't risk losing more money because even if the stock trades below $10 (could be liquidity issue, whatever) you can still redeem your shares for $10 + interest either when the deal is about to close or when/if the SPAC dissolves (usually 2yrs-3yrs after it IPOs if they can't close a deal)  \n\n\nKeep in mind that once the deal closes this ability to redeem your shares ends.

Think of it like a call option - if it trades above $10, then great! But if it doesn’t, you can’t lose that initial $10 investment. \n\nA timeline of a SPAC is as follows:\n\nDay 1: IPO @ $10 (usually $10)\n\nDay 1 - Day 365+: Management works to find a solid private company to merge with and take public. They then privately negotiate a merger agreement and terms with that company. (Sometimes the SPAC could trade higher than $10 during this time on speculation/rumors)\n\nDay??? : SPAC announces its going to merge with said company to take it public (If holders like the deal, SPAC trades up, otherwise it doesn’t) \n\nFinal Days: SPAC holds a shareholder vote to approve the merger.

If you don’t want to hold the SPAC after the merger and they are trading above $10 you can also just sell them for a profit in the market.\n\nLast Day (Usually before the 2yr mark from IPO): Deal closes, the new company and SPAC are now one and the company is publicly traded.

There is no need to make extremely large capital investments. \n\nDanimer's advantage over Origin is that their plastic is biodegradable, however, their share price fell a week or so ago after it was disputed that it meets standards to be called biodegradable so that advantage might be disappearing. \n\nOrigin are part owned by some of the biggest users of plastic on the planet (PepsiCo, Danone, Nestle). \n\nI think the biggest advantage is that Origin is a carbon negative product.

It’s basically a set of notes taken by a scientist who regularly works as a consultant to the Pentagon named Dr. Eric Davis about his conversation with a top ranking Pentagon official named Admiral Wilson that happened almost 20 years ago.\n\nThe admiral says he came across a special access, black budget program at the Pentagon headed by one of the top defense contractors which he doesn’t name  (I think it’s Lockheed Martin, specifically their Skunkworks division). He eventually arranges a meeting with the program director to find out more information and is told that the purpose of the program was to reverse engineer a craft they acquired that was “not of this Earth - not made by man - not by human hands”.\n\nThe admiral demands to have access to the program but is denied by the program director after he gets shown a list of people who do have access (no one from the Pentagon or even the rest of the government, not even the president, is on that list. Basically no government oversight.) Admiral Wilson goes all Karen and threatens to complain to his superiors about this and the program director is like “lol go ahead” and when he does, he gets his career threatened and is told to never speak of it again.\n\nIf you’re doubting the authenticity of the document, it’s probably real: all of the people mentioned in it are real people. (Dr. Eric Davis was in a recent NYT article a few months ago. I wouldn’t doubt if the next article/bombshell about this topic that comes out is about this leaked document if they can verify it.) Whether or not the conversation took place or if what the program director told the admiral is real is up for debate.\n\nAnyways long story short, if it’s true that Lockheed Martin has a UAV in their possession, $LMT is probably going to be a (very) long term hold, but who knows if they can actually reverse-engineer technology that is probably thousands (or even millions) of years ahead of us within our lifetimes.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "WTF did I just read", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao, what was confusing about it?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Nothing confusing, just totally forgot that I was on /r/stocks for a minute", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Then my job is done", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Yeah but how can you sleep at night supporting such an industry?", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "You're right we should cut all funding and hope North Korea, Russia, China, and all other types of terrorists don't attack us or other countries.

But they're going to become ironSource (IS) in a few months, an $11 billion mobile adtech company. I worked in mobile marketing for a long time, and I've worked directly with IS at several companies. They are counted in the top 5 mobile marketing companies overall, with Google, Facebook, AppLovin and Unity. Every single major mobile gaming company, and many smaller ones, use IS as a part of their marketing suite. In my personal experience, they are great at getting scale in certain genres, and generally returned fairly well on ad spend. \n\nTheir major weakness to me was that they were best at scaling in the puzzle and hypercasual genres, and not so great on core games, which are going to be the major driver of growth in mobile over the next 5-10 years. There is also the impending launch of iOS 14.5, which will severely hamper advertising capabilities across all mobile marketing firms by limiting the types of data that games can pass back to advertisers. Right now, that's not as large a risk as most outsiders anticipate it to be. I personally doubt anyone is going to stop advertising in mobile - they'll just move spend to Android (which IS had a huge presence on). I however anticipate Google to make a similar move over the next year or two, (Apple is always the first moved in these cases and the rest follow) and that could really test adtech stocks in the short term. It won't be a long term issue if you're a long investor, though, imo. The industry is just growing too aggressively, and anyone worth their salt in mobile knows that the instant you turn off paid advertising, your game dies due to the way Apple and Google's search algorithms are structured. So people won't stop spending long term.\n\nRegardless of potential weaknesses in the short term, I'm majorly bullish on TBD/IS long term. They can easily overcome their weakness in core through acquisitions, and although they are already used by every major mobile gaming company, there is room for them to juice more business out of those companies by expanding into core, further improving their return on ad spend for clients, and introducing disruptive solutions to counteract the inevitable blows from iOS 14.5. They also have a gaming branch, which I don't count as a substantial part of their business but which could grow, especially if further integrated with their advertising side.

The fact that it is currently trading at a mere $16 a share pre-merger is the definition of \"real upside potential\" too. Companies that operate in a similar space include Affirm ($66), LendingTree ($220), and UpStart ($96). Hell, a company like Loandepot only does mortgages (one of many things SoFi does) and is stabilizing around $20 after its recent IPO. And if you're super-bullish on SoFi, you might put the company with the likes of SQ (I wouldn't go that far though).  \n\nOn the occasion that SoFi does receive proper coverage, a lot of the bullish takes echo Chamath's overly optimistic view of the company, which can be annoying. Those bulls think SoFi will radically alter banking, and the company's Galileo platform will be the \"AWS of FinTech.\" \n\nHowever, we don't need to be that optimistic to have a bullish view of the company. SoFi is arguably the best and most reputable lending/refinancing FinTech company out there already. Go talk to anyone that refinanced their student loans and I guarantee either (1) they refinanced their student loans with SoFi, or (2) they barely ended up picking a different company but had a very positive experience with SoFi and would absolutely consider them for other things going forward. Do the same thing for someone who recently refinanced their mortgage. Overall, you'll find that SoFi has made a name for itself in customer service in a field where it is very common for people to harbor negative feelings towards their lender/refinancer. At the same time, SoFi actually does offer great rates, which will only get better once their banking charter goes fully into effect.\n\nSo I see a company with core products that lock their customers in for years/decades, thereby giving them ample ability to cross-sell their other products. And unlike other lenders in this space, SoFi *actually has* lots of other products to cross-sell. Even if some of these products fail, they still have their core products to fall back on for quite some time. Moreover, SoFi carries a very positive reputation that intrigues would-be customers.

Going public via SPAC has allowed us to get it at a bargain price though, so I can't really complain, even if it takes longer to climb in price. I'd also note that DraftKings has had a relatively nice, somewhat stable run since going public via SPAC last year. Obviously, DraftKings and SoFi are not similar companies when it comes to services, but I think DraftKings shows that well-known companies can enjoy success relatively quickly post-merger via SPAC, so I wouldn't be surprised if SoFi found itself on a similar trajectory and hit above $50 in several months.

It's not quite as bad as what we had in 2008 at least in the banking sector (because of better regulation) but I am skeptical of the risk management of certain over-leveraged hedge funds.\n\nI also see major geopolitical risk in the Chinese stock market and related Western companies because of the increasingly serious tension over Taiwan, Xinjiang etc. and the fast rapprochement between China and Russia; the international market seems to be fragmenting along geopolitical lines, which will continue to remodel supply chains.\n\nI think that the Fed will do whatever it can, but it can't control the appetite for risk of investment banks and especially of hedge funds. Only the government can do that through regulation, but regulation tends to come only after things go wrong.\n\nIn any case I do expect a crash within the next few years.

Everything still seemed safe, and Bernanke famously remarked in 2007 that the subprime crisis had been contained.\n\nWhat nobody expected was that housing prices would cease to go up.  Housing prices had always gone up... it's brick and mortar and that's a valuable asset anyway you look at it.  Unless, of course, supply of houses drastically exceeds demand.  Subprime borrowers defaulting put a lot of houses back on the market at once (more supply).\n\nFurthermore, investor confidence was shaken by the subprime crisis so there's a credit crunch... this means borrowing gets more expensive.  Interest rates rise.  This means less eligible buyers, and less people willing to speculate on houses with easy money (less demand).\n\nThen there's the problem of adjustable-rate mortgages.  Borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages suddenly get hit with rates that they can't possibly afford.  In the past, this wasn't a problem, because housing prices always go up, right?  They could just refinance using the new value of their home.  But faced with falling home prices, they couldn't anymore.  This results in more foreclosures.  Even more houses on the market, less eligible buyers.  The crisis spreads.\n\nNow banks holding ridiculous amounts of these \"safe\", AAA mortgage-backed securities, using ridiculous amounts of leverage, are in real trouble.  Their mortgage-backed securities are no longer worth anything.  They can't pay what they owe.

Helpful snippets from the article:\n\n\"The primary market too is awash with cash, allowing high-yield and leveraged loan borrowers to tap funding at cheap rates, despite falling revenues due to COVID-19. As one buyside account said this week: 'Some companies are worse off than a year ago, and they are borrowing money at cheaper rates than ever.' 'It feels like we are back to pre-crisis levels almost, and the default rate has not really spiked, even though everyone knows Q1 is a write-off in terms of normal business activity,' said another buyside manager this week. 'Some companies, especially in the leisure and retail sectors, just see their leverage multiples rising and rising, but as long as they have liquidity, no one seems to care. You would think that sooner or later this could catch up with us.' ... Restructuring advisers agree that unlike in past crises, liquidity will be the main driver of defaults. But there is indeed a risk that the current accumulation of debt due to cheap rates could come back and bite both borrowers and investors. 'High-yield sometimes used to be 10%-plus, but with non-investment-grade spreads as low as they are, pressure from interest payments is not what it once was. However, following the COVID-19 recession, liquidity shortfalls stemming from businesses ramping up to pre-crisis levels of activity will be a major driver of default rates going forward,' said Joseph Swanson, co-head of Houlihan Lokey's EMEA Restructuring Group.' \"\n\nThink about the scene in The Big Short where the stripper tells Mark Baum (played by Steve Carell) that she owns three homes that she should not have qualified for because she got them at low interest rates.  She then realizes that if those interest rates shift, she's in trouble.  That is the point where Mark Baum (in the movie) realizes the housing market bubble is real and it is going to burst.  Now replace the stripper with businesses that have not had any real income over the past year (\"zombie companies\").  They have been limping along, hoping to survive the COVID-19 crisis, and low interest loans have helped them do that, but what happens if anything shifts?  Boom.  The companies fail and default on their loans, and people lose their jobs.  Those people who lost their jobs might have bought homes during the crisis too, so they now default on their mortgages as people desperate to sell flood the housing market with inventory, decreasing the average home price.  Boom.  Other people who bought homes they could afford, albeit at a premium, are now super under water on THEIR mortgages.  The ripples from the collapse of those zombie companies also creates a lot of extra talent competing for the \"survivors'\" jobs, which may deflate wages, meaning it is harder for people to afford those giant mortgages, leading to more potential defaults.

Excuse the length, but I literally mathed out everything minus insurance:\n\n-----\n\nA Tesla is MUCH cheaper than an ICE car. Consider the following: \n\nI live in Quebec Canada, and I have my model 3 SR+ ordered and delayed pick up until November. So adjust your costs and rebates accordingly: \n\n8 year ownership of a Tesla model 3 SR+ vs. a BASE model 2021 Toyota Camry \n\nSticker price of a tesla model 3 standard range plus:\n- $52,990 \n\nCanada has a $5000 federal rebate for electric vehicles that have a sticker price under $55,000. The model 3 SR+ is the only model that is under that price. So thats the model I went with \n\nQuebec also has a $8000 provincial rebate on top of the federal one. \n\nSo I get back $13,000 in rebates come tax season. Bringing the actual cost down to: $39,990. \n\n2021 Toyota Camry base model:\n$27,250 \n\nNow from there: I average about 20,000km/year in driving, so my average fuel cost per year for a Toyota Camry is about $2400/ year. And stretched over a 8 year period = $19,800 \n\nIn quebec; the average daily cost to charge your vehicle (from home) is about $1. And average yearly cost is $300/year. Stretched over 8 years = $2400 \n\nTotal cost for 8 years for a Tesla model 3 including charge costs = $42,390 \n\nTotal cost for 8 years for a Toyota Camry including fuel costs = $47,050 \n\nObviously maintenance cost are much lower as well. Teslas are bumper to pumper covered for 8 years. Average annual cost spread out over 8 years is about $150/year, with the first 4-5 years literally just being tire rotations and wiper fluid fill ups. Total = $1200 over the 8 year life of the vehicle. \n\nAverage cost for a Toyota camry over 8 years is $550/year, or $4400 total (which is obviously SUPER conservative for a gas powered car). \n\nTesla Model 3 including charge and maint. costs over 8 years = $43,590 \n\nToyota Camry including fuel and maint. costs over 8 years = $51,450 \n\nResale value: tesla on average depreciate at about 39%. Average for standard gas car over 5 years is about 50% \n\nSo. Reselling a Toyota camry after 8 years will probably give you $10,000. A Tesla model 3 SR after 8 years will likely give you $20,000 (it'll be more: but again we are being super conservative here).\n\nSo with all factors considered, including resale (except insurance costs): total ownership cost of each vehicle after a 8 year horizon: \n\n2021 Tesla Model 3 SR+ = $23,590 \n\nBase model 2021 Camry = $41,450 \n\nA net difference of $17,860 in favour of owning the Tesla. \n\nYou would literally have to buy a new ICE vehicle that costs LESS than $11,000 for it to actually be cheaper than a +$52,000 Tesla. \n\nAnd all this is assuming Tesla's robo taxi network doesn't go live, and I end up making revenue on letting my car join their taxi network within those 8 years.

(edit destroy it because you couldn't run it on a raspberry pi so it wouldn't be decentrialized)\n\nAs we reached the limit, a huge debate (really it was a civil war) happened where any discussion on teh bitcoin subreddit about trying to raise the blocksize started getting banned, and people and businesses were getting character assinated left and right (you know Coinbase?  they threatened a boycott of them because they supported raising the limit). People got death threats.\n\nEventually it came all to a head in 2017 where there was an agreement to raise the limit if we also did a different upgrade they wanted, but it was broken in 2 parts.  Their upgrade, then the 2mb limit.\n\nThey backed out after they got their part.  And the fork happened.\n\nFees were never supposed to be $30-40, they were always supposed to be cheap.  Billions of transactions that are cheap is enough money to pay the miners, but if you have that many transactions (one day) then you can't run a node on your raspberry Pi and that's blasphemy.\n\nEdit: Also worth noting very important/prominent people in Bitcoin who refused to raise the limit, founded a company and got 70 million funding, who's purpose is to build software that they can sell to people that only works if Bitcoin doesn't have cheap fees...  Huge conflict of interest that they never acknowledged.

That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.\n\nBut even that's not necessary for a very very long time.  Hardware today can process 10's of thousands of transactions a second for a cost a hobbiest could afford.  Can literally everyone do it?

It would mean a ***SP value of $203,90*** for ***BCRX***. I want to make clear again that BCX9930 is said to be best in-class treatment and it's able to treat x4 times more diseases, therefore aims for a bigger TAM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**V.VII -** **Soliris/Ultomoris patients survey**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBCRX recently did a ***survey with 23 PNH patients***, *12* of them using *Ultomiris* and the other *11* *Soliris.* The survey showed that ***91% of the patients were interested in switching. Needle vs Oral*** *treatment battle once more as with Orladeyo.*\n\nSome of the *patients treated with BCX9930* were asked some questions, among them, the *6th* one expressed his ***desire*** *to be able to* ***be treated with BCX9930 twice a day oral pill.*** As we have seen it before with Orladeyo, patients are *highly willing to* ***switch from needles to oral-pill*** form treatments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z8c5fthby8n71.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=3684b7506f58bb4dcb3acd5a072c88cb078218d6\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**V.VIII - BCX9930 Valuation**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving in mind BCX9930 is a *the* **B*****est-in-class treatment***, that Alexion got bought out for 39B mainly for their C5 inhibitor, and the yearly ***market size*** BCX9930 aims for in 2025 rounds the ***$40B*** mark. BCX9930 valuation can not be less than a ***30% of Alexion’s buy out price***, this is ***11.7B*** *meaning* ***66.44$.***\n\nWe're simply valuing BCX9930 value at the moment knowing it is the best in class inhibitor comparing it with other drugs, \"just the value it has as a drug\". We're not adding here the value it will have adding peak sales etc etc etc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BCX9930 value: 66.44$ SP](https://preview.redd.it/ogbtzhgdy8n71.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=32a4c5cf40ec122f1ef52dcdb8164d74e6b763cd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **5. Alexion's performance with Soliris**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlexion could be the perfect example to have an idea of what we should expect from Biocryst in the upcoming years. *From* ***2007 to 2014*** *Alexion's* ***SP grew a 1777%***. Being valued at ***10.5$*** *in* ***2007*** *and* ***186.6$ in 2014.***\n\nRevenue generated by Alexion gradually grew up as their C5 inhibitor was approved to treat additional diseases firstly PNH then aHUS, as the market size it captured became wider and the amount of patients it treated slowly scored up\n\nBiocryst Pharmaceutical's SP managing to do the SP move Alexion's stock did, is more than ***doable*** considering the unique pipeline it possess. Having in mind *Alexion made* ***66.4 MM*** *revenue the first year (2007) while* ***BCRX expects to generate 500 MM plus with Orladeyo,*** apart from it, additional revenues generated by ***Rapivab/Galidesivir stockpillings*** may come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86vyisdpy8n71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8f1a06d3de6099c6ac931f39d705d9a382c8dec\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **6.** **De-risked company**\n\nLast December the 7th, 2020 BCRX announced they made a **Royalty** ***agreement*** *with* ***Royalty Pharma and Athyrium Capital Management.*** With this agreement BCRX was funded with ***$325,000,000*** *in order to support Orladeyo launch*.\n\n***Jon Stonehouse CEO***, confirmed that the company will ***not need to do offerings anymore.***\n\nIt's important to restate that as part of the Royalty agreement, ***Royalty Pharma will receive a 1% on global net sales of BCX9930, if approved.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4h6146ary8n71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc1d567aef46053a2962656d80438e347f5b8f74\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **7.
