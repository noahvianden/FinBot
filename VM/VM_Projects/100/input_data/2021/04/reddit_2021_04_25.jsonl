That means on 4/21 your puts had no intrinsic value and only 2 days to expiry.  Honestly $4.50 was better than I would have guessed the daily high would be.

OP says:  \n\n\n>Belgium had the world's first stock market(without actual stocks) back in 1400's.\n\nWhich already sounds confusing. How can you have stock exchange without stocks? Since OP didn't add sources, what he means by this is speculation. In the early 14th century, Bruges was a center of trade in Europe. People would trade in the city square and stuff. In 1285 the *Ter Beurse Inn* was established. An inn run by the prominent Van der Beurse family that housed foreign merchants. The square where the inn was located was where a lot of trading was done. This is where the word beurs (bourse) comes from. The inn, square, trading together make an argument for being the first exchange, with the inn later becoming a place where solely trading was done. [More on all this here.](https://thetchblog.com/2020/09/07/the-original-bourse-at-bruges/) \n\n[Trade then shifted to Antwerp, where in 1531 the first purpose-built commodities exchange building was established.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourse_of_Antwerp) So that's a Belgian contender, I suppose. \n\nThe first place where *stocks* were exchanged is [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euronext_Amsterdam). In 1602. By [the Dutch East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company). You know, the company that was established in 1602 and is mentioned by OP in his second point:  \n\n\n>The East India Company is widely recognized as the world’s first publicly traded company  \n\nAnd then there's many more interesting contenders for world first exchanges. Ultimately it doesn't really matter which was first. It's all fascinating history worth a read. Oh, also:\n\nThe top 10 list from OP doesn't make sense to me. I was surprised the LSE had a bigger market cap than the Euronext, but even more so bigger than the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges. Looking around I can't find any data supporting the list. I also notice OP listed a whole bunch of exchanges, and uses the [Stock Exchange Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange_Group) for the London one, which is more than just the LSE. [Most top 10's I can find look like this](https://www.tradinghours.com/markets) or similar. Different order than OP's for sure.\n\nI appreciate the idea of this post.

{"title": "Why Analyst Sees AirTags As A $10B Opportunity For Apple", "selftext": "\"Apple unveiled its Bluetooth trackers dubbed “AirTags” on Tuesday at its “Spring Loaded” virtual event. The product represents a $10 billion opportunity for Apple, according to Raymond James & Associates.\n\nThe Apple Analyst: Raymond James analyst Chris Caso has an Outperform 2 rating on the Cupertino, California-based tech giant with a price target of $160.\n\nThe Apple Thesis: Caso said that AirTags are akin to AirPods in terms of potential growth for the Tim Cook-led company as they would strengthen its ecosystem and encourage upgrades.\n\n“We believe this product category will have very broad appeal (who wouldn't pay $30 to not lose your wallet?), and as such could grow to become a $10 billion opportunity,” wrote Caso in a note Tuesday.\n\nIn Raymond James' estimate, AirPods sell with an annual volume of nearly 70-80 million units.\n\n“At $30 per Air Tag (or $99 for 4), if Air Tags were to sell at a similar unit volume as AirPods, that would put annual AirTag revenue at $2 – 2.5 billion,” as per Caso.\n\nThe analyst theorized that it is reasonable that AirTags would sell at a much higher unit volume compared to AirPods as users buy multiple units to tag items such as wallets and keys.\n\n“We wouldn’t be surprised to see AirTags grow to be a $10 billion business over time, putting that product close to AirPods in terms of revenue impact.”\n\nPrecision AirTag tracking is only available for users of iPhone 11 and above and provides an incentive for users to upgrade, according to Caso.\n\nThis month, Apple said it would let third-party companies use its “Find My” tracking network, which means third-party products can now be tracked using devices made by the Tim Cook-led company.\n\nSource:  https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/21/04/20718393/why-analyst-sees-airtags-as-a-10b-opportunity-for-apple?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=yahooFinance&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site", "id": "my003t", "created_utc": 1619321921.0, "score": 191, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 240, "comments": [{"body": "The network of phones and devices is supposed to make it super easy to find your item.\n\nI love my Tiles but think I will have to switch to the Apple device instead of buying new batteries for my old ones.\n\n\nGotta feel sorry for the people at Tile...", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "Why do you plan to switch?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Tile has abused their monopoly for too long.\n\nHowever sharing my location and now intent (have keys on?

This has all been accelerated due to the covid cause all you dumb fucks have been watching 4k Pornhub filth from you mums basement, while pausing the newly acquired PS5. Those of you with a job perhaps thought working from home would require a new laptop and what have you.   \n AMD delivers the chips for all this.

Can’t blame them. AMD will in coming quarters buy XLINX and expand their business to other segments in the semi conductor industry so there is plenty of room for further growth on the outlook.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  **Supply and competition**\n\nTSMC is the main foundry supplier for AMD. They have kept prices intact but there are so far rumors that they might hike them soon enough. Last year many of the sites were shut down and capacity hasn’t met the surge we have seen late quarters. The problem is not exclusive for AMD but it’s the same for most of its competitors. They have stated though that they expect to be back on track for 2022. Intel got hammered last week in earnings with losing market share in datacenter segment and margins absolutely murdered. AMD has been trading inverse to Intel basically as the market expects AMD to be one of the main causes to Intel's howler.\n\nHowever let the bears beware of the CEO’s lady Su’s own words live:  \n \"we have enormous demand, demand is very, very strong\" continuing their seeing record growth in multiple areas including PC, gaming and datacenter. Lisa added: \"to answer your question, it's good -- it's very good\"  \n [https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tweaktown.com/news/78289/amd-on-the-cpu-and-gpu-chip-shortage-its-very-good/amp.html](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.tweaktown.com/news/78289/amd-on-the-cpu-and-gpu-chip-shortage-its-very-good/amp.html)  \n Now ask yourself if that’s something a smart insanely well performing CEO would say 6 weeks before an earnings report if the shortage was really smashing the business. My cents are on her being right and even a bit conservative on it.\n\n  \n\n**Analysts**\n\nMarket analysts are quite divided on the target ranging between 70 and 135. The best rated one here Hans Mosesmann has a price target of 120.

Yes everyone has heard of LiDar tech and its pros and cons. But the one thing everyone gets wrong with MVIS is that their LiDar tech is much smaller than the rest of the markets which allows car makers to use them and not have it look unappealing to the consumers. Plus MVIS is doing much work to make their LiDar at a much lowers cost which is key especially for the average car instead of the higher end cars. This will allow auto makers to catch up to the autonomous software used in the higher end cars without the automakers having to invest a lot of time and money. Then there is their Augmented reality which is gonna be huge in the years to come. We all know the hololens 2 made from Microsoft that  uses  Microvision Tech in the augmented lenses. However it seems a lot of people overlook the use of augmented reality into today's society. Hello pandemic goodbye big business conferences, meetups, face to face interactions. Here comes augmented reality to still be in the same room and looking at the same material and be able to interact with the people and material. Future of construction, construction workers can work on the physical site with an augmented layout of what they are working on and be able to interact with that blueprint right at the sight. How this will save so MUCH MONEY AND TIME for construction. Hello Biden administration massive infrastructure plan over the next 10 years. How about training new employees. There are many people looking for jobs and many companies hiring (today's issues of hiring isn't not enough jobs but not enough qualified people for those jobs). So how do we get those people hired and trained quickly to be able to keep up? Augmented reality! A much more fast and cost efficient way to get that on job experience. This can be applied to mechanics, healthcare workers, construction workers, many sales & marketing, field service, farming, architecture. The uses of MicroVision tech and almost infinite.

These goggles will only cause a safety hazard to the skilled workers that are building it. Can you imagine all of the OSHA fines and lawsuits that will come from this when the first accident happens. The root of the problem is bringing in young quality workers and keeping experienced workers that are good at their craft. That will make things go quicker. A good team of workers in the field make a job go quicker and under budget. This technology is only viable for a developer who wants to show potential clients what the space would look like before it is finished. But good luck selling that to a developer that is already trying to undercut every contractor for labor and materials.\n\nI’ve Worked in construction for 10 years and own a small construction company. Small and medium size contractors couldn’t afford this. Large GC’s have only a few people testing this technology but it wouldn’t translate into the field (built) environment. It would only be in the office environment which doesn’t make the actual work go faster and more cost efficient. If they can perfect BIM it will make the jobs go smoother for the project managers, estimators, and Superintendents. Which would make for a smoother project without a lot of change orders.
