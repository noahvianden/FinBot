If the market suddenly drops 3% it would cause SQQQ to go up 9%. But let's say you bought at 10 thinking a crash was imminent, but the market went up for awhile after, bringing SQQQ down to 9. When you finally get that 9% pop, it only brings you up to 9.81, still below where you started. You might be able to imagine how this might play out the longer you have to hold SQQQ waiting for a crash. You can even look at a long term chart of SQQQ and see how a lot of the big peaks are still below where the price was just a few months before that.\n\nIf you can accurately time a crash, then I'd argue that UVXY calls would be the most profitable, but then you also have to know when to get out of the trade too.

He is a expert in the UK markets both his funds are diversified with exposure to Japan UK and USA.\nFinally to Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust. So these trust are similar to arkk funds and their parent company who controls the fund baillie Gifford were also at one point before the pandemic the second largest shareholder of Tesla just behind Elon musk they have sold some of Their stake after the impressive run up.

Mainly the current volatility affecting the entire all time high market.

Additionally, some analysts are looking at the innovation and restructuring that Hasbro has been doing and evaluating based on that. \n\n\nI think investors looking at Hasbro are seeing the same type of potential I do, which sets the PE high, but my personal valuation, which is obviously a bit more speculative, would set the target price even higher. While analysts do see Hasbro’s shift in focus toward entertainment and improved digital sales, I don’t think they really understand the potential that the new focus on WotC brings. \n\nD&D and MtG have exploded in recent years. TTRPGs and TCGs have traditionally been thought of as a small part of the fringe Nerd Hobbyist Industry. Now both are full blown industries of their own, with their respective subcultures permeating across multiple demographics.

And WotC will be at the forefront of that.\n\nThen there’s the entertainment stuff, which I detailed in another post, obviously it’s risky to bet on a company in hopes that a few movies will be mega successful, but risk vs reward to me makes it a no brainer. Tons of IPs with projects in the works with potential to become Hasbro’s next Transformers franchise. It’s possible that current investors see that the same way I do.

You can sacrifice some of your youth to see a compounded return on fun via investing in yourself but still have fun while doing so. Fun in your 20s is overrated due to having little funds. Having fun with good money in your 30s (and beyond) is more valuable. You will realize this when you see others that took the other path and thank yourself.\n\nHonestly, I think fun is pretty overrated when we are young. If you save and invest your money you are also investing in future fun. Just like money, fun can be saved and it can grow like compound interest. When I started college I had lots of family/friends that would tell me that I wasn’t living life and that it’s too short to always be studying. Jokes on them. 3 years later I got accepted to a graduate program to become a medical professional. I graduate in 3 more years and if blessed with the opportunity to specialize maybe another 2-4 years more in the form of a paid residency. \n\nI will probably end up with nearly 200k in debt after these 3 years. If I continue to invest and save the money my parents send to help with food, transportation, etc; I could probably knock off a solid 30-40% of that debt. Maybe even more if you take into consideration resident salary. Instead I’ll just pay the interest off, invest the rest, and start working. \n\nWhen I start after the next 5-7 years, in the field of my desired specialty, I can expect to make a 250-450k a year starting out. So after exactly 1 year, after taxes, I already have the ability to pay off that loan and have some money left over. At this point I am still under 30 years of age. \n\nBefore that following year I could get a loan to start my own practice. Sure, it’ll probably take a year before I manage to turn a profit. But once I do, it will be 500k-800k in pure profits every year. \n\nI want to add that I didn’t take into my girlfriend being on her way to doing the same. We’re pretty set on getting married and starting a joint practice that will raise profits approximately 25-30%. By the time she’s done and joins me I will still not have reached 35. Most of those friends I mentioned earlier barely continued education after high school and are either in and out of jails or working harsh dead-end jobs. Due to this, they couldn’t marry or find someone with an education that got them a good paying job. In fact, most of them are stay at home moms or they they are paying child support.\n\nNow idk about you; but I think the finite level of fun one could have in their 20s due to limited funds and leads to that kind of life comes no where near the fun one could have in their mid 30s-60s (if staying in good shape) if they invested in their future. Life really isn’t all that short. It’s just that people confuse “life” with the good things in life. Yes, the list of those moments tend to be short for most of us. That list usually tends to get longer for those who make sacrifices though. \n\nI feel that the belief of “life being too short” needs to be phased out. The only people that can live that way and face little to no repercussions are the wealthy and even then it’s not sustainable. Life expectancy isn’t what it used to be decades ago.

THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE UPVOTES!  Disclaimer that I am NOT a financial advisor, and I do not work in finance.  I'm just a guy who has made some big financial mistakes in his life and is passing on the same knowledge that my kids will receive.**\n\nMost employers offer a 401k or Roth 401k plan as part of their benefits package.  Some of them will also match what you put into it.  I'll use my company as an example:  I am allowed to contribute money out of my paycheck (deductions are set up annually and happen automatically every pay period) into either a \"traditional\" 401k plan, or a Roth 401k plan.  I'll explain the difference between the two in a minute, but for now, focus on the pay period deductions.  An employer will typically \"match\" your contributions up to a certain percentage.  For my employer, that percentage is 5%.\n\nThis means that if I contribute 5% of my paycheck to my 401k plan, my employer will also kick in 5%.  This is free money that I am not obligated to pay back.  Most employers will have a stipulation that you have to work there for 6-12 months before they contribution kicks in, but once it does, that money is yours forever, even if you leave the company and go work somewhere else.  This means you are highly incentivized to put in at least what the company will match so that you are receiving the maximum benefit from them.  In my world, I put in 10% of my pay, but my company maxes out at 5% match, so they don't put in 10% to match me, they put in 5%, but I'm still getting that 5% for free, so in real world dollars, I'm saving/investing 15% of my yearly salary.  This also works the other way down, meaning if the company maxes their match at 5%, but you decide to only put in 3% of your pay, the company will also only put in 3% to match you.  They will only match you up to the max of 5% or whatever their maximum match rate is.  Some companies match up to 3%, some go as high as 10%.  It's a huge benefit that a lot of people don't consider and don't take advantage of.\n\nThe difference between traditional 401k and Roth comes down to taxes.  Traditional 401k is funded with pre-tax dollars, and you pay taxes on the growth once you start withdrawing money from the account.  This means that if you make $50k a year and you choose to contribute 5% of your pay to your 401k, then exactly $2,500 a year will get contributed to your account.  This makes it a little easier on you today, because money withdrawn before taxes is seldom noticed.  The Roth is funded with after tax dollars, so a 5% contribution on a $50k salary would be less than $2,500, it would end up being 5% of whatever your net pay is after taxes and other deductions are taken out of your pay.  The benefit of a Roth though is that the money invested grows tax free, and you get to withdraw it without penalty when you retire, so if you have $2M saved, you actually get to keep all of it, whereas $2M in a traditional 401k would get taxed at the future tax rate, and you would only realize $1.5M or so (depending on tax rate and withdrawal rate).\n\nIn the end, it really doesn't matter a lot which retirement plan you pick, it only matters that you fund it as hard as you can for as long as you can, and never touch it until you are eligible.  It is possible to take out loans and early withdrawals from 401k plans, but there are hefty fees and taxes for doing so, which essentially negate all of your gains.  If you find yourself in the future needing to cut down on contributions, you can do so at any time, even down to 0%, but remember that doing so also cuts into your future compounding interest, and you will need to play catch up like me.  I'm currently putting 10% of my pay (plus 5% from employer match) into a traditional 401k, plus I have a Roth that I fund separately with extra money and bonuses.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**I have gotten a lot of comments and messages about this post, so I'll add more information here to try and save other people time.**\n\n**1) What is compound interest and how are you getting it?**\n\nCompound interest is pretty much just the annual growth of your money that compounds on itself.  Fund values are driven by the underlying stocks that they own, and as a general rule, stocks go up in value every year (barring a black swan event like COVID or the 2008 crash).  If you are constantly buying into something that grows at a 7-10% rate every year, your account grows from both the value gained (the 7-10%) and the extra money you are putting in.  The next year's growth then benefits from both of these, so the 7-10% in year 2 grows your account by a larger amount than year 1 did.  This compounds every year and over 30-40 years, it starts to get really insane.  This is why I made the statement \"at around 500k, compound interest kicks your account in the balls.\"  What I meant was, just from interest alone, year over year, your account will grow by roughly $30,000.  There are a lot of compound interest calculators out there that can show you your potential gains if you input the dollar amounts and interest/growth rates.  I use 7% for a fairly conservative planning model.\n\n**2) Your suggestion of a Large Cap Growth Fund is garbage, everyone knows that (insert any other fund except bonds here) outperforms Large Cap!**\n\nI honestly don't care what fund you pick, it is your decision to make.  I gave OP the suggestion of Large Cap Growth because his original question was what would you do retrospectively.  I obviously have the benefit of hindsight, but he asked to not use that, so I picked Large Cap Growth because that type of fund has made me more money in the last 10 years than any other.  Can you make just as much or more investing in International, Small Cap Growth, Large Cap Value, Small Cap Value, etc.?  Sure, you can.  I've stated this multiple times in the comments below, but it doesn't really matter what fund you pick, what matters is that you regularly contribute to it and never touch it until you retire.  Picking one fund over another is NOT going to be a million dollar mistake.  Not picking anything, however, is.\n\n**3) Experiences are all that matters, and you can't really save that much money in your 20s anyway.**\n\nI agree that experiences matter.  In my 20s, I didn't travel or do anything crazy, I just spent my money on food, booze, hanging out with friends, cars, motorcycles, etc.  I did have fun, but if I would have saved at least a little bit of money every month, and invested it, I would be in a much better position today.  Saving just $200 a month from 20-30 would have net me around $35k conservatively, and while that isn't a huge pile of money, that $35k grows with the rest of my account over the next 30 years from 30-60 and becomes very substantial.  I was never arguing the point that OP should save every dime and never go out or take vacations, I said save as much as you can as often as you can.  For some people, that might be $100 a month, for others that might be $100 a year.  Just get started and get in the habit of putting money away and not touching it.  Don't spend everything you make.\n\n**4) Roth IRA is better.  No Traditional is betta!**\n\nAgain, it doesn't really matter.  What matters is putting money in one or both and don't touch it.  We can speculate all day on tax implications today vs. 30-40 years from now, but we'll never know everyone's situation.  If your employer only offers Roth IRA matches, then obviously pick that so you can take their match.  If they only offer Traditional, there you go.  If they offer both, then just pick one and run with it.  There isn't a wrong answer, and if you're that worried about it, pick both and contribute as much as you can to both.  \n\n\n**5) Can you provide some examples of Large Cap Growth Funds?**\n\nYou can go to Fidelity's website (or any other brokerage that you prefer) and pretty easily research mutual funds.  There are hundreds of Funds out there, so don't worry about picking an exact one or the same one I use or whatever.  Look at the rating the Fund has received, it's returns over 1Y, 5Y, 10Y, etc. the risk profile, and any other information that is important to you.  There are a lot of funds out there nowadays that are commission free, but some still charge a small yearly fee for management.  I'm more concerned about overall performance, so I typically don't pay much attention to the fees, but again, it depends on what is important to you.  If you aren't sure what you are looking at, start googling the terms.  Some people have also argued that you should just put your money in SPY or VOO.  Again, it doesn't really matter what you pick, what matters is putting money into it regularly and not touching it for 30-40 years.\n\nI'm happy to answer more questions, and if I get the same ones over and over, I'll add them here.", "score": 536, "replies": [{"body": "This man is on the money.

Would these same people say it's so easy to beat the market after 2008? What about the Dot Com bubble? Did they perfectly time the Nifty Fifty and continue to beat the market in the subsequent market crash?\n\nSo even if people say they are in their 40s, that means they have invested through a single recession and might have experienced the dot Com boom and bust. Does that qualify them to explain how easy it is to beat the market in various market conditions? Probably not, but it sure makes them more qualified them the 20 and 30 year olds who have beat the market by buying tech stocks. \n\nHere is a fun example:\nIf 20% of your portfolio was Tesla and the other 80% was companies that have since gone bankrupt, you'd have beaten the market over the past five years (by over 50%). Would that make that person an investing genius? Hardly, 4 of their 5 picks went bankrupt. And let's not even get into the fact that Tesla's P/E has no basis in reality, much like other companies related to electric cars.\n\n\nBetween 1992 and 2017, the average return of a mutual fund was 8.55%, where the S&P 500 averaged 9.69%.

If professionals who have teams researching spending 8 hours a day can't consistently beat the market, how can you reasonably expect someone who is equally knowledgeable (and let's be clear, you and I are not as up to date as fund managers) to do it in only few hours a week. There are plenty more statistics that show that the fund managers who happen to beat the market to it by chance, not by skill, if you're curious to see them, I suggest reading Jack Bogle's \"The Little Book of Common Sense Investing.\" (I would actually recommend reading the book if you have any interest in investing, it's usually the first book I recommend to people.\n\nIf you want to buy individual stocks, my suggestion is to do it with a small portion of your portfolio (<5%) and consider it just as much a hobby as an investment.

Talking about option fundementals or strategies to me may as well be as useful as speaking to me in Chinese.\n\n> Like, my brother has his MBA and does real estate DD for a living, he doesn't even touch stock picking, there's so much you have to learn\n\nI mean sure this makes sense because real estate and stocks is like apples to oranges, this is like saying a biologist doesn't touch theoretical physics, both are science at the end of the day but two completely different fields. They're two entirely different beasts with two entirely different types of fundementals.

You can sacrifice some of your youth to see a compounded return on fun via investing in yourself but still have fun while doing so. Fun in your 20s is overrated due to having little funds. Having fun with good money in your 30s (and beyond) is more valuable. You will realize this when you see others that took the other path and thank yourself.\n\n\nHonestly, I think fun is pretty overrated when we are young. If you save and invest your money you are also investing in future fun. Just like money, fun can be saved and it can grow like compound interest. When I started college I had lots of family/friends that would tell me that I wasn’t living life and that it’s too short to always be studying. Jokes on them. 3 years later I got accepted to a graduate program to become a medical professional. I graduate in 3 more years and if blessed with the opportunity to specialize maybe another 2-4 years more in the form of a paid residency.\n\nI will probably end up with nearly 200k in debt after these 3 years. If I continue to invest and save the money my parents send to help with food, transportation, etc; I could probably knock off a solid 30-40% of that debt. Maybe even more if you take into consideration resident salary. Instead I’ll just pay the interest off, invest the rest, and start working.\n\nWhen I start after the next 5-7 years, in the field of my desired specialty, I can expect to make a 250-450k a year starting out. So after exactly 1 year, after taxes, I already have the ability to pay off that loan and have some money left over. At this point I am still under 30 years of age.\n\nBefore that following year I could get a loan to start my own practice. Sure, it’ll probably take a year before I manage to turn a profit. But once I do, it will be 500k-800k in pure profits every year.\n\nI want to add that I didn’t take into my girlfriend being on her way to doing the same. We’re pretty set on getting married and starting a joint practice that will raise profits approximately 25-30%. By the time she’s done and joins me I will still not have reached 35. Most of those friends I mentioned earlier barely continued education after high school and are either in and out of jails or working harsh dead-end jobs. Due to this, they couldn’t marry or find someone with an education that got them a good paying job. In fact, most of them are stay at home moms or they they are paying child support.\n\nNow idk about you; but I think the finite level of fun one could have in their 20s due to limited funds and leads to that kind of life comes no where near the fun one could have in their mid 30s-60s (if staying in good shape) if they invested in their future. Life really isn’t all that short. It’s just that people confuse “life” with the good things in life. Yes, the list of those moments tend to be short for most of us. That list usually tends to get longer for those who make sacrifices though.\n\nI feel that the belief of “life being too short” needs to be phased out. The only people that can live that way and face little to no repercussions are the wealthy and even then it’s not sustainable. Life expectancy isn’t what it used to be decades ago.

Your tax rate now will most likely be lower than in the future. In a Roth, you pay income tax now, not when you withdraw in retirement. Caveat, this is money you shouldn’t touch until you retire as there are usually large penalties if you do beforehand. \n\nNow what to invest, my advice is to only invest in something you understand. An S&P 500 ETF is one of the easiest things to understand and is a fine investment to start with. When it comes to ETFs, beware of fees. Those can really hurt your earnings. Vanguard ETFs have some of the lowest fees generally. If you want to go individual stocks, companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google are solid choices. These are now referred to as FAANG stocks now. \n\nAnother great safe choice is a group called dividend aristocrats. These are stocks have pay a dividend and have continuously raised their dividend at least 25 years. Make sure you set up your account to automatically reinvest dividends and this a phenomenal way to grow value over 30 years. \n\nCalls like Tesla are super hard to make.

Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. \n\nTry to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week because you wanted to go out and have a good steak. \n\nIf you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself. They won't teach you in school. You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. \n\nMy grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and thought me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20 years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still novice and could just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. \n\nGo to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. \n\nNone of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  \n\nIn 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. \n\nDont believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you cant verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?\n\nBroad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. \n\nI like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. \n\nPick a solid broker, read above. \n\nGet a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. Dont be afraid to gamble a little every now and then but dont make a WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. \n\nStart with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (dont forget that inflation will take cash out if your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balance act])\n\nAfter you have set yourself up try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs what I'm in. Go global too. \n\nAfter you have a little bank roll sell some options. Dont do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. If you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. \n\nIf you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10 or 20 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns, and ride the waves. \n\nLook at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.\n\nDon't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. \n\nDONT PANIC. \nDont trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis and stick to your plan.\n\n\nLearn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. \n\nTime in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. \n\nAnyway, at the end of the day... just do something. \n\nAnd buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.\n\n*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned.

What kind of accounts would you put the money in?\n2. What investments would you purchase in those accounts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1) What kind of accounts would you put the money in?**\n\nIf you work and your employer offers a 401k match, invest the minimum needed to get the maximum employer match.  For your 401k, I am not going to address that in question 2, but most plans offer \"target date\" funds which will be very similar to what I will suggest for you.  The only reason not to use one is if the expense ratio is high (above 0.1%) or you want to balance the allocations with holdings in other accounts, but that is beyond the scope of this post.\n\nAfter maxing out your match, you need to decide what else you want to do with your money.  That could mean saving more for retirement (Roth IRA for someone your age), saving for a house or college (taxable account or educational account), build an emergency fund (savings account).  To determine this, you need to look at your own financial stability, how much you can rely on your parents, and your own goals.  I highly recommend the [Personal Finance Flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gdlu9/how_to_prioritize_spending_your_money_a_flowchart/) for determining where to put your money.  It isn't perfect and it can't account for every situation or the case where are not financially independent, but it's very valuable.\n\nFor question two, I'll assume you have opened up either a (Roth) IRA, an educational account (i.e. 529), or a taxable investment account.\n\n**2) What investments would you purchase in those accounts?  (I.E. The Good Stuff)**\n\nI've been pleasantly surprised to see ETFs mentioned a lot in this thread, which is really good.  So how do you know which ones to get?  We will be constructing our portfolio from 3 (or 4) assets: Bonds, the US Total Stock Market, the International Stock Market, and (potentiallly) REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts).  REITs will only be chosen if you are investing in an IRA or a Roth IRA, as they are very tax inefficient.  If you are investing in a taxable account, we will skip REITs.\n\nFor someone your age, we are going to be super aggressive and say that you want to hold no bonds.  You may want to have up to 10% bonds.  Anywhere from 0 to 10% of the portfolio would not be a bad decision.\n\n**Asset Allocation**\n\nHere is one example of an asset allocation, you can find others at [the Bogleheads wiki](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation).\n\nNote: Percentages may appear peculiar because they were chosen to maintain the ratios between the funds, whether or not you have REITs and bonds.  The exact percentage isn't important.\n\nFor this example, when there are bonds, I have always done a 95 equity to 5 bond ratio, though I expect for an 18 year old, the zero bond route would be more appealing and a 10% bond ratio is more common.  No reason and no mathematics behind this decision, it's just what I used when I started typing this post.  Within equities, I have always used a 50% US, 40% International, 10% REIT, when REITs are included and a 5 US to 4 International ratio when REITs are not included.  You would not be wrong to do +/- 5% on any of these numbers, though I would not have REITs be more than 10% of your total portfolio, regardless of age.\n\n||**Tax Advantaged Account, No Bonds**|**Tax Advantaged Account, With Bonds**|**Taxable Account, No Bonds**|**Taxable Account, With Bonds**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|US Total Stock Market|50%|47.5%|55.556%|52.78%|\n|International Stocks|40%|38%|44.444%|42.22%|\n|REITs|10%|9.5%|||\n|Bonds||5%||5%|\n\n**Fund Selection**\n\nFund selection is going to depend on your broker.  You can't go wrong with any of Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or Vanguard.  All three are pretty competitive with fees (and low expense ratios are very important in index investing).  I'm sure there are other brokers that are great, I just have less knowledge of their fund offerings.\n\nSo you can buy either ETFs or Index Mutual Funds.  Technically, the ETFs might be slightly more tax efficient, but the benefit is usually minuscule at best.  With some brokerages it is easier to automatically invest with mutual funds, if that is the case, going with an index mutual fund is fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Fidelity (ETF / Mutual Fund)|Vanguard (ETF / Mutual Fund)|Schwab (ETF / Mutual Fund)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|US Total Stock Market|ITOT / FSKAX|VTI / VTSAX|SCHB / SWTSX|\n|International Total Market|IXUS / FTIHX|VXUS / VTIAX|SCHF / SWISX|\n|REIT|USRT (among others) / FSRNX|VNQ / VGSLX|SCHH / (Unsure)|\n|Total Bond Market|AGG / FXNAX|BND / VBTLX|SCHZ / SWAGX|\n\nNote: There are many different REIT indices and the funds selected are NOT equivalent as they track different indices.\n\nHopefully this helps, let me know if you have any questions.  If anyone finds any errors, please let me know so I can correct them.  If anyone disagrees, I'd love to hear why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: 55% US Total Stock Market, 45% International Total Stock Market, choose fund based on your broker based on the above table.  Put money in consistently, the same amount every two weeks (or whatever works for you). Don't ever sell. When the market goes down, avoid the urge the sell. You can't time the bottom.

Cell phones were all the rage. From like 2000-2005 is the period of time when cell phones began to transition from a novelty, useful device to what they are today. This is when cell phones became ‘cool’ before 2000 they were used mostly for emergencies, to tell people where you’re at or that you’re on your way. Shit, I still remember my parent’s bag phone that plugged into the car lighter and I don’t think we ever used it, probably because there wasn’t any cell service anywhere.\n\nIn retrospect, it’s so obvious the iPhone was truly a game changer and life would never be the same after it was unveiled.

Because the Total Addressable Market is absolutely massive. Even after several states have legalized weed, researchers estimate US Black Market weed sales to be around $400B while legal sales account for only $60B, so the growth runway is absolutely MASSIVE. With about 2/3’s of the country in support of legalization, it’s only a matter of time until weed is legal at the federal level. Sure, legal weed may not grab 100% of the black market but think of it this way, do people still buy black market booze? The answer is either no or it’s such a clearly trivial percentage of purchases that’s it’s almost not worth tracking. This is what will time will do to the black market for weed. Black market weed is cheaper now, because it’s surplus weed flowing from legal states to the streets. As the market becomes more regulated, the black market will begin to dry up and legal sales will take off. The main risk here is consolidation. Will a couple MSO’s team up to strangle the market? Will a cigarette company swoop in? Will the market become over saturated?

This also explains the capping at $700 (options writers), and the walk-down to $690 at the end of the day - a 30k increase in put options is unusual too, but the 60k call contracts added - at substantial expense.\n\nOther notes:\n\n- Most of the increase in open interest is in the $700-$800 range - should $700 break on a bullish move, the delta hedging effect could be substantial.\n- Likewise, on the bearish side, most of the new puts purchased were in the $600-$700 range - close to the money - increasing expense & the delta hedging effects as well.\n- There's a 2:1 bullish bias in newly added contracts, and overall bias is now bullish by 50k more call contracts than put contracts.\n- Key clusters are around $700, $750 and $800 - these should define options flow related lines of resistance in the spot price.\n- Looking out one more week, there's a huge cluster of ~100,000 put contracts expiring on 04/16 (next week) in the $600-$800 range, which were all in the money recently, when TSLA dipped below $600.\n- This cluster's average strike is $710, so just a little more than a week ago it had a value of ~$100 intrinsic and ~$30 extrinsic - representing a **~1.3 billion dollars short position**. During the dip to $550 this short position likely had a value of around ~3 billion dollars.\n- A possibly large entity consciously built that short position and decided to keep it open over the Q1 deliveries report - expecting it to be a miss or a 'meh' report - not a \"hit it out of the ballpark\" home-run.\n- There's a chance that the recent concentration of FUD and yesterday's capping and fight about $700 was by large hedge funds trying to salvage the value of this enormous short position. Should $700 break decisively, the value of the short position drops below $100m - a staggering trading loss.\n- Even more curiously, yesterday the owners of the in-the-money $700+ portion of these put clusters **increased** their short bet, from 51.2k contracts to 52.6k contracts. I.e. they didn't take profits, even increased exposure - in a hope to recover the value of those puts.\n\nI.e. I think, should current price levels hold, the 4/16 put position might be the single biggest TSLA shorting loss via options I've seen in a single event. It's enormous - and entirely hidden from the short interest report due to a temporary artifact in delta-hedging behavior of large options market makers.\n\nI.e. this could be a huge shorting loss not present in the shorting losses estimates of S3 Partners, frequently cited by the business media.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "BTW., I think most of the 04/16 puts are probably hopeless, unless they can score some genuinely negative Tesla news.\n\nThe Q1 earnings report is going to be remarkable, and I'd expect a rise into it from bullish investors, and from a de-risking from sane shorts who don't want to hold a short position across a Tesla financial report that might break several records.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Remindme! 10 days", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 10 days on [**2021-04-16 13:18:04 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-04-16%2013:18:04%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/ml40wg/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_april_06_2021/gtke8h3/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fteslainvestorsclub%2Fcomments%2Fml40wg%2Ftsla_daily_investor_discussion_april_06_2021%2Fgtke8h3%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-04-16%2013%3A18%3A04%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20ml40wg)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "> The increase in options positions during yesterday's trading is remarkable:\n\nI sold ten of those Puts.

This would of course be next level (5) for FSD but would also be a distinct advantage in the AI realm. \n\nI’ve been enjoying a book called “super intelligence” which makes a reasonable point about first movers advantage in the AI space. Once a group (company or government) creates the first super intelligence there is a only a small probability that other groups are able to catch up. This is due in part to the exponential feed back loop an AI can improve itself, once it reaches a threshold point. This is a over simplification but the takeaway is, first with a super intelligence AI wins. \n\nWhat if Dojo is a super intelligences AI that can be used for other applications other than improving FSD?

They probably learned to hate Elon, because in the early years he was clueless about the auto industry & they saw through that.\n\nNow that Tesla caught up and is reforming the auto industry from the inside, using Silicon Valley tech & first principles engineering, RealTesla has lost much of their auto expertise (they are largely clueless about EVs or self-driving), and only the Tesla hate remained.\n\nIf you want good contrarian takes on Tesla, you have to seek out not the haters and bears, but the \"bearish investors\".

It's part of a legal discussion back and forth about what type of data needs to be made public to agencies about disengagements and such and the actual context is much more about legal wordings than reality.  Discussion about how that means \"Tesla isn't even planning on it being level 5\" is some braindead shit, similar to when RealTesla was up in arms about out of context \"would be out of business in a few weeks\" shit from an email 2 years ago.\n\nThe problem with RealTesla is, it's been a cesspool of misinformation and bad takes with an occasional sprinkling of almost valuable negative information.  That negative information is usually one off anecdotes about poor service somewhere or another that doesn't have any bearing on the stock price or really anything.  The majority of posters there fall into a hater camp (which I mean, really?  Kind of sad to spend that much identity energy on disliking a company lol).

{"title": "Tried to post ASO DD this weekend but it got autofiltered. So, here it is if you are still interested!", "selftext": "By now you have likely seen some $ASO talk. There are some other really good DD posts in WSB that cover different aspects of the stock. This post will break down why I'm bullish AF on ASO and why I believe that it could hit $60 or higher in the next few weeks. Before GME gang jumps down my throat, don't worry, I am still hodling. There are other stocks to make money on while that one consolidates and trades sideways for a little while. \n \n&nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**: ASO looks a lot like RKT did in February when there was a massive spike. Short interest is high (may be over 45%) on a stock that has been steadily rising since its IPO in late 2020. They beat earnings expectations in a similar fashion to RKT (1.09 actual vs. 0.62 expected EPS = 76% beat). Undervalued stock that is primed for a squeeze means bears r fuk. \n \n&nbsp;\n  \nOk, for those of you apes with a few wrinkles, I will explain why you might be able to take your wife and her boyfriend and her parents to Red Lobster and order more than water and biscuits. \n \n&nbsp;\n \n**2021 is the year of the squeezes and the SI% on this bad boy is HIGH**\n \n&nbsp;\n \nHedgies have shorted a wide swath of the market, with a focus on retailers. Makes sense, right? The pandemic has hit a lot of retailers hard, forcing a lot of store closures. Academy Sports & Outdoors has been able to thrive through the pandemic for a few reasons: \n \n1. Their stores are mainly located in southern states whose COVID restrictions are far more lax than their northern counterparts. \n  \n2. Guns and ammo. There has been a massive pullback on offering guns and ammo by big box retailers due to a shift in public sentiment due to mass shootings. However, thanks to the pandemic and civil unrest, more people are buying guns than ever. ASO has not curtailed their gun and ammo offerings, which are a recession-proof sales channel right next to liquor.  \n \n&nbsp;\n\n \nRetailers have been shorted massively (see GME) with the shorts expecting that retail will die with the rise of online sales. Maybe they are right in the long term, but for now, people are still going to stores. Here in GA, you wouldn't know there is a pandemic if people weren't wearing masks. The mall parking lots are full. The short interest on ASO was 45.21% on 3/15 according to TD Ameritrade (compare that to 36.6% on RKT in late February). The stock is up 147% since its IPO in October 2020 without any significant dips, which tells us one thing: none of the shorts are in the money.  I first took interest in ASO about a month ago when I saw them at the top of the shorted list. Investing in stocks in January that had high short interest was quite lucrative for me, so I've been trying to continue investing in shorted stocks that appear to have a bright future. Because bears r fuk and squeezes are fun. \n   \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's look at the short interest over time for ASO: \n \n&nbsp;\n\n|Report Date|Total Shares Sold Short|Dollar Volume Sold Short|Change from Previous Report|Percentage of Float Shorted|Days to Cover|Price on Report Date|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|3/15/2021|12,510,000 shares|$308.37 million|+0.8%|39.4%|9.1|$24.65|\n|2/26/2021|12,410,000 shares|$305.04 million|-3.0%|39.1%|8.3|$24.58|\n|2/12/2021|12,790,000 shares|$306.45 million|+24.5%|41.2%|8.9|$23.96|\n|1/29/2021|10,270,000 shares|$262.50 million|+10.1%|33.1%|7.3|$25.56|\n|1/15/2021|9,330,000 shares|$196.58 million|No Change|44.8%|8.4|$21.07|\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe can see that short interest has increased over time up to a high here of 39.4% on 3/15. TD Ameritrade says 45.21% and we know that short interest is not clear cut, so there is some variance on that  SI%. \n \n&nbsp;\n\nMost shares were shorted between $21 - $25 and were still shorted on 3/15. What has happened to the price since 3/15? It was driven down to a low of $23.19. As seen on [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/yrwzR6R.jpg). This means that most of the shorts did not become profitable during the biggest drop since the latest SI% report and likely did not cover. There was another seemingly artificial drop on 3/31 down to $24.50 where some shorts may have covered which [I have put a little box around](https://imgur.com/lss7ppj). Why do I say that it is an artificial drop? Because the company absolutely crushed earnings expectations and was trending up the day earnings were released. That premarket drop was clearly induced and may have been an opportunity for some of the shorts to cover with a small profit, but certainly not the majority. I believe SI% is still very high and there is a **squeeze to be squoze**. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSome may attribute the drop in price on 3/31 to the **IPO lockup expiration**. If you don't know what lockup expiration means, \n&nbsp;\n\n\n>When a company goes public through a traditional IPO, it usually sets a lock-up period of 90 to 180 days during which insiders can't sell their shares. That rule isn't mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission -- it's a self-imposed one that prevents big investors from flooding the market with shares.\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the lockup  expired and insiders can sell their shares, but why would they? They just beat earnings by a lot and should expect their shares to continue to increase in value. Also, there were further restrictions placed on insider sales that a commenter on another ASO DD thread made. I'm assuming it was valid research. Hopefully they can add it to this post because I don't have the full details, but essentially there is a still limit on how much the insiders can sell at one time as to no shift the price too much and that limit is 1% of the company's value. With a $2.64B market cap right now, that is $26.4M, or about 900,000 shares being the limit on insider sales in a day.  It is entirely possible that the lockup expiry was the cause of the 3/31 drop, which would mean that it was not artificial and it was not a plan by shorts to cover. Meaning SI% is still in the 35-45% range. \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**THE STOCK IS UNDERVALUED**\n\n&nbsp;\n \n[According to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-academy-sports-outdoors-inc-052048433.html) the consensus price target is $32. [Simply Wall St](https://imgur.com/Y95DfqK) has a fair value estimate of $49.99. Prior to the company beating EPS expectations by 76%, I was seeing discounted cash flow values of $35/share. [GuruFocus has DCF value at $36.29](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/ASO/dcf). The price has been depressed. Watching the charts for the last month, there have been pretty massive sell walls in the $25 - $29 range, with order books full of those suspicious algorithm share #'s keeping the price from going up to its fair value naturally. With price targets that have not been fully updated for the earnings beat and increasing volume being between $28 - $35, it seems that the worst case scenario is buying in at $30 will net about a 10% gain or loss. That is attractive to boomers, which could increase retail volume.  \n \n&nbsp;\n\nDid someone say **volume**? Average volume was around 1.5M. Since earnings were released there has been an increase in volume: \n \n&nbsp;\n\n|Date|Volume|Over/(Under) Average|\n--:|:--|:--|\n|26-Mar| 775,000| (725,000)|\n|29-Mar| 2,390,000| 890,000|\n|Earnings Release 30-Mar| 4,880,000| 3,380,000|\n|Lockup Expiry 31-Mar| 5,040,000| 3,540,000|\n|1-Apr| 3,610,000| 2,110,000|\n\n&nbsp;\n \nPrice at open on the day of earnings release was $24.98. It closed on 4/1 at $29.01 for a 16% increase and kept going up after hours another $1 or another 4%. \n \n&nbsp;\n\nLet's see that in a table: \n\n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings||\n:--|--:|--:|--:|:--|\n|26-Mar|23.92|24.59|||\n|29-Mar|24.98|24.23|-3.0%||\n|30-Mar|24.59|26.74|7.0%||\n|31-Mar|25.79|27.05|8.3%||\n|1-Apr|27.08|29.01|16.1%||\n|After Hours|29.01|30.00|20.1%||\n\n&nbsp;\n \nNow, I said previously that this stock reminds me of RKT. Strong earnings release for a heavily shorted stock and a delayed increase in price due to massive resistance. That resistance was overcome for RKT from massive buying volume as retail jumped on board. Volume really picked up and the RKT flew. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n|Date|Open|Close|% Change since earnings|\n--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|25-Feb|20.33|19.9|-2.1%|\n|26-Feb|23.33|21.85|7.5%|\n|1-Mar|23|24.3|19.5%|\n|2-Mar|27.34|41.6|104.6%|\n \n&nbsp;\n \nI'm not saying that ASO will have a 100% gain this week, but if you look at what's been happening in 2021 (RKT, AMC, Discovery?), when a stock gets attention and momentum with a high SI%, it is entirely possible to jump 100% in a day. ASO seems similar to RKT in terms of having low float, high short interest, consistently beating earnings, and absolute price. The price point is really important here. Most jabronis can afford to buy into a $30 stock. \n  \n&nbsp;\n\n**Indicators** \n \nI don't put a ton of faith in traditional indicators because we live in the Upside Down now, but MACD and RSI both look very promising, with MACD [on the 3-month chart](https://imgur.com/unGgIgg) \"crossing over\" into positive territory on 3/30. This is a bullish sign for the chart watchers. RSI on the daily, weekly, and monthly charts is over 70. Also a bullish indicator (to me). \n\n&nbsp;\n \n**Conclusion** \n&nbsp;\n\nFor me, personally, I think ASO is primed to have a big day this week if it volume gets high enough. By big day I mean spiking to anywhere from $45 - $60 before settling back into $35 - $40 and then slowly growing. If it goes any higher than $60 I will definitely be throwing a pizza party for my local store. \n \n&nbsp;\n \n\nThanks for reading my post. Good luck out there. [Enjoy this video of my dog eating a banana](https://v.redd.it/p23legq9zuo61/DASH_96.mp4). Dogs are apes too.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPositions = 223 shares. [38 calls at various strikes expirations](https://imgur.com/nC2pwHm). I sold 5 calls on Friday just to know what it feels like to close a position with a gain.\n \n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: Guess I'll update this since this post was written on Saturday. Looks like initial predictions were right. The stock has gone up. Calls are printing. Still think that the steady gains could attract enough volume that it could trigger a spike. Gamma or short squeeze, take your pick. We are very close to $35 at the time of this post, where there are a lot of calls held that could trigger a Gamma squeeze up to $45 now since they released new $45 calls last night. This stock keeps \"gapping up\", which makes me think that we aren't seeing the actual buy volume during market hours. It was the #3 stock talked about in the weekend threads and we aren't seeing the volume to match. My theory on that is that people are buying on RH and WB and other brokerages that don't settle buys until after hours. Hoping to gap up again to $35 Wednesday morning and then it should get really fun. Interestingly, there were $621k in $35 puts purchased between 10:00am and 10:05EST today, 4/6. Maybe a way to depress the price further. Looks like this stock is another battleground between shorts and bulls with massive balls with kangaroos just dancing around enjoying their bouncing.\n\n \n&nbsp;\n\nEdit #2: What a dip! Guess the large volume of puts purchased this morning had the intended effect. Why else would you buy so many already ITM puts? Volume doesn't explain the dip, so I'm guessing that it was the puts. Lot of upward resistance at $30. Currently seeing a but wall of 11,500 shares at $30.

They also have insane footprint a and market penetration; there's over 20 in houston area alone. So its very convenient to go to a store instead of ordering online, and it seems alot of people like to touch and feel the outdoors stuff before buying it", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that being able to touch and feel the products is important, but I think an omni-channel approach is something that complements that.  If all you have is the brick and mortar store, then when you go in, what you see is what you've got.  But with online and physical catalogs that let you browse their full range of offerings, you can find products they offer that might not have been in stock for you to see if you had just dropped in randomly.  And an online storefront lets you know what is in stock in what stores, so if there's something in particular you are interested in seeing in person, you don't waste a trip down to one of their stores to get a feel for the product only to find out it's not in stock.  And after you've visited and done your groping of their product lineup, you don't have to make a decision right then and there, you can go home, think it over, make comparisons with other products, and order something for pickup the next day.\n\nThis isn't the sort of thing you can create overnight-- it takes web development, robust inventory management, and a level of marketing knowhow that takes time to build.  But I think the companies that pull it off will be gaining market share as time goes on-- they'll be able to support leaner supply chains, target and retain customers better, collect data and use it to predict trends better.\n\nWith that said, if ASO's lackluster omni-channel effort were the only thing I was worried about, I'd still be fine with the stock.  Because the companies that are taking that approach are more expensive.  Dick's (DKS) is a good example, it's doing well with this stuff.  But it's got a forward-PE ratio of 15.  ASO has a forward-PE ratio of 10.  If I bought Dicks, I'd be paying 50% more per dollar of earnings.  Dick's would *have* to gain market share to justify that price.\n\nBut it's not just their weakness online, it's the debt and the downside risk of a trade war.  Dick's has a debt-equity ratio of 0.18.  ASO has a ratio of 1.45.  Not only do I think Dick's product line is better insulated against tariffs (though how much is debatable), it's balance sheet is good enough that it would survive a trade war.  I don't think ASO would survive a trade war, not as leveraged as they are.\n\nAnd if I didn't care about omni-channel, I still wouldn't go with ASO.

Out of their $4b in liabilities they paid off 660m.  Basically none of it was paying down debt-- most of it was just them paying off suppliers who had floated them goods for the upcoming holiday season.  And almost all of that came straight out of their cash reserves.  They had 870m cash in hand now they've got 150m.\n\nSecond, have you read the 2020 term loan facility?  It's not a full on variable rate loan like the 2015 facility was, but it's very close-- they have the choice of paying either LIBOR+5 (with a minimum of 0.75 for the LIBOR) OR the *highest* of 1) Fed Funds Rate + 0.5, Credit Suisse's \"prime rate,\" or the one-month LIBOR plus 1%, plus a margin of 4%.  So they're only guaranteed a fixed minimum rate if LIBOR stays under 0.75.\n\nThird-- and this is the real kick in the pants-- they're reducing their hedge against a rise in the interest rate.  Per their Q4 report:\n\n> We use interest rate swap agreements to hedge market risk relating to possible adverse changes in interest rates.\nAll interest rate swaps had been designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments on borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan Facility. On October 28, 2020, we determined that a portion of the underlying cash flows related to $100.0 million of swap notional principal amount was no longer probable of occurring over the remaining term of the interest rate swaps as a result of the Company's planned refinancing transactions (see Note 15). As a result, we reclassified approximately $1.3 million of losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCI\") to other (income) expense, net in our statements of income for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended October 31, 2020 related to the portion of the forecasted transaction no longer considered probable of occurring. We also de-designated a portion of our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges, leaving $250 million notional principal amount designated and $650 million undesignated. The remaining $4.0 million loss in AOCI as of October 31, 2020 related to the de-designated hedges will be amortized as an increase to interest expense over the original maturity of the de-designated swaps. The de-designated $650 million notional principal amount of fixed interest rate swaps will receive mark-to-market treatment prospectively, with changes in fair value recorded immediately to other (income) expense, net on the statements of income.\n\nYou see what they're saying?  \"We had a hedge against rate increases with a notional value of $1b, but we decided we didn't need it any more.  We're keeping $250m of that as a hedge, but we've freed up the other $750m, and this quarter we sold $100m of that $750m.  Any money we make or lose with these undesignated swaps we're going to call income.\"\n\nBut the 2020 loan facility offers an alternative fixed minimum rate only if LIBOR stays below 0.75.  If it goes above 0.75 then the rates become just as variable as the 2015 loan facility.  It's like if they had 100 lifeboats on their ship and they've just sold 10 of them and put another 65 up for sale.  But as soon as LIBOR goes above 0.75, the seas will become just as choppy as when they had 100 lifeboats.\n\nA LIBOR over 0.75 isn't a crazy thought, you roll the clock back just 1 year and LIBOR was over 0.75.  This is a risky strategy for a company that's reporting $4.3b of assets against $3.3b of liabilities, especially when $862m of their assets is goodwill and another $1.72b is other intangibles.\n\nEDIT:  Fixed some grammar.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Wow you clearly have no idea what you’re talking about nor do you know how to interpret financial statements.\n\nPer their Q4 earnings release, they had total liabilities of $3.2B at the end of the most recent fiscal year.

{"title": "Building off the post from yesterday, I built a dashboard that tracks congressmen’s returns from stock trading over time. You can use it to see who’s a fellow member of WSB and who’s actually making money.", "selftext": "[Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/investmentdata/comments/kj69oo/track_trading_by_us_senators/) the dashboard tracking trading by U.S. Senators.\n\n[Senate Stock trading vs. S&P 500](https://preview.redd.it/4tqxbg3gxkr61.png?width=1960&format=png&auto=webp&s=da597db3d306e5abf848080cec1726e6bce09730)\n\nA while back I did a little write-up on which politicians I actually think browse this sub, I’ll copy that below:\n\n**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**\n\nComstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.\n\nShe bought \\~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.\n\n**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***\n\nLowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.\n\n**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***\n\nThe Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.\n\n**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***\n\nPat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.\n\nInsider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.\n\nWSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.\n\n**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***\n\nMarshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.\n\nWhat Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.\n\n**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**\n\n***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***\n\nThe story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.\n\nOn July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.\n\nAlthough he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.\n\nSadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.\n\nAfter holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.", "id": "mlfhvd", "created_utc": 1617726231.0, "score": 2959, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "Me before reading this: \"representatives should not be allowed to own individual stocks as a measure to protect their constituents from potential corruption.\"\n\nMe after reading Sheldon Whitehouses' track record: \"representatives should not be allowed to own individual stocks for their own safety.\"", "score": 939, "replies": [{"body": "He liked the stock.

{"title": "BlackBerry: How the Patent Sale could transform BB", "selftext": "On March 30, BlackBerry has reported Q4 and FY21 results/call AH. At first the market didn't like it and on the next trading day the stock lost 10% (panic mode, loss porn and so on). However within the next 2 trading days BB has regained all its $ in a quick reversal. I'm here to tell you why.\n\nThis is a followup to [my OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/mhi3ev/blackberry_earningscall_were_actually_bullish/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) \n\n^(Quick note to the Mods: I believe my OP is about to bring new original content to the discussion and hopefully will be eligible to live its life as a post.)\n\n**Portfolio Patent Sale (big $$$)**\n\nQuick refresh: the stock fell because the revenue came below expectations but straightaway the company said it happened because they are currently negotiating the sale of a portion of their patents specifically related to ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** Consequently they had to voluntarily limit the monetisation of these patents during Q4.\n\nThe points I would like to investigate are: for how much $$ this sale could go, how likely this sale is to happen, who could be the buyer and when could it be completed?\n\n***First the money.*** CEO Chen during the call: *we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.* He also confirmed the yearly revenues for Licensing are around $250m. And that BB owns 38,000 patents. I will simply use these numbers with a DCF to estimate what that \"big number\" could be. Before I proceed I would like to emphasise that CEO also said: *we believe that the completion of the transaction will be beneficial to our shareholders* (if it happens).\n\nAssuming a 10% discount rate and 7 years of revenue life, we have $250m current year, $227m next year, $207m (...) to $141m for the final year. For a total of **$1,339bn.** That's quite a pleasing big number but let's be careful nonetheless: we don't know the size of the portfolio being negotiated and the payment is expected to be initially a lump sum  + 7years of tail royalties. So they could tweak it a bit.\n\nWith a 15% discount rate we get **$1,196bn** and at 20% **$1,081bn.** Another way to look at it: if we consider that they would sell only 75% of that side business and we discount it at 10% we still get a number north of a billion $ (consistent with CEO comment: *it's a major portion of our portfolio*). So money wise should the sale indeed happen we are looking at an one time cash flow of $1bn to $1.3bn. Not too shabby for a $5bn market cap company with already $800m cash in its hands (yes they could have momentarily circa 40% cash to mkt cap ratio).\n\n***Is this really happening?*** There is a high probability it would maybe 80% but it's not cleared yet. To get to this conclusion I listened twice to the conf call to try to decipher the clues. Whenever CEO was talking about the amount he sounded as if that part was near completion (*will be a big number* and *the majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on*). Although he also stated that *the company has not yet reached a definitive binding agreement and negotiations are ongoing.*\n\nThe main hurdle might be the regulatory review of the transaction as the big boss mentioned that in the most conservative scenario: *we assume that negotiation and regulatory review continue for the first half* (of FY). A sentence that directly leads me to believe that the buyer could be a major company.\n\n***Big money buyer:*** if there is a lengthy regulatory review it might be because the potential purchaser could be in a position to infringe antitrust laws (NB: antitrust laws were created by Congress to preserve competition among businesses and prevent any one business from dominating a single industry and building a monopoly). \n\nSpeculations are ongoing that the buyer could be Facebook. It's honestly hard to say but that's the name with the higher odds at the moment. Just to recall BB sued FB in 2018, claiming the social media giant was using BlackBerry inventions in its messaging applications. Then they settled the dispute in January 2021 over patent royalties for terms that weren’t disclosed. You see the analogy here. By the way during the conf call this settlement was never mentioned and we still didn't see the financial repercussions in BB accountancy.\n\nThat said it could very well be someone else from North America, which leads us to the when.\n\n***The timing of the sale*** is honestly hard to guess but again let's refer to the CEO comment that in their most conservative scenario the discussions could continue during H1. Subjectively I tend to believe that it would happen sooner rather than later because 1. they are losing money by restricting their Licensing every day that goes by and 2. it was *the* major statement in their whole conference call. You can arguably think that you would release this kind of communication when negotiations are very advanced. If I had to bet I would say it's a matter of a few weeks obviously subject to the regulatory approval.\n\n**The Transformation**\n\nBy now unless if you've been living on Mars because that game rocket took you too far, you must know that BlackBerry is no longer an handset company. They excel at cybersecurity, they are deeply involved in the automotive industry including EV thanks to QNX and they are coming big hand in hand with Amazon to bring IVY to the world (October early release and Feb22 full product).\n\nIf and when they sell that side portfolio to a potentially big name you can expect all financial and traditional media to report the transaction and to emphasise the renewal, the rebirth of BlackBerry as an Internet of Things, Cybersecurity high-margins long-duration Tech company.\n\nIn terms of communication they have just started and they are about to splash the cash to continue on. John Chen is quite excited about it: *you will see us being more aggressive, in fact we ran an ad today Intelligent Security everywhere, an ad today. I just saw it on the New York Times and so we're just going to step-up in both people and spending and resources to go after the market and it is a huge, as you know very well, it is a huge market and no clear winner at this point.*\n\nHe later added that: *we have a reasonably large number of hires mostly in sales and marketing.*\n\n***IVY is not priced in at all:*** there is no other way to say it. At the current BB valuation investors are totally ignoring the potential of IVY, probably because they don't understand it. Let me go straight to the point.\n\n*BB and AWS said the new intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY, will compress the time to build, deploy and monetize in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple brands and models, making it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate development of apps and services.*\n\nThe goal is to establish IVY as a standard platform across the auto industry, as Apple and Google have done in mobile phones through their iOS and Android platforms. This way IVY could be the equivalent of the App Store but for all mobility platforms whether EV, autonomous driving EV, air drones, rockets (SpaceX already using QNX) etc. The end uses are potentially limitless and most of the current discussed applications are under NDAs. Once they start to pop out, the picture will get clearer and clearer.\n\nSimilarly to what Apple did back in the days, BB has started an IVY Fund with $50m in it + $100K AWS credit for new startups willing to develop a product on IVY. Let's also not forget that the deal was approved by Andy Jassy in December who later got upgraded from AWS big boss to Amazon CEO. We can reasonably imagine that he values IVY as a potential disruptor and Chen sees it as a *significant growth opportunity.* Initially thought to hit the market in 2023, the early release will be available as soon as October 2021 (again the market is sleeping on this advancement).\n\nOne quick word on the cybersecurity part of the business: BB and CRWD have roughly the same yearly revenue (I will leave it to the experts to discuss how comparable they are). One company has $5bn market cap and the other $44bn.\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\nIf the sale doesn't happen at all that's gonna look bad and hurt financially. Still according to the call, *full year licensing revenue will be in the region of $100 million* (if the sale fail) vs an usual $250m per year. As mentioned throughout that's because they are limiting the Licensing revenue while negotiating. Cybersecurity growth, QNX and IVY will still remain in play but more as mid and long term catalysts. They would still push for sales and marketing but the blue sky scenario obviously implies the receipt of a billion $ in cash in exchange of their accessory patents.\n\n*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*\n\n*Disclosure: long BB shares and June 20C and 15C (in that order).*\n\n**TLDR:** BB is selling their old business patents probably for more than $1bn to a big player in order to focus on their new business model - cybersecurity, IoT, QNX, IVY - and come back like what's up.", "id": "mliwqp", "created_utc": 1617735365.0, "score": 2250, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 328, "comments": [{"body": "My Bias has been confirmed.

It's pretty obvious IVY will work and more question of what degree. John Wall spoke at CITI and JPM Conferences in January and on April 1st on a conference call entitled *'How U.S. and Chineses corporations collaborate in growing autonomous vehicles*'. Here are some choice quotes (or paraphrases) he made during these:\n\n* *'The response from automanufacturers has been \"overwhelming\"'.*\n* *'These are sitting on a \"goldmine of data\" '.*\n* *\"We are seeing that the use cases are unending\".*\n* *\"Your imagination is the limit\".*\n\nJohn Wall is not a spinmaster and seems low key. He also underlined there's been lots of dialogue / exchanges with these (so he's not dreaming). \n\nOn **Valuation** \\- Yes there are quite a few known names that are used as comparables and many are valued at 10x BB even though they have similar or less revenue. The most often cited is solid but not ten times as solid and longer term not nearly as interesting, nor with potential of BB. Here is one interesting metric we can thank Bill Gates for. Almost to the day 10 years ago FB had a user base of 50 million and NO revenues. The average FB user, it seems, spends about 35 minutes per day on FB. For a 1.6% stake Bill Gates's MS invested $240 million into FB valuing FB at $15 billion (3 times the value of BB today). This also valued FB at $300 per user. QNX has a user base of over 175 million and growing at about 25 million per year. The average driver is in their car 90 mintes per day. If we ignored all of BB's current business or their potential, and looked only at IVY, BB is valued at close to $25 per user. John Wall previously calrified that IVY will work on the existing installed base of QNX. So much potential yet one does not pay for it at these levels. In fact one basically pays 1/10th some other names.

BB has stated that revenue from QNX is in range of '*high single digits to low double*' (pressumably $8-$12 range). And it's a one time. To focus on that is missing the point. It is ALL about the installed base.\n\nThe insatlled base is 175 million plus (considering it's been growing at approximately 25 million annually and we have not had an updated number in about a year, it is likely safe to assume the installed base is in the vicinity of 200 million).\n\nNote the language in the press release and this excerpt -\n\n\"*Volvo Group wanted to take a new approach to software. It wanted to find a single supplier for the operating system (OS) and hypervisor to meet the needs of the ‘whole truck’, capable of supporting safety certification to the highest levels.*\n\n*Following an in-depth proof of concept, Volvo Group decided to build its ‘Volvo Dynamic Software Platform’ (VDSP) on the* [*QNX® OS for Safety*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-os-for-safety) *and the* [*QNX® Hypervisor for Safety*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-os-for-safety)*, both* [*certified to ISO 26262:2018 ASIL D*](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications)*.*\n\n*The engagement includes a new flexible use of the QNX OS and Hypervisor for the whole vehicle, which gives developers and architects the freedom to design the best possible system as the company looks at the requirements of the next 15 years, including the future support of autonomous driving and electrification.\"*\n\nThis is very much the language Blackberry uses when discussing IVY and its appeal to OEMs and automanufacturers.\n\nIt is unlikely that a less than serious conversation has already taken place with Scania and Volvo and many others about IVY, it's appeal, and use benifits (keep in mind John Wall stated the \"*use cases are unending*\" and the response has been \"*overwhelming*\").\n\nOnce one gets their heads around an installed base and recurring fees from that base, only then can one appreciate the kind of upside that awaits. Too many are just not seeing it. As you state \"IVY is not priced in at all\". In fact you get all this and a whole other package of business at a massive discount to other known names.\n\nHere is another metric that applies to installed bases.\n\n**NFLX** has an installed base of 200 million users worlwide (sort of the same as BB). Of course the business is different but the revenue model maybe not so different to IVY. The average NFLX user coughs over $150 US per annum. Could IVY extract $150 US per annum from its installed base ? How about $100 US or even $5O US ? I would suggest any of these numbers is more than realistic, in particular if we consider what consumers pay for cell phone service, or ISP, or cable TV, etc. The point is there will be some number and any number will be significant to IVY.\n\nAnyone can disagree but this is precisely what BB and AWS have in mind (even ultra conservative Chen mentioned '*recurring revenue*s').\n\nNFLX has a market cap of $250 billion or 50X BB's $5 billion. And this ignores anything else BB is doing.\n\nPaying 10% of what the comps trade at for this kind of upside is crazy rare but I guess many just don't see it yet (including most analysts who continue to miss the boat with their cautious sitting on the fence outlooks).\n\nIs it  possible that Watsa (with $1 billion on the line and an average share price cost of about $14 USD), or Chen (who is already very wealthy and came out of retirement and allocated so far 7 years of his life to this), or the people at AWS (who have already been involved with IVY for two years) don't have this in mind and haven't been executing in that direction ?\n\nExponential upside is putting it mildly.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "With his strong ties to business in China he was the guy to do this job.

Ended up holding these bad boys ayyy. That's what happened when you don't follow the golden rule;\n\nIF ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SCREENSHOT, ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SELL. Had unloaded and took that -5% loss up there\\^, I wouldn't 1. hold this massive fucking bag, and 2. rebuy the 4/16 calls to give me some time even if I believe in the bounce back up / gap up. Hell I could've yolo'd 230k worth with a cost of $3.\n\nMy numbers plugged into Options Profit Calculator: [http://opcalc.com/sYl](http://opcalc.com/sYl)I suggest everyone learn how to use this so you can gauge the next day. Plug in your calls/and IV to get the most accurate numbers.\n\nPoint your finger at April 8 column and go down to 690. If TSLA is at $690, my position is up 6.84% and so on. If TSLA would've done a end of day rally to say 685-690 or past the high of day to 695, then my position would be 50-98% up..

After seeing March 8th dip to $560~ and buying in, I saw the resistance levels at $690, $700, $710 (Tradingview charts will show it but it's quite obvious even by observation) \n\nEverytime TSLA made a move for $690/700/710, it would immediately get crushed down to lower support levels $680, $660, even $600 before bouncing back up.

Regardless, this is a little catalyst to get this little retard train chugging ALONG with SPY highs, QQQs rallying, April bullish month, run up to ERs. \n\nAll of these factors are BULLISH for TSLA. Fuck what people say about PEs and valuations and all that nonsense. Literally doesn't matter here- the argument of comparing TSLA with other car companies is invalid.

I accumulated puts for the lowest price possible in 5-10 contract increments. I anticipated TSLA is gonna flush/sell off towards end of day along with SPY/QQQs. At that point I would close my puts and pick up cheap $700 weeklies to anticipate a gap up the next day.\n\nBut throughout the day, on every dip to support $680, 685, I load up on $700 calls- and unload when it gets close to $695-700, aiming for 10-15%. I'm not holding in hopes of a big runner. If it runs, and I miss out, oh well. If I do chase, I chase small.

{"title": "$SPY - The Coked Out Bull Who Outran Inflation - S&P 500 Trade Thesis", "selftext": "What’s poppin’ fellas, I’ve got a trade thesis for y’all which I need picked apart. Although I spent a great deal of time discussing it with the greatest minds Twitter and Discord had to offer, I still can’t shake the feeling that this trade is pretty fuckin’ stupid at face value, so bare with me.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was a little drunk on Easter, and had an epiphany :\n\n- SPY 100 - 200 took roughly 14 years.\n- SPY 200 - 300 took 3.5 years.\n- SPY 300 - 400 took a little over a year.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith the rate things are going, SPY 400 - 500 is looking like it’s set to happen in under a year, maybe even faster. Hell, in our current investing environment, I would be shocked to see SPY lower than 500 by the end of the year. Asset inflation is running rampant which is indirectly driving up the value of equities, we’re printing fuckloads of money with no end in sight, and money is flowing into the markets out the ass as investing becomes increasingly mainstream. I know a lot of people will doubt me for these things, but I’m thoroughly convinced that this is what modern day inflation looks like.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n/u/DustyBowls had an awesome writeup on this which can be found below :\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The stock market is not a bubble. This is inflation. This is what modern inflation looks like. The federal government - Dem or Repub matters little, as Bush, Obama, Trump and now Biden all did this - they hide the true inflation by excluding things from the inflation basket such as real estate. All the easy money, low interest rates and supermassive spending by Bernanke, Yellen, now JPow.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**This is why the upper middle class and to a much greater extent the rich can profit at all times - they're so heavily into stocks and other financial devices plus housing and land that the massive devaluation of the dollar and the explosion in inflation is not their problem - they just rise with the tide. Regular middle class and worker bees (the 99.6%) are seeing massive pay cuts in the form of inflation. You got a decent job making high five / low six figures and want to buy a place? Even in mid-size midwestern towns, the housing market is so hot that you just got priced out of the market. And you'll never get back into because this is not a bubble that will burst - this is inflation. The Federal government is going to print even more money and devalue the dollar so that its debt / GDP doesn't get too fuked. The rich don't care. The well-positioned middle class (a minority of the middle class) don't care. Everyone else should. You got a $600 or $1400 or $2500 stimulus check? Cool story the housing price and your rent just went up 10% compound for the next five years and you're far worse off than you were.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**It ain't a bubble it's a rising sea. If you aren't in a yacht or at least a skipper, you're fukin’ drowning man. Your flat salary, your savings account, your hourly wage - you just got a LOT poorer.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBy riding the coattails of the rich, we can look to become a lot less poor in the process. We’ve identified the trend, and now *we* can also rise with the tide. Ultimately, our end goal seems to be SPY 500. The price action over the past year reinforces this, as we’ve gone from $264 to $405 (over a 55% increase) during that time period. Hell, even the past decade of data supports us. **Every year from 2008 onwards, bar 2015 and 2018 have easily netted a 20% return.** If we see an increase that’s even remotely as good, we will be well ITM by the time our year is up. SPY 01/21/2022 500Cs are trading for $1.00. Dirt fuckin cheap. For more risk averse traders, we can go with a SPY 450C 01/21/2022 for $5.00 instead. Regardless of the chosen strikes, if these plays hit, it’s at minimum a 10 bagger, likely more.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPersonally, I’m going to look for an entry around SPY 400 since we’ve left some gnarly gaps, but I’m thoroughly convinced that we may continue to rip. We need less than a 20% increase in 10 months, which is well within reach. We’re in a fucked up investing landscape, which is heavily skewed towards exponential growth. All we need to do is take the leap of faith, and reap the reward in a couple of months. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, **I can’t think of a good bear thesis, so this is where I turn to y’all**. I’m not worried about the “bubble” popping, as I don’t think we’re in a bubble; This entire system is just a byproduct of the insane amounts of money we have printed. In my eyes, the only thing that can stop SPY 500 from happening is us getting nuked by North Korea, a new strain of super aids wiping out a good chunk of civilization, or aliens coming down and fucking some shit up. If any of those things happen however, we’ve got bigger problems than our SPY 500Cs expiring OTM. If anyone has a decent bear thesis, please lay it on me. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**__TLDR__**: Fuckloads of printed money combined with asset inflation will be a pretty nuts combo for the markets. Bears r fuk.

{"title": "MYOV: Deep Value and Possible Buy Out", "selftext": "Okay smooth brains, gonna come at you with some DD on a true value play (for those of you that can read). With a great entry as of writing.\n\nThe good stuff:\n\n1 great drug, 3 potential use cases.\nThe basics of any biotech pharma company are the drugs and what they do. Simply put, relugolix (orgovyx) was approved by the FDA in December for the treatment of Prostate Cancer. The drug was so much better than its competition, they were granted priority review by the FDA. How much better were they? Well the competition was a once a month shot that had a high mortality rate due to cardiovascular issues. Since this approval, they have signed a 4.3b deal with pfizer for half the drug, and are now commercializing this together at a rapid pace.\n\nThe other use cases are endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids have a pdufa (fda approval deadline) of June 1st and after meeting and exceeding all 3 phases of clinicals, are highly likely to pass (these are big positive catalysts).\n\nThis is also accompanied by 2 additional publications in the New England medical journal. One of the most renowned journals in the world.\n\nNow that we’ve covered the basics in Lehman’s terms, let’s move on to the strategic outlay.\n\n\nIn january of 2021, Pfizer and Myovant announced a strategic partnership for men’s prostate cancer worth up to 4.3b for myovant. It also resulted in heavy upfront cash payments, and royalties in the double digits to myovant moving forward. After this announcement, the stock shot up to $31 a share.\n\nBefore this, another pharma giant, sumitomo, decided it was going to expand its pharmaceuticals pipeline. To do so it started an American subsidiary named sumitovant and purchased Roivants share of 5 different companies. To date, 4/5 of the companies are now private with urovant recently getting bought out by sumitovant at 100% premium. \n\nMyovant is the crown jewel of the vants. If you go to sumitovants website, they claim ownership over myovant already (53.5% makes them a majority holder).\n\nIt’s my theory that myovant is not far behind and will likely be purchased before June 1st PDUFA. At this time, the stock has been seeing a pretty large short interest increase and is trading below the PPS it had in November before approval for relugolix and before the Pfizer deal. \n\nWithout a buyout, this is a steal of a value play.\n\nMyovant has roughly 40% of their market cap in cash. Pfizer valued just the prostate cancer application at 8.4b. Their current market cap is ~1.8b and they are trading at $18.93 a share.\n\nI plan to ride this rocket to Valhalla 🚀 🚀 🚀 \n\nTLDR:\nCompany has successful drug applications that are new standards of care, a massive deal with Pfizer, wildly undervalued, and a potential buyout candidate. \n\n🚀 Positions: ~20k shares, 326 calls dated from 4/16 all the way to 1/22\n\nQuick about me: I’ve been on WSB (mostly lurking) since mid 2020 and trading for years.
