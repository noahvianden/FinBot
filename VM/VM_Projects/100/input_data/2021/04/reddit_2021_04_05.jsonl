If you buy back a CC at $1 in the example, then presumably you will be looking to sell another call, the question would be which call are you going to sell? You might buy back the call and then wait for the underlying to go back up in value.\n\nLet's take a stock at $50, you sell a CC at strike $55 for $2 (a pretty good return). Your effective buy price is now $48. So long as the underlying stays above $48 it's a profitable position. Let's say the underlying does drop to $47, you are now at a $1/share loss ($48-$47). If, at that time, the call is then worth $1, and you buy it back, your effective buy price will increase by $1. Now your effective buy price is now $49 instead of $48. The underlying is still at $47, with an effective buy price of $49, you are at a $2/share loss ($49-$47). Buying back the call did not necessarily help you here. But, if the stock does go back to $50, and you can sell the call again, for $2, the you'll have an effective buy price that is reduce by another $2.

Many traders hold on to gains to see them disappear the next day. If a trade hits 50%, then instead of waiting for higher profit, a person can and often should sell to realize a profit (any profit), as a negative swing the next day could wipe out all gains and then some. Because these are options, every day you hold an option you have purchased, it loses value, so the chance of getting those gains back gets smaller and smaller.

And that is what I am interested in. And yes, I want to open that door and explore more sophisticated trades. \n\n\"so you're going to have to narrow things down a bit more\"\nOk, let me give a specific example. I have a target company I understand, I am bullish long term, I have access to analyst reports putting that stock at buy/hold (I will not invest money exclusively on my DD). I have an alert on spot IV going above a moving average IV. I observe the stock taking a negative return, yet nothing changed in the business, or the news. I use this opportunity to enter a \"relatively\" safe short term put credit spread (15-30 days). I look at the ratio max gain/max loss, the BEP compared to spot and recent stock price history. I make a judgement call and place my order. I then monitor the situation and act accordingly. I can close early if something changes in my views, take my profits if the stock price moves in the right directly faster than anticipated, or let it go closer and closer to expiration if I real really comfortable. \n\nI could, instead, setup a diagonal spread (push the long leg to a further maturity).

(So, I pick a stock offering weeklies)\n\nBut then, I hit different problems. \n1- Some combinations become debit spreads. The potential still look interesting, but if the stock has a large positive return, I end up in a losing region. Since I am bullish on the stock, this seems counter productive.\n2- Some combinations seems to have the max profits at a much lower asset price (max profit here being defined as the top of the triangular payoff line when looking at potential option prices at the maturity of the first leg). Again, being bullish, this seems to go against my views on the stock.\n3- When I do find a combination I think I am fine with, the margin req. is much higher compared to the regular credit spread. Making me wonder if this is really worth it. It seems to barely offer more profit potential, while locking more money out. Making the % gain lower.\n\nThe top results from google search on diagonal spreads are not going deep enough in the topic to my liking.

This is a diagonal strategy I have used myself and also has some good explainers on the web, so you should be able to find plenty of good reference material.\n\nYou can make the short be weekly, or what I prefer to do is set the back (long) leg out 45 days and roll the front short leg every 15 days. That gets me three rolls, including into a vertical spread on the last roll. Brining the long leg into 45 days reduces the overall cost of the spread, and thus reduces risk. You could also do 90 days with 30 day rolls on a stock that does not offer weeklies, but I haven't tried that myself.\n\n> 1- Some combinations become debit spreads. The potential still look interesting, but if the stock has a large positive return, I end up in a losing region. Since I am bullish on the stock, this seems counter productive.\n\nThey aren't really debit spreads, it just means you can't find a roll for a credit. That definitely happens. No strategy has a 100% win rate. Instead of worrying about the occasional loss on a roll, think of the net average gain/loss on the spread for its entire lifetime, or the fleet of such trades over the course of a year. The average return is more important than the return of any one spread or roll.\n\n> 3- When I do find a combination I think I am fine with, the margin req. is much higher compared to the regular credit spread.\n\nThat can happen, yes. If you broker doesn't realize you are doing a diagonal, it just looks like a naked short. Are you opening the trade as a diagonal, or legging in with two separate orders?\n\n> 2- Some combinations seems to have the max profits at a much lower asset price (max profit here being defined as the top of the triangular payoff line when looking at potential option prices at the maturity of the first leg).

They concluded that ETFs can increase daily volatility of the underlying stock by 3.4%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>For example, during the flash crash in 2010, ETFs made up many of the securities that saw large price declines and also experienced temporary mispricing of greater than 10% from the underlying index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032615/how-etf-arbitrage-works.asp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese opportunities are much less common and less profitable (unless scaled well).", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Exactly my reasoning to buy last Thursday.

The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.\n\nThe deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.\n\nIt follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.\n\nThe standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.\n\n\"The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,\" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. \"The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.\"\n\nThe headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)", "id": "mk9aak", "created_utc": 1617584936.0, "score": 6047, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 495, "comments": [{"body": "Report: “this is spam.”\n\nI don’t know what you’re smoking son but I would like some", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Old news, could’ve sworn I saw the same post a few days ago.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "It was a top post in Investing 4 days ago", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This news broke almost a month ago and apparently was posted yesterday.

{"title": "Janet Yellen to call for global minimum tax rate", "selftext": "Janet Yellen will use her first major address as Treasury secretary to argue for a global minimum corporate tax rate, Axios has learned, as she makes the case for President Biden’s plan to raise U.S. corporate taxes to fund his $2 trillion+ infrastructure plan.\n\nWhy it matters: Convincing other countries to impose a global minimum tax would reduce the likelihood of companies relocating offshore, as Biden seeks to increase the corporate rate from 21% to 28%.\n\n“Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids,” Yellen will say today in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, according to an excerpt of her prepared remarks obtained by Axios.\n\"It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government.\"\n\"We are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom.\"\nThe big picture: President Trump lowered the U.S. rate from 35% to 21%, arguing that U.S. companies were at a global disadvantage and were being incentivized to relocate offshore.\n\nThe average corporate rate in the G7 is 24%, with some nine countries recently lowering their corporate rate, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative tax group.\nBiden’s plan would also raise the international minimum rate for foreign profits from U.S. companies from 10.5% to 21%, which would still be lower than the 28% domestic corporate rate.\nDriving the news: Biden has tapped five Cabinet secretaries to explain — and sell — his plan to the American public, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\nYellen’s task is to make the international case. Her speech also is designed to set the tone for the annual spring International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington, which will begin virtually this week.\nBetween the lines: Biden has been relying on Yellen to convince the business community and reassure Wall Street that his $2 trillion+ infrastructure proposal, on top of his $1.9 trillion stimulus package, won’t lead to inflation.\n\nNow he’s deploying her to convince international finance ministers and central bankers that the world’s biggest economies need to act in concert on corporate rates to avoid a race to the bottom.\nGo deeper: Yellen will also challenge the world’s economic powers to focus on climate change and on ways to improve vaccine access for the world’s poorest countries.\n\nShe will call for $650 billion in new “Special Drawing Rights” — essentially lines of credit at the IMF that can help developing countries access more U.S. dollars.\nThe Trump administration was skeptical of new SDR allocations and many congressional Republicans are still opposed.\nThe bottom line: By trying to convince other countries to impose a global minimum tax, Yellen is acknowledging the risks to the American economy if it acts alone in raising corporate rates.\n\n“Together we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity,” she will say.\n\nSource  : https://www.axios.com/janet-yellen-global-minimum-tax-rate-51c7395b-e46a-4a5c-b18b-bdcf5d8bd352.html", "id": "mki9or", "created_utc": 1617621456.0, "score": 286, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 234, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 385, "replies": [{"body": "The EU can’t even implement this even if the French don’t stop banging on about how ireland under cuts everyone.", "score": 107, "replies": [{"body": "The only way to approach it is to make the location of the corporations headquarters moot.\n\nIt doesn't matter.

And so that's what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that's around that,\" he said.\n\nApple has long been expected to get into the auto business with its own vehicle or selling its technology to other car makers, and has made a number of moves indicating it planned to do so. Helping bolster its engineering ranks, the company acquired autonomous vehicle startup Drive.ai in 2019.\n\nAn autonomous vehicle could position the company against Tesla, which is rolling out its own self-driving features. In 2018, Apple hired back Doug Field, then Tesla's senior vice president of engineering, to presumably work on self-driving cars. Apple has also brought in several other former Tesla employees, including former Tesla vice president of engineering Michael Schwekutsch, now senior director of engineering for the Special Projects Group at Apple.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk had even said last year that he once tried to start talks to sell the company to Apple, but Cook declined to take a meeting.\n\n\"You know, I've never spoken to Elon, although I have great admiration and respect for the company he's built. I think Tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the EV space. So I have great appreciation for them,\" Cook told Swisher.\n\nMost recently, CNBC reported that Apple was close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia.

{"title": "The Uranium Bull Thesis Is Playing Out To Perfection. A $500bn Market Is Emerging. A Multi-Year Run For The Equities Is Inevitable!", "selftext": "With so many exciting developments of late, I wanted to share my .02 on the current state of the uranium market, focusing a bit on SWU, which I am very fond of haha. As always, I look forward to any feedback.  \n\nAs am sure all are aware, we have seen a 15% jump in spot over last 2 weeks. While the increase was in large part to non-producing mines physical purchasing , I noticed a number of discussions on Reddit and various Discord servers, StockTwits also, seeming to suggest that this uptick in spot U was indicative of where we are in the current fuel cycle.\n\nExperienced investors in this sector will tell you however that this couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nRather, a more powerful indicator as to where we are in the cycle is by looking at the SWU enrichment price.\n\nBased in large part on SWU projections, many expert investors are forecasting a $500bn market. For perspective, during the last cycle, the market peaked at \\~$150bn.\n\n***So... what is SWU?***\n\nFor those very new to uranium investing, a very quick overview might be helpful. Also, for those more familiar than I am, I appreciate the feedback.\n\nSWU (short for Separative Work Unit) is a measure for the cost of enrichment. Generally speaking, when SWU prices are low, utilities benefit by purchasing excess enrichment inventory at cheap prices using intermediaries (i.e., carry trades).\n\nConversely, a rise in SWU signifies that the demand for enrichment is growing. As excess inventories are utilized by end users, the utilities (no longer aided by the secondary market) instead turn to the uranium producers to purchase future contracts at much higher prices. It follows logically that higher enrichment prices force the utilities to retreat back into the fuel cycle; from conversion (UF6) and even fabricated fuel purchasing, to the beginning (i.e. spot U308), which in turn drives those spot prices up.\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps most importantly, higher SWU prices on future contracts are essential in incentivizing the mines to come back online. McArthur and Cigar Lake, for example, need at least the $40's, and for Paladin, likely in the $50s in order to justify their operational costs.\n\nTherefore, **SWU is arguably the best indicator of where we are in the fuel cycle**.\n\nEven when there are false starts/spikes in the market (which we’ve seen in the past couple years), SWU price is consistent.\n\n***What is the current SWU price?***\n\nSWU bottomed out at $\\~34 in August 2018 after so much excess accumulated in the years following Fukushima.\n\nSince hitting that low, SWU has been on a relative straight line upwards, currently estimated at \\~$54. This steady growth over the past 2.5 years is one of, if not the most, compelling reason investors are so confident of a long bull market to come in this sector.\n\n***So... how the \\*\\*\\*\\* is SWU forecasting a $500bn market?!***\n\nOf course, there are a number of things we can look at that are driving this thing. It's becoming almost a daily occurrence now to see catalysts emerging (i.e., breaking news this week on EU Green energy qualifications, the White House endorsing nuclear in as part of the clean energy standard).\n\nHowever, more-so than anything SWU is at the core of the bull thesis, which is, that ***decarbonization of the electrical grid around the world is not possible without nuclear power*** (Duke Energy Corp. just said the same yesterday...)\n\nAs SWU prices continue to rise, **it is inevitable that equity prices will follow**. Denison is a fun example. \n\nEven now , I'm still amazed at how many people claiming to have thousands of shares of certain uranium producers are surprised when they hear that Denison isn't actually producing any uranium. When utilities start executing term contracts with other producers at SWU in the $60s, $70s, $80s, and beyond, those mines will turn the lights back on. The fact that they just bought spot above market is a pretty powerful indication of where things are headed as far as volume on these long term contracts. It won't be long before Denison’s prices start to rise. The same idea goes with Cominak, Ranger, etc.\n\nMoreover, what happens when we've exhausted Cigar Lake and Kazatomprom? Or McArthur River? \n\nIt isn't just that we have a rising demand, we need new projects coming into existence now in order to avoid a huge deficit in supply between 2025-2030. The investment opportunities on these projects are extremely exciting. \n\n***And why $500bn***? \n\nFrankly, I think $500bn is conservative, though something in this vicinity I have seen as the consensus among many experts. Market cap for publicly traded uranium is at 125bn right now, and this is only the very beginning. Ultimately, there are new players in the game with a ton of liquidity (i.e., hedge funds), and they are looking for value. Taking $URNM as one example, the AUM just months ago when it IPO'd was a few million. Now AUM is $175mm. We also cannot ignore what is happening in China. It is a huge growth story there. There is also a SPEC frenzy.  \n\nBut again, looking at the big picture, more-so than anything else, I keep going back to SWU. For me, it is the most powerful predictor of the multi-year bull run to come. And while there will always be doubtful retail who, to their credit, have rightfully called false starts over the last couple years, you cannot deny what 2.5 years of rising SWU enrichment prices means for where we are in the current cycle.\n\nAgain, I would be very interested to hear where folks agree/disagree.

Capital costs are the problem-- unless the technology being proposed is offering lower capital costs per kWh, I am not interested in it.\n\nSimilarly, I think most new nuclear ideas that promise to lower the volume of nuclear waste produced per kWh are missing the plot.  Not only is nuclear waste cheap and safe to store, but it's not volume that matters, it's the quantity of long-lived radionuclides.  Unless somewhere in the process we are reducing the number of these daughter atoms, then it doesn't matter how much volume the nuclear waste takes up-- so splitting 10% of the atoms in five fuel rods vs splitting half the atoms in one fuel rod doesn't matter, you still get the same number of split atoms.\n\nMolten salt reactors are cool, I always love geeking out over new reactor designs.  BUT, as lame as it sounds, the safety and economics of an incremental, evolutionary approach are almost always going to be superior to a radically different design.  We have a lot of experience designing, building, and operating light water reactors.  From that experience we have developed a thorough understanding of what materials survive the longest, what components will need to be replaced when, and how to operate the reactors safely and with minimal downtime.  By switching to a new design, in particular one that uses a completely different coolant and moderator, we are sacrificing a lot of our expensively-obtained knowledge.\n\nI'm not a materials science guy.  In my undergraduate thesis I used a research project that was testing alloys for a molten-lead fast reactor, but I was looking at it from a sort of meta perspective. \n I took a class called Materials in Nuclear Engineering in grad school but I probably understood less than half of it.

It's not even just that natural gas is so much cheaper, it's also that nuclear is not a dispatchable power source, plus it's very difficult for a utility to finance the construction of a nuclear power plant simply because the capital outlay for a plant is so large relative to your typical utility's market cap.\n\nI think coal is on it's way out, (at least in the U.S, in China it's a different story), and I think it's mostly natural gas that will be replacing it.\n\nI think hydro is a slam-dunk winner anywhere you've got the resource.  I think onshore wind has gotten to that point where it's a threat to natural gas on a cost-basis if the resource is good enough, and solar in a place with good insolation isn't far behind either.   But the lack of dispatchability of these sources will become a major issue, and I don't think there's an energy storage solution on the horizon that is quite good enough to put that problem aside.\n\nI think the big winner is natural gas.  There's still so much of it in the ground that we can reach with fracking now, I think it will be quite a while before natural gas prices rise enough to start curtailing it as a power source.  It's cheap and dispatchable, and until a price gets put on carbon there's basically nothing stopping it from just wiping the floor with everyone else.

Pick whatever tests your college accepts that you think you've got the best chance at-- worst case scenario you're out a hundred bucks or so, best cast it's the cheapest college credit you'll ever buy.  I rolled in with 13 5's and a 4, so I automatically got about 2 and a half semesters worth of credit, and that gave me a lot of cushion to take risks.\n\nNext, the big secret to college is that no matter how many classes you take, they still charge you the same amount.  So just fucking take them all, rob the bastards blind.  Normally your advisors would stop you, but here's the thing-- if you double major (which in my day was a double degree program), you get two advisors.  So tell advisor A that advisor B signed off on it, and you tell advisor B that advisor A signed off on it, and since mom and dad never talk to each other they'll let you joyride in the lambo.\n\nSo I took like 8 classes a semester, had a couple where I took 9/10.  I couldn't do it freshman year (you cant have two advisors your first year so the exploit doesn't work, plus MIT has all sorts of rules on your freshman year because it has a special grading system they don't want you to game), but if you stick to 8 or so classes a semester after that, at that rate you'll be done with all the coursework for four degrees by the end of senior fall.  And once you've banged out that, you're ready to start shopping for sugar daddies.  The U.S. government is the biggest sugar daddy of them all-- if you smile and put on pretty clothes and tell them you'll suck their dick / work in one of their labs, they'll pay for the rest of your college.  You don't *need* to actually go work in a government lab as a career, they're such thirsty fucks they'll start paying for your tuition just for a summer internship and the off chance you decide to stay.\n\nThen you're on easy street.  You've got the next year and a half paid for by Uncle Sam, and the only work left for you to do is your thesis.  So fuck around.  You can meet a lot of cool people and do a lot of cool things in college, and it's sooooo much better when you don't have PSETS and tests to worry about.  I don't know how it is at other colleges, but at MIT there is an absolutely crazy amount of stuff to do outside of classes, you should not miss out on it.\n\nI actually double dipped on fucking around.  I spent a year and a half fucking around, then I applied for the 4th degree, deferred enrollment, took a job overseas, then came back when the economic crisis fucked me over, enrolled in the fourth degree program, and fucked around for another couple years with no work to do except writing a second thesis.\n\nI don't recommend fucking around for 3 and a half years even if Uncle Sam is paying for it all.  That's just too much fucking around to do in your life, even during an economic downturn.  But I got lucky and it worked out for me in the end-- in my third year of being useless I met my girlfriend (she was a freshman, but I added 7 to my age and divided by 2 and she was within range) and now it's ten years later and we've got a nice place and 4 cats and do bougie shit together.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "> Next, the big secret to college is that no matter how many classes you take, they still charge you the same amount.\n\n\nNot in Canada :(", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "There are a fuck ton of nuclear reactors coming online in China and India.

{"title": "The Bull-Case for Lordstown Motors Corporation (RIDE) – Never Bet Against America", "selftext": "Disclosure: All of the following represents my own opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, [LMC](https://lordstownmotors.com/) was [attacked](https://www.businessinsider.com/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-short-seller-hindenburg-report-earnings-2021-3) by short-seller, Hindenburg Research. By now, we all know short-sellers bend the rules and attack volatile stocks so they can make a profit. Ultimately, their goal is to induce Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) especially towards retail investors like us. For this reason, it is critical to do extensive DD before you ever believe a short-report.\n\nThink about all of the shorts that lost billions on Tesla last year. People like Cathie Wood, who actually took a deep dive into Tesla’s value proposition and learned the use-cases for their vehicles & technology, are now swimming in money. It’s important to remember that there are 2 sides to every story, especially when a short-seller has a vested interested in a stock price going down.\n\nAnd yes, Hindenburg was the short-seller that helped bring Nikola down from their sky-high valuation last year and exposed them for fraud. However, LMC is *much different* than Nikola. So, in this post, I’m going to do 2 things:\n\n1. Break down some of the many inaccuracies in Hindenburg’s “research report” against LMC.\n2. Show you why RIDE stock currently presents an excellent opportunity for both short-term & long-term growth.\n\nOkay, let’s get started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**First and foremost, two key people in Ohio recently stepped up to defend LMC from Hindenburg’s allegations.**\n\nPer Senator *Michael Rulli*, “(LMC) is way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article has never been in that plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”\n\nU.S. Rep. *Tim Ryan*, who is considering a U.S. Senate run in 2022, didn’t mince words about the short-seller report. *He called it “bull-\\*\\*\\*\\*.”*\n\n“I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for people to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (LMC) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”\n\nTim Ryan is spot on. Hindenburg’s report was a bunch of BS filled with fluff to make LMC appear weak in the public eye.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now, onto an overview of LMC:**\n\nGM invested in LMC back in 2019 in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/). They are working towards mass production this September with their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance).  [LMC now has over 500 employees with plans to be at 1,500 by production this September](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio). They believe that when the facility is at full capacity in 3-5 years, they will be able to produce 600,000 vehicles a year, due to the simplicity of their state-of-the-art [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Enter Short-Seller Hindenburg Research, who first announced they took a short position in RIDE stock last month, and then slandered them in the media just to make a profit:**\n\nI will now break down the main components of Hindenburg’s “research report.” Let’s jump right in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC is 3-4 years away from production**\n\nHindenburg claims that they spoke to some “undisclosed former employees” who told them that LMC is way behind on beta production and won’t be able to actually produce anything until 2024 or 2025. Hindenburg didn’t even request to take a tour of LMC’s facility to back-up their claims.\n\nWell, at the end of last week, LMC proved this wrong by [revealing their first betas](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas). This shows that they are very close to mass-production; these betas are coming off the production line and [being welded by robots](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20). These betas are essentially 97% of the finished vehicle, and will be [used for crash, engineering and validation testing](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020). Betas will also be given to initial customers for feedback. LMC’s Endurance already has a 5-Star crash test rating via software crash simulation. Plus, contrary to Hindenburg’s report, LMC confirmed that production is still on target for September of this year.\n\nThe betas are going to be a huge catalyst for the stock going forward, and they were just publicly revealed at the end of last week. Now, LMC plans to produce one beta every day for the next 2 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hindenburg makes claims that a LMC development mule that caught fire in January was the “first ever test-drive”**\n\nWell, if the first ever test drive was in January, why is there video evidence of test drives as early as [October](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1321504690362818567?s=20) and [November](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1327013275821891585?s=20) of last year? Clearly, this vehicle has been on the road for well over 7 months now. Also, the development mule that caught fire [had already been addressed a couple of months ago by LMC](https://www.wfmj.com/story/43303425/lordstown-motors-comments-on-endurance-prototype-fire) prior to Hindenburg’s report.\n\nUltimately, that development mule was not built on the assembly line and it was not using the actual batteries that their truck will utilize. It caught on fire as a result of human error, which will not be the case going forward since they are at beta phase with robots are welding the trucks instead of humans.\n\nTo address the fire / battery issue, [LMC announced they will now use “Tesla” batteries from LG Chem](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors'%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.). Oh, and what do you know, [LG Chem is partnering with GM to build batteries right next to LMC’s facility](https://www.todaysmotorvehicles.com/article/gm-lg-lordstown-ultium-cells-hiring/).\n\nBtw - that’s Marcus Lemonis (CEO of Camping World) driving the truck in the November video I linked above. For those of you who follow Marcus, you understand that he knows a successful business when he sees one. I think it says a lot that he decided to pursue a [long-term partnership with LMC](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx).\n\nPlans for the 1st ever all-electric RV are being released this summer by LMC in conjunction with Camping World. As a reminder, the [North American RV market is valued at \\~ $27 billion](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-recreational-vehicle-market), and the growth has actually accelerated due to the pandemic. Enormous opportunity here for both LMC and Camping World with the world’s first ever all-electric RV.\n\nThis claim by Hindenburg about January being “the first ever test-drive” is clearly false.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hindenburg makes claims that LMC’s 100,000 pre-orders are largely fictitious / SEC also “inquires” about pre-orders**\n\nFirst and foremost, the SEC opens thousands of “inquiries” each year. This is not an investigation, even though all of the click-bait articles going around right now would make you think it was. These sites literally make money based on clicks, which is why the media has also blown the story out of proportion – just to get increased viewership. That’s the sad reality of the world we live in.\n\nThis is currently a voluntary reveal of information and documents from LMC to the SEC, and they are fully cooperating. This type of thing has happened to Tesla countless times, and many other start-ups as well. I will include a brief example in the comments below on how Wall Street capitalizes from FUD when the SEC gets involved.\n\nAdditionally, regarding the pre-orders, go look at basically ANY EV company. They all utilize *non-binding pre-orders*. [LMC has made this clear from day 1](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/lordstown-motors-releases-business-updates-remains-on-track-to-begin-production-of-the-lordstown-endurance-in-the-fall-of-2021) – all pre-orders are non-binding letters of intent (LOI). LMC is a start-up, so they hired consultants to travel around the country and show off the Endurance prototype and generate pre-orders to assess demand. This is much more cost-efficient for a young company rather than hiring hundreds of salespeople in-house.\n\nHindenburg points out some of the LOI are from very small companies that aren’t likely to fill all of the pre-orders that they’ve put on paper – and they specifically call out a small company called E Squared Energy. However, the [E Squared CEO came to the defense of LMC](https://www.cfo.com/capital-markets/2021/03/lordstown-motors-responds-to-short-seller/#:~:text=The%20Hindenburg%20report%20also%20said%20Lordstown%20Motors%20allegedly,Energy%2C%20came%20to%20the%20defense%20of%20Lordstown%20Motors.) after Hindenburg’s report and confirmed he still plans to fill all 14,000 orders over a 3-year period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What Hindenburg failed to understand during their “research”**\n\nLordstown is targeting fleets: fleets don’t always buy directly from auto manufacturers. They frequently buy from intermediaries and service partners. Most commonly, these intermediaries and service partners are small/medium sized companies, and it’s critical to develop relationships with these types of partners early and often.\n\nDeveloping these relationships is exactly what LMC is doing, as they recently announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a fleet provider that manages \\~ 2 million vehicles. An analyst commented that [this agreement alone would generate over 12,000 orders](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/can-lordstown-motors-overcome-the-credibility-hurdle-analyst-weighs-in-2021-03-18).\n\nSure, not all 100,000 of the current pre-orders will come to fruition for LMC, but demand isn’t the issue here. LMC is putting out a [simple and economical vehicle for fleets](https://chargedevs.com/features/retooling-a-shuttered-factory-to-build-electric-trucks-qa-with-lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns/). What do fleet managers care about? Cost and efficiency.\n\nLMC’s all-electric *Endurance* truck comes in at a $45,000 price point, and the simplicity of the vehicle will lead to less maintenance and a lower total cost of ownership than any options currently available to fleets. This is a no brainer.\n\nLMC firmly believes their demand is robust, and they have already said they are going to sell way more than they can even produce the first two years. All of the talk from the recent Infrastructure bill/proposal sure helps LMC’s future prospects as well. They also have stated that they have interest from the gov/military for the federal fleet, and they [received a GSA listing to be able to sell to those entities](https://www.fleetforward.com/10135588/lordstown-motors-gains-gsa-listing).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**And lastly, Hindenburg makes claims that CEO Steve Burns is a con-man**\n\nI decided to do some deep digging on this. Was there a chance he was trying to pump up the stock price in the short-term by over-exaggerating orders so he could dump off his shares for profit like the Nikola founder did?\n\nWhat I found by digging deep through [LMC’s form 10-K](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/10-k/0001558370-21-003449) was that, this is not the case. Burns doesn’t really have incentive to pump-up the stock in the short-term with the pre-order announcements. This is because, per page 33 of the 10-K, “any shares of Class A common stock held by Stephen S. Burns will be locked-up until October 23, 2021, and 50% of such shares will continue to be locked up until October 23, 2022.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why is this finding significant?**\n\nWell, this means that Burns can’t sell a single share until AT LEAST October 23 of this year. In fact, I think this creates a HUGE incentive for him to hit their September production target.\n\nThink about everything the Lordstown community has been through last few years, and now a short-seller comes out with a bunch of inaccurate claims to slander LMC’s reputation in the media just to turn a profit.\n\nI would be willing to bet that LMC now has a huge chip on their shoulder to continue to prove all of the doubters and short-sellers wrong. LMC made significant progress in refuting Hindenburg’s claims by having betas coming off the assembly line at the end of last week. Actions speak louder than words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nHindenburg made several inaccurate accusations in their report, and as a result, I view $RIDE as one of the best buying opportunities that I have ever seen in my 5+ years of investing. I will be watching this stock very closely in the next week or so, and I will look to increase my position substantially if this touches $10.\n\nSure, there are risks. But, even with minor setbacks, LMC has shown they are very close to mass-production. They will soon have the first all-electric *full-size* pick-up truck for fleets. These things will sell like hot cakes once they begin production.\n\nI’m not directly comparing LMC to Rivian; but, think about it like this: Rivian’s expected IPO valuation is $50B this year. RIDE currently has a $1.6B market cap. So, If LMC is able to achieve even half ($25B) of Rivian’s market cap in the next couple of years, RIDE stock would be worth over $160 per share. The growth opportunity and technical upside here is too big to ignore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n[Lordstown Motors is going to change the automotive industry for decades to come](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1331299805147123713?s=20) – literally an American underdog story.

He was new to the market, and he was worried he was going to lose all of his money on this investment.

Workhorse did most of the R&D work for the pick up . . . then decided they wanted to focus on the delivery vehicles they are producing and the drone addition.  So Lordstown went in with a huge lead over being a \"start up\".\n\nSo then you look at the competition.\n\nFirst you have Tesla and the Cyber Truck -- only people I know who want one of those are what I call \"yuppies\" that just want one to drive around on paved roads and try to look good (I say try because there is no looking good in one of those things).  You won't have anyone who regularly needs to haul anything of substance in the bed of the truck.\n\nNext you have Rivan and their pick up.  More like Lordstown in a traditional pick up.  But  judge just ruled that Tesla can continue the lawsuit against them and a few former Tesla employee's for trade secrets that were given to Rivan by the Former Tesla Employee's.  Ends two ways -- A) Rivian has to pay Tesla a large sum of money or royalties on every vehicle sold (more likely). B) Rivan has to scratch everything they acquired illegally and start a complete redesign (less likely).\n\nThen you have Canoo -- I don't even know what to call that \"pick up\".  Ugliest one of the bunch.

RIDE can target fleets all they want, but your truck has to actually be produced and worthwhile. As to the $45K price target, well I can make a truck with a $25K price target, but if I never produce it, who cares.\n7. The San Felipe race should be interesting.
