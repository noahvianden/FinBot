Developed by Abe Cohen in the mid-1950s, the Bullish Percent Index was originally applied to NYSE stocks. Cohen was the first editor of ChartCraft, which later became Investors Intelligence. Because a stock is either on a P&F Buy or Sell Signal, there is no ambiguity when it comes to P&F charts. This makes BPI a straightforward indicator with clearly defined signals. The Bullish Percent Index (BPI) fluctuates between 0% and 100%. Indices with over 2000 stocks, such as the NYSE, are highly unlikely to reach 0% or 100%. In its most basic form, the Bullish Percent Index favors the bulls when above 50% and the bears when below 50%.

As I Grew Older and got into High School I started taking financing classes investment 101 and similar things. Now I'm not trying to make this posttake a hard turn but I have always had this feeling since I can remember almost as if not that I could read your mind cuz I clearly cannot, BUT I do have extremely heightened intuition as if I knew what you were about to say before spoke or that events or things that happened to myself or others around me.. It could be about the most random person/thing id have a feeling in my chest and stomach that's is too overpowering to ignore its almost like a warning system long before not saying im \"special\"  but STOCKS ... Middle low class here my dad growing up saves every dime and is private about it 900 sq ft 3bd home the usual nothing fancy there have been three stocks that I have always had this pressing feeling about 3 stocks so far and the feeling is always immediate but needs to be followed up by research I'll read the name of a stock in certain sector and just off the sector an the name I get an instinctive feeling that is very strong so ill really dive into some research and history.. And EVERY SINGLE stock ive picked has had massive returns (not bragging or saying I have an advantage or hey listen to me by any means only explaining my experiences and how they feel) as a sophomore in high school I had all the tech stocks it was 08 that was obvious Amazon Google I had 3M I'm in my portfolio but the first stock I had this feeling with was a company called Seattle genetics(SGEN) it was a extremely small company 8 to $9 a share most thought they seemed like real nobodies invested in 08 my dad invested at the company at the time of me telling him this and still to this day will not tell me how much he's made off of it shares sit at 156.58 as of writing...  I got involved in a different type of insulin from pig fat...imo at SGEN still a buy but most are probably going to rate hold\n\nBut the big 1 and more recent one here is VXRT... when coronavirus hit Millions out of work I took to the stock markets with what little promotional money was available w. Sign up and what little funds I had left after feeding housing and putting clothes on my five children I had stayed away from the stock market for a long time as my life was so busy with kids and other things I just hadn't been actively investing only analyzing with coronavirus keeping everyone in the house on lockdown I stumbled upon Vaxart a company specializing leading the industry in vaccines in tablet form... and I thought they won't be the first but they might be the best... They are in a stage 3 trial, and recently had a press release shut down any negative fake narratives about efficacy in May last year i bought a few shares. NOT NEAR enough..kicking myself now it rose from 2.25- now just below $9 ...headed to 14 I think is generally agreeable without an approved covid tablet bexause they are the closest ones to an effective norovirua vax... That makes it a safe investment for the long OR short haul if they hit the covid tablet, it'll soar like you wouldnt beleieve I FEEEL as if its an almost guarantee double im kicking myself I didnt use my savings to invest in May as its up 170% and when the market opens Monday I'm spending all my capital...check it out do your own research and invest in things you believe in.

The cause and effect for me is still unclear.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "My understanding is that rates go up when the economy is in good shape.  That's because people are more confident in equities and they sell off bonds (less demand = lower prices = higher yields).\n\nWhen the economy is in bad shape, people go back to bonds because they're a safer alternative to stocks.  People don't trust in the stock market's ability to perform and flock to bonds to give them fixed income and a safer place to park their capital.  More demand for bonds = higher bond prices = lower yields.\n\nIf you don't understand the inverse correlation between bond price and yields, let me know.\n\n\\[EDIT: Short answer for why bond yields and prices are inversely correlated: say you have a bond that's worth $1000 face value and has a 2% yield. If demand for bonds has gone down and you must now sell that bond on the secondary market for, say, $800, then the yield has increased. Why? Because the buyer is paying less money for the same fixed return. Less money for the same fixed return = higher overall yield. And vice versa. I encourage everyone to look this up if you're not clear on it.\\]\n\nApart from that, I think the confusion is not only on your end.  Right now is a weird time.  Bond rates went up recently, and people were saying that was a *bad* sign for the markets.  That's because people were saying it was related to inflation.  Imagine: if inflation is going up, bonds with their current 1-2% yields (and negative real yields) are a horrible place to park your cash.  You're actually losing money already due to negative real yields, but if inflation spikes 1-3% you're actually losing even more.  Remember, bond yields are fixed so inflation eats into their nominal (fixed) yields.\n\nThe theory was that economic stimulus plus dovish Fed policy (low interest rates, easy money) made people fearful that inflation was just around the corner.  Thus, they began to sell off their bonds.  Remember, less demand for bonds = lower prices = higher yields.  If this were indeed the motivation for the bond sell-off, it's actually a *negative* indicator for the economy.  It means we expect inflation to come.  It means the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates to contain inflation (more expensive to borrow money).  It means that future earnings will be worth less (value of dollars in the future goes down).  This is why tech stocks sank at the same time bond yields went up: A. because they depend on easy capital (low interest rates) to expand their operations, and B. their valuation at the moment is highly linked to their future earnings.\n\nHowever, Jay Powell and the Fed came out and said any inflation would just be transitory, and the market seemed to believe it.  The bond sell-off was contained.    Furthermore, analysts were saying, like I said in the first half of my comment, that rising bond yields is actually positive for the economy.\n\nSo basically the fears about inflation got buried and we're back to a \"normal\" scenario where rising bond yields are seen as a positive sign for the markets.\n\nI'm not sure why bond yields went down today, but a quick Google search said that higher yields have attracted some investors (including overseas investors) back in.\n\nI'm new to this but it was good for me to make sure I understand it and try to explain it.

I think the EV market is pretty saturated at the moment, personally, due to the hype around it. I'd put some of the big EV companies (TSLA being the most obvious one) at least on a watch list in case they ever return to a more reasonable price.\n\nI did some personal DD on a series of car manufacturers about a month ago: Toyota ($147.93 at the time), Ford ($11.70), GM ($51.33), Honda ($27.67), Hyundai ($47.48), Volkswagen ($23.42), and Daimler/Mercedes ($20.03). Some key highlights that I found at the time:\n\n- The least leveraged companies in terms of liabilities vs book value were Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota. The worst was Ford by far, followed by GM.\n\n- In terms of price vs assets, Hyundai (P/B < 0.4) and Honda (P/B < 0.6) were selling at considerable discounts. Volkswagen was also selling at a nice valuation **at the time**, but that opportunity has very much vanished since its public EV play. \n\n- PEG ratios are pretty mediocre/bad across the board the last 3 years; generally speaking, these auto makers have had decreasing profits. \n\n- Still, most of these auto makers (except Ford) logged solid Q4 calendar profits, often the best calendar Q4 in last 3 years, suggesting that people may be spending more money on cars/parts/etc. coming out of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nGiven what's been going on with EVs and autos the last few years (at least the ones I looked at), I can see two potential plays here:\n\n1. Bet on consumer discretionary spending as the pandemic falls back, wherein gas-OK people replace old junkers with fresh wheels or fix up what they have, and\n\n2. Bet on whether a company will be the next one to come out and make some big EV announcement like Volkswagen did.\n\nEither way, most of the companies I looked at seem OK financially, but growth doesn't look good over the last few years. Calendar Q4 2020 looked promising for most of the companies, but it's impossible to know if that upward trend will continue.

The short of it is that small satellite constellations are going to take over the old earth centric space market and lower the cost of entry. This will expand the market for who buys the data and feed into more launches. For example, you can find gas leaks in pipe lines, get roofing dimensions without sending someone on top of your house, find greenhouse emission hot spots, monitor global supply chains, gather data on traffic patterns and shopping behavior, etc all  on demand with small satellite constellations. \n\nRocket Lab stands out here because that is who they cater to. Their main payload isn’t a large satellite, it is a small satellite. While it is more expensive than rideshare, getting the right orbit and the right schedule is important for many constellations that want to cover the whole earth with a high pass rate. They are currently the only service doing this and getting to space. They also are setting themselves out to be a one stop shop for satellites by providing high margin items like reaction wheels and star trackers that they can easily validate in any excess space on their own rockets. I wouldn’t be surprised if they start selling kits customers can use to fly their payloads with.\n\nTheir next rocket is aiming to accommodate more satellites at a time, just like what SpaceX is doing with Starlink. However, Rocket Lab has been leveraging the connections they built to gauge what the market needs. They aren’t shooting for Mars as their end goal, which allows them to cut inefficient excess that SpaceX has to build for. This brings the cost down and makes them more competitive. \n\nIt’s a challenging space to do business in, but their track record is pretty insane.

I.e. de-facto \"commercial money\" was converted to USD - which is only minimally inflationary. Note that the purpose of these Fed measures wasn't to manage inflation one way or another, but to address the financial & corporate debt crisis that was crashing US financial markets last March.\n  - The Covid disaster-relief deficit spending measures of last year and this year were all inflationary, but that's just a small percentage of the increase in the monetary base.\n  - Covid did cause a big drop in production, which was strongly dis-inflationary. The intentionally generated inflationary forces tried to counter this.\n- Yesterday Fed chairman Powell disclosed that a large majority of Fed members don't see rates rising until 2024. This disambiguated a small blip in the 'dot product' the Fed disclosed with their last rate decision, which suggested the chance for rate hikes in 2023 - which fueled the rate worries and the bond sell-off. Powell made it clear that this is not the result of their staff projections, but the result of a small minority of Fed governors.\n- Yesterday's \"Fed Beige Book\" showed moderate growth in the US only - again countering the inflationary-explosion narrative.\n\nI believe today's green macro & falling yields is the result of all this new information, which suggests another leg for the 2021 macro bull run.\n\n(But, as usual, I could be wrong.)", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "gave you my free award. not necessarily this post in particular, but rather your contributions in general.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks. 🤠", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Today's options flow notes:\n\nHere's today's graph:\n\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/mp773w/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_april_12_2021/gul7apu/\n\nHere's yesterday's summary:\n\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/mqjl8q/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_april_14_2021/gugutfz/\n\nHigh level notes:\n\n- Yesterday TSLA performed a strong -4% bounce from the $780 resistance, which was helped by both macro correlations and by delta hedging forces: which are symmetrical, and thus they were strong in *both* directions this week, creating a large 7% intraday whiplash from $780 to $729.\n- Options open interest inflows were very strong yesterday: 64k new calls and 68k new put positions were established.\n- Most of the positions were for this week (04/16) and next week (04/23) - just before the Q1 earnings report on Monday 26. The IV premium across Q1 earnings is high and keeps options traders from initiating large leveraged positions across earnings.\n- Interestingly, yesterday's \"put barrier\" of 25k contracts at $700 has become weaker, it's 20k contracts now. This reduces the 'strength' of any $700 downside breach, should it occur.\n- Going forward the forces magnifying rallies in the $730-$800 range are still 2-3x stronger than the downside delta hedging forces in the $660-$730 range.\n- These become even stronger at $800, which now has a large cluster of 53k call contracts.

The progress in safety is fantastic. Some additional things will be needed for autonomy: the ability to handle situations where a human would have to think about it and make decisions. Tesla hasn't said much about these capabilities, but I believe they have a plan to handle them. I think they're right to focus on safety and basic driving situations first.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Can you think of an example of that on highway, and in particular where the car coming to a stop and asking the driver to take over (which is level 4 I believe) doesn’t work?\n\nI can imagine some weird scenarios like a cop trying to block the traffic for whatever reason, or a tree/boulder blocking the highway, etc... but all those cases could fall under “stop the car because there is an obstacle”\n\nEdit: typos", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> Can you think of an example of that on highway, and in particular where the car coming to a stop and asking the driver to take over (which is level 4 I believe) doesn’t work?\n\n\"Full autonomy\", which is what you referred to, is Level 5. A police officer pulls the car over and needs to talk to the driver (something wrong with the vehicle, detour ahead, traffic infraction, etc.). Or a police officer is signalling traffic to keep moving (perhaps directing around a car crash), and specifically doesn't want the vehicles to stop. Or a flag person is directing traffic - have to obey the hand or verbal signals of the flag person. Those things could happen on the highway, and an awake and competent operator would have to be in the vehicle to deal with them. So yes, Level 4, but not \"full autonomy\".\n\nTesla could very well be working on the ability to handle these things, as they would be needed for a robotaxi, but they haven't talked much about it as far as I have observed. I believe Waymo has remote human operators who either continuously monitor the vehicles or who can be contacted if needed, for example to speak with a police officer, which is fine if the vehicle is within cell coverage (which of course it is since Waymo operates only within extremely limited geographic areas). Not sure what a Tesla would do if it's on a highway way out west in an area with gaps in cell coverage and it needs to interact with a human outside the vehicle. I trust that Tesla has a plan, but I don't know what it is. I wouldn't be surprised if it at least includes the ability to follow hand signals.\n\n\"Full autonomy\" (Level 5) requires (1) safety (not crashing, not hitting anything), (2) Ability to operate (including following all legal instructions) with no input from any human in the vehicle, and (3) ability to get from a designated Point A to Point B if possible. \"Stop the car because there is an obstacle\" can help with safety (1), but doesn't necessarily fully cover (2) and (3). Like I said, autonomy and safety are different things.\n\nI believe Tesla will at some point achieve full vehicle autonomy, and it could be very soon (as Elon said maybe in 2021), or it could end up taking longer. Tesla could be keeping quiet on human interaction issues for competitive reasons and could already have a plan in place. \n\nThat being said, I believe there could be a period of time where Teslas with FSD are at high level 4 - maybe not quite ready to serve as robotaxis, but a fantastic transportation experience for the driver, who could for example take a nap or work on other things, and need be present only for those rare occasions where human judgment is needed. I could imagine many drivers being delighted with high Level 4, while waiting for full Level 5 to be implemented.\n\nLike Tesla has said, robotaxis are likely to go into operation in a few areas at first, maybe specific states, counties, or cities, and as the weird corner cases are worked out and as robotaxis are shown to be safe and reliable, other jurisdictions will be willing to adopt them. Because widespread adoption is likely to take a while, I think of robotaxi revenue as something that is likely to be added to Tesla's income in large quantities at some point, but I don't have enough information to say \"it'll be here for sure by year X\".
