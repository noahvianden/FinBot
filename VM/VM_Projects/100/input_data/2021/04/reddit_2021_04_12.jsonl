Early assignment is rare, but if you have reason to suspect you might be assigned (like a dividend date is approaching this week) you can always close for less than max loss, based on whatever the current market prices are.\n\n> How do factors like big changes in volatility impact the spread as time goes on and moves towards expiration?\n\nCredit spreads have negative vega which means they benefit from a decrease in volatility. Volatility changes will not change the max loss nor profit of the spread, but a decrease in volatility might mean you can exit the trade sooner if you hit your profit target (and vice versa, an increase in volatility might mean you have to wait longer to exit). \n\n> Is there any way to have your position go so sideways that you can't close it but also can't afford assignment?\n\nNot sure what this question means, sorry.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the explanation!

I can purchase the stock on margin, but not the option… so, would this breakdown be correct?\n\n    - I spend 25 per stock\n    - I use 25 of margin per stock\n    - I receive 30 per stock from the sold call \n\nSo, in the middle of the trade I have:\n\n    - $2500 debit for underlying\n    - $3000 credit for sold call \n\nFor a net $500 credit in my account during the course of the trade. Is this right? Could I go and purchase stock with this extra buying power during the course of the trade?\n\nAnd after the trade, assuming I hold until expiration and the sold call is exercised so that everything is closed out, I will have used $2500 of margin for 5 days. At 9.5% annual margin, that would be 2500 \\* (.095 / 360) \\* 5 = $3.2986 In margin interest total.\n\nAt expiry, I receive $2000 for the stock sale, and that amount + the $500 that was sitting in my account during the trade goes to pay back the margin loan, and I'm left with net $3.29 debit for my margin interest and everything else cancels out.\n\nIs this all correct? Could I actually use that $500 of buying power on something else during the course of the trade, assuming that my overall account cash+stock is enough to maintain margin requirements?\n\nThanks so much!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I believe you could, though I would recommend against doing so.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> - $2500 debit for underlying\n>\n> - $3000 credit for sold call \n\nThat part is incomplete. You also have $5000 in equity of the shares and -$2000 as a liability for covering the short. That liability will increase if the value of the call goes up, but equity in the shares will presumably go up close to the same amount.\n\n> Could I go and purchase stock with this extra buying power during the course of the trade?\n\nYes, but that doesn't change the total of your liability column. This is why it's useful to think of the premium collected on a CC as a loan that you may have to repay at some future point, though you may not have to repay all of it. It's not free money.\n\n> Is this all correct? \n\nNot if the only equity you have is the shares tied up in the CC. You need additional equity to secure the margin loan. It's the same as taking out a margin loan against 1000 shares of XYZ, the only asset you have in that account and $0 cash, and then immediately selling the 1000 shares of XYZ. The cash from that sale is encumbered by the margin loan. \n\nSo, assuming you have additional equity not involved in this trade, and everything goes according to plan, yes, it looks right. But things don't always go according to plan. Some things that actually happened to people, these are not theoretical:\n\n* The stock moons and shares are $120 at expiration. You sell shares for $20 that are worth $120. While that doesn't change your math, it changes your psychology. It's not a pleasant experience.\n\n* Your margin equity falls due to a market crash. You get margin called.\n\n* Trading is halted on the stock and the call option on expiration day.\n\n* The company announces a corporate action during your trade, like a merger, split, reverse split, or spin-off, that impacts your position unfavorably.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the detailed response!

If your spread is so wide that expiration between your strikes is a likely occurrence, you might want to rethink your strategy.\n\nTaking assignment on a short put of SPY is just about the worst idea ever. SPY has to be *down* for that to happen. Why would you want to pay $410/share when SPY is $400/share? Is your credit more than $10/share?

So these are stocks that can be used as an alternative to owning BTC (they act in practice as a Bitcoin ETF). \n\nI picked MARA purely because their current stock price ($49) makes it a lot easier to enter the market with a smaller investment, especially when compared to MSTR which trades at over $700 per share.\n\nSome observations about MARA:\n\n\\- Their main business activity is already related to Bitcoin. They buy bitcoin mining equipment and set up mining rigs. \n\n\\- They bought a significant amount of bitcoin (around 4,800 valued at $150M at the time when it was purchased.) This was equivalent to 10% of their market cap when it was bought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat’s the relationship between MARA’s price and bitcoin? \n\n\\- since July 2020 MARA stock has risen about 5x more than BTC price\n\n\\- since November 2020 MARA stock has risen about 4x more than BTC price\n\n\\- since January 2021 MARA stock has risen about 1.5x more than BTC price\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRisk-return relative to bitcoin:\n\n\\- MARA’s Sharpe Ratio since March 2020 is 3.39\n\n\\- Bitcoin’s Sharpe Ratio since March 2020 is 3.05\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the price of MARA is correlated to BTC but MARA has higher average returns and a higher Sharpe ratio than BTC.\n\nHere’s my options play from the latest bitcoin dip (this can be replicated at any Bitcoin dip)\n\n\\- Buy MARA at-the-money or slightly in-the-money long-term Call options that expire on the 21/1/2022 (to capture the bitcoin bull cycle in full). \n\n\\- I bought mine with a strike price of $22 towards the end of February with MARA trading at $26 at the time. The cost was $1,850 per contract.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere’s the potential returns of this play with different bitcoin scenarios at different times:\n\n\\- With bitcoin reaching $70k by the 1st of June 2021:\n\n* Mara stock price would range between 42.9 and 82.3\n* January 22 call options would be between 65% and 261% in profit\n\n\\- With bitcoin reaching $100k by the 1st of October 2021\n\n* MARA stock price would range between $66.88 and $162.26\n* January 22 C options would range between 160% and 661% profit\n\n\\- With bitcoin reaching $200k by the 1st of December 2021\n\n* MARA stock price would range between $146.76 and $428.52\n* January 22 C options would range in between 574% and 2095% profit\n\nAnd here’s how they compare to buying bitcoin at the same dip:\n\n\\- If you had invested $1,850 at the end of February you’d have $8,100 if bitcoin reaches $200k.\n\n\\- If you had bought $1,850 dollars worth of MARA shares at the end of February you’d have in between 10,440 and 30,490 dollars if bitcoin reaches 200k\n\n\\- If you had bought a MARA January 22 22 dollar call option you’d have in between $12,450 and $40,600 USD.\n\nIf it's of interest I can provide updates on the performance periodically. So far the play is sitting at around 70% profit.\n\n(note the text is summarised in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKAM0lD82k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDKAM0lD82k))", "id": "mpasid", "created_utc": 1618222172.0, "score": 304, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "I'm up over 900% on Mara shares. been selling CC for months as well. \n\nFull disclosure: I have no idea what they do.", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": "Lol I dipped out, couldn’t take the ride I guess", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "I got assigned and got scared", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> I have no idea what they do\n\nThis is the way", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "LOL this is the way", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "MARA and RIOT are proof boomers literally don’t know how crypto works", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "I'm going to be honest and agree.

As part of logging transactions and collecting transactions fees, they may also 'find' a token (BTC) by being the first to solve a particular cryptographic calculation. So miners profit from both effort and luck.\n\nConsensus refers to the fact that the 50%+ of miners must calculate and log and verify the transaction onto the ledger for the transaction to be confirmed. This takes 1-10 mins typically. Theoretically, you could install enough miners to take over 50% of hashrate output and then control the blockchain ledger. Practically, this is not possible.\n\nExchanges are middlemen, but not for blockchain transactions per se. They allow you to exchange currencies.\n\nThink of Exchanges as currency exchange houses, and miners as little invisible fairies watching over your shoulder and logging each transaction you make as you spend/collect tokens so you can't cheat and spend it twice (via a skill-testing-crytographic-question). 50% of their fairy friends will confirm that you aren't cheating by answering the skill-testing-question the same way. Some lucky fairies will collect BTC tokens along the way.\n\nTo answer your question earlier - blockchain tokens are a nice way to store value because they are units that cannot be counterfeited.\n\nTransferring this value to someone else is also easy, fast, and cheap - think about how much it costs to wire money ($25-80) to someone and how long it takes (1-3 days) before you can confirm everything went well.\n\nAs someone mentioned previously, the total number of BTC tokens is capped at 21 million BTC. So the value must increase over time as all the tokens are found and also some tokens will be lost (people dying without passing on their wallets, etc.). No entity can execute QE quantative easing and 'print' more BTC, the way federal governments do with fiat currencies, so that method of devaluing BTC cannot occur.\n\nAll this taken together, it means that there may be upheaval on how Banks, Federal Reserves, and FinTech payment companies will work in the future. Gold has historically been the 'store of value' asset that people used in the past during times of upheaval - but it was always a pain to buy/sell gold. Some believe that BTC is starting to become that 'store of value' now, but on top of this, it is very liquid and you can easily buy/sell BTC.\n\nSide note: day-trading BTC is tricky as the markets are unregulated and there are lots of whales out there pushing their weight around with market manipulation techniques that are typically illegal in equities markets.

Giving out 9 trillion in loans to private equity firms in NY. Bailing out poorly run cities and making everyone else pay for it. They used COVID as a guise for the biggest wealth separation and class dependency scam since America's conception and blamed trump the whole time by controlling the media to swing the election, using the filibuster 300 times in 2020 and by milking virtue signaling. I believe Trump was just playing his part willingly. The conservative in me says we should have let the world adapt on their own. You should know from how the **stock market's volatility, detachment from reality** and parabolic rise **is a bad symptom**.\n\n**-Global warming:** this one is dear to me, as I am an environmental engineer and took multiple classes on the matter- one literally called 'global climate change.' My easiest explanation is the **band saturation effect**. **We are already fucked short term and we will hit renewable dependence out of necessity before the climate dictates a need for change**.\n\n**-disease control:** dexterity. there is a virus and people are also being retarded about it. When I go to the bar wearing a mask and everyone is sitting at the bar breathing on the beer taps has no mask, its pointless- one of many examples. It's a respect thing only and it's not a two way street. Between aggressive ad campaigns, social media doxing, **heavy censorship**, vaccination passports (something you got called a nasty conspiracy theorist for six months ago) for a virus that has a 99%+ survival rate, yeah I am going to call bullshit where it's due. Again, politicians and corporations milked it to exhaustion and the world will forever be injured from the **power grabbing under the guise of 'disease control.' Its can be both** and that's how its been exploited.\n\n**-Far right conservative:** I hate labels; all I want are civil liberties. Corporations manipulate the government, the gov manipulates the people and the media has been weaponized as a means to their end: to get people to dox each other for thinking for themselves. Folks are clamoring to reiterate any propaganda that fits their narrative, rendering the public **powerless and** **dependent**. It's too easy. Just promise free money. The puck has to stop somewhere before we burn like Venezuela. The government is also a bureaucratic/financial black hole that is complicit in crime on the global scale.

It sets precedents and it shows how the media has bias in what news they run which renders it propaganda. People call right wingers authoritarians and nazis but you have to play hardball to protect the personal freedoms. **It's a catch 22 and leads people to fight against their own best interests.

The rest of the revenue comes from energy, car service, autonomous package sales, charging, software, and insurance (notice I’m not including robotaxis).

Powell, said in an interview broadcast on Sunday night. But he warned that the crisis was not yet over.  \n>  \n>Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, at a news conference in March 2020, as the coronavirus began to cripple the U.S. economy. The outlook is brighter now but not without risks, he said on “60 Minutes” on Sunday night.  \n>  \n>In the interview, with “60 Minutes” on CBS, Mr. Powell said that the American economy “has brightened substantially” as more people are vaccinated and businesses reopen. But he cautioned that “there really are risks out there,” specifically coronavirus flare-ups, if Americans return to normal life too quickly.  \n>  \n>“The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly,” he said. “And that’s troubling. It’s going to be smart if people can continue to socially distance and wear masks.”  \n>  \n>The Fed has held interest rates near zero since March 2020 and has been buying about $120 billion in government-backed bonds each month, policies meant to stoke spending by keeping borrowing cheap. Fed officials have been clear that they will continue to support the economy until it is closer to their goals of maximum employment and stable inflation — and that while the situation is improving, it is not there yet.  \n>  \n>Mr. Powell reiterated that approach on Sunday, saying that the central bank would “consider raising rates when the labor market recovery is essentially complete, and we’re back to maximum employment, and inflation is back to our 2 percent goal and is on track to move above 2 percent for some time.”\n\n [Fed Chief Says U.S. Economy Is at an ‘Inflection Point’ as Risks Remain (msn.com)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/fed-chief-says-u-s-economy-is-at-an-inflection-point-as-risks-remain/ar-BB1fxJue?ocid=msedgdhp)", "id": "mp6d77", "created_utc": 1618199937.0, "score": 239, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "This I like", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "He needs to STFU and get back to the printer!", "score": 242, "replies": [{"body": "He’s literally saying 99% the same thing every interview.

So I think your analysis is flawed right away if you’re using 3% as your baseline. \n\nLet’s not worry about who’s wrong here. Let’s keep it simple. We ruined the lives of millions of Americans, sent the suicide rate to the moon in 2020 (more than .5%...), destroyed the education of our children, and crashed our economy over a virus that presents only mild symptoms in 99.6% of confirmed cases to POSSIBLY prevent <1.6% (at VERY best over a 20 day period in warm weather or .5% on average) of growth of that virus??? The margin of error conveniently omitted from this report (typically 3%) would allow the possibility that we caused all of this destruction for a 0% success rate against a virus that has a 3% death rate overall IF you include seniors over 70 and those with comorbidities who should certainly take precautions. We should be talking about a decrease of  50-75-95% to say that wearing masks had a significant impact. Destroy families for 1-2% possibility of a decreased chance of getting a virus? I believe the saying goes “the juice ain’t worth the squeeze”. Check out the Amish in Lancaster PA who just kept going to church. They were not killed off and COVID is in the history books for them. \n\nThat’s just the math. We’re not even touching on motivation to keep everyone scared in this conversation.

Like, if you look now the same $59.5 option expiring this week (4/16) is going for $8. Which basically means that if INTC is still trading at around the $65.25 it's trading at now, then your $62 option will be worth worth in the $6-$10 (depending on volatility) when it's a week from expiring. All that time value you paid premium for is (potentially) wasted.\n\nSo if you're going to make the bet that INTC will drop below $60 on 4/22, I'd wait until like 4/20 or 4/21. Then you'd be paying a much lower premium. Right now you're paying a lot extra for whatever price movement happens on 4/12 - 4/21 and 4/23 - 4/30 when you don't care too much about those timeframes, right?\n\nAlternately, instead of buying a super cheap option at that $59.5 strike, you could put that premium toward a closer strike price that'd have a better chance of ending profitable. Or you could buy a further out expiry so that if the big drop doesn't happen immediately, you'll still have most of the value of the option and can either ride it out if there's a slower move down, or sell without a huge loss if it moves against you.\n\nSo, DO NOT DO THIS, I'm just theorycrafting out my butt but if I were to make this play I'd probably wait until the week of earnings and buy a super cheap \"lottery ticket\" way OTM option expiring that week or next (depending on if you think the crash will be over by Friday or stretch into next week).\n\nMost important thing, I think, is that right now you're betting on INTC being below $60 after 4/22, but you have no idea what the price will be at open of 4/22. If INTC regains the $2 it lost today by then, then your option has even farther to go to become profitable. Difference between a $6 crash and an $8 one can be big.\n\nOf course it can also keep dropping in the coming week in which case, good for you, you can profit even without a crash, but if you're betting specifically on earnings then I'd say you're better off buying your option as close to the date as possible.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Can casinos get back in the green plz", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Doubled my position on CTEA.

There has been no significant rollover last week - and it's difficult to roll over Q1 while maintaining leverage, due to the high implied volatility of the 04/26 earnings.\n- Tesla's surprise move of moving Q1 earnings to a Moonday (04/26) will increase the IV, value and relevance of 04/30 options - although there's only 75k of them.\n- The delta gradient is strong at $700, but becomes really substantial in the $730-$750 range, and I don't think options writers want to see $800 prices ...\n- I.e. should there be a TSLA rally this week, there's a substantial delta hedging effect both from the erosion in put value, and from the out-of-the-money calls moving into the money.\n\n**TL;DR:** this week could get interesting.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting that the 'peak' of both Puts and Calls has moved upwards a full $100 from last week (although puts are more similarly-sized every $100).", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I think the 'peak' is really just representative the cheapest 'lottery call' prices available to gambling shorts and longs.

I know this is a Tesla discussion board. But I heavily invest in Tesla and NIO. NIO beat expectations in Q1 and so did Tesla, this was some sort of indication that chip shortages wouldn't be that big of an issue short term. Even if it was a issue in Q2, how big would it necessarily be? Bears like to pretend that it's the end of the world. Worse case scenario is that the demand cannot be met and is delivered in Q3 and Q4. \nPersonally for me, Tesla, NIO, Arkk, and other popularly traded stocks have all moved very similarly on the 1/3/6 month chart. The tech especially EV/auto companies are cyclical.\n\nI did ask you to do the math behind the amount of chips manufactured in house vs the demand. But that's okay, I understand.\n\nNIO recently said right before Q2 that they might not be able to beat expectations, but they did. \nElon Musk of Tesla said recently I believe 2 days ago that they had some other sources for chips. Tesla also beat Q1 expectations. \nBoth companies beat Q4 2020 which is a big deal. I use these 2 companies because they're both in different regions but targeting a somewhat similar consumer base. \n\nAlso, because Tesla moves similarly to NIO, ARKK, PLUG, Palantir, SPCE, and other popularly traded stocks. Perhaps stock movements aren't based primarily on individual movements but rather a general consensus amongst these particular group of categorized stocks. \nThis is why maybe tech after great earnings still sold off mid February. See the thing is I am bullish just like you. But I want to make sense of the movements. I don't think bears give good arguments personally. Tesla is doing great and I think that there will be a rotation out of financial and U.S \"value\" and back into tech. The NASDAQ might be one indicator but while these stocks tend to move with the NASDAQ, they also take longer to recover I would assume. Especially because of mainstreet conditions and after big run-ups from growth stocks, cooling down and consolidation periods are normal.\n\nSorry for the long reply. tldr would be I agree with you.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "\n>I did ask you to do the math behind the amount of chips manufactured in house vs the demand. But that's okay, I understand.\n\nSorry I missed this. The answer is zero. No one manufactures chips in house. Not Tesla, not Ford, not even Apple. There's a limited number of foundries globally that make all complex chips for global consumption and it's definitely a bottleneck in some supply chains. It's just that I don't see any signs of Tesla being affected this time around, probably because they simply stockpiled the chips they need for the coming few quarters ahead of time.\n\nTesla, unlike legacy auto or smaller start-ups like Nio, are both *Rapidly growing* and *have positive cashflow*. These two combined mean that they both *need to* and *can afford to* stockpile crucial components for future production. \n\nImagine if you're Ford. You always buy 100,000 of this one chip cause that's what you put in your pick up truck. If the supplier suddenly only can deliver half that, that will affect your bottom line cause your margins are so low you can't afford to buy extra stockpile. \n\nImagine if you're Nio. You grow, so you buy more chips every month. But you can't afford to place moee than one month's order at a time. Supplier says this month you only get half => affects your bottom line. \n\nNow, imagine a company like Tesla that can afford to keep 3 months of *growing capacity* of chips on its shelves. If supplier says this month is only half production, that won't affect Tesla until 3 months down the line, so they can plan for it. Maybe the next couple months they place larger orders to compensate. 3 months later, when the \"low deliveries\" would affect Tesla, the crisis is over. \n\n\nSorry for the long rant, I kind of wanted to write this down myself :)\n\nTL;DR a temporary component shortage doesn't affect Tesla as much as they are rapidly growing AND cash rich", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "NIO can afford chips and are not struggling financially. They raised capital along with Li,Xpeng, and Tesla.\n\nYou said earlier that Tesla was able to manufacture chips in house which is why I asked where you got these numbers from. Now you're claiming they stock piled necessary chips. Can you source your info for this? other companies produce chips for Tesla.\nI do see Tesla being more prepared though and agree. But this does not mean Tesla will not be affected by a reduction in supplies. This is a problem globally, which is fine. Most investor relations have estimated it will be resolved by Q3, this includes William Bin Li of NIO. Musk also went out and tweeted some reassurance. I also see particular companies like Tesla having good relationships with chip suppliers. \nI agree with you that for certain companies ship shortages should have been priced in the stocks price weeks ago. Which is why we see companies like NIO and TSLA slowly climb up from 2021 lows. I would also look at companies like ARKK, PLUG, PALANTIR, FUBO, and a few other highly traded stocks on a 6/3/1 month chart because they have been moving very similarly. So perhaps the chip shortages as you've said aren't actually that big of an issue. I would be surprised if analysts and investors aren't considering the fact that these short term problems become irrelevant by Q3-4.\n\nI wanted to know your breakdown of Tesla supply chain. That's fine, you don't have too. I do want to say also that a lot of companies do have extra cash on hand. Perhaps during the November round of share dilution. Companies like Li,NIO,Xpeng, and Tesla who all raised cash knew they would possibly have to start bidding for chip shortages.  NIO raised cash unexpectedly 7-10 days after Tesla did while telling investors they had no plans to because they already had 4 billion on hand at the time. The chip shortages have been a problem for a while.\n\nYour TL;DR for Tesla could be easily applied to NIO where you've said they are \"rapidly growing and cash rich\". I own both these companies so I follow them closely. Which is why I had to point out where your comparison of companies conflicted. By the way, is that really how Ford works? because Ford has over $30b cash on hand. This means they could actually outbid supply of chips from companies like  Tesla. \nSo  you say that Tesla isn't as heavily affected but I am in disbelief of that. Which wasn't really my point regarding the current share price.\n\nTL;DR I agree with you for the most part. What I want to know is if ALL AUTOMAKERS are being affected by chip shortages. If that multiple companies globally are being affected. Then why on the 6 month why did NIO and Tesla trend down while FORD went up? Because I am starting to think that perhaps the EV market is cyclical. We had big run ups in 2020 and with a mixture of sector rotations the stock sort of cooled down. The bear case doesn't work for chip shortages if it's only applied in one company but not others. So I really wanted your take on this.
