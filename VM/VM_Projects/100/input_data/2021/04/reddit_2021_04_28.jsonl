{"title": "Is it really better to sell options during high IV? (Quick study)", "selftext": "\\---\n\nUpdate: Thanks for all your generous comments and feedback. It's been a fun and educational exercise and I look forward to continue learning from y'all. \n\n\\---\n\nIs it really better to sell options during high VIX from a purely volatility premium standpoint?\n\nI decided to do a quick study by comparing historical VIX and realised volatility of S&P500 since 1990. Results indicate that while high VIX (say greater than 20) is correlated with higher volatility premium (VIX - RV), it is also correlated with greater volatility drawdown (VIX < RV). In other words, there's a greater chance of IV underestimating actual volatility during periods of high volatility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hf6ns6wbptv61.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa3999ac859df9fca398c76f3a5f1754c4acf7b1\n\nIt seems that the optimal volatility risk/reward to sell options is between 12.5 - 15 VIX.\n\nSee spreadsheet here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fro7cXN9\\_YQIz4ilqZZXEapsEemezclJAcWnUuaRHGM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fro7cXN9_YQIz4ilqZZXEapsEemezclJAcWnUuaRHGM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI welcome any feedback/comments.

Like how the hell is Amazon supposed to have every nut and bolt and then expect consumers to know which one they need? Home Depot has a way in which if a consumer buys the wrong product they have a very low amount of effort required to get the right product. If you buy the wrong product for the job on Amazon you literally have to wait 2-3 days to be able to pick right back up.\n\nPlus so many professionals rely on Home Depot to be their source of goods for the services they provide.

I have a high affinity for information technology as well as commerce and Shopify basically sells people the ability to perform online commerce. That is right up my alley! \n\nThis makes me see how an earnings report can lead to an overall stock price increase. It gets people's attention and when they take a proper look at what the company does, it makes them passionate about wanting to invest in them for a long horizon! I can't believe I was so ignorant to not invest in them sooner. A business model like this will only get stronger with time. Even post COVID. Not gonna total FOMO in right now but definitely gonna begin gradually building a stake in this company. It fits right in with my other explosive tech/IT positions and I am quite keen to see where the go over the next few years.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "did you make a post or smth for your DD? would like to have a read as the company sounds interesting", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I didn’t make a post.

It’s like helping cut out the middleman while becoming the middleman yourself. It’s honestly ingenious. In this day and age most folks looking to get a business of selling products going may want a website to let people do that and Shopify’s schtick seems to be helping to make that happen.

This can go both ways of course. If you think Tesla is a fraud or just overvalued, it’s natural to see the credits as unsustainable. If you see Tesla as a legit long term hyper growth investment, it’s easy to handwave away the fact that they have never turned a quarterly GAAP profit without credits.\n\nMy take: while I would really *like* to see a quarter of profitability w/o credits to shut up whiners, it makes no sense for Tesla to throw those credits in the bank instead of use them to grow. \n\nFurthermore, it is completely _inaccurate_ to say that Tesla did not make money on their cars. In black and white, the cars are profitable. There is a >25% margin on each car they sell. The credits represent approximately 5.8% of the vehicle revenue and approximately 21.6% of vehicle margin. \n\nThe energy sector lost $101M, equal exactly to the gain in BTC, so that cancels out, leaving only $80M in difference between regulatory credits and GAAP profit. \n\nTesla reported $666M spent on R&D. How much of that is exclusive to energy rather than their cars? If they spent even $81M (12.16% of their R&D budget) on items other than cars, then they turned a profit on their cars without the credits.\n\nBut what if they didn’t spend 81M on other projects’ R&D?\n\nWell remember they are a growth company, right now flooring the accelerator to grow as fast as possible. How silly would it be for them to hold back growth by not including the credits the *know* they sold in their capital expenditure + R&D planning? It would be absurd. \n\nSo here we have a case where people are lazily confirming their own bias using a top line number comparison instead of doing a  deep dive to understand what’s going on behind the scenes.\n\nShould you, the TSLA investor worry?

An option means you have the right but no obligation to buy 100 shares of whatever stock. Btw a call means your bullish on the stock.

If you contract has more value than what you bout it for then you can sell it back to the market for a profit. If you choose to exercise your contract that means you have to have enough money to buy 100 shares of whatever stock. Most people sell the contract because buying 100 of any shares requires you to be a baller. So options are a good way to making money as well. Warning do not sell calls or puts as that puts you on a short position and if you don't have the 100 stocks you're fucked. If you're a beginner buys calls or puts.

{"title": "MNMD: A Story of Forecasts and Fundamentals", "selftext": "· Originally posted by [u/izzyforeel](https://www.reddit.com/u/izzyforeel/), but edited and recovered by u/JustOnTheHorizon_ OP had originally deleted his account so it took some digging to recover it. That being said, full credit goes to OP and u/JustOnTheHorizon_. Original post date: January 2021. Please enjoy. –\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey guys,\n\nI thought I’d post about my thoughts on MNMD. First of all, please do your own due diligence and do not fall victim to the pump, hype and euphoria. These are highly speculative investments and have significant risk associated. All that said, there have been many requests for fundamental analysis and MNMD projections so I wanted to provide my thoughts.\n\n\\*All figures in USD (market cap, sales) except for my investment holdings. I purchased MMED.NE shares. Source data available as well, but got messy with all the 10-k filings and links in the table.\n\n# Entry Point\n\nFirst and foremost, I want to address the most commonly raised question on this thread: “Is it too late to buy MNMD?” Any investment is subject to the risk / reward paradigm. Those that got in at $0.3 deserve every penny they earned as MNMD was by definition a penny stock and one of the most risky investments you could own. Since then, it has grown tremendously due to scientific milestones which have pointed to significant progress in the industry.\n\nThe milestones MNMD has achieved have DERISKED MNMD from a penny stock to a small cap biotech company with a very large drug portfolio and numerous future catalysts. I do not expect to make 10x my investment in a week, nor should you. Is there still tremendous upside even at the current valuation of \\~$1.5bn? I strongly believe so and will let my position reinforce that.\n\nI entered this space with an average cost of \\~$4.9 CAD, holding 311,206 shares, and a book value of \\~1.5MM. Yes you read that correctly. Do I panic every day and check the ticker? No. Does my heart beat thinking of the time I evaporated \\~$500,000 in unrealized loss when the stock was at $3.4? No. In fact, I continue to pick up shares at what I believe is a discounted valuation. There will be many that look at $4.9 entry point and think that even I got in at the bottom. It’s all relative.\n\n[OPs original YOLO \\(Not a YOLO\\)](https://preview.redd.it/m5g55vw3dxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=463e90c35b488f6a370a63769daece2d5a07f5d8)\n\nI only invested what I could afford to lose and although $1.5MM is a large sum of money, it is not my entire portfolio, nor would it impact my daily life. If I lost it all it would not impact my ability to service my mortgage, pay my bills, impact my other investments, nor prohibit me from doing the things I love. I continue to hold dry powder and monitor my investment on a monthly basis, while continuing to buy following successful milestones.\n\nThis is a very long term play that could fundamentally change the way we treat the body’s most important organ. We are just getting started. I have a very strong conviction on the future outcome of this industry and that is the reason I couldn’t be bothered about short term fluctuations. An important question to ask yourself is whether you believe MNMD can reach its next scientific milestone. Take things one step at a time and is there a probability the next scientific update will be positive? Emphasis on science, ignoring NASDAQ, candlesticks, and capital structure (for now).\n\n# Institutional Capital\n\nI work in finance (albeit project finance / private equity, and don’t value stocks for a living, so don’t consider me an expert here) but already know of a few moderately capitalized asset managers that are now participating in MNMD. The recent bought deals are evidence of sophisticated capital flowing into this industry. I personally qualify as an ‘accredited investor’ and am having conversations constantly with folks in my circles who are investing heavily into these stocks. As more institutional capital flows in, the more stable these stocks become. Of course, this is all relative.\n\n# Access to liquidity\n\nAs with all brand new industries, the capital requirement is immense in order to bring products to market. What drew me into the space was the fact that MNMD did raise capital. Biotech stocks do not have cashflow, thus their only path to fund operations is through equity raises. The fact that MNMD was able to raise over $237MM CAD since May 2019 is a positive for this company. Yes it is dilutive, and good job for paying attention in finance 101 class, but bootstrapping a biotech company is not possible, nor is servicing debt.\n\nThe path to commercialization of will be full of obstacles, however a strong balance sheet with sufficient capital gives MNMD the resources to get there. The current valuation has tremendous upside following scientific milestones and future equity raises and dilutions are a good thing, as it will be at an increased valuation.\n\nThere are definitely smaller cap companies out there that may double overnight, however for the risk / reward, I do not feel comfortable owning companies that don’t have a large balance sheet, nor a diversified drug portfolio.\n\n# Believe in the Science\n\nI do not feel I am in a position to write original content on the efficacy of these drugs. I have done my research and read a fair number of published studies but anything that I write would simply be regurgitating what others have said.\n\nThe biggest investors in this space are those with personal experiences with psychedelics because you have first-hand experience of the profound meaning extracted from one treatment. The ability to dissolve your ego enables you to deal with the root cause of so many problems ranging from depression, PTSD and addition, without approaching the problem by numbing symptoms. Herein lies the inherent value of this industry and will simply take time to prove it through trails. I have the conviction to continue to invest because I believe in the science. The data to reinforce this is on its way, and I personally want to invest now, knowing that the likelihood of very significant catalysts are probable.\n\n# Forecasts\n\nThis of course is the elephant in the room for early investors, later\\[er\\] investors and bears alike. Is a $1.5bn market cap pricing in all of the upside already? Is this a $100bn stock? This company has zero revenues, shouldn’t it be worth zero?\n\nThe truth is, no one knows. There is tremendous risk with this company. However, I will not be selling unless we see some significant negative scientific outcomes. Again, less emphasis on stock price, NASDAQ, more emphasis on the science. Everything else will follow.\n\nThe various ways to value a company (DCF, sales / earnings multiples, liquidation value etc) all have their issues with an early stage company of this nature. Any sort of bottoms up DCF analysis is just guessing because variables such as patient count, dosage, pricing, market share, market penetration, amongst other have far too much variation to come up with a reliable figure. Discount rates and time horizon can favour your outcome depending on how aggressive / conservative you are.\n\nThus, the way I like to look at this market is a best case scenario for a single drug, based off historical sales data from one company and one drug. This implicitly takes into account patient dosage, competition, market share, market penetration etc, because one drug from one company has already proven its ability to capture such sales data.\n\n[Letters and Numbers](https://preview.redd.it/37z2u5a9dxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a0b8a6b8643b49666b9eef994eb70c4984f64dd)\n\nI have broken out annual sales data for various comparable drugs according to MNMD’s current pipeline offering. This is the inherent benefit of MNMD, is that it has a diverse portfolio covering many underserved issues. Like many of you, I believe MNMD’s biggest blockbuster will be Layla, given the problem of Opioid addition plus MNMD’s IP rights on 18-MC to corner sales. Suboxone is the current drug on the market due to delayed onset effects ranging from 24-36 hours, compared to someone in withdrawal uses fast acting opioids 3-4 times a day. Suboxone itself however is still addictive and has a long list of negative side effects. Furthermore, it does not correct dopamine dysregulation in patients.\n\nThe sales of Suboxone alone are growing at an \\~9% CAGR, with sales expected to reach \\~$4bn in 2028.\n\nThe use case for 18-MC however, does not stop at Opioid addiction, and can be applied to alcohol dependency and smoking dependency among others. This means the TAM for 18-MC could be significantly larger than the existing market captured by Suboxone given its smaller demographics relative to 18-MC. Could Layla exhibit sales greater than Suboxone one day? Who knows. Sticking with comp sales for the analysis for now.\n\nVarious anxiety, depression and ADHD medication is also shown in the table to show sales potential of Lucy, Albert and the micro dose programmes.\n\nIs there a possibility of a LSD, 18-MC, or LSD compound or derivative achieving blockbuster drug status? Do you think there is an inherent benefit to a psychedelic compared to an antidepressant sedative with side effects such as nausea, weight gain etc?\n\nYour perceived probability and sales outcomes depends on whether you believe in the science. Those that don’t can easily be skeptical of a $1.5bn market cap many years away from profitability.\n\nThose that do, look at the next half a dozen clinical trial outcomes as very probable and thus have applied a less punitive discount to the stock valuation. I have rationalized my decision to invest at $1.5MM because of my own perceived discount rate and confidence in the next 12 months of positive catalysts.\n\n# Valuation Multiples\n\nNow, as many of you know, investors pay a multiple for the future earnings of a company, today. If a drug makes $1bn annually, investors will pay a multiple of future earnings expected over the drugs lifetime, discounted by various factors.\n\nThere are various metrics to use here, ranging from Enterprise Value / Sales or various types of earnings metrics. MNMD is years away from having a real operating company, anything to sell, or even the corporate infrastructure to get it to market. However, the question has always been, how big do you think this company could get?\n\nThis is where things can get tricky. We used peak annual sales in the last section to forecast comparable estimates for MNMD revenues. Thus, I believe it is appropriate to use mature, large cap trading multiples instead of early stage bio techs, as our revenue estimates were mature figures with stabilized growth. If we were to use companies / drugs earlier in their lifecycle or clinical phases, the trading multiples would be much higher because the market is buying potential future sales. Can’t have it both ways.\n\n[An ugly rainbow](https://preview.redd.it/farn3m3gdxv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0abe00f3b8456574265f74a0c54fab49a5fe60e1)\n\nAll of the chart data in the graph is specific to the pharma industry. However, there are various subsectors to the industry such as Contract Development Manufacturing and Contract Research Organization. MNMD would likely have to partner with each of these types of firms to scale its business, better assess market size etc, but wouldn’t trade at similar multiples given a different business model. Same goes for Packaging and Distribution.\n\nThe graph also shows S&P average which is a good rule of thumb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[More letters and numbers](https://preview.redd.it/1iybej4kdxv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=88ee491b4a27ba8467d27b863f001fc9ba5ecceb)\n\nAlthough the chart gives a good reference point for pharma multiples, I wanted to look at valuation from a more company specific perspective. The chart above shows large cap specialty pharma companies that are publicly traded. This will give you an approximate median value of what the market is willing to pay for a company that has a certain amount of sales. As you can see in the green box, industry multiples of EV/EBIITDA or EV/Sales will basically get you to the same place. Median pharma industry EBITDA margins are in the 40% range with EV/Sales at \\~4x vs EV/EBITDA of 10x.\n\nNote that the above list of trading comps is stale data, as of Sept ’19. I only want to use public data and have refrained from using Bloomberg, Cap IQ etc. Thus the information I’m posting is merely reposts of info available on Google. As you can see, Allergan is listed in this table as a live trading comp, and has since been acquired by AbbVie. Accordingly, I want to highlight some notable M+A activity:\n\nAmgen acquires Celgne’s plaque psoriasis drug, Otezla $13.4bn: EV / LTM Sales = 7.6x Thermo Fisher acquires Qiagen for $11.5bn: EV / LTM Sales = 7.3x Abbvie acquires Allergan for $84.2bn: EV / LTM Sales = 5.4x Elanco acquires Bayer’s animal health unit for $7.6bn: EV / LTM Sales = 4.5x As you can see, companies are willing to pay a premium in M&A to acquire competitors and drugs, due to synergies, reduction in SG&A etc.\n\nThis is a very long winded way of showing that if one of MNMD’s compounds hits, and exhibits sales in line with any sort of comparable drug from the table above, this could be a $20-30 billion dollar company (\\~4bn\\*5-7x). If several of these drugs reach commercialization, this is potentially a $100 billion dollar company.\n\nNow I agree that these projections are completely outlandish right now. I’m simply doing the exercise you all wanted.\n\nFeel free to guess at your own forecast sales and multiply out enterprise value using the above metrics. Before you rip me apart for the extreme optimism, I understand that I’m using multiples for stable, reputable, large cap pharma. I understand that there is an extreme amount of stigma attached to psychedelics and achieving ubiquity for these treatments is a large uphill battle. There is an enormous amount of work, luck and time from now until sales and this is not to be under estimated.\n\n**Do I think MNMD is worth $30-$100bn today? No.**\n\n**Do I think MNMD is worth somewhere in between today’s valuation and $30-$100bn?**\n\nDepends **whether you believe in the science.** If you’re reading this, odds are you do. I invested because I believe it too.\n\nSo instead, let’s take a lazy man’s approach to valuation and take things one step at a time.\n\n# Simpler Approach to Valuation\n\nThe exercise above is to show you all the immense potential of MMED’Fs drug portfolio. Do I think MNMD is the next Pfizer, Abbie Vie or Eli Lilly? No. This is not a $500bn dollar company. However, I do genuinely think there is tremendous upside not factored into the pricing for this stock.\n\nFundamental analysis aside, I think the simplest way to approach valuation is from a catalyst + efficient market hypothesis perspective. Markets are not fully efficient, nor even semi-efficient, but there is some sort of reasoning in believing what the market is willing to pay. The obvious flaws in this are that the market right is riddled with irrational investors and a market of 300m financially illiterate traders isn’t more efficient than an illiquid market of 10 rational ones. As of today’s post there is a discount to the $4.40 price. To me, that’s just more opportunity to continue to scoop up more shares.\n\nI have stayed out of the industry in the early days because truthfully I did not know which stocks to pick. Since then, much smarter people than me have done their diligence and allocated their capital to the companies that they believe are winners. This is part of an efficient market hypothesis.\n\nSophisticated capital flowed into MNMD @ 4.40 / share, with the expectation to make a profit. I also, invested in this company at $4.9/share, with the expectation to make a profit. If we establish this as a baseline, do we believe there will be more positive than negative catalysts in the next year and in the future, such that we will see accretion in the share price? Conversely, if we see negative outcomes in future catalysts, it will cause erosion in the stock valuation. Below are near term events which should have a significant impact on share price:\n\n· Phase 2 readout– Q1 2021 Open IND w/ FDA for Phase 2b – Q3 2021 Project Layla\n\n· Phase 2a study– Second half of 2021 Strategic Pharma Partner Potential – Late 2021 Various\n\n· Combined MDMA LSD Phase 1 trail – Q1 2021 IV DMT Phase 1 trail – Q1 2021 First ever Phase 2a clinical trial Microdose LSD – Q3 2021 Patent filed for neutralizer technology for LSD to shorter/stop hallucinogenic effects Game changer for safe, regulated environment for clinical administration Given that Phase 1 studies are focused on safety, what are the odds clinically developed LSD / MDMA fails a safety test?\n\nGiven that Phase 2 studies are focused on proof of concept and method, what are the odds the clinically designed process fails the test?\n\n# Believe in the science.\n\nEach one of these incremental catalysts derisks MNMD, and will bring the valuation closer to ‘blockbuster drug’ status, albeit inches at a time. Just as the bought deal derisked this company for me to participate, achievements in clinical trials will be evidence for more investors to jump in as well. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves and guess at how large this company can get. Just think of what is the next step and do your own evaluation as to whether achieving it is realistic. Once we get through the above list, there will be more milestones to pass such as Phase 2bs and 3s. If we establish $4.40 as the baseline currently and MNMD has a successful outcome in any of the previously listed catalysts, there should be a significant accretion in valuation.\n\nThere is a noticeable omission for most of you, in that I’ve left out the NASDAQ up listing, future dilutions and general capital structuring events. To me, a NASDAQ uplisting is irrelevant. This will add liquidity, although probably more volatility, but changes zero fundamentals about the stock. It should however, add more weight to the efficient market hypothesis and erase the discount I believe this stock is trading at. We’ll see some analyst coverage with price targets that will attract more investors, but the fundamentals of the stock do not change.\n\nWith respect to stock price, it is impossible to forecast this because the capital structure of this company is completely unknown. IF we can even get to revenue generation, and this becomes a $30-100bn company, how much dilution will there be from now until then to back out a share price? The point is that there is so much runway in share price accretion from now until then, that I’m not bothered with anything finance related for this company. **There is potential for 50-70x accretion in the value of this company.** The focus needs to be on the science. MNMD has raised enough money to get though its next set of obstacles and fund operations, thus insolvency risk has fallen away for now which is really the only important financial point for early stage biotech.\n\nLet’s take things one step at a time, believe in the science and be patient.\n\n# Cash position & Expenditures\n\nAs you can see below, the quarterly burn payroll burn rate is quite low for MNMD relative to its cash position. It’s hard to discern which items under their historical expenditures are one off versus recurring, thus difficult to calculate their exact run rate. However, the huge positive here the low ratio of payroll relative to its cash.\n\n[Tendies at Wendy's: Already in our bellies](https://preview.redd.it/ici10ntodxv61.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fde7f60fd7e2f8bdef405f6e5b022acf9e322a1)\n\nNext up we have the projected use of proceeds from their latest raise, net of underwriter expenses. Now that the Over-Allotment has been exercised, MNMD has additional capital that it has further allocated to Albert, Lucy, Layla and the Microdose LSD program.\n\n[Tendies at Wendy's: Soon to be in our bellies](https://preview.redd.it/8gozyududxv61.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dd203b18101c760f03790f8a700171a80995299)\n\nGeneral takeaway is that MNMD is well enough capitalized to get through its next phase of milestones. I will be keeping an eye on news surrounding the Microdose LSD program. Estimates at this stage for Phase 2a are $3-4m and the results of which will inform capital expenditures required for future phases. A positive milestone in Q3 ’21 should be an incredibly positive catalyst for this company.\n\nProving that you’ve raised capital and have enough cashflow to get to the next step doesn’t guarantee we’ve picked the winner in the industry. It does however give me confidence that MNMD will continue to be a going concern for at least the short term and get to a point when new investors can come in at a much higher valuation. This is a real risk for the penny stocks out there without capital or IP, and that is the reason I chose MNMD.\n\nEdit: Did some re-formatting to make it easier to read cause it's pretty lengthy and there's a lot of details. Hopefully it helps.\n\nEdit #2: I went back into the trash compacter and salvaged the original data and charts since some people were asking.

For simplicity, just consider a monthly, a biweekly, 10 days, a weekly, 5 days, 3 days,  2 days and a daily timeframe now consider 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and hourly frequency.

Why? Well take a look at the short interest. AMD is the most heavily shorted stock in the semi industry. The latest there shows 82.7M shares sold short on 4/15 with price at $85.21. That means they need to keep the stock under $85 to make their precious profit. They also want to keep the stock down in order to get a good buy-in for the Xilinx deal. Which means it seems they're trying to keep the stock down for the entire year until the Xilinx deal closes, that's a long time to keep up negative pressure. Meanwhile, AMD is going to continue to get upgrades and price target increases.\n\nI know everyone hates Jim Cramer but this is what he said in regards to AMD on the AAP call this morning:  \n\"This is just a buy. I mean, you gotta buy it very aggressively here. Because if it weren't for the Xilinx arbitrage, it would probably be up. But remember, it has to be shorted if you want to buy Xilinx and that's what's killing them. Because people just keep shorting it all day. There's 51M shares traded, which is rather remarkable.\"\n\nOne could speculate that Intel is coming in to steal AMD's thunder but in yesterday's earnings call, AMD put that to rest. Intel's datacenter sales were down 20% YoY which Intel last week said was NOT due to competition but due to customers \"digesting\" existing purchases and that this is a slow time of year for data center sales. AMD's Dr. Lisa Su shows 100% growth in datacenter sales YoY saying customer demand is strong and accelerating, basically calling Intel liars and that AMD is taking all that market share with no slow down in sight.\n\nOne could speculate that Nvidia is going to challenge AMD in the datacenter but Su Bae dismissed it in the earnings call saying customers are not asking for ARM chips, and AMD would build them if they were. Basically saying that building an ARM processor for the datacenter would be like building a solution to a problem no one has, and no one is asking for, there's no money in it.\n\nOne could speculate that the \"chip shortage\" will negatively impact AMD. But the good doctor put that to rest yesterday as well confirming rumors that AMD is increasing production by 20% in Q2 which reflected in them raising guidance for 50% growth in 2021! By contrast, Intel is expecting 0% growth this year.\n\nAll of this positive growth and lack of industry competition means AMD is going to continue killing in quarter after quarter which will push analysts to keep upgrading the stock and price targets which will make it harder and harder for hedge funds to keep up the negative pressure throughout the year.\n\nWith AMD, there's no need for individual investors to try to turn it around on the short sells, it's going to happen naturally due to continued analyst upgrades, we don't have to do anything. I recommend getting on board now and being patient, because when it pops and the short sellers give up/move on, when the negative pressure cannot contain the buying from institutions and individual investors on analyst upgrades, it's going to explode.\n\nAMD Positions: 550 shares, various call options with expirations from June 2021 to June 2022.\n\nUPDATE: BoA upgraded AMD price target from $100 to $110 and named AMD their #1 pick in all of computing.

As a result, we expect strong SVOD subscriber net adds in 1Q21. On a total reported basis (i.e., including Showtime OTT and other DTC services), we estimate VIAC will add 4mn+ global SVOD subscribers in 1Q21 vs. an implied average of 2-3mn per quarter during 2020.\n\n*June pricing change:* In early June, VIAC will debut a $4.99 pricing tier for Paramount+, which will also remove the linear station feeds from the service. At this point, management has indicated they will be able to explore further bundling and distribution agreements, which we view as a potential catalyst to 2021 subscriber growth.\n\n*Improving original content slate:* As production returns across VIAC's studios, we expect the original content slate for both film and television to improve for the company's DTC services, namely Paramount+, and the company's linear networks.\n\n*Improving advertising trends:* As the economy reopens, we believe demand for advertising will continue to recover. With the expanded reach from Pluto TV and Paramount+, we believe VIAC presents advertisers a more holistic offering and the ability to reach all age demos.\n\n**We maintain our Buy rating and 12-month price target of $75 for VIAC.**\n\nVIAC #TOTHEMOON **🚀🚀** **🚀** \n\nNote also that Paramount+ only launched in the quarter on March 3, and has the below % share of new subscribers. Note how they beat Disney+, Hulu and Netflix!
