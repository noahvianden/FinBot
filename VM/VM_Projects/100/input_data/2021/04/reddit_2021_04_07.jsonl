{"title": "For the youth, just broad strokes what I've learned after 20 years investing.", "selftext": "#DON'T PANIC\n\n(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)\n\nFor what it is worth this is my advise:\n\nSAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. \n\n#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. \n\n\n::\n# I cant believe I have to edit this, but some idiot brought it up: If you find a large some of money laying on the ground take it to your local police station. Check your local laws to determine what the minimum amount would be for your state/jurisdiction most are between $500 and $10,000. If you find it in a bag with drugs... well, you do you. \n\n::\n\nI was really just talking about pocket change \n\nTry to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. \n\nIf you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself.\n\nThis is NOT thought [edit: or taught] in school. \n\nYou either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. \n\nMy grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. \n\nGo to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. \n\nNone of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  \n\nIn 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. \n\nDon't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?\n\nBroad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. \n\nI like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. \n\nPick a solid broker, read above. \n\n#Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. \n\nDon't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)\n\nStart with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.\n\nAfter you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. \n\nMaybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. \n\nAfter you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  \n\nDon't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. \nIf you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. \n\nIf you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. \n\nLook at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.\n\nDon't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. \n\n#DONT PANIC. \n\nDon't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.\n\nLearn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.\n\nBuy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).\n\n\nLearn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. \n\nTime in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. \n\nAnyway, at the end of the day... just do something. \n\nDo not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. \n\nTry not to fall into investment fads.\n\nWhen I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.\n\nAnd buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.\n\n\n*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*\n\n**last edit: swords for plowshares boys**\n\nPS: I upvoted you all so far, love this late(early) discussion. Going to sleep now. Whether you agree with me or not, I wish you all solid gains. It is not about you or them, or your gains vs his/her loss. I hope you all make gains and that my small insite can lead future generations(or my own or past) to an easy life where we maybe don't have yachts or pent houses, but at the same time.... have to die young of stress and ill health, and can just have the money to be content and happy and be like me,... spending this week digging a new garden, and not be broken old men/women like I see so often.\n\nAnd if you dont like that, if you say everyone should \"pull up them boot straps\" then I say Fuk you.

More like 8 subjects in one, but it's a good starting point. The section on fundamental analysis is the most helpful. However it jumps around somewhat (and the author of that section suggests to buy the book \"Fundamental Analysis for Dummies\", so you know it's not the entire book in that 8-in-1 book). I recommend this book only because it's a broad introduction into investing, finance, real estate investing, retirement planning, etc...\n\n2. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle. I'm half way through reading this book and have learned a tremendous amount. This guy has a cult following, even though he passed away in the recent past. You will understand the concepts of compound interest AND compound fees. Yes...compound fees, as in mutual funds and what money managers charge. It all adds up. You will get a deeper understanding of index funds and why they are a good idea to have in your portfolio. This book is really worth getting for sure. It will get you started with how to think like an investor, not a gambler.\n\n3. Elements of Investing by Malkiel and Ellis. Haven't read this yet. However I have read Malkiel's book \"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\" (that was a good book, however I read it in the 1990's and need to read again LOL. Essentially it says everything is BS and you can pick stocks at random and still do as good as the pros. Throwing darts at the stock pages to pick stocks vs going with a pro). Anyhoo, \"Elements of Investing\" gets great reviews and the author's are well regarded in both academia and the real world.\n\n4. Anything by Benjamin Graham. This was Warren Buffetts mentor. I just bought \"The interpretation of Financial Statements\" published in 1937 and has been in continuous reprint. Haven't read it yet but since I have no background in truely analyzing financial statements, accounting or any of that stuff, I figured it is worthwhile. It's considered a classic text in value investing and fundamental analysis. \n\nI did download Grahams \"Intelligent Investor\" on Kindle and am currently on Chapter 4. As far as I can tell, this book gives the reader a real fundamental understanding of the stock market as a whole and it's history of the \"ups and downs.\" BTW the stock market in the US has been more \"up\" than \"down\". Knowing this info helps put investing in perspective. This book is highly regarded and I would not ignore it.\n\n5. If you are like me, I have never taken an accounting class or a finance class. No problem because you can pick up Accounting and Finance books at used book stores and thrift stores. And by books, I'm talking about college textbooks. The kind that cost $150 when you go to college, but cost only $2-$5 in the real world. These are good references to have to double check if a formula you are using is correct or if your approach to something is correct.\n\nI hope this helps. There's alot of books out there on investing. Some of which border on the \"fad diet\" books or the \"get rich quick\" schemes.

Here is the financial advice that I plan to give to him. On his birthday, I will hand him a hundred dollar bill and a 1 gram 9999 pure gold foil 100 dollar note. Both have a similar value. One is money, the other is currency, a promise to pay issued by the government. Think about how over time, the difference in value each will hold. In 1978, when I was 18, gold was 168.00 an oz. Yesterday it was 1750.00. Has the price of gold increased or the value of the dollar decreased? Food for thought.\n\nEstablishing a rock solid foundation is critical. \nTell yourself that 10% of all I earn is mine to keep. Repeat it daily, take it to heart. 10 PERCENT OF ALL I EARN IS MINE TO KEEP.   Worth repeating, over and over until it gets so deeply ingrained it is what you do without even thinking about it. \n10% to keep and to invest. That's only 10 bucks out of every hundred. You spend that on 2 trips to the drive through coffee place or a fast food meal and never give it a second thought.\n\nEstablish an emergency fund. It should be 3 to 6 months of your minimum living expenses. Put this in a bank money market account. Think of this as an insurance policy, something you never spend.  \n\nEstablish a long term savings account for major purchases. Amount varies depending on your goal.  If you're planning on purchasing a vehicle or real estate, put aside money to make that happen. \n\nThere is good debt and bad. Stay out of \"bad debt\" like credit cards. Never put anything on a credit card that which you cannot pay off by the end of the billing cycle. \nA good credit rating is like gold in the bank. The better your credit, the better interest rate you get. Establish credit early and use it prudently. \n\nAfter you have a solid foundation on which to build  remember that savers are loosers, except for the intended goals stated above. Savings depreciate in value over time.  INVEST! Remember your 10%?  do more if you can. If you have an employer that will contribute matching funds into a retirement account, max it out!  A employer that offers tax deferred 401 k or 457, same thing.  Most all of them are in stock market mutual funds of some kind. That's not an option? Self directed Roth IRA.  Learn the magic power of compounding interest.\n\nChoose investments wisely, investing is a little like gambling. You place your bet that a stock is going to rise in value, not fall. That real estate investment will rise in value. Do your homework. Due diligence pays dividends. I cannot stress the importance of this enough. Diversify your holdings, never put all of your shillings in one basket. I can't tell you what to buy, only what i would do at the moment. \n\nStock markets are fluid and ever changing. With experience  comes foresight, the ability to pick more winning investments than loosing ones.  Look at the economy, look at trends. Especially look at investors like Warren Buffet. Emulate what successful investors like him do. If Buffet buys a gold mine and drops airline stocks from his portfolio, what should you do?  Create a power group.

Here it goes.\n\nSo, I don't know if you have ever played Halo Wars, so I don't want to bore you with how the game works if you already know but I will start with the basics. In Halo Wars, you have a mobile base. The mobile base can have different buildings that do different things. So, you have the Airport, Vehicle Depot, Barracks, Reactor and Supply Pad. The reactor supplies the energy needed to build your vehicles, the Barracks train troops and, most importantly for my theory, the Supply Pad brings in resources at a consistent cadence throughout the match.\n\nSo, when you get \"resources,\" you can spend them on training soldiers, building vehicles or aircraft, or on attacks against the enemy. To me, selling premium is like getting resources - money that comes in on a daily, weekly, monthly basis that I can then use to buy \"soldiers, vehicles, aircraft\" which are the long-term investments. Right now, all my long-term investments are in my Roth IRA, HSA & 401(k). Eventually, my hope is to get it to a point that there is also an individual taxable with long-term investments or some kind of other alternative (like Fundrise or something), but we've got a while to go. Before we do that we'd have to max out HSA, 401(k), my Roth IRA and my wife's Roth IRA and we're not there yet (I contribute to 401(k) up to max match but I do not max it out because I don't make enough money to be able to do so - not yet).\n\nThe idea is that the individual taxable is basically almost like a mitochondrium (the powerhouse of the cell), supplying the cash I need to make contributions to investment accounts that have contribution limits without having to take money from my paycheck. You need wage income to contribute to a Roth IRA, yes, but it doesn't have to be those same dollars per se. So as long as you've made $6,000, you can make that contribution.\n\nThis actually worked pretty well last year - I kept putting all my extra money into the account, and every quarter I took money out to make my 2020 Roth IRA contribution, my 2021 Roth IRA contribution and/or my 2021 HSA contributions. I plan to try to do the same this year. I only made $3,000 in realized gains in my trading account last year, so obviously not all of it was just gains - most of it was just principal that I had been churning in and out of CSPs. So, that's why the account is now smaller, but the theory still stands.\n\nTL;DR Sell premium in a taxable account, make contributions to accounts with tax benefits with said premium, idiot-proof your investing by allowing your wins to live on forever in long-term mutual funds.

As the match goes on, you can afford to buy more reactors and having 2, 3 or 4 reactors lets you do different things. Well, if you have more experience and more money in your account, eventually you can get approved for the highest level of options trading which frees you up to do naked options. In the game, having 3 reactors lets you build the nicest vehicles and also use other cool weapons/power-ups.

Couple of things.\n\nHere is the text from the book - FYI, the term \"locked-in loss\" is used in quotation marks in the book because, as you point out, you aren't technically locking in anything. So don't suspect the validity of the book, it is perhaps the most respected and esteemed text ever written on the subject.\n\n***Example:*** *For the covered write described as \"buy XYZ at 20, sell the January 20 call at $2, the stock unexpectedly drops very quickly to 16 and the following prices exist:*\n\n*XYZ common, 16;*\n\n*XYZ January 20 call, 0.50; and*\n\n*XYZ January 15 call, 2.50.*\n\n*The covered writer is faced with a difficult choice. He currently has an unrealized loss of 2.50 points - a 4-point loss on the stock which is partially offset by a 1.50-point gain on the January 20 call. This represents a fairly substantial percentage loss on his investment in a short period of time. He could do nothing, hoping for the stock to recover its loss. Unfortunately, this may prove to be wishful thinking.* \n\n*If he considers rolling down, he will not be excited by what he sees. Suppose that the writer wants to roll down from the January 20 to the January 15. He would thus buy the January 20 call at 0.50 and sell the January 15 at 2.50, for a net credit of 2 points. By rolling down, he is obligating himself to sell his stock at 15, the strike price of the January 15 call. Suppose XYZ were above 15 in January and were called away. How would the writer do? He would lose 5 points on his stock, since he originally bought it at 20 and is selling it at 15. This 5-point loss is substantially offset by his option profits, which amount to 4 points. However, his net result is a 1-point loss.*\n\nHe goes on to say that this would still be the correct move to exit a trade that has moved against you if exiting the trade is your goal. Now, as you point out (and he may actually get into this later in the book, I haven't gotten into the section about calendar spreads and whatnot yet), if you roll out in time, in this hypothetical example you may be able to sell a $15 call for enough premium to cover that $1 loss and more. Maybe you can even sell, say, a $17.50 call for $3 out 4-5 months. But, then you are stuck bagholding a stock that is showing substantially weakening technicals and you will have contracts further and further out in time keeping you holding onto a sinking ship. Your losses would be partially offset by credits - but it's worthwhile to remember that stocks can go to zero and if you are selling covered calls on a company that is deteriorating fast, no amount of options selling and rolling is going to totally right that ship.\n\nNow, if this is something like $INTC gapping down because of some stuff and the stock starts recovering immediately, what you're talking about probably makes sense - roll out in time, let the kinks work out. That could be a valid approach - but it isn't always the best move. Maybe you're looking at somebody who bought $NKLA at $70 and sold $70 calls only to watch the stock crater down and down and down. Could you have figured out a way to roll and roll and roll and end up getting your cost basis down to market price or less? Yeah, maybe. But maybe not. And it's worth noting that while you are defending your trade, your capital isn't being deployed elsewhere.

All that means is that the short-term trend is now higher than the longer-term trend. It means the stock is on an uptrend. Does that mean it's going to the moon? No. Does a golden cross mean it'll go up 10% in a day? No. But it's an indicator. Whether it goes up or down afterwards, you learn something either way.\n\nOne real life example - when $VIAC totally blew up, it stopped on a time at the 200-day EMA at the $45 level and hung out there for three days.

Momentum exists as far as people believe there is momentum.\n\nFor example, during the GSX blow up in the last little while, you could literally watch GSX *bounce* off the 30.00 mark.

When you write a CC, you net some premium. That premium, however, is completely fungible. Cash is cash. Cash does not carry a memory of where it came from (except for tax purposes). You could just as soon say \"I sold CCs on AAPL to lower my cost basis on my MSFT shares.\" The reason people don't say that is because of narrow framing bias, where they view individual positions or tickers as separately existing atomistic entities segregated from their portfolio as a whole.\n\nIn fact, let me be bolder. You can even say...\n\n\"I got a raise at work in order to lower my coast basis on MSFT shares\"\n\n\"I sold my Tesla to lower my cost basis on TSLA shares\"\n\n\"I won a scratch off lotto ticket to lower my cost basis on GME shares\"\n\n...and it would make just as much sense (tax implications notwithstanding). *Money is money.*\n\nWhich is to say you aren't lowering your cost basis at all.

Do you see why what she's doing makes no sense? There's no law that says she HAS to recoup losses from GME shares with gains from GME CCs. She can make any number of plays and recoup her cash all the same. But she won't, because she genuinely thinks CCs \"lower cost basis.\"\n\nThe top comment does call her out on this, fortunately.

{"title": "Hitch a $RIDE to the Moon: Technical Analysis of Lordstown Motors", "selftext": "**PART 1: Introduction**\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. I might be the guy who used his emergency fund to take out puts on SPY, why would you blindly listen to me? Trading is a hobby for me and I hope to share a potentially great find with you all and teach some new skills along the way\n\nThis might not be the first time you have heard of Lordstown Motors ($RIDE). It seems people are finally starting to warm up to the company now that some positive news has come out, and I’m all for it. I’ve been chart watching this for a while and I’m glad people are finally starting to see through the veil of drama and realize being bullish on a prospective company is not some pipe dream, a feeling plenty of you should be familiar with. Because since when do we find Hindenburg Research, literally five dudes with a lot of money and a focus on “activist short selling”, coming in like your wife’s mean boyfriend on Christmas eve to tell you that Santa Clause isn’t real, to be a credible source?\n\nBut enough metaphors. Lordstown motors is an electric vehicle focused on developing the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. If any of you are like me, you aren’t convinced by just one guy on the internet screaming “$STONK to the moon!”, you need to see proof that Lady Market is having another mood swing and changing her mind on the stock.\n\nSo that’s what I intend to do. I won’t give you the same boring old rundown of fundamentals that you get plenty of. If you want some of that [check out the post that was just made on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Instead, using technical analysis and a bunch of pretty crayon drawings, I will prove that not just I, but the market is changing its tone towards $RIDE. I’ve learned that the way to make significant money in this market is to find and bet on [oversold stocks like $RIDE](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lordstown-motors-becomes-oversold-ride-2021-04-05) that have all of the FUD priced in; live and die by the motto “buy the fear, sell the greed”. I believe $RIDE is the type of stock that traders will begin to buy hand over fist in the coming days and weeks, and hopefully I can teach some fresh blood a new skill along the way.\n\nIf you find yourself falling asleep at any point, just skip through and look at the pretty pictures like a Dr Seuss book.\n\n**PART 2: Technical Analysis**\n\nNow, as I already laid out, I believe that $RIDE is undervalued, however my style of trading rarely forms opinions based off of fundamentals alone. I prefer to trade on indicators. Many people have told me I read tea leaves, they call me John D Cuckefeller, and if you feel the same then read no further. But it's no coincidence that stocks tend to follow these indicators, and they are what led me to start liking the stock to begin with.\n\n**Volume and Short Interest:**\n\nBefore we get into the technical analysis, I’d like to address this sub’s favorite market mechanic: short sales. According to the numbers given to us by [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/ride), short volume reached its recent peak directly after the short report, and has largely fallen and consolidated since then. Why are we seeing a consolidation period after a short attack? It is my belief that many of the shorts are beginning to take their profits and leave, realizing the stock has the potential for a huge rally. Not only are they scared of people like you, who will target a stock just to hurt short-sellers, but they also realize that we have found the floor for this stock and will begin an upswing off of this, and don’t want to stick around to be spammed with diamond emojis and prank pizza orders for Harambe to their moms house.\n\nEven given all this, $RIDEs short volume is up 46 percent from last month, [to a total of 12.5 percent the total float](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RIDE/short-interest/). And even more interesting to me is the fact that since the recent [reveal of the endurance betas](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/04/lmc-reveals-endurance-betas/) the short volume ratio has increased again to around 24 percent with no significant increase in volume. No significant changes in volume and an increase in short interest from an actual working product? Sounds like a few people had too much of a vested interest in Lordstown being “3-4 years away from production” like the bears claimed.\n\nThis is, in my opinion, *very significant* as it indicates the catalyst is probably not priced into the stock yet.\n\n**Relative Strength**\n\nFor anyone who’s a fan of indicators, it should be obvious that $RIDE is massively oversold, to the point where demand can’t go anywhere but up. Just look at any relative strength oscillator; many traders use the RSI but I prefer to use the Stochastics. I won’t get too mathematical on you, but this chart essentially shows us the demand of a stock. Pretty simple. $RIDE has been in the 20th percentile oversold range for some time now, and is just starting to creep out now that demand is increasing for the stock. Rumors can’t last forever and the market is showing uncertainty in the current downward momentum. This should be seen as the first sign of renewed investor confidence in the company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The relative strength of $RIDE, shown by Stochastics. More oversold just means more fuel for the explosion](https://preview.redd.it/jdeugezrvsr61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=a32d3b1fa3326fdff20c09b406c4780db04df869)\n\n**MACD:**\n\nThis indicator line nicely plots out momentum behind current movements and can tell you when support in the opposite direction is beginning to form. Don’t overcomplicate this; when the purple line is above the orange line, the stock (often) goes up, and when it’s below the orange line it goes down. Traders use the crossovers of these two lines as an indicator of breakout events. In times of high volatility, violent swings in the MACD above and below the centerline can often result in violent reversals when they cross again. A great example can be seen with the MACD a couple weeks ago on a favorite around here; GameStop:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MACD analysis on GME. Anyone else remember the massive FUD during this time?](https://preview.redd.it/hl89sol1wsr61.jpg?width=1185&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=458e07447e4bc8462a3e6e982d2e67d493010e1d)\n\nI noticed this crossover beginning to form, and that week when everyone was shitting on GME I bought more like any good retard would do. The MACD predicted the reversal perfectly by showing how downwards momentum was beginning to shift. The violent downswing below the centerline resulted in a violent upswing, and the rest should be obvious. A crossover event occurred and it rocketed from 40 to 150+ the very next day. I couldn't predict how much it would go up but one thing was clear: the MACD told us it was very unlikely to go down more, and in a time of great FUD, I bought more.\n\nNow lets take a look at the MACD for $RIDE. Does the chart below give anyone else Déjà vu? Or did is it just me? Using what we've learned about the MACD and seeing the real-world example with GME, just take a look for yourself with $RIDE:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MACD analysis on $RIDE, looking absolutely bullish AF. A thing of beauty 🚀🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/vsf3zynawsr61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=0970eb9794859538a9eade2fe7ab539c10842080)\n\nThis was the first thing I noticed when I found this stock a couple weeks ago. Historically, the MACD has predicted massive uptrends before based on being very far below the center. Similarly, we recently had another event that spread mass doubt on $RIDE and pushed the MACD far below the center line in a violent manner (I wonder what it was).\n\nDespite the price continuing to decrease the past 2 weeks, the MACD line has flattened out and finally crossed the signal line in orange. This is a good sign that negative pressure is decreasing and one thing is for sure, the stock is not likely to go much lower in the short term. With the recent dip in the moving average being so far below the centerline, $RIDE is honestly primed for ignition and I've been buying. When you see a MACD like this, I don’t really have many reasons not to buy and follow the trend except maybe if the Great Depression Part 2 is starting.\n\n**Price Action:**\n\nPRICE ACTION!!!\n\nThe most important indicator of all. It's easy to get caught up in all the pretty colors and forget about the bigger picture of price action. A change in things like volume and overall trend means more than any indicator, which should be used to contextualize the price action and not the other way around. For the sake of simplicity, I won’t go too far into this one. Individual candlesticks are valuable, but in the bigger picture we can see that the current price seems to be at a historical floor at the moment, and more importantly, the price action and volume is trading in a narrow range of consolidation for the past week or so. Specifically, a breakout above 14 dollars or below 10 could easily spark a much greater movement of volume and price. We don’t need to force anything or look at fancy charts to figure this out, but instead just look at the actions of real market participants.\n\nCombining the price action with the other indicators to give context is where things get really juicy and we can find some unexpected things.\n\n[Positive divergence of the MACD and price action. Momentum is increasing against a bearish price trend, and price is now consolidating before liftoff](https://preview.redd.it/0k28fdixwsr61.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ed734f7bac97d0982b7f0791bf4e6df33c3b017)\n\nInstead of the smooth 1-day period chart, we’re looking at a 4-hour period for more details. Notice how the price action has been in a trend down but the MACD has been in a trend up? This is called positive divergence, and is a result of a stocks momentum not agreeing with its current trending direction, which is a pretty big deal. Many traders use divergence in addition to the other indicators to assess the likelihood of a reversal, and based on the other factors and presence of a catalyst, I believe a reversal is being foreshadowed right in front of us. As of just yesterday, April 6th, the divergence resulted in the MACD crossing above the centerline, indicating that the price action has started seeking an uptrend. This is significant reason to believe that a breakout above resistance is much more likely than a crash, a huge amount of upward pressure is building. The price is currently consolidating in an area of low volatility, and though I don’t want to get too far into the Bollinger Band indicator, this could result in a “[Bollinger Band Squeeze](https://www.tradingsetupsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BollingerandKeltnerSqueezeExample.jpg)” upwards very soon.\n\nThese are the indicators I use for any stock I look at, and for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. There is just too much potential for an explosion right now upwards of $30-$35, and not enough potential for a further crash, to justify ignoring this.\n\n**PART 3: Catalysts and Fundamentals**\n\nSince indicators are driven by price action, which is itself driven by catalysts, they usually won’t run far without some sort of news to cling on to. As far as catalysts go, Lordstown did just release their [beta trucks](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas) last week. News which, I cannot stress enough, *I DO NOT THINK THIS CATALYST IS PRICED IN YET* as discussed earlier. They are also [showcasing their truck in one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable at the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race](https://www.autoweek.com/racing/more-racing/a35598958/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/) in Mexico's Baja California Peninsula on April 17 (less than 10 days away). Not to mention their market cap when compared to their worse-off competitors. The current price just doesn’t make sense.\n\nI also I like the design of the truck itself; image is everything, especially when compared to some of its competitors (I’m sorry Canoo bulls but wtf is that thing? Not to mention the Cybertruck). Lordstown is targeting commercial fleets and government contracts initially. Yesterday, the Camping World CEO tweeted a [leak to an RV that Lordstown is working on](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) (the Lordstown logo is in the center of the wheel) through [their partnership](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx). The electric RV market could be huge. The catalysts are plenty but the market is still timid, for now.\n\n**PART 4: Conclusion**\n\nWell, I hope you learned a few things from this post, even if I end up being wrong about everything I laid out here. As I stated, this is not my full-time job; I do this as a hobby. Feel free to ask me any questions regarding this info; I know some of the technical analysis can be confusing. Knowledge is power among the knowledge impaired.\n\nAnd for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. It has all the same signals that make me love other big names around here, and there is just too much potential for an explosion right now and not enough potential for a further crash, to justify ignoring this. Lest we all forget [Morgan Stanley’s 10$ price target on Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html), have a good $RIDE everyone, and don’t let the short bugs bite.\n\n**Positions:** 65 shares at 12.94, 2x $20 07/16C, 1x 15$ 01/21/22c\n\n**EDIT:** Forgot to add, but per page 21 of [this slide deck](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/ef77bce6-b19a-4288-a651-e08089f1362f), the current replacement value of Lordstown’s 6.2 million square foot factory is over $3 billion, but the current market cap of $RIDE is only $2.01 billion. An EV stock that is trading almost 50% below its asset value? Come on now. Everything I’m seeing is screaming buy.\n\n**TLDR;**\n\nI love $RIDE’s pretty charts, and there is way too much technical upside here to ignore. IMO, $RIDE is poised for a breakout, and this is the type of chart that technical traders will begin noticing and placing big bets on. $RIDE to the moon 🚀🚀🚀", "id": "mma558", "created_utc": 1617824434.0, "score": 1512, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 944, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "The blow award was a nice touch by this community.

Beyond that, based on what I have seen from virtually every other EV maker (including Tesla) projections as to when they are getting to production are rarely met.
