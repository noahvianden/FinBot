Over-the-air software updates allow owners of select Ford vehicles to  update software from the convenience of their own garage.\n\nFord is targeting to sell more than 100,000 vehicles equipped with  BlueCruise in the first year, based on company sales and take-rate  projections.\n\n**Mother of All Road Trips becomes the ultimate Ford test drive**\n\nAll 10 test vehicles ‚Äì one departing from Palo Alto, California, the  others from Dearborn, Michigan ‚Äì spent much of last November and  December winding their way across the United States and Canada. Test  drivers searched for every conceivable road condition and highway  driving scenario, monitoring the system‚Äôs performance, collecting data  and highlighting areas where improvements could be made.\n\nThe trip marked the final leg of a development process that ran up  more than a half-million miles in a series of shorter test drives, each  designed to evaluate a specific aspect of BlueCruise. As real-world  validation of those earlier tests, road trip enabled the system to scan  for variances in road signage, lane markings, exit ramps, traffic  patterns and weather.\n\n‚ÄúI drive long-distance quite often, whether out to Boston or down to  Florida to visit family or friends, and usually I mentally tire out on  drives that far,‚Äù said Alexandra Taylor, BlueCruise feature development  engineer, who logged more than 3,000 miles in an F-150 on the trek. ‚ÄúThe  one thing that became clear is that, when using BlueCruise, long drives  aren‚Äôt nearly as mentally taxing to me.‚Äù\n\nTaylor and fellow BlueCruise engineer Shruti Gotadki set out on an  eight-day journey that wound through the southeast United States,  targeting driving differences between Jacksonville, Louisville, Atlanta  and other major urban areas.\n\nBack at the Ford lab, driver-assist technology supervisor Justin  Teems monitored the progress of the entire fleet, corralling important  data that will help shape BlueCruise driving experience in the months  and years ahead.\n\n‚ÄúIt was like mission control,‚Äù Teems said. ‚ÄúWe really wanted to push  BlueCruise to its limits. Every state builds roads a little differently.  When you include factors like lane line degradation, weather and  construction, building a hands-free driving system becomes extremely  complex. Those complexities are why Ford has the best team of engineers  in the world working on it.‚Äù\n\n**BlueCruise, the evolution of Ford Co-Pilot360 Technology**\n\nUsing both advanced camera and radar-sensing technologies and  building upon Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go, Lane  Centering and Speed Sign Recognition, BlueCruise adds a new level of  convenience for drivers with vehicles equipped with Ford Co-Pilot360  Technology. The feature allows a driver to operate truly hands-free on  prequalified sections of divided highways called Hands-Free Blue Zones. A  driver-facing camera in the instrument cluster monitors eye gaze and  head position to help ensure the driver‚Äôs eyes remain on the road.\n\nCurrently, more than 100,000 miles of highways across North America  are dedicated Hands-Free Blue Zones in the Ford GPS mapping system.  BlueCruise uses blue lighting on the digital instrument cluster to  indicate when the vehicle is in a hands-free zone.\n\nIn addition to the full hands-free mode, equipped vehicles will also  feature Lane Centering mode. Lane Centering works on most roads with  lane lines and can help keep the vehicle centered in its lane but  requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. In either  mode, a visual prompt on the instrument cluster notifies drivers when  they need to return their attention to the road or resume control of the  vehicle.\n\nBlueCruise is an SAE Level 2 driver-assist technology, similar to  Tesla Autopilot but with the advantage of offering a true hands-free  driving experience while in Hands-Free Mode that does not require a  driver‚Äôs hands to stay in contact with the steering wheel, unless  prompted by vehicle alerts.\n\nAnd unlike other approaches ‚Äì such as GM‚Äôs Super Cruise, which uses  red and green lighting, or Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot, which requires a driver  keep their hands on the steering wheel ‚Äì BlueCruise communicates with  drivers in different ways. The instrument cluster transitions to  communicate that the feature is in Hands-Free mode through text and blue  lighting cues, effective even for those with color blindness.\n\n**More highways and features to come**\n\nBeyond the 2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E, additional Ford  vehicles will also receive BlueCruise hands-free driving technology,  while current owners continue to receive over-the-air software updates  to add new features and capabilities in the coming years.\n\nFuture enhancements are planned to include Lane Change Assist that  will let the vehicle change lanes with just a tap of the turn signal  indicator, and Predictive Speed Assist that will adjust vehicle speed  for road curves, roundabouts and more.\n\nFord also plans to offer regular mapping updates for the technology  to recognize changes plus thousands of miles of planned new road  additions.\n\n**Affordable** **hands-free highway driving technology**\n\n2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E customers will be able to purchase  BlueCruise software ‚Äì including a three-year service period ‚Äì for $600  in the second half of 2021, when it‚Äôs ready to launch. Hardware pricing  varies by vehicle.\n\nFor F-150, BlueCruise is available as a part of the Ford Co-Pilot 360  Active 2.0 package for a total of $1,595 ‚Äì $600 for the software and  $995 for the hardware. The Ford Co-Pilot 360 Active 2.0 package is  standard on F-150 Limited and available as an option on Lariat, King  Ranch and Platinum models.\n\nFor Mustang Mach-E, BlueCruise comes standard on CA Route 1, Premium  and First Edition variants. It‚Äôs an available package on the Select trim  for $3,200 ‚Äì $ 600 for the software and $2,600 for the rest of the  package ‚Äì as part of the larger Comfort and Technology package, which  includes features such as a 360-degree camera, heated front seats and  heated steering wheel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsource: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/04/14/ford-mother-of-all-road-trips-bluecruise-hands-free-driving.html", "id": "mqpreu", "created_utc": 1618404200.0, "score": 129, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 170, "comments": [{"body": "At this point, I think basically every car manufacturer will probably get up to at least level 2 ADAS.

Outside of incentives, every Mach-E has a price tag that is non-negotiable and made clear upfront.

The biggest cloud over it for me is whether bitcoins volatility is going to start to subside with institutional investors creating selling pressure on the runs and buying pressure on the dips. I think we‚Äôre starting to see a bit of that already,  not all that long ago many people thought the run was likely over once again, but then instead of the big drop, we had *tons* of support which was later revealed to be the likes of Tesla and other institutions \n\nSo, we‚Äôre at all time highs right now. great time to IPO, maybe not the best time to buy. I do believe they‚Äôll add more cryptos to their exchange, which will be a large increase in revenue (this is where binance has the edge currently) but ultimately bitcoin is going to be the largest contributing factor. The next bear market is going to be the most interesting to me, I‚Äôm really interested to see how it evolves with institutions involved now rather than just the emotional retail side alone we‚Äôve had in the past. I‚Äôd love to see the next bottom be a less violent retraction with strong support from these institutions, that additional confirmation that the institutions are here to support the price would be more than enough for me to jump in. By then, market discovery takes its place, hype dies down a bit, and you can be sure you‚Äôre getting a mostly fair price with a higher ceiling to run up to. \n\nWhat I‚Äôve learned dealing with crypto related things is it‚Äôs not so much about price as it is about the emotions surrounding the market. If no one is talking about bitcoin you can literally close your eyes and market buy and you‚Äôll make an absolute killing. it has been a highly emotional market dominated by retail thus far. Right now everyone is extremely excited. That alone gives me pause regardless of what their financials say right now.  \n\nTo put on a bit of a tin foil hat about speculation, the biggest long term case is obviously bitcoin continuing to grow in adoption, but I‚Äôm also really interested in seeing this type of exchange done for actual securities as well. Imagine something like ERC20 tokens representing shares of AAPL I can actually take private key ownership of. damn that‚Äôd be really fucking cool. We‚Äôre talking about the ability to transact 24/7, peer to peer if desired, and in used more ways than just simple stock market exchange. A serious reduction in the fraud on our exchanges.

Until especially tech growth stocks started correcting in mid February. I also had such a great adrenaline loaded time, but the truth is: this was not normal and that is okay.\n\nSome general advice:\n\n* Your first and absolute top priority should be to create an emergency budget with 3-6 months worth of your normal life expenditures in it. This money does not belong into the stock market and should never be touched except during an unplanned emergency situation.\n* Your second highest priority should be to use your 20s to invest as much time and effort into yourself. You get wealthy (w/o inheritance) through 3 factors: Your income, your spending habits and proper investment choices. To massively increase your first factor, income, you should be spending as much energy as possible into your education and value to the job market. Believe me, if you do this, you won't be bored for very long that your option plays didn't work out.\n* Parallel to your education, you should already start budgeting. Now this does **not** mean that you're not allowed to have fun anymore. This means that you give yourself limits on how much fun you're allowed to have (money-wise) and plan how you manage your money in general. In reality this means that, as soon as you receive any paycheck or money, you pay your bills in full, take part of it and put it into a savings account (to have fun in the future, e.g. travel, holidays, car, whatever) and put something into your investment depot. **After** these three criteria are fulfilled, you can do whatever you want with the rest of your money! And that's so nice! You have absolute freedom this way and a clear conscience!\n\nRegarding stocks / investing:\n\n* I participated in some risky trades myself recently, but not with options. I use a virtual portfolio to play around from time to time with options but mostly get f\\*cked by my trades. That's why for myself, I concluded that this is to risky. Especially short options can in theory go to negative infinity (the real stock value just keeps rising). In short: With options you can get badly hurt.\n* **However:** I'm not the one to tell you to invest everything into index funds or ETFs. I do believe that most of your regular investment should flow into those, but, you can allow yourself a little 'gambling' or 'speculation' money. You know, for the shits and giggles.\n* If you like to learn more about index investing, you should check out Ben Felix on YouTube.\n\nSome final words: Don't let yourself get pulled down by your loss, it's only money. Especially if you're young, you can still afford to make risky decisions and mistakes. Always restrict yourself to money you can afford to lose when speculating. Time in the market beats timing the market (I know, 'blah blah blah, you're boring', but it's true): [https://imgur.com/gallery/BlK4jzM](https://imgur.com/gallery/BlK4jzM)\n\nIf, by your question \"How to bounce back after losing so much?\" you mean something like \"How to make big money quick so my mind monkey is happy again?\", you are going to have a bad time.

I started to progress in software sales, and the company I was working at (which was publicly traded) tripled in value, so my equity went from $30K to \\~$100K.  I also made some bets on Square and other stocks, and reinvested all my savings into tech stocks, and bet on margin.  I ended up with about a total life savings of $300K after about 4 years.  From there, my sales manager was a total dick and was verbally abusive, and I thought to myself, I'd rather risk all my money to never be in this position again.

As I saw TSLA drop in value, I became convinced more then ever that this was it, and I bet my entire life savings on the company.

There's significant psychological issues that come up when your wealth increases by that much, that quickly, it was like winning the lottery.  I felt the urge to diversify, but continued to hold on.  I ended up buying call options, and also did covered calls.  The stock continued to go up, and I rolled those covered calls out.

Because what kind of retard would give away this goldmine of information for free?\n\nMe. That‚Äôs whomst.\n\nSo who am I? Well, a month ago I posted [DD warning about GME](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7l0p0/gme_disinfo_exposed_1_why_the_gme_moass_post_that/) and sentiment manipulation in WSB.

If you want to be angry at me about GME, go ahead and downvote, skip everything in this post and head straight for the comments section, my dudes.\n\nEnough about me. Let‚Äôs talk stock. Let's talk Hyliion.\n\n*Note: This is an interactive post. That means you're expected to click the links before you leave a dumbass comment.*\n\n# HYLIION (HYLN): The fuck???\n\nHyliion is a company that develops and sells electric powertrain systems for transport trucks involved in long-distance trucking. Their drivetrain -- the Hypertruck ERX -- is fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) and/or renewable natural gas (RNG), which are MUCH more green than diesel, which is used by most trucking companies. RNG can even achieve **negative emissions**. You know when you turn loose an earth-shaking fart in a very public setting, and you just wish you could suck that noxious gas back up inside you to avoid further humiliation from that flower-wilting smell? Well, this is almost identical to that. Kind of.\n\nI know what you're thinking: *\"So what? This dinosaur can un-fart gas. Aren't we moving away from gas and towards fully electric, hydrogen-powered, and nuclear fusion-powered vehicles anyway?\"*\n\nThere's a few things to keep in mind:\n\n* Stuff needs to get shipped TODAY\n* There **aren't** enough plug-in refueling stations for **transport trucks** in the US\n* There **aren't** enough hydrogen refueling stations in the US (only 39 currently)\n* There **are** currently enough CNG and RNG refueling stations for the trucking industry\n* CNG/RNG is currently 1/12 the price of hydrogen and 1/7 the price of electric refueling\n* In the future, CNG/RNG will be 1/3 the price of hydrogen, and 1/2 the price of electric refueling\n* HYLN's powertrain is designed specifically to be able to be used with hydrogen in the future, anyway\n* Trucking companies aren't going to want to wait around [30 minutes](https://www.businessinsider.com/this-expert-says-tesla-semi-is-economically-and-ecologically-pointless-2019-2) for their trucks to get an 80% charge every [500 miles](https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a34774933/musk-now-says-621-miles-of-range-for-tesla-semi/) (source: latest max range \\* 80%) using a theoretical megacharger station which [doesn't even exist](https://www.torquenews.com/11663/tesla-looking-develop-so-called-megachargers-tesla-semi-trucks) currently, and also lose 1 ton in carrying capacity due to the weight of the battery\n\nSource: [https://i.ibb.co/WpQy5NL/hylnfuel.png](https://i.ibb.co/WpQy5NL/hylnfuel.png)\n\nHYLN's powertrain also offers other advantages:\n\n* Increases efficiency and reduces cost of gas for truckers by up to 35% (one of the biggest costs for trucking companies)\n* Drastically increases pulling power up hills (time is money, dongus)\n* Software uses machine learning that optimizes driving patterns, introducing further savings\n* Eliminates need for idling vehicle when truckers are staying overnight in the cabin with a couple of \"friends of the road\"\n\nI can hear you now: \"*But I like Tesla because that's what the attractive people on CNBC told me to like!\"*\n\nTesla is pretty cool. But you know what else is cool?\n\n*A* [*fucking battery*](https://i.ibb.co/NY8xcTT/hylnbattery.png) *that can recharge in 8 minutes, lasts 5x as long as conventional EV batteries, and is so safe that you can* ***shoot a fucking bullet and not worry about it exploding***\\*.\\*\n\nYou hear that sound?\n\n*RING... RING...*\n\n\"Hello, who's there?\"\n\n\"Yes, this is the US Military, and we would like to take your fucking stonk to $100 a share, please.\"\n\n**Key takeaway:**\n\nHyliion's powertrains will be an extremely important bridge for the transition from dirty diesel to hydrogen/electric powered vehicles. Hyliion's product will be able to run on hydrogen in the future. Hyliion has the most badass battery out there, and can be used for military and commercial purposes. HYLN's got ya bases covered, boy.\n\n# Financials: Green Giant (Dick)\n\nHyliion is currently valued at 1.65b. It currently has 650m in the fucking *cash*. This means that the company is valued at less than 3x its current cash holdings. It's a sneeze away from being priced at bankruptcy value. So why is it valued so low? High debt? Burning through cash? Insiders selling? Bad news?\n\nFucking **nah**. None of those.\n\nFor starters, HYLN used some of its cash reserves to extinguish all of its debt last quarter. It currently has **no fucking debt**. That must be why Wall St hates the stock so much: Wall St really likes stocks that take out a shitton of debt so that they can help the company issue additional shares and dilute the stock and fuck over shareholders and allow bankers to pocket tidy sums. **No debt is good for the company**. **It's great for shareholders.** **Bankers hate this one simple trick**.\n\nNow, it's true Hyliion had a negative earnings last quarter of -0.13. So, for every share, HYLN lost 13 cents over the quarter. Know what else had a negative EPS? Fucking *Amazon* in 2014. This shit doesn't matter to HYLN. They only lost 32m last year. They would have to lose that same amount every single year for 20 years -- and then not qualify for any loans -- before they want bankrupt. Not to mention that this 32m they lost last year factors in the debt that they paid off, so future losses should be even smaller! That shit is just unfathomable. They're a **growth** company. This year is when they're **supposed to** lose money. So when do they start making money? They're projecting 2b in revenue in 2024 -- y'know, *more than the entire market cap of the company currently.* Can you say \"undervalued\"? I know it's a lot of syllables, so maybe ask your wife's private male yoga instructor to coach you through it.\n\n# Hyliion and The News -- Why Good is Bad and Why Bad is Nonexistant:\n\nHyliion recently released two extremely positive pieces of news for the company:\n\n1. The revolutionary EV battery\n2. Formation of the Hypertruck Council\n\nI already talked about the battery. The stock popped 70% after this press release and has since drastically sold off.\n\nThe formation of the Hypertruck Council is goddamn massive. Basically, HYLN assembled a group of industry leaders in logistics and trucking to help inform them of the best way to move the ERX towards mass commercialization. They'll be providing feedback, suggesting changes, conducting testing, and, presumably, eventually purchase their vehicles if they like what they see. And I'm not talking about some rinky-dink companies. I'm talking real Big Dick Boys with over a hundred thousand trucks that could potentially use HYLN's hypertruck. To name just a few: Agility Logistics, American Natural Gas, Wegmans Food Markets, Anheuser-Busch. You know that last one! They make the shitty beer your cool friend Dave used to open with his forehead and drink foamy beer from when you were still a virgin in college. The stock popped 11% the morning it was announced, and closed the day at 0%. What the fuck.\n\nHyliion hasn't released any new negative news. Their path to profitability is the same as it has always been.\n\n# Recent Insider Sales (Simple English: These are bad!)\n\nNone.\n\n# Recent Insider Buys (Simple English: These are good!)\n\n[300,000 shares over the past 3 months](https://preview.redd.it/fedm83x61us61.jpg?width=789&auto=webp&s=c3fc1c8aacc7a2987e91c9eb05bfc151fd2b275a)\n\nInsiders must believe in the company, otherwise they wouldn't be buying shares for MUCH higher than HYLN's current trading price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, given all of this good shit, why is the stock red? Let's finally get to the meat and plums of this thing:\n\n# HYLN Stock: redder than your crush's boyfriend's bed sheets on prom night\n\nHYLN is down 83% from its all-time highs. By any metric, it was overvalued at ATHs. However, it's down 34% in the past month alone, and 63% in the past 6 months, when it was trading at a not unreasonable valuation for a growth stock. It's currently [oversold](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/hyliion-holdings-is-now-oversold-hyln-2021-04-12), and trading below its long-term floor of $10. It's actually below the price that initial investors paid for the company when SHLL completed its acquisition of HYLN.\n\nIn fact, **every single person who has ever bought the stock (before today) is currently in the red.** And yet, the stock only has a daily [short volume of around 20%](https://i.ibb.co/C2XNDzR/hylnshortvol.png). How is this even *possible*? I think even you chimp-brains know the answer:\n\n**Manipulation.**\n\n[This article from GripRoom](https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-stock-is-being-manipulated) lists 10 different signs that a stock is being manipulated. HYLN fulfills 9/10. The only one it doesn't fulfill is #5: \"Bad news shaves off more market cap than it should\" -- because there wasn't *been* any bad news lately. Replace \"Bad news\" with \"Good news\" and we have a perfect score of 10/10.\n\n# How HYLN is being manipulated\n\nMark Delaney, an analyst for Goldman Sachs with a commendable rating of 1000 out of 7000 analysts, and an average annual return of Roughly The Market Average Over The Past Ten Years % (according to [TipRankings](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/mark-delaney)), recently downgraded that stock to $9 a share. This was after downgrading the stock to $11 a share just two months prior. Once again, I must reiterate that there has been **no negative news for HYLN** during these past two months, and only very positive news. The same day he issued a Sell rating for HYLN, he issued a Buy target for Lordstown Motors (RIDE) with a price target 100% higher than its current trading price. He issued this Buy rating despite RIDE currently being [under investigation by the SEC](https://www.wfmj.com/story/43555603/lordstown-motors-knew-of-sec-investigation-month-before-public-announcement) for fraud by misleading investors about [preorders, and other material information](https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/firm-exposed-nikola-calls-lordstown-motors-mirage).\n\nSo why is GS downgrading HYLN, and upgrading a company under investigation for fraud? It could have something to do with this:\n\n>Lordstown CEO Steve Burns and DiamondPeak CEO David Hamamoto will sit on the combined company's board.  \n>  \n>Goldman Sachs is the exclusive financial adviser and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is the legal adviser to DiamondPeak, while Goldman Sachs is serving as exclusive placement agent on the PIPE offering.\n\nIn other words, Goldman Sachs:\n\n* helped RIDE list on the major exchanges\n* got paid to provide \"financial advice\" to the blank check company that acquired RIDE\n* **has it in their financial interest to pump the stock in spite of fundamentals**\n\nMeanwhile, Goldman Sachs continues to downgrade HYLN while acquiring shares:\n\nHow credible is GS? I mean, they downgraded NIO to \"Sell\" July 17, 2020:\n\n>Due to Goldman Sachs's downgrade on July 17, NIO stock gave up 14 percent of its gains\n\nThis was the lowest the stock has been since that day. The stock has risen over 240% since then. [Just read this article.](https://marketrealist.com/2020/07/goldman-sachs-downgrades-nio-stock/) It's fucking hilarious. Another choice quote:\n\n>On June 2, Goldman Sachs upgraded NIO from neutral to buy. Then, 22 days later, the analyst downgraded the stock from buy to neutral based on its valuation. He downgraded NIO again 25 days later.\n\nYou could fucking right a book on this shit:\n\n*From Neutral to Buy, and Back Again: How to Cuck Retail Traders in Just 50 Days!*\n\n**These guys are fucking crooks.**\n\nAnother example. GS issued a [Buy rating for TSLA](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/goldman-sachs-upgrades-tesla-and-says-the-stock-has-massive-upside-of-over-30percent.html) on Dec 2, 2020. Six days later, they announced [an additional share offering with TSLA](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html). In other words, they pumped the stock so they could make more cocaine money from the share issuance.\n\nSo if you still haven't figured out why GS downgraded HYLN, let me spell it out for you: it's the same game that Wall Street always plays:\n\n1. Rate the stock a \"Sell\"\n2. Watch price go down\n3. Buy a bunch of shares\n4. Wait for stock to rise drastically\n5. Go back to step 1\n\nI mean really, who are you going to trust -- some suit-wearing chud who's only up 16% YoY in a market that's up 50% YoY, and whose only experience with heavy-duty batteries is replacing the ones in his wife's overused vibrator -- or an [actual trucker](https://shorturl.at/dqDF9) who knows the ins and outs of the trucking industry?\n\nI quote:\n\n>‚ÄúI know about truck driving. I know what trucking companies are looking for. I know what this type of product needs to be able to provide in order to be viable to the market. I know how truck drivers think. I know a lot about this industry. I‚Äôve been doing this for a long time.‚Äù\n\nYeah, I think when I want to know about trucking, I'll probably go with the guy who pisses in bottles and collects VDs from all over the country, rather than the guy whose only experience with 18-wheelers was holding his wife's hand and telling her how pretty she looked while she filmed a scene for [TitsNTruckers.com](https://TitsNTruckers.com)\n\n# Other sus sentiment manipulation\n\nAKA how to turn rocket emojis into fear emojis:\n\n1. [Brand new account made only to trash HYLN](https://old.reddit.com/r/Hyliion/comments/mpqsce/no_insider_sold/gucn1pz/?context=3)\n2. [This account is dead now](https://stocktwits.com/jshetty720), but the guy used to post 8 hours a day, every single day, exclusively Bearish posts about HYLN, using entirely and only emotional language. That's... that's not someone who's doing that for free.\n\nPlenty of examples of this if you spend enough time on Stocktwits.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the stock dropped below $10 to take out some stop losses and encourage selling in people promoting the \"If it breaks $10, there really is no floor!!!\" narrative, before bouncing summarily back above $10 and trending upwards again. But this part is pure speculation.\n\n# Competent Management Team\n\nThese are some of management's heavy hitters:\n\nThomas Healy -- Founder and CEO -- made Forbes' \"30 under 30\" 2 years ago. Healy's a no-nonsense engineer. He's not a pump man, and he knows his stock is a longterm investment. HYLN is his third start-up, and he's been working on it since 2015.\n\nPatrick Sexton -- Chief Technology Officer -- Served as Director of Engineering in Powertrain Innovations at Dana Incorporated for 6 years. This guy fucking *knows shit, and stuff*. AND he even has *Sex* in his name. He has a *ton* of *Sex* in his name. If that doesn't make you Bullish, I don't know what will.\n\nAndy Card --  on the Board of Directors -- Former transportation secretary and WH Chief of Staff under George W. Bush. This is kinda, yknow, *the exact sort of guy you want working as a corporate director for your company*.\n\nSherri Baker -- CFO -- Worked with Dean Foods for 8 years and Frito Lay for 10 years.\n\n# Finishing statements\n\nI know a lot of y'all got burned by HYLN before, probably buying in at $50 a share like a bunch of retards. However, you have to ask yourself: do you like the *stock*, or do you like the *hype?* If it's the latter, then I recommend waiting until the stock is at $70 and buy in right before Mark Delaney downgrades the stock to $20 or something retarded. If it's the former, do your research, ask questions, and then throw your hands in the air and say \"Fuck it! It's too complicated!\" and go ask your fucking fortune teller what you should do.\n\n[Just remember this mantra](https://i.ibb.co/zmjkntd/hylnmantra.png).\n\n**Current positions:**\n\n2800 Shares\n\n10 JAN 30 23 C\n\n10 JAN 15 23 C\n\n3 JAN 20 22 C\n\n20 SEP 21 20 C -- this will most likely die OTM but *fuck it,* I'm already down 80% on this bastard, so why not let it ride?\n\n\\-----\n\n**tl;dr: HYLN stupid cheap**\n\nedit: fixed a few typos", "id": "mqrfzf", "created_utc": 1618409622.0, "score": 821, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 352, "comments": [{"body": "Been a huge fan of HYLN since before the merger.

He says that, as momentum has turned away from HYLN, it's not the time to invest.**\n\nFact is, HYLN lost its momentum *months* ago. It's continuing to roll downhill at a steady rate, but one really good announcement could send the stock flying. Prudent investors may wish to wait until *after* positive developments are announced and momentum breaks upward, but look what occurred when that happened with the battery announcement: everyone piled into the stock, the stock mooned on good news, and then sold off. I still believe it has more upside than down at this point.\n\n**2. The cash raised could evaporate sooner than expected**\n\nAs I demonstrated in OP post, cash burn is really low for the company. At worst, it will continue to burn cash for a very long time without every becoming profitable or making any sales. This is an absolute worst case scenario, and I just don't see it as realistic based on the partnerships it's been forming. If these partnerships fall through, then I'd reevaluate the stock.\n\n**3. Cash burn will increase as research costs rise**\n\nHYLN has effectively outsourced a lot of their R&D by forming the Hypertruck Council, so I disagree with this one. Seems like a non-issue.\n\n**4. To bring its product to the commercialization phase, Hyliion will need more capital**\n\nSeems sus, given they still have huge cash reserves and no debt. They could use preorder funds for their hypertruck to sustain them until they've installed and completed sales. Since they're outsourcing the production, I don't know why they would need a massive amount of funds for commercialization. Seems just baseless speculation to me, IMO. I'd reconsider if the author provided any solid numbers.\n\n**5. Without a clear path to revenue...**\n\nThe *path* to revenue is clear, it's the likelihood of success that's not exactly clear IMO. We know *what* HYLN has to do to become profitable. We just don't know yet if trucking companies will buy into it.\n\n**6. The EV and clean energy euphoria ended a few months ago.**\n\nThis I agree with. If you look at EV and clean energy stocks, they've collectively all \"sold the news\" of the Biden administration and their infrastructure plans. However, that doesn't mean now is the time to not buy or to continue selling -- it would've been prudent to sell months ago. Is it prudent to sell *now*? That's a question worth asking. IMO, no.

{"title": "What happened today with PLTR is completely normal", "selftext": " \n\nI know that some of you are very mad, cuz you bought into the wsb hype, but what happened tha last 2 days is absolutely normal and actually should be expected. Despite the fact that some retail investors think that those kind of events are some huge catalysts, they are just events that are intended to show investors and potential customers the capabilities of the company's products.\n\nHowever, retail investors hype themselves up and buy the stock just before the event, cuz they either think that others will follow suite or that they will show some ridiculous, innovative technology or product. This of course does not happen, so they immediatly sell their shares, cuz they were in for the short-term anyway. At battery day Elon showed the huge progress that Tesla have made on potentially world-changing battery technology, but shares dumped by more than 15 percent the next day for the following reasons - 1- Tesla did not show an electric jet or a flying car 2. They did not understand anything about what was said and found the event boring 3.They were short-term traders that just played the catalyst. The same thing happened on the day that Apple showed the new Iphone- runup before the event and dump after. Both stocks are up big today.\n\nNow before you ask why didn't you sell your shares if you expected the share price to decrease, I will tell you. Most successful investors will tell you that if you actually believe in the long-term growth of the company, you should not try to time the market. I bought PLTR's CFD's (certificates for difference) at DPO and almost convinced myslef to sell at 15, cuz I throught that the rally will be unsustainable in the short-term, but I am glad that I did not do that and instead I sold at 30. I bought shares this time at 24 average price. Of course I know that even if you are a long-term investor you will still want the share price to increase in the short-term ( there is something called opportunity cost) and I personally would like it better if the company was more transparent with the media and investors, but it is what it is. Just remember that the share price will definitely increase only if PLTR accelerates its revenue growth and customer acquisitions, everything else is speculation.\n\nThis is not a financial advice and I promise you that Peter Thiel is not funding my posts.", "id": "mr0knr", "created_utc": 1618435996.0, "score": 232, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "I think the real problem is I own it... and until I sell it... it will remain red.", "score": 165, "replies": [{"body": "Ima hit you up after my next paycheck.
