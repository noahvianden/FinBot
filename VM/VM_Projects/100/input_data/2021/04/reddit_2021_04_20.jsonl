I guess if something blew up or I forgot something I‚Äôd look locally.  Anyway I‚Äôll believe physical retail when I see it.  The margins and the model still don‚Äôt make much sense to me (not just GME, I‚Äôm talking all physical retail) - commercial walk-in rents are very high relative to warehouse rents - we‚Äôre talking 3-6x more - and you need way more people per sqft than a warehouse.  Those people are idle about 50-70% of the time between customers.  Idle meaning not making a sale - they can be tidying up, restocking, etc - it supports the business, but that‚Äôs not a sale.  Amazon warehouses are actively constantly - a worker is constantly moving to fulfill orders so their cost is divided up against way more orders than a physical retailer could ever do.  \n\nGranted everyone is trying to turn physical stores into mini-warehouses and using ad hoc delivery, this has an interim effect of maybe making a small dent.  But then again Amazon is taking over unused mall space at warehouse rents (not what the mall operators used to get for sure) and coming to neighborhoods with their own fleet of trucks.

That should be the most loyal customer right?Everyone took their dollars to the lower price option.  I‚Äôm not sure anyone can compete on pricing for computer hardware - it‚Äôs pretty much the same minus promotions so maybe you have some loyalty there?

Michael Burry and DFV didn‚Äôt invest in GME for the memes. The stock has climbed 4000% in less than a year, drastically improved its balance sheet  by eliminating most of its outstanding debt without raising any capital, completely turned over its BOD, including Ryan Cohen as the new chairman and has been assembling an all star cast of leadership to implement their digital transformation.\n\nThat aside, their earnings report explicitly mentioned the possibility of a squeeze, multiple clearing house rules have been put in place regarding ‚Äúmember defaults‚Äù, the major banks are raising the highest sums EVER from issuing bonds, HFs such as Citadel have broken the law dozens of times by manipulating markets in similar ways as they are being accused of now where the fines are simply a ‚Äúcost of doing business‚Äù and nothing more. Those are all irrefutable facts that I just listed. You may read that and say, ‚ÄúI think the hedge funds have learned their lesson from the 68 previous offences and have finally decided to stop breaking the law in return for insane profits‚Äù or you could say ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say for sure what is going on, but it is *possible* that they are breaking the law for **massive** returns and finally got caught in it so deep that they can‚Äôt get out without continuing to do so‚Äù. \n\nIf you had the choice of losing all your money, credibility and going to jail for admitting fault or doing everything in your power to try and prevent this scenario by obscuring the truth for peanuts in fines, *if* they catch you, which would you choose?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "None of this is targeted at DFV buying in at pennies, this is at the mass of teenagers thinking that 140 is actually warranted and somehow undervalued still. If you are so certain the hedge funds have done all this wrong and only get fines when it DID actually squeeze, in what random world do you think even if all these fantasies of dark pools and synthetic shares would they not just do it again? Or if this was such a clear cut case why are all the other funds or large investors accelerating things and buying up all the GME they can? You people act like its just the 'apes' vs melvin or some shit.

He clearly still believes it will be worth more than it is today.\n\n> If you are so certain the hedge funds have done all this wrong and only get fines when it DID actually squeeze...\n\nWhat makes you think it did squeeze?  Plotkin (Melvin) said himself under oath in front of congress that the surge in share price at the end of January was not driven by short sellers closing out, but instead was retail and others buying in. Either he lied in front of congress, which he would have no reason to if he did close out his positions, or he told the truth and only could‚Äôve closed out *after* the January spike, which as a reminder only stoped rising because buying was literally shutoff for most retail investors. If he did close out in January then his portfolio wouldn‚Äôt have such shitty returns in March where they reported being down ~50% on the year, after having such a good first few weeks in February (when the price fell and shorts would‚Äôve done well). \n\n> ...in what random world do you think even if all these fantasies of dark pools and synthetic shares would they not just do it again? \n\nFirst off, do you not believe dark pools or synthetic shares exist or that they simply aren‚Äôt leveraging them?  If you accept that they do exist then you also have to accept that it‚Äôs possible that they‚Äôre using them and looking at their incentives would help you assign a likelihood to their usage (small fines for big returns). They are still doing it.  That‚Äôs how they reset FTDs and maintain downwards pressure. \n\n> Or if this was such a clear cut case why are all the other funds are large investors accelerating things and buying up all the GME they can? \n\nThere are a couple answers to this:\n\n1. Some large investors have jumped in or maintained their positions in GameStop, which can be seen form the high institutional ownership. \n\n2. If this is truly as big as mainly people believe then this will likely cause a lot of market turbulence and no one wants to be seen as the catalyst to all that.\n\n3. The DTCC has been churning out new rules like crazy and finalizing some of these would protect large institutions from being negatively impacted and setup a better framework to pickup the scraps at a discount (e.g. large banks issuing billions in bonds to have cash to spend/serve as capital requirements).\n\n> You people act like its just the 'apes' vs melvin or some shit. Why are hordes of investment firms not piling on for 10 million per share?\n\nSee above, but their will definitely be many investors (retail, HF, banks, day traders, etc...) that will FOMO in once they see things taking off and the pieces are in place.\n\nYou can read all my responses and still think this isn‚Äôt very likely, but as someone interested in options and therefore presumably making investments based on weighing risks vs reward, how much would you be willing to pay for a share of GME thinking there is a 1% chance it increases 10,000%?  What about a 5% chance? 10%? 20%? 50%?\n\nAt some point, if you think there is even a *tiny* chance of this happening then it is perfectly rational to pay $40, $150, $1000 or more per share. I would argue there is a material chance of this transpiring and although some of the lofty prices may be less likely, I believe the overall distribution of possibilities are a steal at the current pricing.\n\nEdit: a word", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I would rather pay 140 bucks in scratchers than believe the astrologyesque 'DD' you people put so much stock in and bet on GME.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "It‚Äôs all good, it‚Äôs his loss.

There are only a few stocks like this and at the top of that list is AAPL.  True many stocks, mostly young companies on the move, will outperform AAPL.  Some will double, triple, quadruple, and AAPL's days of quadrupling are likely over but capital preservation and security is just as important as capital appreciation, and especially if you have already made all or most of the money you need, I recommend AAPL as a safe longterm investment or temporary parking place. Eventually and maybe very soon it will resume its upward track but for now even a sell-off day like today is quite modest and unlikely to continue for more than another day or two, which means today and tomorrow might be the best times to buy AAPl and any of its suppliers like Skyworks which has been getting hammered for several weeks now.

Companies like Tesla/FAANG are solving problems way bigger than what Palantir does (data mining, finding connections in large data sets, and operations optimization). The man behind Tesla is solving problems like self-driving cars, reusable rockets, and monkeys playing games with their minds. Most of Palantir's clients are technologically outdated and need Palantir's service to get them up to speed (e.g. governments, Airbus, JPM).

{"title": "When Easy Mode is Over", "selftext": "(I started writing this yesterday April 19th, and finished it today)\n\nI think we all agree: 2020 was Easy Mode for Selling Options. 2021 is Hard Mode for those still playing.\n\nWith the market continuing to drop, CSPs making money were originally sold way OTM for pennies, or are now ITM, Assigned, and stocks wheeled. Just selling CSPs isn't the surefire profit method it once was. The VIX is laughing sitting at 17 and premiums on some stocks is all but gone, so now what?\n\nIt looks like my account balance is going down as everything slowly bleeds, but there is a positive way to look at it: Current Cost Basis and Collateral. This is now a very long game, as everything recovers, it may take a while. We are looking at months or longer on most of our plays.\n\nCost Basis and Collateral won't go down on a market drop, so this is a truer gauge of the account then -1.3% today even though I closed Options for Profit and bought more shares. (I'll give an example below of where I'm tracking and how.)\n\nI'll admit my 2020 strat was \"sell a CSP, stonks go up, profit\". Not true anymore. I've inevitably been assigned (at higher prices) on most of my CSPs. There are still ways to profit and this is how I am.\n\n1. Everyone knows the mantra: 'Sell Calls on Green Days and Puts on Red Days'. Even more true now, since we need that delta movement to help with option prices. I really wanted to sell a few RKT CCs today but it dropped lower than where it was on Friday. The delta move from a green day is worth way more than the theta decay of today. Waiting a day or two, is the best choice.\n2. I have narrowed down my list of underlyings currently, so I am not chasing the stocks. It feels like everything is down, so I picked about 7 stocks I'm comfortable with, which has dropped, and I believe will recover. Timeframe is uncertain, but this is a long game. Here's where I get the downvotes, stocks I'm currently playing: RKT, DKNG, TNA, MARA, PLTR, WKHS, and SPCE. My money, my choice.\n3. Covered Strangles, my new favorite weapon. Have an affordable CSP along with however many CCs I have shares for. Pick a good number for the CSP to collect premium from, and hopefully, close when it is profitable. 50% preferred, or in this market, ride the waves. If the underlying breaches the CSP, horizontally roll it if the thesis is the CSP was a good Strike. It may be several horizontal rolls before closing. You can't get assigned if the CSP never expires. \n4. The urge to add to the account to average down is there, but why put more cash into the account to catch falling knives? This is ThetaGang and we sell premium. So looking at #2 (I picked my underlyings), let's take the premium and buy shares to average down. We are fine with Assignment on the underlying at the Strike, so why not continue to average down if the CSP is breached. This especially works on a high bad assignment, and I'm working on the next several weeks (months) to break even, or if it sits at a value price, I'll just keep accumulating. It's worked so far. \n\nActual numbers:\n\n* Took Assignment at $37, then it tanked. Averaged in at $14.50x100 and playing a Strangle at 13P. The DKNG, MARA, and TNA premium as well as WKHS premium have gone to shares, and I have 268 shares @$22.4301 Average Cost. So much for the 100@ $37. This might be a long play with WKHS still at $12/share, but another 32 shares is another CC. Another 100 shares @$13 brings my Cost Basis below $20/share. \n* Same with RKT, started with 275@$19.80. Currently hold 367@$23.9433. A gain of 60% of the original buy-in. The share accumulation helped when the $1.11 Special Dividend happened. I held 345 shares at the time of record. \n* Currently also at 109 SPCE @ $43.53 (45P assigned earlier) \n* 103 PLTR @ $33.6694 (34P assigned earlier)\n\nAs I said, Total Liquidity should always go up, so even though my account says $31.8k, total value is $41.6k, just have some underwater stocks for a bit.", "id": "mv1keo", "created_utc": 1618956035.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 169, "comments": [{"body": "Here is one simple trick that insiders hate: Stop investing in memes and high IV underlyings.

It has a 95% probability of ending up at 0 to 366. That is using IV which on average is overstated but it‚Äôs what we got.\n\nSo with that in mind, plus the fact that most of you are selling OTM options, delta INCREASES as your position moves against you. So not only is there a lot of potential down movement, the premium isn‚Äôt enough to account for it. ATM June 18 puts are $38.

In the past I would always leave 4 or 5 percent breathing room between the spot price and strike for just this type of situation. Of course you give up initial premium which would then need to be made up by holding longer for a higher percentage before buying out. An entirely different approach. Still, the common element of finding high quality stocks with short-term irrational downward price movement is the same I have always used. I was just wondering if most who are following will have to roll a significant percentage in the coming week or if perhaps they were more effective in their timing and selection process than I was (and if so I would be interested to hear about it.) I remember reading that you could probably throw darts at a dartboard and the technique would work. Since I don't run meme stocks or growth plays a dartboard approach among high quality undervalued stocks in the current market would have panned out about the same as my selection process in which I utilize basic discounted cash flow analysis  to validate a baseline price. Nothing fancy or sophisticated but consistent enough to show comparable value. I definitely think Calevonlear's approach is valuable and worthy of analysis and will continue working on it.

Out of 22 July monthly puts that I'd started in total since beginning Calevonlear's strategy only two are left and both do look likely to have to be rolled next Friday.

I have found this to be so, with my mean days in trade =8 currently.\n\nThe high delta is super important to the speed of the trade which is, in turn, vital to the strategy itself since the strategy predicts the stock to retrace, but no how much it will do so.  So without the high delta I suspect this strategy would not be anywhere near as successful.  In other words it requires relatively large moves in premium with movement in the underlying.\n\nSo let's look at your trades.  How many total July puts did you sell and how many will need to be rolled?  What has been your average number of days in trade?\n\nAbout my own trading with this strategy so far.  \n\n1)  I've never sold a put at less than 45 DTE.  In fact I ofen sell more than 60 DTE.  Currently I have 2 July, 3 August, 3 September, and 3 October puts sold in the account I'm using for this analysis.\n\n2) I always exit at 10% on day 1, 15% on day 2, and 25% thereafter until roll date at which point I'll exit for the scratch.\n\n3).

I have been auditing my moves as well and after reading your comments I can see that I've been shading away from the strategy in several directions. \n\nThe way the Fed handled things last year made it clear that money policy would not be reverting to the old system any time soon so now I essentially trade 20-50% of my portfolio in options and keep the remainder in cash vehicles that are also optionable which I use in lieu of margin. I still have individual stocks but only about 10-15% of my holdings. I try to do this in a conservative way so dabbling in ATM puts has been a stretch but I am sold on the Calevonlear premise and will continue to try and perfect this system along with several others that I run. My issues as I see them:\n\n1. If I adhere to the monthlies only ideal, my DTE creeps lower as the month moves forward and I look to sell enough options to make a 25-30% overall yearly profit target. Most of my problem children were originated 2-3 weeks ago and at the time I didn't (and still don't really) feel it necessary to trade only monthly options as my underlyings have plenty of liquidity as a prerequisite of their selection and running monthlies only greatly restricts opportunities. Good trades come up in their own time, not just when monthlies are optimum to write. So these options that were written mid-term will get extra time on the back end beyond the monthly schedule to retrace prior to rolling if need be. Perhaps using monthlies is essential to the strategy for some other reason (or more likely they are better suited for a black swan event) although it seemed that they were recommended primarily for liquidity. I will monitor this and adjust as needed.\n2. I haven't been rigid about the 1.5 SD but if I am under it is in the 1.35-1.45 range - certainly easy enough to tighten up going forward as the S&P equal weight is two full SD below the mean in the past week alone on the 90 day chart. I really think that my problem is a timing issue more than anything but with all the rumblings about inflation I should have been more tuned in to freakish possibilities following the fed meeting. \n3.  I did miss selling one of my options on Corning for a 30% profit and it tanked.  This system is timing based and therefore requires diligence. However, I'm not sure I like the idea of being completely  \"mechanical\". It takes the art (and the fun) out of it. After all we are good at making decisions or we wouldn't be making a profit. Slightly tighter organization around my work schedule will make it easier to not miss anything. But I probably will never exit rigidly on the 10, 15 and 25. Sometimes you feel it and I've learned to trust that on occasion. And in spite of the miss I do have the time to focus at critical moments. Calevonlear runs a bunch of accounts and pretty much has to be mechanical or it would eat him up. I run one account. If this is a mistake I am open to correcting it. Time will tell. It has worked for me in the past but my other systems are not as timing sensitive.\n4. TipRanks is ok. I prefer my own hybrid analysis but I do look. They don't give you much data and it is too weighted on the opinions of hedge funds which is probably misdirection and sleight of hand knowing those guys. \n5. I'm with you about the IV percentile. The kids on Thetagang are book smart (impressive) but strategically lacking (give up the stonks already.) They'll get tired of blowing up their accounts eventually. And of course the tides are changing anyway and good trades will be tricky in a while. \n6.  I'm already originating at the highest delta ATM with a sub 5 long leg as I agree that this is fundamental to the system. Spreads aren't optimum but even though I have a relatively large portfolio they allow me to manage the risk while meeting my profit target and thus far the net impact has been negligible. That said, they did effect my decision to roll early as I didn't want to get stuck. But with 60% cash (essentially) in my portfolio I could always sell the long leg when necessary so maybe I shouldn't factor this. Time will tell if spreads are more nuisance than they are worth but the alternative is higher risk so I'll use them until I know this system better.  \n\nI really had just 5 or 6 that dropped equivalent or lower than the S&P equal weight and they seem pretty understandable. DE dropped like a rock but is interest rate sensitive. Thought I could get in and out. Famous last words. GLW as I mentioned. Not sure why it tanked. I'll ride it out.  I took a chance on BAC thinking the fed would announce future rate hikes which they did but the banks tanked (huh?) Not the first time I've been burned by a bank although I've done well overall. Note to self - no more banks and oil companies for this system. Extraneous drivers (read OPEC and Jamie Diamond) make it too complicated. Gold prices tanked and so did NEM.  All of these I rolled early just to be safe even though my long leg is under 5 delta when originally sold. URI, UNH and Anthem surprised me but not badly. Honestly I'm interested to see the magical properties of Delta that I've been reading about. My other 10 or 12 I'm relatively confident will come back. I'll know in a week or two. May need to roll a couple. As for growth stocks I've run spreads on all the FANG stocks. With Google and Amazon I own the stock so I  sell conservative covered calls instead of puts. I do like to see profitability before I invest even though many growth stocks are promising. This area is a bit of a hole in my game so I'm open to ideas.  \n\nIt helped me organize my thoughts to write this. Appreciate your input.

If you send me one I will respond.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ok, I think I can see two more reasons that you are having problems from your above post.\n\nYou are only adhering to about half of the methodology that Calevonlear has described.  I understand all of your reasons, but I think some of them might be incorrect with respect to desired outcome.\n\nBefore I continue let me briefly talk about tinkering and art in any methodology.  I'm a scientist by training.  Forming hypotheses and testing them is my art and I love tinkering and trying to improve systems, including trading systems, as much as anyone.\n\nHowever, when presented with a methodology and an expected result from that methodology, it makes no sense to question any deviation, from those expectations, in the results obtained if the methodology is not being adhered to.  So initially, at least, it's important to follow the strategy exactly for a fairly large sample size to see whether you are getting the expected results.  Only once you have that data point is it sensible to tinker to see if you can improve upon those results.\n\nNow I'm no paragon in this respect.  In fact, initially I was looser in a couple of ways as you are but I realized that they might be having a negative impact and tightened them after the first few weeks.  I think your assumptions about the \"why's\" of some elements of the strategy might be incorrect and leading you to poorer results.\n\nSo first let me detail those results.  You seem to be concerned that if you adhere strictly to Calevonlear's method you won't generate 25-30% returns.\n\nFollowing the method fairly exactly my results are currently 0.622%/day (on buying power reduction) at my average \"days in trade\" of eight days (this is just an audit of my last ten closed trades, it may be higher or lower in reality.  If you like I can audit back the full two months).  Even accounting for only using 30% of my net liquidity this would return over 50% annually on my portfolio if sustained.  I doubt that's actually sustainable.  Worse months will occur. But even if I made every month as bad as the last 30 days I'd still be at 35%.  \n\n*But*, the very thing that generates these fabulous returns is what you are allowing to slip.  Calevonlear is very specific.  The strategy *depends* on an average \"days in trade\" of 7 or less.  I'm at eight currently, so perhaps there is still some room for improvement (but it's also possibly just sampling error as my sample size is not very large yet, so I'm waiting another month or two to see where it settles before trying any adjustments.).\n\nSo, why am I so certain that your \"days in trade\" will be too long?  Because the very things keeping it super short *are* the tight exit percentages.  Initially I did exactly what you are doing.  I'd see a reversal going nicely and I'd let it ride to try to eke out a better percentage thinking that was the sensible approach to higher returns.  But after some auditing I realized this bit of \"art\" was literally destroying the system's power.\n\nAlso, I can guarantee that Calevonlear's reason for his early exit strategy is *not* a need to simplify because he's too busy.\n\nWhy is this?  Because the high returns of this method are entirely dependent on keeping your  percentage return/day as a function of buying power high.  It's not the final percentage that is important at all because the minute you close you are on to the next trade.  In fact, think of what Calevonlear is actually doing.  It's pretty fussy.  He's closing trades at 5% sometimes on day one and then finding a new trade.  I think he said somewhere that half his trades close in the first couple of days.  These are the two fussiest days, where you have to be putting in day orders for specific short duration exits percentages on every single trade and then starting new ones when they close.\n\nSo let's compare the results of his system in three scenarios.  \n\n1) My own average 0.622%/day at an average 8 days in trade.  Probably about half of these are taken at 10-15% and the rest at 25%.\n\n2) Only looking at the last ten trades that I closed on day 1.  The average percentage gain was 3.54% on buying power...in one day.  And this was *always* closed at the 10% profit level exit.\n\nNow finally looking at the last ten trades that closed in the third week after opening.  The average % gain is now 0.35% *in spite* of the great majority of these being closed at 25%.\n\nI think it's very clear from this how much better your returns will be if you exit trades significantly earlier at reduced profit levels and just churn that buying power over to the next trade immediately.\n\n>Time will tell. It has worked for me in the past but my other systems are not as timing sensitive.\n\nI think this is key.  We are not taking a generally bullish position on a stock with this strategy.  It's a pure reversion play.  Which means that we expect that the dip is *overdone* and should show a reversal of *some* magnitude shortly but we have no prediction about how much it will go back up.  As a result of this thesis we very much don't want to be in these trades for very long as the dip might easily revert slightly before continuing downward in a new channel.\n\n>I didn't (and still don't really) feel it necessary to trade only monthly options as my underlyings have plenty of liquidity as a prerequisite of their selection and running monthlies only greatly restricts opportunities.\n\nThis sounds fine, however you may be restricting your universe of possible positions by only using underlyings with plenty of liquidity in the weeklies.  Nonetheless, if you're finding plenty of good trades with high liquidity in the weeklies then I see no issues here as long as these positions are all meeting the target of having a premium that is a minimum of 20% of the buying power expenditure.  This is also an absolutely *key* element in the strategy.\n\n>Most of my problem children were originated 2-3 weeks ago\n\nThis seems a bigger issue.  This is clearly not adhering to the minimum 45 DTE.  Why are you not just moving out in time?  You're only reducing your premium and extrinsic value.  Are you really able to get the minimum 20% profit level from your premium from these short plays?  \n\nRemember, this is *supposed* to be, fundamentally, a nearly pure delta strategy.  It's not a theta strategy.  So, you will get a very similar percentage move in the premium on a July 30th ATM  after one day as on an October 15th but that percentage will represent a much higher profit and a much higher return on buying power.\n\nTake AMD as a random example of a stock with decen weeklies.  You could sell the Jul 30 ATM for $4.35 or August, September, or October monthlies.  The August is already less than 45 DTE so doesn't fit.  I'd usually sell the September if it gave a high enough maximum profit/buying power but can virtually guarantee that at its current IV it would not meet the target, so I'd move on to the October which sells for $6.95 if the trade were to meet all the other criteria.  The difference in premium between the July 30th and the October 15th is about 59.7%.  I'm reaping all of that on every trade of this sort at every exit percentage.  Trying to shorten DTE makes no sense to me given that we are not trying at all to maximize theta burn.\n\n>2. I haven't been rigid about the 1.5 SD but if I am under it is in the 1.35-1.45 range\n\nI think this is fine.  On days that I don't find trades at 1.5 SD, I'll drop it as low as 1SD.

I don't think this strategy is ultimately going to be very sensitive to sectors.  It's just too much about smaller reversals rather than any actual theses about market forces.

We each tinker and figure things out in our own way.  I don't expect you to take my advice from this text wall.  Honestly, writing it out helped me consolidate my own thinking while getting to do a bit of data crunching which is my jam.\n\nI'll send you that DM.  You're welcome to carry this conversation on either here or there as you prefer, or not at all if you've had enough.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great analysis and thanks for your help. I do believe that you have hit the nail on the head. I've been busily whittling away at the structure of the system and then wonder why it became wobbly. So typical that I would immediately attempt to *improve* things. Another factor I noticed on further review has been my loose counting of linear regressions starting above the mean. I guess everything above the mean no longer exists in this method and we must start counting from the midline. Sort of like presidential politics.\n\nI believe I misspoke and to clarify, I wasn't advocating shortening the trade durations (although this was my initial plan and I am now riding herd on the strays), but rather starting beyond the constraints of monthlies when indicated and moving out the expiration date appropriately. Or since you mentioned *at least* 45 days, move out the expiration to the next monthly. I'm sure you track your pool of future underlyings and have noticed the great disparity in premium from day to day which seems to be caused in part by where the spot price lands in relation to the strike. Even with tight strikes it will vary premium 30 or 40% frequently as the delta dips while we wait for the spot to go either up or down and get closer to the strike. Once it hits the strike and moves just past ATM, the premium goes up. So timing does impact premium significantly but as you mentioned shortening the trade at its inception is not appropriate.\n\nBeing disciplined on exit is vital and I will take this to heart. I've been burned once or twice already. This is not a process that lends itself to stretching for more return. However, since you never know when you will need to replenish your sold puts, all the more reason to not restrict your dates to monthlies (if you have sufficient liquidity in the underlying.) This is where my stubbornness kicks in and I will probably need a further lesson from the market to learn properly.\n\nFor my first 15 or 20 trades, days in trade have been relatively equivalent to what you are experiencing. A number of very fast closers averaged with several that needed to be rolled and the rest closing in 5-10 days. With a minor move in the market its a new world and we shall see. \n\nOne thing to point out is that my selection process, utilizing essentially major corporations that have long been profitable but are currently experiencing an irrational  short-term downward trend, makes me highly correlated to movement in the S&P. When it dips 4 percent or so in several days as it recently has, it impacts many of my underlyings. As luck would have it, if we have recently replaced profitable plays with new options as I did, then we are vulnerable to the move. If it hits us as they are expiring we can get out of town but otherwise we ride it out. This (along with a few poor decisions) is essentially what has happened to me in this instance. Not a big deal. Good time to learn.\n\nIn six months or a year when the Covid money runs out etc. we will see a lot more market dips and strange movement. Other than greater diversification I'm not sure how we can further protect against these moves. If you analyze your holdings based on different dates of origination you will see your vulnerability overall to a market move of some sort. I will be interested to see how strong the rebound is and how this impacts my holdings. Other than the stocks mentioned previously, my others fall right in line with the prevalent philosophy and theoretically should rebound quickly. Or the market dips again and its a dogfight. What is the philosophy in that instance? If its the beginning of a 10 or 15% correction and we wait we're going to get burned. This is what I am pondering.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">As luck would have it, if we have recently replaced profitable plays with new options as I did, then we are vulnerable to the move. \n\nYes, exactly.  Or, if you did what I did and made a large deposit on Monday from which you promptly sold a huge pile of puts.  This is one area where I need more discipline.  Calevonlear is very clear about keeping margin usage very low when the VIX is low but I've been stretching that a bit.  It's not served me well.  I would have had a fair bit more buying power available on Friday if I hadn't already stretched myself beforehand.  And obviously selling puts on Friday would have beat selling them last Monday.  If I'd been more consistent in applying the strategy I would be well ahead of my current position.\n\n> Or the market dips again and its a dogfight. What is the philosophy in that instance? If its the beginning of a 10 or 15% correction and we wait we're going to get burned.\n\nI'm not that worried about corrections of this size.  I think that the strategy's system of increasing margin allotment with the increases in the VIX should buffer that quite a bit.  I'm more concerned with a true bear market.  A sustained dip of 30% or greater is something that I pretty much expect to happen in the next few years but I know very little about how to hedge against such events.  Calevonlear has said he'll be writing up a post about this at some point.

Whenever something new comes up it turns out that he was right. Hats off to him.\n\nHe's talked quite a bit about hedging on S&P futures (according to posts he used to use VIX futures.) Has a technique that may be promising in generating some profit to offset the expense. And using PMCCs as a delta hedge as well. I'm not clear enough on any of it and I'll have to read it again because all of a sudden the need for a hedge is becoming very real. Imagine that.\n\nMost 30% drops take months to play out. Last March was an anomaly. We may have to roll a few times but hopefully won't get buried in the avalanche before we can sell at close to scratch. I'm more concerned with a quick panic drop of 10-15% although I like your confidence. \n\nWith spreads I will have difficulty staying out in front. Since I don't use margin and have enough cash I can sell the long leg and roll like crazy but when to start is for me the question. In the past I've stood like a deer in the headlights in comparable situations unable to decide or I've reacted too quickly (as I may have done last week.) Starting to see the benefits of being \"mechanical\" at least for a 4-5% drop like this one (hopefully). Whatever happens it will be good data to analyze going forward.\n\nI've been doggedly (perhaps blindly) continuing to sell puts through the dip as this seems to be the prescribed method.

It helped a lot in the covid crash but he's stopped using it as he found it expensive and inefficient.  Now it seems he's hedging delta with futures when his delta gets too big.  But I barely understand it.\n\n> been doggedly (perhaps blindly) continuing to sell puts through the dip as this seems to be the prescribed method.\n\nI think this is right, and the drop doesn't really phase me because I see how this will play out as long as it's not a true crash, which I just don't see.  I think keeping everything as mechanical as possible is the way to the best returns.  The only art to employ is in the choosing from your selection of the day.  I think there can be some significant finessing to this with some studying of the data and experimentation.\n\nOne thing that I've been toying with is when I really prefer a certain stock but the IV will never give me the profit percentage that I need I've started buying LEAPs.  I'm using the same principles. I try to sell on a quick pop in the first three days and if that fails I sell  an ATM covered call against it.  I'm still toying with it, but they seem to work and can be even more profitable than the puts, obviously.  However, I'm only doing this on value stocks that I like.\n\nBasically, I just really like the reversion thesis.  But I can see different ways to play it depending on your outlook for a stock.  But time will tell.  Calevonlear's method might ultimately be the most long term stable and flexible.  I have several accounts.

Let‚Äôs do a an experiment, I assume that PLTR blows their prediction of 30% growth in the next 4 years and grows by 40% (that will be very hard to accomplish so this is a very bullish 33% average beat). \n\nWe have a revenue of 1.1 billion for 2020, have that grow for 4 years by 40% (1.1*1.40^4 =4.2). That results into a revenue of 4.2 billion. When I use a PS multiple I assume they improve their margins and are not considered a consulting business- that would be disastrous for the stock - therefore, I am still very bullish. Splunk - which is a worse competitor has had an average 5 year PS of 10. If we apply a price to sales of 10 we are trading today at a 2024 PS ratio of 10! If we take an extra bullish view (we can apply a PS of 15 - which quite curiously appears in a lot of VC late stage funding valuations); with a 15 PS we have a 63 billion valuation which implies a 50% growth from here in 4 years. Which is insane especially since I took into consideration extra growth.\n\nI know most of you ü¶ç like to gamble but if you plan to hold this for 10 years this is a great pick, but don‚Äôt be surprised if in 4 years you‚Äôre up only 50%.

When we talk government subsidies lower prices can encourage consumption and higher prices can discourage it.  And all the economic theories agree on this.  MMT, Keynes, and Austrians.\n\nFor some reason most theories function on a premise that if a consumer expects prices to fall further they wont make purchases today.  That may be true if they expect the price to fall by a knowable amount tomorrow.  But if that price decrease is going to fall an unknown amount in an unknown time frame, very very few consumers would be swayed by this.  What ill-conceived theories propose is that the majority of consumers are going to turn every single purchase they make into some sort of speculation on future deflation.  Just imagine the average person shopping for Christmas dinner \"I'm not sure if I should buy that turkey yet....might be cheaper next week\".  99% of people are buying the turkey to make sure they have it.\n\nAnd of course they ignore the effects of supply and demand as prices fall.  As people are essentially richer and cost of living decreases they'd be disincentivized to work ie: able to retire earlier.  This would decrease economic output and serve to counterbalance the falling prices.  On the consumption side, consumers would be able to afford goods and services they previously couldn't and would be eager to indulge.\n\nJust to prove how ridiculous this notion of a deflationary spiral is, humor me with this hypothetical.  If we did have a deflationary spiral and you could buy a yacht (pick your unrealistic indulgence) on a week's salary, would you?  Or would you wait until the price fell to an hour's pay?  Or would you wait longer and get it cheaper?  It's a hyperbolic example, but you see my point.  At some point you're spending that money and making purchases.  You're not waiting forever.\n\nSo the only thing indicating there could ever be some kind of deflationary spiral driving all prices to $0 is a bizarre notion that Americans (or people in general) as a whole have not just a modicum of self control, but absolute self control when it comes to personal finance.  As I already pointed out, there's an entire mountain range of evidence that says otherwise.  Yeah, some people save $5M for retirement on a $65k salary.  But it's far more common to make $300k and save nothing.  \n\nThe richest nation in the world is in debt up to their eyeballs.  The market has been on fire.  People could make a fortune if they deferred consumption and invested their discretionary income.  By and large they don't.  Why not?  Because that's not how the psychology of the consumer works.  Consumption today is preferred to consumption tomorrow.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "The problem is it's self re-inforcing.  If you can buy more for less next month, why buy now.

Both of those things would be super cost prohibitive from a purchasing power prospective.  Anyone with a mortgage or a car loan would probably walk away from it since the payment you are making on the loan would be better tucked away and hidden.\n\nHouse values would tank as people walk away from the market, forget about renting most landlords would walk away too, unless they are debt free.  So renting would be hard.  I suppose people could take to squatting in abandoned properties.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: changed some wording a little and adding:\n\nEvery year, when you get a performance review at work, they'll let you know that you've done a great job so they are only cutting your pay a little.

If you didn't need it right away, you'd probably wait.\n\nFirst of all, you're assuming people know this.  Neither deflation nor inflation work this way.  Yes, currently we assume prices will go up over time, but we don't know when and we don't know by how much.  That's how a deflationary environment would work.  Maybe that Caddy comes down to the price of a Focus in 6 months, maybe the Focus is only 5% off a year from now.\n\nSecond, I disagree with the premise that many people would do that.  Particularly if you're talking Americans and vehicles.  Americans can't wait until their current vehicle is paid off before they get something brand new.  I'm waiting for vehicle loan terms to cross the 10 year mark because I feel like that's coming.\n\n> But you'll feel lucky that you were working for the unicorn debt free company and not one of the millions that got swallowed by their debts. \n\nI think you make a good point with debt in general, but I think it works against you.  Yes, the deleveraging phase would be incredibly painful.  But I'm personally not one of the people who thinks our current debt laden culture is a healthy.  I think the forced deleveraging would be good for us in the long term.\n\nTo some of your other points, I think it would be good to reduce the number of landlords and have more people own their own homes- particularly if they're more affordable.  Having your wages cut for \"good performance\" would be weird, but if the purchasing power increases, it's not bad.\n\nPeople who purchased homes for $100k 20 years ago and are now worth $800k feel good about that.  Another $600k into their net worth.  But it's disasterous for people like me trying to get into the market.
