The roads are absolutely crazy. Tuk tuks literally don't obey any rules\n\nI read through the thread. Note that I \\*did\\* use the word \"eventually\". I agree that the current beta Version 8.3 would likely have severe problems there.\n\nI watched the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLUm3Q-7iZA) you linked - twice. Truly amazing. Very chaotic, but of course there are \"rules\", even if many of them are not in the law books. It's a traffic circle / roundabout, and everybody is going the correct direction around the circle. About 16 minutes of video, and no major collisions, no pedestrians run over. That would not happen unless people were following a set of \"rules\". My impression from two viewings:\n\n- At least on average, go in the correct direction.\n\n- Right of way is negotiated using \"body language\" (including the motion of the vehicles).\n\n- It's not OK to actually have a major crash or actually run over somebody. Minor nudges may be sort of OK.\n\nAnd no doubt a batch of others that I missed. The video you linked has a recommended link to another video, [\"How to Drive in India (India’s Unofficial Road Rules)\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCwL-QrCSgI], which reinforces my view that the driving there operates under a set of \"rules\" (or \"customs\").\n\n> I would nearly think another sensor suite of microphones would need to be added to recognize where a sound came from.\n\nMight be useful. The video I linked commented that a common use of the horn is to let others know that you are behind or beside them. Teslas don't have an array of external microphones, but they do have sonar for nearby objects, and cameras for 360 degree vision. It appears that Teslas on FSD in India will need to learn to honk to inform others of their presence.\n\nWhen Teslas were learning how to use FSD in the US, first a large amount of training data was collected by the cars and sent to the company for analysis and to put together a training set. Next, FSD was operated in \"shadow mode\", comparing what FSD would have done to what the human driver actually did. Then alpha and beta versions were tested on the road, carefully supervised by a human driver prepared to intervene if needed, and interventions were logged and reported to the company to see whether changes were needed. Over time, FSD performance got closer to what a good human driver could do.\n\nI don't see any fundamental reason that couldn't also work in India, using skilled drivers who are accustomed to driving in India throughout the training process. \n\nFor how long it might take in India, I don't know, but several factors to consider:\n\n- FSD has just recently been transitioning to the \"4D\" approach that considers the motion of objects over time, and use of full 360 degree vision. I think we will start to see the benefits of these changes in (US version) beta Version 9, and possibly get some idea of how these advances could affect training for driving in India.\n\n- The Dojo training system will hopefully become operational this year - it is expected to greatly speed the training process.\n\n- I believe the actual driving decisions (once the neural net driven vision system has figured out what is going on) are still hand coded. I believe Tesla has said that the long term plan is to have more and more of the driving systems performed by the neural net as well, which would be closer to how humans learn to drive, and which may be better adapted to the driving styles in India.\n\nMachines have learned to perform many complex tasks, including negotiating with and bluffing humans. The complex negotiations involved in driving in India appear achievable as well. I wouldn't be shocked to see seriously good versions after five years of work, possibly less. If Tesla is seriously thinking about entering the Indian automobile market, I wouldn't be surprised if somebody at Tesla is already working on it.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes, but fundamentally, if humans can do it, then the computer will do it as well.

{"title": "[$BB] The emerging tech cold war between the US and China could be another growth catalyst for Blackberry", "selftext": "With President Biden viewing China as \"[steep steep competition](https://youtu.be/7M-FIX39udk)\", the decoupling of US-China tech supply chain is inevitable. Both China and the US will start to reduce their own critical industries' reliance on components from the other side, so that they can avoid being held hostage by the other side using these supply chain choke points as geopolitical bargaining stakes (see how the ban of [Qualcomm chips](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17242664/us-uk-china-smartphone-zte-security-risk-sanctions) and [Google Android OS](https://www.techradar.com/news/huawei-ban) disrupted ZTE and Huawei's global smartphone businesses respectively). This is evidenced by China's \"[Made in China 2025 ](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/made-china-2025-threat-global-trade)\" plan and the US's ongoing [plan](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/efforts-to-bring-chip-manufacturing-to-us-soil-will-continue-in-2021/) to bring chip manufacturing back to US soil.\n\nDespite the growing anti-globalization trend in critical supply chains, there is still a desire for US automotive companies to penetrate the Chinese market and also a similar desire for Chinese automakers to expand beyond their domestic market into global markets. \n\nFor emerging technologies like connected and autonomous vehicles, there will still be a need for a standardized vehicle base operating system (hypervisor) and data abstraction layer for future software-defined vehicles in order for a software and app ecosystem to flourish across different vehicle makes from various automakers. A standard vehicle base os is also crucial in ensuring that these vehicles remain interoperable across different countries with different legal safety requirements, cloud services, V2X infrastructure and media apps ecosystems, without requiring changes to their physical hardware when scaling across different markets.\n\nIt is unlikely that this standard interoperability layer will come from the US or China due to their reluctance to incorporate such a critical component from the other side in their emerging tech products due to geopolitical and security concerns. Being a Canadian company, Blackberry has the best chance at global dominance with their [QNX hypervisor](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf3r7c/qnx_hypervisor_will_be_in_all_future_connected/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) and [IVY data platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mf2t5a/blackberry_qnx_ivy_might_be_the_next_android/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).\n\nIf you listen to this [discussion](https://youtu.be/nRwdDnrc7qI), you will understand all these talks are not mere hype, but actual plans to be executed. John Wall, SVP of Blackberry Technology Solutions, also mentioned that they will likely partner with a major Chinese cloud provider (Alibaba cloud, Huawei cloud, Tencent cloud, Baidu AI cloud etc.) very soon, similar to the Blackberry-AWS IVY partnership. This shows how well-positioned Blackberry is at being the interoperability layer for connected and autonomous vehicles in a world where there is increasing decoupling between the US and China tech ecosystems.\n\nEdit:\n\nI see some complaints that my viewpoint is not substantiated enough, so here's some elaboration:\n\nThe US-China decoupling will only happen for intermediate goods (components that are used in the production of final goods that will be purchased by end consumers). For example, instead of using the US's Android OS, Huawei phones are now using their own HongMeng OS. Supply chain decoupling does not imply the ban of final goods from China (Huawei phones) in the US. You can still [buy](https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/despite-ban-you-can-still-buy-huawei-phones-in-the-us-heres-how/) Huawei phones in the US, just that not many people would want to buy them due to the lack of Google Mobile Services and Google Play store for these Huawei phones (cannot download apps easily). This affects Huawei's sale in the US.\n\nNow for connected and autonomous vehicles which does not yet have any dominant app ecosystems like Android or iOS yet. This time, with the Chinese having the capability to influence the growth of an emerging tech sector, do you think the Chinese will support an American OS + platform + app ecosystem and risk getting banned again and losing their global sales?\n\nOf course, China can build their own OS + platform + app ecosystem but it is unlikely to gain traction beyond their domestic market because they lack the deep technical capability/maturity (HongMeng OS turned out to be just an Android clone) or the influence to convince app developers outside China to develop apps for them. \n\nI think you might have underestimated the importance of standards and abstractions in the tech industry.\n>The world runs windows on AMD and Intel\n\nThis only works precisely because both AMD and Intel chips use the x86-64 Instruction Set Architecture, where programs are compiled to the same assembly code which is interoperable across Intel and AMD chips. There is a reason you cannot run a desktop software on an Android smartphone with a Qualcomm chip because smartphones use the ARM architecture. Again, in the smartphone world, Android can run on Qualcomm Snapdragon, Huawei's Kirin, Samsung's Exynos chips, precisely because all these chips use the ARM Instruction Set Architecture. (ARM was last valued to be $40 billion btw)\n\nNow, such interoperability layer (analogous to x86-64 for desktop CPUs and ARM for smartphone CPUs) has not existed  for the connected and autonomous vehicle yet. My main focus in this article is to put forward my view that this interoperability layer is unlikely to come from any American or Chinese companies because each of them will not accept any proposed standards from the other side. It has to come from a third party (not necessarily Canada, can be any other countries). But ruling out Chinese and American tech companies, Blackberry is the only frontrunner left capable of driving this industry standard forward.\n\nPosition: 7200 @ $11.77", "id": "mjpxtn", "created_utc": 1617514229.0, "score": 785, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "BB could post net profits of 88 billion dollars and the stock price would still go to hell.", "score": 108, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "i’ve been hurt so much, i cannot be hurt again", "score": 175, "replies": [{"body": "BruiseBerry", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Black’nBlueBerry.", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hurt me once, shame on you.

So here goes!\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkhtpy8hq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=cde4524f9c0f45d083d6370cce81e462640a965c\n\nGameStop continues to be the top discussed stock with more than 27K mentions. AMC dropped from 2nd to 4th position. PLTR gained in mentions and was the second most discussed stock last week due to a long-term deal they won with the U.S Department of Energy which is potentially worth 89 million dollars. ViacomCBS also made it into the top 10 but not in a good way. The company has lost 50% of valuation in the last 2 weeks and the sentiment reflects that. Rest all the companies are regulars in the top 10 list!\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brep8x8qq6r61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=47be46b91c1230ab01f618066a0344277613d285\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**ViacomCBS($VIAC)** was the company with the most growth in mentions. But, the average sentiment across the mentions was negative given the 50% drop in valuation. The stock had crossed the $100 mark on 22nd March 2021 and has lost more than 50% of its value since then. The market had been over-enthusiastic about the stock since the beginning of 2021 due to its effort of transforming to a streaming giant from a traditional cable media company. However, this enthusiasm was short-lived. There might be some scope for a short-term rebound.\n\n**ASO** was also growing in mentions due to their stellar earnings report. The company reported\n\n* Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.\n* (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.\n\n**Humanigen(HGEN)** reported phase 3 results of Lenzilumab™ stating it improves survival without the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The stock jumped 100% on Monday and has stabilized at around 34% increase from last week. \n\n**MicroVision(MVIS)** stock soared 50% on Wednesday. This is mainly due to Microsoft receiving a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets. (It's estimated to be worth $21.9B over the next 10 years). There has been a lot of rumors stating Microsoft is planning to buy MicroVision which predominantly drove the discussions on MVIS.\n\n**FUBO** stock price has been on a continuous decline for the last 2 months (more than 50% drop) and there is now increasing chatter on whether it is oversold or on the path to a rebound \n\n**SOME FAQ’s:**\n\nHow does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nWhat is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyze financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments\n\n*Disclaimer : I am not a financial advisor!*", "id": "mjzvwy", "created_utc": 1617554863.0, "score": 1702, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "This is good shit.", "score": 229, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "Can we get this to update daily?

Unlike stupid apes, these funds are smart enough to just eat a loss and move on.  They don't have to buy more of anything, that's retard logic.\n\n> The forced liquidation of Archegos Capital lead to massive VIAC blocks being sold in the market at a discounted price, which aided to the nasty continuous sell-off. There’s been a drastic decline in volume the past few days which signals that the liquidation phase is near or at its end.\n\nAssuming the sell-off finished, the stock has been at its current point for about a week-- bulls have had plenty of time to take a bite if they're interested.  Maybe the stock bounces back to $50 or $55, but I doubt it's on its way back to anything near the $100 it had.\n\n> VIAC’s bullish momentum came from a few factors: Their new streaming service Paramount+ releasing, ViacomCBS reaching 11-year agreement with the NFL, strong earnings, extremely cheap valuation relative to market, and a company that follows the value/reopening/cyclical trend in a higher yield environment.\n\nThe streaming service is the only reason to get excited here.  Because without it the cheap valuation is justified-- cable TV is a dying industry, streaming is the future.  Netflix, Disney, and Comcast get higher multiples because they've already got their foot in the door, they're already playing the game.  Hwang bet on up-and-comers-- AMCX, DISCK, and VIAC.  It's completely understandable that these companies trade lower than their better-established streaming rivals.  And I would not consider TV and streaming media to be a big \"coronavirus recovery\" sector.  You're telling me as soon as it's safe to come outside, people are just gonna stay home and watch a bad Star Trek series?\n\n> ViacomCBS is not some meme company, it’s a company with a strong balance sheet that produces real profits.\n\nIn a dying industry.\n\n> Paramount+ growth and success will stem from ViacomCBS’s brands and their unique model.\n\nThe brands thing, maybe, sure, who knows.  But what makes their model unique?  It's a streaming service, how is it unique, do they shove a dildo up your butt after you click on the play button???\n\n> Paramount+ offers live sports (NFL, Europa League, March Madness, Masters Tourney), news, original content, and a large library of older content from their various brands.\n\nAgain, sure, maybe Showtime will beat HBO, and the NFL will beat the NBA, and Nickolodeon will beat Adult Swim, and etc etc.  But then again maybe not.\n\n> ViacomCBS brands: Paramount Studios (Star Trek), Showtime (Billions) Nickelodeon (Avatar, Spongebob), CBS, BET, MTV, Comedy Central, Pluto TV, etc.\n\nWho can forget that classic brand, Pluto TV.\n\n> They recently signed a 11-year contract with the NFL that gives them multi-platform rights, allows them to stream them on Paramount+.\n\nWhat happens 11 years from now if someone offers the NFL more money?\n\n> The launch of their new streaming service and transition into the digital age helps their growth prospects.\n\nIt sure as fuck better, right?\n\n> Valuation currently is dirt cheap sitting at a PE Ratio of 11 and trading significantly under it’s fair value price\n\nValuation is dirt cheap because you have to have good growth prospects to have higher multiples.  The people arriving late to the streaming scene have worse prospects than the people who showed up early-- you cant compare multiples between the two groups.\n\n> Technicals: Price has been consolidating around $45, near it’s 200 DMA, multiple indicators showing oversold.\n\nGeez, it's almost as if there's a big reason for that.\n\n> Shorters are getting greedy, short percent of float is near 19%\n\nShorters just cashed out buddy boy.  They said \"This stock aint worth $100\" and made fat stacks cause they were dead right.  The people you're hoping to squeeze have already covered their positions and now they're popping bottles at the club.\n\n> The reason to invest in VIAC over VIACA is because of the large difference in volume/liquidity in their shares and options.\n\nFirst thing I agree on.\n\n> Recent Price Targets for VIAC: Benchmark Firm gives $120, Citi gives $92, Needham gives $80, Goldman Sachs gives $75, BMO Capital gives $70\n\nCredit Suisse says $46, Loop says $48, Wells Fargo says $59, MoffettNathanson says $55, UBS says $29, Citigroup says $49, Barclays says $35, Bank of America says $32, Keybanc says $30...\n\n-----\n\nI wouldn't be super surprised if AMCX, VIAC, and DISCK bounced back a little.  Because it's not like Hwang was necessarily making a bad bet here-- the success of Disney and AT&T and Comcast in claiming a foothold in the streaming market shows a path that those companies can potentially take to build their own streaming services and carve out a slice of that pie.  But the multiples seem to accurately reflect the chances of that happening.  AMC Networks doesn't fully own the rights to some of its heaviest hitters, so it's sitting in the shitter with a forward PE of just 6.89.  Discovery has a practical monopoly on a lot of content, so it's got a forward PE of 11.3.  And Viacom CBS is in the middle with a forward PE of 10.52 because while it doesn't have the same problems as AMC, most of its stuff is like the little brother of something in AT&T's catalogue.  Like, who's betting on Showtime over HBO?  You look at most of what VIAC's got and it's like that meme where you ask mom if you can get X and she tells you you've got X at home.  \n\nI don't even really wanna buy leaps on this shit, the IV is still pretty high.  If I buy a Jan 2023 $45c, I gotta pay $11.8??  So if this stock goes up 25% in the next 21 months I break even????  What??????\n\nIf you believe in the company, I think wait a month, wait for people to realize it's not about to jump back to $100, and then buy some ATM leaps on it when the IV is something reasonable.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

One season they've got the best shows and they're on top.  The next season someone else has the best shows and they're fucked.  When you control the distribution channel, you have a cushion against those sort of ups and downs, but when you don't, it is rough.  In the ecosystem you're outlining, the Netflix's make money no matter what-- the people licensing to them are living feast or famine.\n\n2)  Amazon and Netflix are not pure-play streaming platforms any more.  They make their own content now.  So every time you do dealings with them, they're gonna have their finger on the scale-- they're gonna promote their own stuff over yours, give you the short end of the algorithm whenever they want.  Your content creators will always be playing handicapped against their content creators-- and if that's the state of affairs, how hard will it be for the shops with streaming platforms to poach your creatives (or sports licenses) from you?\n\n3)  Mergers with other similarly positioned players don't magically modernize your company, it's just a doubling down on the model that's losing.  Owning the back catalogue of The Dick Van Dyke show AND I Love Lucy is not going to magically solve anything.\n\n4)  They don't have the cash to fund significant acquisitions.  Which means they'll have to offer stock instead.  Why would I want to invest in a stock that has \"DILUTION SOON\" in big red letters over it?\n\n5)  Even if the leadership of Viacom is convinced that the solution to their weak streaming platform is to merge with everyone else that has a shitty streaming platform, who's to say their M&A targets agree?  Again, there's no synergy.  You're a $30b left shoe trying to convince another $30b left shoe to form a giant $60b left shoe.  Meanwhile a $300b right shoe could be on the other line with your M&A target, making a better offer.  How are you going to outbid them if they decide they want what you're after?  And if they don't want what you're trying to eat, doesn't that say something about the quality of your meal?\n\n6)  Mergers make you bigger, which makes you harder to be acquired by someone else, and being acquired by someone else is, in my view, one of the best things that could happen to a VIAC shareholder in a world in which they cant get their own foothold in the streaming world.\n\n-----\n\nI agree on at least one point, which is that Viacom is cheap.  They're one of the cheapest ways to buy a dollar of earnings on the market today.  And on that basis alone I'd rate it neutral.  But I would sell it in an instant if they merged with a company that did not have a successful streaming platform.\n\nAnd if Viacom is going to aggressively push mergers, I would rather own the stock of the companies they're going to be making the lucrative offers to.

{"title": "The US Gov't has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation", "selftext": "**TL;DR: The US federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation. A 1% underreporting of inflation saves the US gov't between $500 billion and $1 trillion per year. It's likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades.**\n\nFor background, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates inflation. It releases a measure known as the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. The formula used to calculate CPI is rather complex and opaque, and has been changed numerous times over the years. The effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number. [\\[1\\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)\n\nMany government revenues and expenditures are inflation-linked, either directly or indirectly.\n\n**Directly linked:**\n\n1. Social security payments\n\nSocial security payments are linked to a measure known as CPI-W (very similar to the CPI) [\\[2\\]](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/COLA/colasummary.html). Every year, the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation. It has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth \\~**$37 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by **$370 billion.**\n\n2) Tax brackets\n\nTax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation [\\[3\\]](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111715/are-tax-brackets-adjusted-inflation.asp). This means, when the government underreports inflation, more people move up into higher tax brackets. It's hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues.\n\n3) Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities\n\nThese are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back, in both interest and principle, according to inflation. They are linked to the CPI. These securities (known as TIPS) compromise \\~8% of the US federal debt [\\[4\\]](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Pages/tips.aspx). This is **\\~$2.24 trillion**. Every 1% of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by **$22 billion.** There are also increases to the interest payments on this debt.\n\n**Indirectly linked:**\n\n1. Debt interest payments\n\nInvestors will demand higher returns from Treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation. The US government has **\\~$26 trillion** in Treasury debt. The yearly cost of servicing this debt is \\~1-2% of that, roughly **$378 billion** in 2020. If investors were to expect higher inflation, this yearly cost would go up by \\~**$260 billion** for every 1% increase in expected inflation.\n\nThere are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation, these are just the main ones I could find. When we add up all these policies, we see that underreporting inflation by just 1% can save the government **between $500 billion and $1 trillion a year**. This is 30% of the entire tax revenue of the US government. Underreporting inflation by 3-4% a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year.\n\n**Evidence of underreporting**\n\nThere has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited. Is there any evidence that the US government has in fact been understating inflation?\n\n1. Changes to the CPI formula\n\n\"Originally, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. In this case, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time, the U.S. Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living.1﻿ Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI).\n\nOver the years, the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions. According to the BLS, the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate. The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution. Substitution, the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes, changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket.﻿ The overall result tends to be a lower CPI. However, critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a COGI to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the U.S. government to report a lower CPI.\" [\\[5\\]](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/consumerpriceindex.asp)\n\nEssentially, the methodology used to calculate the CPI was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported. When a good is considered to be of \"increased quality,\" its price increase is lowered to reflect this. When the price of one good goes up, its relative weighting in the CPI is reduced and another, lower-priced good is \"substituted\" for it.\n\n2) Rent\n\nIn 2005, the average US rent was $755. In 2019, it was $1,164 [\\[6\\]](https://www.deptofnumbers.com/rent/us/). This is an increase of **54%**, or an average yearly increase of 3.1%. During the same time, the CPI has gone from 191.6 to 252.4 [\\[7\\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL), which is only a **31%** increase, or an average yearly increase of 1.9%. If we use rent as the true measure of inflation, CPI has underreported inflation by **1.1%** per year. Keep in mind that, during the period just mentioned, the US experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen, during the 2007-2008 crisis. The housing bubble was already far along by 2005 [\\[8\\]](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPISA). Nonetheless, rent increases managed to outstrip the CPI.\n\nWhat do you think?

The fact that the F150 and Camry metrics diverge so much is itself a sign that looking at a single model doesn't tell you much.\n\nThe F150 of the 90s was something my home-builder neighbor bought for work. Today's F150 is a status symbol. It's middle America's Macbook. Like the article says, Ford killed off most of their other vehicles because the margins on trucks are so much better. The price of an F150 is up so much not because of inflation in materials or manufacturing costs, but because rural and suburban Americans are happy to get jacked to the tits in debt to buy them as status symbols. Debt is an important part of that equation because when borrowing costs go down, prices on things people finance go up. Total cost of ownership isn't up as much as the sticker price would have you believe.\n\nA much better comparison would be to look at a 1990 F150 and find the absolute closest thing to it that you can. Which isn't easy because trucks have become such status symbols even the most barebones models aren't comparable to the ones from the 1990s. \n\nThat is perhaps itself a different sort of inflation. Maybe an F150 built to 1990 specs would cost only 21% (the New Vehicle CPI since 1990) more today than in 1990. But nobody is making 1990 F150s so it doesn't matter.

So someone making 9,750 was taxed at 10% one year but because of inflation the bracket increased by like .8% so then people could then make up to 9,950 or something and still only be taxed that 10%. So by limiting the actual inflation number, or by making the inflation appear smaller, they can keep people in larger tax brackets. It was the 2017 tax act or something that started this. If they reported a higher inflation they would have to increase that tax bracket further. So then someone making like 11k, someone who was in originally the 12% bracket, would actually be within the 10% bracket now. So by under reporting inflation/CPI they can justify not moving the tax bracket tolerance. If they actually reported the higher inflation, they would then have to increase the tolerance to allow people making 11k to only get taxed 10%. When right now they get taxed 12%. So by under reporting they are increasing their tax revenue. Anyways I am sure that’s what you meant.

Changed methodology: You have to change the method of calculating the CPI over time for it to be an effective measure. You have to, for example, adjust which goods belong in the basket. If horseshoe prices have been going up, that's not inflation if people don't really pay to shoe horses anymore and just want tires on their cars instead. Otherwise, your inflation measure would be kinda dumb, since very little economic growth has driven resources into making horseshoes cheaper, but it has directed a lot into the automobile industry. Now cars last a lot longer, and we don't have unsafe lemon-type vehicles like the Ford Pinto. If you thumb through *Wealth of Nations*, Adam Smith is concerned with the relative prices of wool and linen (the latter used for durable workwear in his period, similar to denim today) over time. But obviously that index would mismeasure inflation today.\n2. Rent: This is not a sound argument. \"Look, one component of the basket of goods has gone up faster than the rest. So that means the measure isn't working.\" Some of the goods in the basket will go up faster than the rest, like healthcare. Others won't, like gasoline, airline tickets, or computer components. There are also other things going on with housing costs. First, actual rents and owner-equivalents of rent (what owners pay themselves to live in their own homes) are both factored into the score. At least some of the OER increase is driven by asset price inflation. Second, smaller households are becoming normal, so people are consuming more housing. Third, people are choosing to relocate to place where rent is expensive. Cheap rent exists, just in cities like Detroit or Cleveland, or most of rural America. Instead, the US population is becoming geographically concentrated in big growing cities and their suburbs, where rent is higher. But that's not necessarily inflation, so much as a broad shift in consumer preferences toward upscale versions of the same thing--kind of like the shift toward upscale casual dining or upscale fast food like Shake Shack, rather than good ol' Applebees and McDonald's. When there's high inelastic demand (people keep moving to San Francisco and complaining how damn expensive it is, or people keep getting quadruple bypass surgery even though insurance is really expensive), expect the prices of that thing to go up. That's not necessarily indicative of overall inflation--since consumers experience things like high housing and medical costs as a reduction in their real incomes, they may spend less on things for which they have elastic demand.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yet another problem with this thesis is that it assumes that the government has an incentive to try to save money, and that's why it's underreporting inflation.\n\nHave you seen the size of the federal budget deficit?

And if the dollar is worth less, we call that inflation. \n\nIncidentally the dollar has fallen 8% to the euro in the same length of time (despite the EU issuing €1.5billion in QE in that period) and the dollar has fallen 12% to the pound despite QE from the UK government in the billions, and the dollar has fallen 98% to the currency that shall not be named.  \n\nPeople say the stock market is in an ATH bubble.  I disagree.  It's worth exactly the same as it has always been worth,  the dollar is just worth less.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Who is the retartd that posted this shit?

The last 10-12 years has been tremendous for assets due to low interest rates. My theory is that due to technology our economy has become more and more efficient. If every year they can bring corn yields up 2% and inflation was at 2% then corn price would remain flat. You get what I'm saying? If the dollar is just supply and demand then in order to counteract increased demand for dollars ( DXY up) they could print more dollars to bring it down. It doesn't mean the demand got lower however. If the printer gets jammed than we'll see whats under the cloak. Until then, SPY 500c.\n\nEdit: I completely forgot to make the point about assets. When assets fell during March of last year, look at what happened to DXY? It moon'd. Showing deflation. However, printing money, brought DXY back down to show inflation. However, what everybody and their grandmas did was take their newfound $2400 fortune and put it into equities rather than buying goods. This means the demand for dollars in a goods and rent market was actually low. Hence why we don't see CPI increasing by much. When people take profits, they want to buy a ton of corn and the demand in goods market for dollars goes up. Personally, I believe there are two very valid perspectives to COVID induced asset increases. One is that we saw alot of technological advancements that made every day easier for even post COVID era, meaning where SPY and QQQ are right now is justifiable. Two is that this market is a ponzi scheme fueled by money printing. Meaning SPY and QQQ grew unjustifiably. This argument, which I suppose you are going for, means that assets are facing the blunt of the inflation, meaning this year we probably had 5%+ worth of inflation and CPI isn't reflecting it as it is more concerned with the goods market rather than the equities market. Personally, I think it's a mixture of both. I don't know though, I'm just a slightly more evolved form of monkey floating on a rock traveling very fast around a glowing gas ball trying to make sense of something seemingly so abstract.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What does this mean to us lowly Americans?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Inflation only exists if you think it does. its all made up.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What the fuck is the point of a government saving money?\n\nSure, it'll probably cost folks more for good government but isn't that how things are supposed to work?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’ve held the same belief for a long time.
