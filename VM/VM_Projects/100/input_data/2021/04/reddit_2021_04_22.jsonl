{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 22, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 22, 2021**\n\nStocks fell on Thursday, erasing yesterday’s gains as market volatility continues. Stocks fell after Bloomberg reported that President Biden would propose increasing the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.91% down, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.94% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 1.21%.\n\nAccording to a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy), President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. \n\nCorporate earnings have so far exceeded Wall Street’s even lofty expectations, as companies benefited from both a surge in consumer spending as the economy opens back up and cost-cutting measures implemented during the height of the pandemic.  However, despite the largely positive earnings, many stocks have failed to react positively to the news. It seems as more positive economic data is released in terms of consumer spending and unemployment, it takes more and more impressive results to convince investors to pile into the stock. This suggests there is froth in the markets given the sky-high valuation of some companies, in our opinion.\n\nJim Caron, investment management fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley (MS) said, “What we have is the absence of a catalyst. Everything that we’ve done over the last twelve months has been to build up to this point, to get this recovery, to get a very, very strong second-quarter GDP, which we think could be upwards of 10%. But after that, things start to slow down. It doesn’t mean that the data gets bad, it just means on a relative basis that the third quarter will be weaker than the second quarter and the fourth quarter may be weaker than the third quarter.”\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla Inc. vehicles in the wake of a fatal crash in Texas.\n* Square (SQ) announced that it plans to make new inventory-management features available to its sellers.The company is rolling out tools that help sellers automate their inventory-management processes by using barcode scanners to take stock of inventory and receiving alerts driven by machine learning to see when an item is due to run out.\n* The White House announced more than 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been distributed in the US, greatly surpassing original estimates of 100 million doses delivered in the first 100 days of Biden’s presidency. On the back of this robust distribution, all states are beginning to open back up.\n* Mortgage applications jumped 8.6% in the week ended April 16, marking the biggest jump since late January as mortgage rates pulled back following a surge, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). \n* Ford Motor (F) is planning more downtime at five North American factories due to a global semiconductor shortage. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written in the morning and does not reflect current stock price\\*\\***\n* Twitter (TWTR) target raised by Argus from $72 to $82 at Buy.

If AAPL begins to drop, your ATM will move OTM and due to gamma will have a shrinking delta. To counter this we will BTC the 135 and STO the 130. To make sure we maintain or improve our original position we need to make sure that our closing profit + net extrinsic value gained (130 extrinsic value - 135 extrinsic value) is greater than $500 ($5 strike x 100 shares). If you do not spot check this before doing so or adjusting your strike, you will give up your maximum profit from your original roll and lose ground. When I am selling ATM CCs I will perform this roll as soon as I am able each and every time.\n\nEdit: After digging through logs it looks like there is still a little slippage. It might be the way that TW calculates net extrinsic or perhaps part of it is double counted. So be aware you will still give up a little bit of “max profit” doing this but taking profit and keeping your deltas aligned will probably suit you better then letting the underlying free fall.

The quick and dirt is this:\n\nSell ATM with the most extrinsic value, TLT has weeklies so if you really wanted to push the bounds of your income you can sell weeklies or use my 45+ DTE method. Any time you can roll the strike down with positive extrinsic, do it. There will be some slippage, but that can be fixed by a roll out later. The goal is to milk as much extrinsic as possible and then let the shares go with a bullish move. Then reset by buy/writing again. If you get into a situation with an extreme downturn (think SPY Feb-Mar 2020) you will want to wait until your combined CC delta gets close to zero, say when your short call gets to maybe 70-80 and then neutralize the short call delta as a spread (it might take a ratio) then let that spread come to it's conclusion or manage it separately if you want to try and theta your way out of it or reduce it's locked in losses. Then you can sell 30 delta CCs until TLT or whatever other underlying you are rocking recovers. Keep rolling the 30 delta call down when there is another strike available at 30.\n\nThis is really hard to explain and my best advise is to go into TOS, start around Feb 20, 2020 OnDemand and sell 3 SPY covered calls using weeklies 7 DTE (or just rock the monthlies). Skip ahead a few hours at a time and anytime you can roll the strike down do it. When another 7 DTE contract opens up and you are able to roll your strike down again roll it down and out. Keep doing this until late March when SPY bottoms out, then it's time to maneuver like a dolphin. Keep doing the ATM puts but anytime your combined delta gets neutralized, turn the short call into a spread and count that week as a loss, then sell another call. Rinse and repeat. You should come out with breakeven around end of April early May? Spy will still be down 15%. Practice this until you can do it correctly.\n\nThis is 100% hindsight but it will help you hone your technique, since you know exactly what SPY is doing.

So I am leveraged 2x using 30% BPR. Which means a 2020 drop will put my net liq at 360k (360k from long - 120k from hedge). If you can stomach that and roll to recovery great.

But when it comes to changes in the capital-gains tax rate, specifically, stocks are unlikely to be meaningfully affected.\n\nIncreased corporate and capital-gains tax rates could be on the way. Government spending certainly hasn’t been light in the past year, with [trillions of dollars of fiscal stimulus and potentially](https://www.barrons.com/articles/dow-jones-industrial-average-surged-big-stimulus-on-the-way-51612822321?mod=article_inline)[ $2 trillion more for infrastructure spending.

Centrist Democrats in Congress are also pushing back against Biden’s corporate tax proposal. That’s a key reason that ](https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-it-could-mean-for-stocks-if-biden-raises-corporate-taxes-51616447175?mod=article_inline)[Goldman Sachs](https://www.barrons.com/quote/GS) strategists this week forecast that the corporate tax rate would rise to just 25%, below Biden’s proposed 28%.\n\nThe capital-gains tax is a separate concern. Under Biden’s proposal, those earning $1 million or more annually would see capital gains on stocks taxed at 39%—the ordinary income-tax rate—versus the current capital-gains tax rate of 20%. Nobody knows what the rate will be, but the same pushback from centrist Democrats suggests it will be well below 39%.\n\nIn addition, history shows no discernible correlation between equity valuations and changes to the capital-gains tax rate. An increase in capital-gains taxes should lower an investors’ after-tax return and, in theory, would be reflected in stock-market valuations, or what investors pay for every dollar of profits. Investors may only be willing to pay a lower multiple for near-term profits, given that the after-tax rate of return would be lowered.\n\nBut that correlation isn’t visible. Research from [UBS](https://www.barrons.com/quote/UBS) Global Wealth Management shows that earnings multiples on the [S&P 500](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SPX) can range from roughly 8 times to as high as over 20 times regardless of whether capital-gains taxes are at 15% or near 30%.\n\nIndeed, there is “no relationship between capital-gains taxes and market returns,” writes David Lefkowitz, head of Americas equities at UBS. In 2013, for example, the S&P 500 gained 30% even though the capital-gains tax rate rose nine percentage points. In 1981, the tax rate fell about eight percentage points, but the S&P 500 still fell 10%.\n\nThe reality is that earnings growth and interest rates are the most important factors affecting stocks, which makes assessing the impact of tax rate changes on stocks difficult. One effect on the market, according to Arthur Weise, chief investment officer of Kingsland Growth Advisors, is that investors may gain interest in growth stocks over value stocks. The reason: Growth stocks benefit from longer-term industry changes, while value stocks are more impacted by the near-term movements of the economy, Weise says.\n\nAnd holding a stock for that much longer would diminish any negative impact of a higher tax.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wealth tax may not be a capital gains tax lol", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "where is there any mention of a wealth tax?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Nah you're right.

{"title": "$TTCF Tattooed Chef, a plant based food brand. The next Beyond Meat 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Fellow rocket ship enthusiasts, I present to you a Due Diligence developed by yours truly, [u/yoloallinbro](https://www.reddit.com/u/yoloallinbro/), borrower of NINJA loans.\n\nTattooed Chef is a plant-based food brand. They have vertically integrated manufacturing and are available in stores like Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam's Club. TLDR is below.\n\n**Fundamentals:**\n\n* 2021 expected revenue is $222m, expected net income is $2.5m-$5m\n* 2020 revenue was $148.5m, net income was $41.5m (I think \\~$40m was one time tax deduction)\n* 2019 revenue was $84.9m, net income was $2.2m\n* Current market cap is $1.34b\n* Merged with SPAC $FMCI in October 2020.\n* It's shorted to oblivion according to finviz, fintel, and iborrowdesk. 30% short float.\n* 2021 Q1 earnings expected to report around May 8th.\n* Insiders own a total of 48% of the company.\n   * Recently, an insider director bought 250k shares on April 15th.\n\n**Qualitative notes:**\n\n* CEO Salvatore \"Sam\" Galletti is the founder of the company. He's worked in the food business for 35 years. It started off as a private family business. He was approached to go public via SPAC and took the opportunity because of massive capital injection to build out Tattooed Chef, the brand.\n* Tattooed Chef is a new brand that the company started working on in 2017. Before this brand, they were only private label providers to stores like Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. They still operate these private label customer accounts alongside the Tattooed Chef brand.\n* The company is entirely vertically integrated (namely, its manufacturing).\n* His daughter, Sarah Galletti, is the Chief Creative Officer of Tattooed Chef. Her job is to design new products. The CEO said her core strength is getting designs out quickly and that is complementary with the company's vertically integrated manufacturing so that they can get the product out from design quickly.\n* They've spent like 0 dollars on advertising. They developed a plan to hit 2 billion impressions in the form of 6 and 16 second videos in the first 8 months of 2021. This is the first time they're spending advertising dollars.\n   * Small nuance: they spent dollars on product demos in Sam's Club. But that is negligible spend.\n* They have 11 SKUs in Walmart, in over 2000 of their super centers. They started off in Sam's Club. They also have SKUs in Costco. They were given an opportunity to have 2 SKUs in Target, and recently in March 2021 they got approved for 6 SKUs.\n   * The way the food business works in regards to shelf space is, the stores want to shelve products that actually sell. They have to meet sells-per-week requirements. They started off with smaller SKU allocation in Walmart and Target and after proving their products they've grown to the SKU numbers they have now. That's a very good sign.\n* Twitter and Discord groups like Jeremy Lefebvre and Dumb Money post pictures of local Target frozen shelves being out of TTCF stock. Search Twitter for $TTCF and you'll see them. Also the comments on TTCF's official twitter account have stuff like \"yo get the product in my target please, it's always out of stock\" and \"when you gonna be in europe please\".\n   * Youtuber Jeremy Lefebvre DM'd the TTCF instagram account asking something like \"hey is this a production issue on your end or what? my target is always empty\" and they replied saying something like \"nah bro we just selling hella haha\". Very good sign.\n* A common conception is TTCF only produces frozen products. That is not true. They're already working on ambient products, designed by Sarah. The CEO said an interview in December that they should have their first ambient product out in 60-90 days (so sometime Q2 2021).\n   * Note that they're not an ambient manufacturer, so they'll have to work with a co-packer. This is like their first dependency outside of their vertically integrated manufacturing.\n* 2021 is about aggressively growing the TTCF brand and focusing on revenue. Before, the CEO ran the private business while always thinking about profitability. As a result, they've developed contribution margin quotas for each product they produce in their internal manufacturing. But now with SPAC capital injection, he can focus on growing the TTCF brand and get it into retail stores.\n   * Before 2021, their only sales was the CEO and his daughter. Now, they've hired marketing teams to get them into more retail stores, namely an ex-Coca Cola national sales manager.\n* Looking forward, Europe has a strong demand for their products as well, as plant-based proteins are growing in affinity. TTCF has 2 manufacturing plants, one in California and one in Italy. It's cheaper for them to ship ingredients from Italy to the US for their US operations. So they're looking to hire sales in Europe to get TTCF in stores there. According to their twitter, they're already in Costco UK.\n\n**Competitive edges:**\n\n* Most food brands in this space are not profitable -- they burn a ton of marketing dollars while their manufacturing costs are high. This isn't a problem for TTCF because they've built manufacturing infrastructure for themselves since 2010.\n* The CEO views competition in the space as competing for shelf space. That comes down to having unique products. He says having Sarah as a creative and fast designer is a key edge to this.\n* Vertically integrated manufacturing.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n* It's basically a startup building a brand but with a profitable base of proven internal manufacturing as it was used for private labeling and a strong balance sheet. With building a brand comes all sorts of scaling challenges -- capital allocation for marketing spend, hiring employees to do sales, operating in new stores, etc. So they'll run into a bunch of growing pains. But I can't think of anything major. And also it doesn't look like they'll need to do share offering any time soon to raise money, so that's good.\n* Environmental conditions or macro conditions causes their ingredient chain to be more costly, reducing margins. I haven't dug into whether they're affected by commodity inflation yet, but because they own manufacturing I don't think it's a potentially big problem for them.\n* The company's history is honestly difficult to follow. They were like 2 different names before Tattooed Chef. An infographic kinda solves the problem tho, linked in sources below. And also people think it's only a frozen food brand, but they're actually working on ambient food too.\n* Recent news of the CFO leaving and a stock sell by the CEO give bad optics. But I think the headlines of these events make it seem way scarier than it actually is. The sale by CEO was planned.\n\n**News Clarifications:**\n\n* The CEO selling shares was to pay off debt.\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/docoh.com\\/filing\\/1821515\\/0001213900-21-021925\\/SC13DA](https://preview.redd.it/7e2pfzrursu61.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=86651dcfccb619226a2e580624964ec25b2d3c8e)\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* It looks super good on paper -- 50% YoY revenue growth, they're profitable, and only now they're tapping into advertising.\n* In the CEO interview, he said \"focus on aggressive growth\" like a bajillion times for 2021. Its 2021 revenue estimate of $222m only includes current accounts of Sam's Club, Costco, Walmart, and Target. So given new accounts will happen, this revenue estimate is conservative.\n* And given the recent SPAC sell off, I think now's a great entry point.\n* Market cap is 1.36B, that's a 7.4 forward PS. Beyond Meat $BYND has 2021 expected revenue $630m, and trades at a 13.6 forward PS (Market cap of BYND is $8.44B). The comp just makes it seem like an extremely asymmetric bet.\n   * If it trades at BYND's forward PS for 2021, then the share price would be \\~$36.\n   * My math for that is: 13.6 \\* $222m = 3b, share price at 3b would be \\~$36.\n   * But I personally think the revenue growth projections are very conservative, because the CEO said it only includes existing accounts, which is those 4 stores. Their 2021 aggro growth plan is to push into more retail stores.\n* I tried their food too, bought it at a local Target, it's pretty good for a frozen meal and as a meat eater I can see the appeal.\n* Obligatory rockets: 🚀🚀🚀\n\n**Position:**\n\n* 10,000 shares at $16.\n\n**Sources:** (note, mods ban youtube links, so I have to give you manual instructions lol)\n\n* Jeremy Lefebvre DMing TTCF on Instagram asking about out of stock in Target:\n   * Search \"I AM LOSING A FORTUNE TTCF STOCKS AHHHH\" on Youtube and go to 11:22.\n* 1 hour interview with CEO (yes, I watched the whole thing):\n   * Search \"Tattooed Chef (TTCF) CEO & President Sam Galletti FULL INTERVIEW at ROTH Webinar\" on Youtube\n* 2020 Q4 earnings report: [https://ir.tattooedchef.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/financial-information/quarterly-results)\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\n* I'm not a financial advisor.

It's another brand trying to play both sides, so they're already sacrificing brand loyalty with a segment of the population they should be trying to nab as loyal customers: vegans and plant-based dieters. This is to try instead to appeal to the ovo-lacto vegetarian crowd. \n\nVegetarians will eat vegan food, but vegans won't eat eggs and dairy. Morningstar Farms (of Kellogg's) saw the problem with this.

The hardest part is just getting oneself to do it. It's all uphill from there in my experience.\n\nI'm with you on sentiment about this company. I've had TTCF on my watchlist for a while now but never bought in because they sell animal products, so I don't want to support it but I also can't be bullish on companies that are wish-washy and misuse the term \"plant-based\".

If you look up this brand on forums or on reddit, it's always \"WTF I bought this and it's not even vegan\". Creating a bad experience for customers trying to do the right thing is a fast way to get cancelled by a core customer base for a brand. That comes down to leadership not knowing their market because they're not a part of it. \n\nThe founder and former CEO of Tofurky, Seth Tibbott, on the other hand, has been vegan since the 70s and his company is going strong to this day with popular, reasonably priced, tasty products that occupy a lot of shelf space in tens of thousands of stores and they have a loyal following.

I've been playing with SPY and indexes recently, and it led me to formulate an interesting outlook on the current state of the market. I am really curious about what [noble WSB gentlemen](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/) have to say on all these findings, so feel welcomed to engage in the discussion upon reading the post.\n\nCompulsory, this is not a financial advice, and I am not an advisor - more than that, I am almost confident that I don't even know what I'm doing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S. Commenting \"Stonks only go up\" as a counter-thesis is perma 🌈🐃  \n\n\n# I. The Abstract\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main purpose of this work is to provide a technical counter-thesis to the current market craze, and to spark a constructive discussion. As it was mentioned in the post title, the tools that were used for creating this TA on SPY include: market cycles analysis, for setting a suitable framework; Elliot waves theory as a method of ordering major market movements; Fibonacci retracement for identifying the key, magnetic support and resistance levels; and a sweet 150 moving average to predict the potential bottom of the bear market. These tools will also be given a deeper explanation in the beginning of the discussion, for a bigger circle of WSB participants to wrap their brains around the technical factors at play. If you consider yourself to be a trader with sufficient technical knowledge and skills, feel free to skip the part II. The third part will be focused on the technical data accumulation, based on the historical examples from different time periods, and for different markets types. Part IV is the juiciest, as it incorporates the thesis formation through the application of all the data accumulated in the process of the analysis. V is a bonus part. Without further ado, let's get started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# II. The Technical Core\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Market Cycles**\n\n[S&P 500 example is used to illustrate market cycles: orange rectangle highlights accumulation phase, blue - mark-up, turquoise - distribution, and red stands for the mark-down](https://preview.redd.it/8hqda630diu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0c94fecc97785e480b47ef1a6a36448edf7edf8)\n\nCycles appear in many aspects of life; ranging from the very short-term, e.g. the life cycle of a June bug, which lives only a few days (like an average WSB participant's portfolio), to the life cycles of planets and galaxies, which take billions of years.\n\nNo matter what market the reference is being made to, the phases are usually not too difficult to identify, and these are cyclical: rise, peak, dip, and then bottom out (and not rise, rise, rise, and rise as many financial experts here strongly believe). As the consequence of the cyclical nature, when one market cycle is finished, the next one begins.\n\nTo see how this works on the financial markets, check the SPY cyclicality on the chart provided above (and for a deeper explanation of each phase, just duckduckgo 'market cycles' and click the first link - this should do well).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **Elliot wave principle**\n\n[Impulsive 1-2-3-4-5 \\(purple\\) and corrective A-B-C \\(burgundy\\) Elliot waves applied to the Silver 2019 bull rally and the subsequent correction, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/3159lojsciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f6325a7df3af7ffa1a9f4e9d92c045e19cec5517)\n\nGood old Elliot! The smart accountant guy, cherished by many technical traders, created his analytical tools as far back as in the 1930s. He discovered and developed the principle that a market moves according to collective investor or 'crowd' psychology, swinging between optimism and pessimism in natural sequences (which can be analyzed with the application of structural wave patterns). Such sentiment swings result in patterns evidenced in the price movements of markets at every degree of trend or time scale (akin fractals). \n\nThe wave theory is a complex subject in itself, with many advancements and different wave structures. For the purposes of this analysis only the core principles of impulsive and corrective waves patterns will be used, in order to not over-complicate the process. The fundamental idea behind the Elliot principle is fairly simple, follow Wiki explanation, applying it to the example chart above (Silver):  \n\n\n>In Elliott's model, market prices alternate between an impulsive, or motive phase, and a corrective phase on all time scales of trend. Impulses are always subdivided into a set of 5 lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3. Corrective waves subdivide into 3 smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective waves move against it.\n\nFurthermore, each wave has its own additional rules and guidelines, which will be mentioned later in the analysis. What should also be noted at this point, is that Mr. Elliot was careful to specify that these patterns do not provide any kind of certainty about future price movement, but rather, serve in helping to order the probabilities for future market action.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Fibonacci retracement**\n\n[Fibo application, NASDAQ weekly chart: pay attention to how the price action plays nicely with the Fibonacci levels](https://preview.redd.it/0ur1l80kciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1f45c8fab9bf03f9daebaf9054b2952f9571ee7)\n\nLeonardo Bonacci is another important name for any technical trader. It is no wonder, because Fibonacci retracement, as a method of technical analysis, is considered to be one of the most popular techniques for determining support and resistance levels. The Fibonacci retracement tool plots percentage retracement lines based upon the mathematical relationship within the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci retracement is based on a core idea that markets will retrace a predictable portion of a move, after which they will continue to move in the original direction. Again, follow Wiki explanation, checking out the NASDAQ chart above:   \n\n\n>Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points on a chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios. 0.0% is considered to be the start of the retracement, while 100.0% is a complete reversal to the original part of the move. Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify possible support and resistance levels. The significance of such levels, however, could not be confirmed by examining the data. Arthur Merrill in Filtered Waves determined there is no reliably standard retracement: not 50%, 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, nor any other.\n\n  \nAnd that is the case! From my own experience, there is no ultimate, universal, favorable to the market Fibo correction level, applicable to all the charts and time-frames. However, as it will be observed and discussed later, many of the cycles' examples addressed will point at 61.8% and 78.6% levels, that is worth keeping in mind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. **150 Simple Moving Average**\n\n[The same chart as in the Fibo example, but here the 150 MA is applied; as it can be seen, the correction bounces off it](https://preview.redd.it/dnjkrx9eciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b819b20afea7aef8363cc6ce06e5f8a3e773a33b)\n\nThe simple moving average (SMA) is a straightforward technical indicator that is obtained by summing the recent data points in a given set and dividing the total by the number of time periods. In trading, the moving averages are used to identify the direction of a trend, as well as potential support and resistance levels (and that's how it will actually be utilized in the thesis). It can be computed for different types of prices, i.e., low, high, close or open - and personally, I usually work with the close price.\n\nMoving averages are a matter of personal taste and preference. For example, for the short term trades and analysis I use 21 moving average, and it works like a charm. The MA that is of an interest for this technical thesis - is the 150 close simple MA. As for the long term trends, it seems to work as a strong correction magnet for the bears' run, as well as an ultimate support for the long term uptrend, as you should see yourselves in the examples that follow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# III. The Historical Examples\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAllrighty, now lets play with some of the major market cycles examples, applying the TA techniques described above in order to identify potential parallels, similarities/differences and to accumulate some data before jumping to the current SPY cycle. All of the charts in III are monthly charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Dow Jones 1994-2003**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eiw0sae6ciu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad8f837d4135ce4d2caf2f24bcdd3052fae477d0\n\nStarting with the cycles, the pattern is fairly obvious: accumulation (always highlighted orange) in 1994; followed by the upward trend (that is the mark-up stage) 1995-1999; what should really draw your attention here, is this fat and long distribution phase, in turquoise, lasting for about two years (this is exceptionally long, as will be seen with other comparisons); the cycle is closed with the year and a half long bear market, that is the mark down phase.\n\nThen, take a closer look at this beautiful motive phrase wave that resembles a perfect TA book example. For the purple impulsive 1-2-3-4-5 wave there are, always, three cornerstone parameters, that have to be confirmed in order for the wave analysis to work out properly:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Wave 2 never retraces more than 100% of wave 1 (✅)\n* Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulse waves, namely waves 1, 3 and 5 (fat ✅, 3 is fucking huge here)\n* Wave 4 does not overlap with the price territory of wave 1 (✅✅)  \n\n\nThen, the most interesting piece, the bear market. Several observations to be made here: A-B-C corrective wave looks fairly ordinarily, though, typically C wave exceeds A wave to a good proportion, and in the current scenario A and C look almost like twins; the due attention should be paid to 150 MA, which acted as a strong support in this case, creating the foothold for the next accumulation phase and subsequently turning the bearish market into a bullish one. The MA acts together with the 61.8% Fibo retracement - another strong supportive factor.\n\n*Overall, a good example of a balanced market cycle with the exceptional distribution phase + interesting Fibo 61.8% and 150 MA tandem support play for the bear market bottom.*  \n\n\nNow, starting from the next chart, I will only concentrate on the crucial points. Which means, that you should do your wrinkle-less brain a favor and go through the following checklist off your own bat: identify and analyze the cycles; come back to the DJ 1-2-3-4-5 wave criteria if necessary and practice applying it to the other charts; check the Fibonacci retracement, how it fits and how the waves play with it - many interesting discoveries to be made in that relation. And finally, pay a lot of attention to bear markets: how these start, the steepness, A-B-Cs development, and how Fibo and/or MA save the day. It is also a good idea to apply your own technical outlook spidey senses and compare the charts provided. Feel free to share the findings! \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fucking Ricardo Milos appears out of fucking nowhere and hands you:](https://preview.redd.it/8cbnni3rbiu61.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2056cf0004b4cd1c2ece261e10471887d4db8069)\n\n[a memo of Elliot waves characteristics.](https://preview.redd.it/6wezltfxbiu61.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b9178c969024c6d3bb8377be188994ffaedbc57)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **DAX 2003-2009**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0q3k1608diu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c19967cfe7e52d271716ab4190ad7fc1db41205\n\nGoing further, lets take a look at DAX 2003-2009 cycle. Remember the checklist, run through that quickly yourself: cycles stages, waves, Fibo and MA.\n\nWhen analyzing the growth stage manifested by 1-2-3-4-5, *take a note of the first wave, that kicks 78.6% Fibo, and is temporarily held by it - this happens often, and is easily identifiable on many of the exemplary charts. Pay closer attention to the play and the structure of wave 1 here, as it really is a good example of how it should look*. Checking 3 and 5 then - these are big, fat and extensive, and the muscular bulls are to be given credit for that.\n\nWhat I also feel like pointing at, is the demolishing A-B-C correction, orchestrated by such as muscular bears. The impulse itself is extremely steep, and the full structure resembles a cutthroat dagger - literally, figuratively, visually and even in fucking vibes. Wave A almost touches 38.2% support, B wave bounces from it with a Jedi flick, and is reversed by 23.6% (*take a note of A💛38.2%, B🧡23.6%*) into a dagger blade C wave. The bears are so powerful at this impulsive C wave correction stage, so they are able to crush through 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% and 150MA altogether, only to be stopped by the support of a last resort (not without a fight), that is 78.6%. Next, the eight month consolidation (re-accumulation) was happening under 150MA and in between 61.8% and 78.6%, just to powerfully revert the price action back to the bullish trend, and the next bull run started. *It can be said that the 150MA, 61.8% and 78.6% played as a delicious bait for bears, for which the three were almost torn to shreds, but hedl.*\n\nOne more thing here. Comparing the current example with the A-B-C wave from the DJI example above, the following point has to be mentioned. If you may recall, A and C in DJ were almost identical. With DAX, C is how I like it. *Remember, C is typically at least as large as wave A and very often extends to 1.618 times wave A or beyond* \\- which is the current case.\n\n*Important Waves TL;DR: 1💙 78.6% Fibo, while A💛38.2%, and B🧡23.6%. C🗡*23.6%/38.2%/50%/61.8%/150 MA while 💙*78.6% (check the other charts for these points).* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **GOLD 2005-2016**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdf6ducxziu61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb241f0f72a2d1fc6038a25e40dceceba552ab85\n\nThe next chart to look at is a famous gold rally. Another important parameter of 1-2-3-4-5 is worth mentioning at this point: *2 and 4 usually have the following interdependence - if the second, corrective wave is flat, the fourth wave tends to have a sharper structure and vice versa*. This principle is illustrated and supported by the chart above. Furthermore, take a look at 3 and 5, which are massive again. This indicates that the bulls are really powerful in this cycle.\n\nTalking about the A-B-C correction, it can observed that again A💛38.2% Fibo. Moreover, this time the retrace level magnetizes the price action firmly, so that the subsequent B wave and a substantial part of C wrap around 38.2% level. The three year correction phase morphs into the accumulation, which is supported by the 50% retracement. Interestingly enough, the lows occurring during this consolidation follow the slope of 150 MA, signalling its supporting power.\n\n*Overall, we see a powerful bullish trend, followed by a relatively lengthy distribution phase, followed by a mild correction to 50% retracement, which proves bulls to be fundamentally strong in this market. Even though 150 MA seems to act as an invitation to bears initially, at the end of the day it is on the bulls side, protecting 61.8% and 78.6% from the bothersome honey lovers, and making them scared just by its look alone. And yeah, almost forgot, 1💙 78.6% Fibo.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. **WTI 2002-2009**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/la6h991b0ju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80537e5a774b8bc3814b19a36565d388f4aa994d\n\nOoh, the fifth wave looks just crazy on this chart, and that is in the nature of volatile markets such as WTI. There are several points of interest for the reader in this example. The noticeable one, is that there is no obvious distribution phase on the chart above. That is, again, the nature of volatility - *sometimes some of the markets are moving too fast, not leaving investors a chance to unhurriedly close their positions (or giving a very short window). There is a chance for the thesis to play out similarly, so let’s take a note here*.\n\nA-B-C here is pure art, so hardcore that there are no green candles (on 1M chart). It is difficult to imagine how fun it was to be a bear throughout this correction. As a result of such an intensive move, it is difficult to identify and separate the waves here, but not impossible. Analysing A-B-C: A💛38.2 again, whereas B is almost nonexistent, which probably should also be attributed to the volatility. C, in its turn, is a masterpiece of a bear creation: it pierces 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6% and the 150 MA altogether (*the latter two again act as a sweet spot for the bears to touch down throughout the whole correction phase*) with a sequence of three lethal red candles. Brutal.\n\n*Yet again, 78.6% Fibo and 150 MA save the bulls’ asses and reverse the bearish trend. And how about this observation: if A💛38.2, then it is fair to say C💙61.8%/78.6%💜150 MA - again, check the other charts for that assertion.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. **HANG SENG 2003-2009**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpnskc4k0ju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=16732da18c67e65b3ddf59048c95a188a231561d\n\nHang Seng, Konnichi wa! Interesting chart of another volatile market, with several major similarities to the previous example: powerful 3 and 5, microscopic distribution phase, A wave piercing 38.2%, C behaving almost identically as WTI C in relation to 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6% and the 150 MA.\n\nAdditionally: 1💙78.6%; B🧡23.6% - never forget!\n\n*Also, what I noticed to be a common characteristic for the majority of examples here: the tougher 3 and 5 are, the more severe correction follows. Check this point out on the other charts!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. And finally, the thesis's grandfather **S&P 500 1995-2003**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jidh8gfq4ju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=201f78a3a268c62c8bd52d758dd569d58b2c257b\n\nThis is the last one before SPY thesis explanation, I promise! Also, this historical example has the biggest weight among all of the discussed here, because this is the direct predecessor of the current cycle.\n\nTo begin with, 1💙78.6%. You may find it funny, or mocky that I refer to that often, but this one is a crucial point to help with the Fibo application for the thesis later. Next, 1-2-3-4-5 checklist ✅ (refer to DJI for that matter). Solid wave 3 and wave 5, which also tend to correlate with the severity of the bear phase - and again the correlation is confirmed in this cycle.\n\nThe distribution phase lasts for about 7 months, allowing plenty of time for investors to fix their profits, before the powerful A-B-C correction starts (looks a bit like DAX dagger). You may notice that A💛38.2%, and B🧡23.6% again, and these prevailing patterns will also be among the cornerstones for building the thesis. C wave, in its turn, while breaking through 61.8% Fibo retracement, gently touches 150 MA to complete the mark-down phase. 150 MA subsequently acts as a sound support for the next accumulation phase, after which the market reverts back to the bullish consensus. \n\nThe price action elaborated in the second part of the previous paragraph yet again serves as a strong support for the proposition that *a) during a bear market 150 MA coupled with 61.8% or 78.6% plays as a reference point for the bears to aim to; and b) 150 MA + 61.8%/78.6% never (at least in the examples provided) let the bulls down in the long term*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# IV. Dr. Bearlove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bear Market\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHooray! If you've read the whole thing and came this far, you are an exceptional WSB citizen of focus, commitment and sheer fucking will. If you just jumped here for the most juicy part, I should strongly encourage you to at least check several examples from III, as these are helpful in understanding what tf is going on here (I hope so).\n\nDiving deeper now, I decided to separate the thesis into four parts: applying the core analysis and the data accumulated to 1-2-3-4-5, as the first (1) step; (2) explaining the A-B-C wave parameters of the thesis based on the historical data accumulated; and then (3) providing additional context to back up and explain the starting point of the mark-up phase (the orange triangle's nose, on the chart below) - please take it take for granted for now; while the last piece of puzzle incorporates the elaboration of the distribution's and A-B-C's duration (4).  \n\n\n[The Thesis Restated](https://preview.redd.it/3zyw4s3tsju61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58a0b02a76265ae06da11d0225cfe16e19bbcd40)\n\n1. **Fucking Finally**\n\nRemember 1💙78.6% (and DAX wave 1 explanation)? This is what originally gave me a hint of where to start looking for the proper 1-2-3-4-5 application. Before identifying this structure, I attempted to apply waves and Fibo to Mar 2009, or Oct 2011 as to the starting points, and these just didn't fit. Several mindfucks later I noticed that June 2013 \\[elaborated upon later in ⬇️(3) in a very great detail, I promise!\\] is the actual 1-2-3-4-5 initiation point, and it all started rollin'...\n\nFibonacci retracement coupled with the Elliot wave theory, when applied properly, may well be used as a beacon shining the light on the timeliness and the necessity of a correction. In my opinion, the thesis illustrates that metaphor incredibly well, just by showing how precisely the technical framework fucking fits this SPY lab 🐁. Take a look how adherent the price action is in its interaction with the Fibo levels (e.g. the lengthy consolidations below 78.6% and in between 50% and 61.8%, or 23.6% clearly acting as a resistance during 4). But most importantly, check out this gorgeous Elliot waves 1-2-3-4-5 pattern, which is either completed already (my bet), or will be done in the not so distant future. Let me elaborate on all of that.\n\nStaring from Fibo and wave one, this time the price action surrounding apex of wave 1, wave 2 and the beginning of 3 💙78.6% for about 2 years! If this is not a true love, then I don’t know what is. Wave 1, in this case, is a very solid incarnation of the traditional 1 structure: soft, relaxed and unhurried. Additionally to that, 1 looks similar to four other examples in III, particularly DAX, Gold, WTI and Hang Seng.\n\nNext, let’s recall an important principle regarding 1-2-3-4-5, discussed in III:3 (Gold), namely: the structures for the second and the fourth wave usually alternate in the following interdependence - if the second wave is a flat correction, wave four tends to have a sharper structure and vice versa. Take a look at the thesis chart again: like in a fucking Raffaello slogan - more than a thousand words.\n\nThe final step to do is to go through the 1-2-3-4-5 golden checklist, introduced in III:1 (DJI):  \n\n\n* Wave 2 never retraces more than 100% of wave 1 (just ✅)\n* Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulse waves, namely waves 1, 3 and 5 (✅)\n* Wave 4 does not overlap with the price territory of wave 1 (✅, however, with a minor remark: vertical 4 was really close to breaking the rule in this case, but... Elliot \\[or JPOW, if you are a fundamentals guy\\] intervened just in time for the bulls)\n\nIs it fair to say that the confirmations provided above ere enough to support the thesis in relation to 1-2-3-4-5 and Fibo? I would say yes, but what do I know? What is your opinion, fellow expert?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **Stonks Only Go Up, (Except for Retracements)**\n\n[One more time, for the sake of convenience](https://preview.redd.it/ax2isvnikru61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12e75efe538cee76f0fa852f89ff85417099cfa7)\n\nNow, let's discuss the most ungrateful part. Ungrateful, because the chances are, well, that markets will shit on your TA and forecasts, even if a lot of effort was put into it. So what, I am not a fucking pussy to stop trying and learning.\n\nAnyway, this is how I got the A-B-C projection parameters. Again, based purely on the historical data accumulated. First things first, A💛38.2%, and at this point it is an understatement. Please, refer to III and check the charts. Seriously, do not be lazy, it is worth it. Because you will notice that A wave gravitates to 38.2% on all of the examples analyzed, to a great extent. Especially, check the grandfather (III:6), which weights at least twice as much for the thesis, compared to others (perks of being relatives). B wave, in its turn, retraces to 23.6% or above in 4 cases out of 6: DJI, DAX, Hang Seng and the grandfather - which is sufficient to assume that B🧡23.6%, imho.\n\nOh yeah, wave C. It was stopped by 50% Fibo once (Gold), twice by 61.8% (grandfather and DJI) and three times by 78.6% in DAX, WTI and Hang Seng. Also, it has been evident through all of the examples, that C has a fetish for 150 MA, and it is mutual. These factors, after being summed up, weighted, and distilled - point at the zone between 61.8% and 78.6% Fibo. And guess what? The grandfather's C landed just there. Noice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Fat, Ugly Cup Konsolidation**\n\n[The chart above represents a longer term outlook on SP 500. The price level of 155 played as a holding back factor, before being broken through in the middle of 2013, which resulted in the current bull run.](https://preview.redd.it/z7lvx4trlku61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=642d73ee2883b1b1c2fbee13c493df4c171d0edb)\n\nAs it has been mentioned, it was difficult for me to identify where to start the wave count for the thesis.

Great now that that's out of the way I may have figured out the catalyst for the drop or maybe the reason why stonks are going to fluctuate in a channel near the top before dropping...either that or I'm clinically proven to be retarded.\n\nSo the Biden tax plan for raising CGT on the rich is the catalyst. Why?\n\nI looked at some Fed data + a few research papers on wealth distribution and investing habits and the result was that the top 1% (who would be fucked by that tax) hold roughly 38.6T $ in assets. It's estimated roughly 25-38% is in the stock market (I assume the rest is either in some boring shit like bonds or something illiquid like land/real estate) and 75% of it is in taxable accounts (if you earn like 2m+/year there's only so much you can dump in retirement accounts).\n\nSo that brings us to a total of 9.65T-14.6T of US stocks held by those in the top 1%.\n\nNow the question is wtf would you do in preparation of a tax jump after a 12 year raging bull market if you were rich, succesful greedy? I would personally sell at least a part of my holdings to take advantage of the lower taxes and whatever is left in my brokerage account at the end I would keep as unrealized gains until either someone lowers CGT again or I lobby someone to lower CGT. There's no way I would sell any investments once the higher tax rate kicks in and I think this is why we'll have another bull market straight after the drop.\n\nWhich brings me to the final point. The $ amount of daily volume across all US exchanges is 10T and when buy & sell side volume is the same that's where stonks don't move. How much would you need to move it by 1%? Well only 1% extra pressure from the sell side assuming buying is at normal levels so you'd need to sell 0.1T in one day.\n\nBringing me all of this back to my initial point. That 9.65T (which is actually the lower estimate) is very fucking illiquid and the more people panic the more illiquid it becomes. If you wanted to only sell 1% of your holdings you would have to do it in 30days+ to not raise any suspicion (you'd only be 0.2% of daily vol), to sell 5% you'd need to do it in about 60days. \n\nObviously this means everyone else is going to cooperate and only sell small amounts of their holdings daily, right?\n\nWell I doubt it. We all know finance is one giant shark tank. It's just a matter of whether all the big boys affected by the new taxes are going to think the same and whether their timing is going to overlap. That's probably also the moment all the 🌈hedge funds start to smell blood in the water and short.\n\nWhen is it? I don't know, sometime this year. I need to do more math to figure out how many days you'd need to sell 10-25% of that amount. Would you sell now if you were rich? What proportion of your holdings would you sell?

And a 50% premium is not likely.\n\nWhy the hell wouldn't whoever is buying the \"$12-15bn\" patent portfolio **just buy the company** considering market cap is $4.8bn and that would buy **everything** BB has?\n\nAnd Motorola sold 17k patents + 7500 applications, not 7500, Kodak isn't a comparable company (how are image processing patents similar to BBs patent portfolio?) You've not provided any source for Nokia's patent value but considering they're likely patents in 5G infrastructure they're going to be valued high and AOL sold patents for things like online advertising which would obviously attract high values - and isn't something BB deals in.\n\nNot to mention you're just so far off on everything else too, Blackberry Spark is no revolutionary piece of software. Microsoft, VMware, IBM all have better UEM products.\n\nQNX is not embedded in all IOT devices.\n\nJust admit you're holding bags, stop trying to create this false presumption that BB is this sleeping giant tech company.", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Let me take a crack at this.  Forget the patents, forget all that TA and FA.  BB got a moment under Obama, and I think they will have another under Biden.  I don't anticipate Biden/Dems being out in 4 years either, so this company that was favored by the Obama administration, now has friends in high places again, working out infrastructure for the next 8-10 years.

The share price peaked before Obama was President, never recovered, and was trading at current prices when he left? Unless you believe Biden for some reason has some raging hard-on for BB that doesn't breach any conflict of interest or doesn't damage his reputation, I can't see why a Biden administration would favour BB massively. I also don't really see how BB would have friends in high places - where? John Chen's only been CEO since 2013, so for half the Obama presidency (and after BBs peak relevancy). And how would those friends in high places be any different to the friends any powerful CEO would have? I imagine Bill Gates/Satya Nadella and the rest of Microsoft could sway the US government far more effectively.\n\nI know Obama used to use a BB phone, but he switched during his presidency, and I can't find what phone Biden uses. Additionally BB doesn't really make phones anymore so I can't see how it'd be too helpful. Might benefit TCL if the licensed BB phones are still in use. So I don't think there's even a serious reputational bonus for BB in the US government.\n\nI mean obviously it's pure speculation talking about FB/Google etc, but until we start seeing serious repercussions for data leaks does it really matter? The whole cambridge analytica scandal cost FB $5bn, nothing. Data leak the other day affected over 500mn people and there's not much talk of serious repercussions. They can get grilled all they want they won't stop until there is serious consequences, and tbh I don't see Biden delivering that.\n\nTalking of SolarWinds - you know the US government hasn't even announced they'll stop using SolarWinds, let alone the myriad of other suppliers like VMware, Cisco, Crowdstrike, Microsoft, GrammaTech, etc etc? I'd stake a bet that BB might be able to take advantage in a small way and get some more security contracts, but until I see that the US government is seriously thinking of shifting its cybersecurity outsourcing to BB I'm not going to believe it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The moment I'm referring to is one like Apple having put Mac's in kids hands back in the 90's.  The free phones that the government was supplying people as I recall under Obama was BB, so what I think they did is get everyone familiar with the operating software.  I think many of the large tech companies made their software adapting from BB's, and I think that's where the grilling and patents are going to intersect, especially when it comes to the amount of data collection and mishandling.  This is where I think they are going to have another moment and make some kind of resurgence.

It seems like a massive stretch to think a resurgence would happen because phones were used 10 years ago, especially when BB doesn't produce phones anymore.\n\nPatents are largely being sold off, so I don't really see how they're relevant either.\n\nAnd honestly, you're far more optimistic than I if you think some grilling by congress towards huge tech companies is going to change anything.

Why would you assume after Cambridge Analytica, or Solar Winds, or any of the many many huge cyber and data breaches in the last few years that anything will change?\n\nTruthfully as well, a lot of BBs cybersecurity suite isn't massively innovative.

I imagine when whales like FB buy it they pay big moneys.  And if some whales are found to have infringed upon patents when developing their platforms, I'd think restitutions might be in order, and I think there are these cases.\n\nSo why a resurgence?

But what is actually changing? As far as I'm aware FB hasn't been broken up or punished by Biden. Or punished by consumers.\n\nPatents are worth under $1.8bn  according to the latest BB balance sheet, under non-current assets. There's usually a price premium on these sorts of things but it's not at all going to be big money in the grand scheme of things. A very optimistic guess would be 3bn I'd say, more realistic is 2-2.5bn.\n\nPatent infringement from FB/Snap was settled in January, restitutions probably would've appeared in the end of feb accounts, so again, not going to be a lot. \n\nI mean, I don't really see much more of a hype around IVY. Institutional investors don't seem impressed yet and no offense but 99% of BB fans on WSB spout the same bullshit over and over again. There's really not much traction that I see - like I said, BB phones were relevant in the US government 10 years ago, things have moved on.

I get the sense a lot is changing come 5g.  I don't see the world interested in letting FB and the like off with light slaps on the wrist either, too much evidence that has been the cost of business isn't actually serving as a deterrent, and it's got the general public in a mood demanding transparency and accountability (which might just lead to patent infringements).  I think with the post pandemic world shaping up, BB has many optional roles they'll be able to take advantage of and have a name in good favor.  I wonder if their price has been depressed for a long time, given how much others generated from BB's intellectual property, and IF there are possible catalysts on the horizon like restitutions or new ventures.  I know people have the 'show me' approach before investing, and I suspect that's how you are with IVY, smart and respectable, however this is a Wendy's, and here we also buy the rumor and sell the news, so >$9 for the IVY rumors seems like a decent bottom. It may fall lower too, but I do predict by the time IVY news is actually flowing $9 will have been a value.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Eh, I think people have argued that the public will get fed up with data breaches and big tech for years, and yet there's not been any significant decline in usage of Apple/FB/Insta/Snap/Twitter/Google whatever. I think the significant luxury benefit of having these things will always outweigh the vague threat of what big tech can and will do to your data.\n\nAs far as BB patent revenue goes - they do actually license them out. It pulls in I think roughly $350mn a year? It's an okay revenue driver, but honestly not anything significant. They're also looking to sell a lot of these patents, and realistically there's a price cap on these - there's no way BB can make more than $4bn or so, any higher and it'd be easier for the purchasing party to just acquire the company and take the patents. Even $4bn isn't a lot of money, it's like two weeks of revenue for FB, one and a bit weeks for Google. Restitutions are already likely paid out, and revenue will drop after patents are sold as BB won't be able to license. Could easily see a share price dip after that.\n\nI think IVY is the shining star in BBs portfolio, but tbh it's nothing new - connected car systems/vehicle data platforms are owned by other company from big tech like Google/Microsoft to startups like Otonomo. IVY has an advantage in that currently QNX is a big OS in the automotive industry, but with companies like Tesla/VW (biggest future EV players) either running or planning to run their own OS, there's not a load of incentive to choose IVY over other platforms. Cars with IVY embedded won't ship until 2023 though, so I think I'll have a lot of time at roughly this price point to consider a buy in. Possibly a LEAP for 2023.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think what bad wolf was referring to about Obama handing out BB phones is he was setting up the masses to get use to their style. More of a conspiracy than facts. But with Canada going into business with BB, shows me they provide better security than others. I’m no cyber/communications expert but a country’s government picked BB over others. Those institutions have experts in that field drafting white pages on the topic and they base their decisions on that. So I wouldn’t say their services they provide are subpar. They must be able to compete or exceed their competition. I know their financials never showed any outstanding moments but they are in a whole new market now. Before it was just phoned that gave them their popularity. Now they are trying to be the best in cyber security and communications. The world will soon be moving to EV. Electric vehicles, more importantly autonomous vehicles. Chandler, Arizona has had a taxi service that’s autonomous since 2018. BB created software that will allow apps across all manufactures interfaces. Example would the same app across android and IOS. I’ve just completed a white page on autonomous vehicles in London. They have been implementing this since 2016. With the direction the world is heading I believe cyber security will become a big part. You don’t want someone hacking into your car and just drives you into a wall or changes your destination. Consumers sure won’t want that let alone the manufacturers. All speculation and time will tell. I agree their financial sheet has been subpar for years, but they also might be on to something here and positioning themselves for a “minor setback, for a major comeback.” The partnerships they have entered too, seems other big companies have faith in them as well. Just my two cents.

But it's an irrelevant point now.\n\nMost if not all governments contract cybersecurity firms for some services. I think the US government has 23 approved cybersecurity providers? It's not really a new concept. BB was contracted by the Canadian government to provide a UEM - but their are other providers of UEMs to the Canadian government too, like Microsoft Intune.\n\n[https://customers.microsoft.com/en-US/story/776750-investincanada\\_nationalgovernment\\_microsoft365\\_canada](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-US/story/776750-investincanada_nationalgovernment_microsoft365_canada)\n\nUsually it just means they're approved as vendors, and the varying agencies can choose from a list of approved vendors depending on what they need. Blackberry UEM seems to be a fairly secure option which is why a fair few governmental bodies choose it - but outside of the public sector it's not a very popular UEM. And it doesn't dominate the public sector.\n\nI think this is the worst myth the WSB/reddit BB hype has perpetuated - BB isn't really a wildly innovative cybersecurity company. Microsoft/VMware/IBM have better UEM solutions, Crowdstrike has a far better UES solution. BB isn't seriously a large contender in the cybersecurity space. \n\nPutting aside that people have said we're moving to autonomous vehicles soon for the last 10 years and we keep missing targets, BB QNX isn't a good revenue generator. It makes less than $4 a vehicle and it's rapidly losing market share to Linux/Android RTOS'. Hell if you think EV is the future, you should see that Tesla is entirely unreliant on BB and doesn't use any BB products, VW is looking to create a whole new VW.os that will mean no QNX. IVY is an interesting problem but how has it differentiated itself so far from other vehicle data platforms from Google/Microsoft or the host of other companies making the same product? IVY enabled vehicles won't ship until 2023, it's a long time to hold onto for what could easily be a subpar product tbh.\n\nI think it's a little easy to say \"look at the partnerships, other companies have faith\". AWS partners with 1000s of firms on 1000s of products. Arguably the fact that IVY is using ML/AI from Amazon shows BB doesn't have the in-house talent to develop such solutions - which kind of worries me. \n\nI'm not so convinced there'll be a major comeback. A minor comeback sure - QNX will sell, IVY will sell. Their cybersecurity products need some catching up tbh. I think the major issue is they'll struggle to attract new talent, patent sale will strip the company of a big chunk of revenue and widen losses.
