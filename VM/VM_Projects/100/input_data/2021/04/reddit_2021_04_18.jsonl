{"title": "I analyzed all 700+ buy and sell recommendations made by Jim Cramer in 2021. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** Jim Cramer is definitely a controversial figure. While an argument can be made on whether he is on the side of retail investors or not, what I really wanted to know was how his stock picks are performing. Surprisingly, there were no trackers for the performance of Cramer’s pick in his program (his program is Mad Money, for those who are not familiar).\n\n**Where the data is from:** [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm). All the 19,201 stock picks made by Cramer are listed here. His stock picks are updated here daily. While Cramer mentions a lot of stocks in his program, I only considered the stocks that Cramer specifically recommended that you should buy or sell. (I have ignored the stocks where Cramer says he likes/dislikes the stock since I felt that it’s a vague statement and cannot be considered as a buy/sell recommendation).\n\n**Analysis:** There were 725 buy/sell recommendations made by Cramer in 2021. Out of this, 651 were Buy and 74 were Sell. For both sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.\n\na. One Day\n\nb. One Week\n\nc. One Month\n\nd. Price Change till date\n\nI also checked what percentage of Cramer’s calls were right across different time periods.  \n\n**Results:** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67ntaei71yt61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=af0b123eaddf35374fe7755d1bead59f9a3be050\n\n Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months. If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%. He was also right on 58.9% of the calls he made (Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%). The weekly performance returns are also a respectable 42% but he was barely touching 50% in the percentage of right picks. One month from his recommendations, the stock return is an abysmal -223% and he was wrong more than he was right on his calls. The returns till date are also phenomenal with 446% return and Cramer being right a whopping 63.6% in his stock picks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s42b0it91yt61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c41ea542d8b024494f0690b85d86ab85e03f492\n\n Cramer’s sell recommendations performed better than his buy recommendations across different time periods. This stat is particularly commendable since we were in a predominantly bull market across the last 4 months. 57.5% of the stocks he recommended as a sell dropped in price the next day with a cumulative return of -118.9%. This trend is observed across the time period with returns for the sell recommendations being negative. The only statistic that is working against Cramer’s sell recommendation is the percentage of right picks till date being only 42%. But still, the cumulative return for all the stocks was -206%. Please note that Cramer made only 74 sell recommendations against a whopping 651 buy recommendations during the same period of time. \n\n**Limitations of the analysis**\n\nThe above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, Cramer has made a total of 19K recommendations in his program. I have only analyzed his 2021 recommendations. The site which provides the data is extremely limited in terms of how we can access the data. Also, currently, the data is pulled from street.com which was earlier owned by Cramer. They update the data every day after the show, but I could not verify if they go back and change the calls down the line (very unlikely with it being a large business). Also, for the return calculations, I have only used the closing price of the stock across the time periods. The returns can theoretically be higher if you consider the intra-day highs and lows. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nNo matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal. I started the analysis thinking that the returns would be mediocre at best as there were no trackers actively tracking the returns from his calls. But the data points otherwise. It seems that there is a lot of scope for short-term plays based on Cramer’s recommendation. Let me know what you think! \n\nGoogle Sheet link containing all the recommendations and analysis: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ah4JvEMIlGopn-zOjNwB8iWCUO4r-W5FV19oX_tM9oQ/edit?usp=sharing)  \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to Cramer or the Mad Money show.*", "id": "mte1rw", "created_utc": 1618756805.0, "score": 2156, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 487, "comments": [{"body": "Since the show is at 6pm...did you assume opening a position at the market open the next day or did you the closing price of the date of the show...\n\nAwesome assessment, although I don’t agree 100% with your conclusions.", "score": 490, "replies": [{"body": "this should be the top level comment.

This result comes from summing up the returns on each stock, but I believe this misses the important step of considering the percentage that each asset in the portfolio makes up of the total amount invested.\n\nConsider a counterfactual portfolio of two assets: Asset A and Asset B. The investor has $1,001.00 to invest in some mix of these two assets. The investor decides to invest $1.00 in Asset A and $1,000.00 in Asset B. The total amount invested is $1,001.00. Assume that Asset A has a 50% gain and Asset B has a 15% gain. The analysis in this post would say that this portfolio returned 50% + 15% = 65%. Calculating an arithmetic average results in an \"average\" return of 32.50%. Respectfully, both of these are misleading due to the lopsided portfolio allocations of the two assets in the portfolio.\n\nThe 50% return on Asset A earns the investor $0.50. The 15% return on Asset B earns the investor $150.00. Together, the portfolio earned the investor $150.50. A return of $150.50 on $1,001 invested is 15.03%. It is true that the investor did make 50% on one asset and 15% on another asset, but since only 0.10% of the portfolio was invested in Asset A, which earned the 50%, the overall return is much closer to the 15% return on Asset B because 99.90% of the portfolio was invested in Asset B. This pulls the portfolio's performance much closer to the performance of Asset B than Asset A.\n\nI pulled the data from this post yesterday (12/18/21) and used Google Finance similar to the author of the post. There are a handful of firms who no longer have prices as of Dec. 18 2021 due to no longer being public (e.g., mergers, going private bankruptcies, etc.). Removing these firms results in a \"Cramer Return\" of 746% using the original methodology. However, each stock is a fraction of the overall portfolio. The total amount invested (i.e., the basis) of the 2021 stock picks through April of 2021 is $102,904.55. At 12/31/2021 the total fair market value of these stocks is $103,343.33.\n\nDoes investing $102,904.55 around the first quarter of the year and having $103,904.55 near year end sound like a 746% return? You're probably answering \"no\" to this question.\n\nIf we calculate the return based on the FMV as of 12/31/2021 and the total amount invested throughout the first quarter, and April of 2021, the return is 0.43%. The investor allocated around $100K in capital and earned just over $400.\n\nOnce multiple assets are being considered during a time period, to back into how many dollars the investor actually made, I believe it is necessary to consider the relative \"weight\" of each asset in the overall portfolio. Doing this actually allows one to calculate the 0.43% return- but one must consider the percentage of each stock to the overall portfolio in the following manner: SUM\\[(percentage of individual stock to total amount invested in all stocks in the year) x (return on individual stock)\\]. This calculation results in the same 0.43% return that was previously calculated using the total amount invested through the first month of Q2 in 2021 and the total fair value as of 12/18/21.\n\nThe counterfactual portfolio math and a recreation of the original analysis may be found [here](https://github.com/RobsonGlasscock/Cramer_Reddit_Analysis):\n\nSome closing thoughts:\n\nMy guess is anyone reading this knows that the average annual stock market return is around 10% over the last 100 or so years (+/- 2%). A 555% annual return is around 55.5 times higher than the historical average. If the average height of males in the US is around 5 foot 8, saying you know a US male who is 55.5 times taller than the average is saying you know someone over 314 feet tall. The 555% annual return in the stock market is implausible on its face. Further, if my memory serves me correctly, some very esteemed investors have annual performance (CAGRs) over decades of 30% - 80%. Is it reasonable to assume that Cramer is that much better than these investors?\n\nLastly, consider the performance on a portfolio as the number of stocks increases. Consider the extreme case where the investor owns every stock in the market. One could reasonably expect this portfolio to approximate the return on the overall market, and we are now back to that approximately 10% return (+/- 2%). Of course, there would be variation based on position sizing, but I hope you can see the point. After the exclusions I mentioned (i.e., firms without Google Finance data as of 12/18/21), there are 618 stock picks. Some of these stocks were recommended more than once, but to beat the market annually by 555% in a long-only strategy it is implausible to suggest that loading up on that many stocks would cause one's performance to be so far off from the annualized 10% return. In my opinion, for performance like that to even be possible one would have to have a very concentrated portfolio with very few positions. As the number of stocks in the portfolio grows, I think it is reasonable to suggest that this portfolio will tend to perform closer to the historical market benchmark.\n\nOthers have commented on front running, prices used in the analyses, etc. My main point is that I believe that the 555% needs to be seen through the lens of an annual portfolio and not the summation of individual stock performance where each stock is essentially treated as its own 100% portfolio allocation and then summed.\n\nReferences:\n\nStatistics and Finance: An Introduction by Ruppert.

In my opinion the current dividend yield isn't even half the story of what dividend investing is about. And also I believe dividend investing is a very bad term. You're not investing in a dividend, you're investing in a company that happens to distribute some of it's profits to shareholders in cash which is called a dividend. Depending on the circumstances these realized gains are taxed, but by having realized the gains you've taken out some risk from the investment without having to reduce your stake in the company. Even if a company goes bankrupt you can have a positive ROI if you've collected enough dividends along the way.\n\nPersonally, I don't invest in companies which don't pay a dividend. This is because companies that pay a dividend know their damn purpose. If a company is committed to paying a dividend and has been doing so over a long period of time that has an effect on the management. Guess which company will use profits in a more responsible fashion for investing in the company, the one thats just throwing any profits they get into potential growth or the ones that only have 50% of profits available for investment? The dividend has a discilipining effect on the company. Some companies have hard commitments to increase their dividend every year. Often they already have a pretty high payout ratio. This commitment forces them to look for new growth opportunities and to be as efficient as possible with their expenses. Some companies don't manage to increase their profits for years yet their keep their dividend sustainable by finding ways to cut costs.\n\nSome dividend yields are distracting, on both ends of the spectrum. MSFT for example has been an incredible dividend grower. A dividend yield of currently 0.86% may seem low now but they've been growing the dividend at such a rapid pace that the yield will increase significantly over time if they continue to do so. When I bought MSFT in 2016 the dividend yield was slightly above 2%. Now my dividend yield based on what I paid for MSFT is 3.73%. The reason the MSFT dividend yield is so low now is because the market has priced in more future growth. This goes both directions. The reason some dividend yields are so high is because the market has priced in future decline. Which is bad news for the sustainability of a dividend. XOM and T may be examples of yields that aren't sustainable like GE and KHC turned out not to be sustainable. If these companies will have to cut their 6 to 7% dividend that I don't know, but the risk of that happening is certainly higher than with a company like MSFT that is only distributing a fraction of it's profits as a dividend. Even if a company pays just a small dividend I'd take that over nothing or too much because they can grow that dividend over time and if you hold long enough the yield based on what you paid can get into ridiculous areas.\n\n**The dividend is what keeps things real** and I don't only see it as a way of realizing profits but also as a filter to filter out bullshit companies. Sure that way some opportunities are missed but yet my dividend paying only company portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 5 years by quite a bit and some companies have increased their dividend significantly since I bought them (MSFT, BLK, PG, SAP, UL, JNJ heck even O managed reasonable dividend growth despite covid and an already high dividend yield). \n\nBy holding these high quality dividend companies I have an ever increasing cashflow into my portfolio without having to sell shares and I can use that cashflow to enter new investments which then again start contributing to my dividend cashflow. I don't have to put a single thought to selling as long as I believe these companies are paying their dividend in sustainable fashion. This means I also don't have to care about market valuation as long as decreasing valuation isn't because of reasons seriously threatening the business of my companies. \n\nI believe this way of investing is not only more mentally endurable but also more successful in the long run compared to trading around hyper growth stocks. I realize many don't have that much money to invest and the dividends they initially get may seem laughable, but I guarantee 99+% of people that enter the stock market with a get rich quick mentally will sooner or later get beaten down badly.", "id": "mtb35f", "created_utc": 1618745362.0, "score": 251, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "Dividends are misleading because share buybacks do the same thing while being more tax-efficient.

All these companies could buyback 0 stock and instead pay it all as a dividend and their yields would jump dramatically e.g. MSFT yield would be over 2% including buybacks.\n\nI prefer buybacks as they make more money long term.\n\nDividend -> Pay Tax -> Reinvest provides lower increase in ownership than company direct buybacks.", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "Will add the other benefit of buybacks is it doesn’t lock companies into a silly practice of having pressure to increase the dividend every year to be a “Dividend Aristocrat” or whatever silly name we come up for them.

In the long term it should not affect the fundamental business now that tesla is debt free, but people who own tesla on margin need to be wary of how this can move the price short term.\n\n\n2. Regulation will not kill FSD, if it works it will win out eventually. There is legit argument whether that takes 1 year or 5-10, but if it's safer that human drivers the use case is so compelling that voters will demand it. The real risk is that FSD just plain doesnt work, and the likelihood of that seems to be shrinking weekly with every new beta release.\n\n\n3. This is a risk that most tesla bulls don't give enough credit to. Obviously nobody is close to making an EV nearly as good, but the current market cap assumes massive dominance and a risk-weighted portion of rediculous profits from FSD. Like tesla is valued at 4x Toyota when Toyota makes 8m cars a year and tesla has a goal of 20m (i.e. 2.5x) in 2030. Obviously there is room for superchargers and energy to add value but they have to come through big to justify growth from current valuation without FSD. If a competitor (eg. Huawei, Mobileye, apple) comes out with a legit FSD competitor in the same time frame as tesla that could seriously dent the profits tesla can realize from it and in turn the valuation. I'm obviously still holding (and buying) but this is the top risk I'm watching.\n\n\n4. The other major risk I'm watching is simple execution risk - i.e. whether tesla can grow auto factories, production, and margins fast enough to meet expectations, and growth of non-auto businesses. So far I'd say they are overperforming on the former, and underperforming on the latter (supercharger is doing well, energy ok, solar is sucking hard). An experienced investor will know that there will be bumps on the road that you just have to ride through, but if it starts to seem like tesla is simply unable to ever achieve the lofty goals it's valuation is based on that would be cause to re-evaluate my position.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> If a competitor (eg. Huawei, Mobileye, apple) comes out with a legit FSD competitor in the same time frame as tesla\n\nI'd say it is close to physically impossible. You can have great algorithms in place, but without data to learn from, you can't take off. So, in order for competitors to come out with FSD variant in the same time frame two conditions should met:\n\n1. Tesla to make critical mistake which would lead to a big push back\n2. Competitor to get in place data gathering solution, scale it up to relevant size, and train his AI to the point of being production-ready\n\nFor instance, Tesla did a big mistake in FSD development by not starting out from 360 degree 4d video (maybe it was a necessary step, but even if it was really a mistake, it still not big enough to give enough room for anyone to catch up), but I'd say all big mistakes were already done, and there is none big enough for anyone to catch up left.\n\nTelsa's lead (in both data and competence) is just too massive.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I think the risk is small, hence why I'm buying and holding Tesla, but I wouldn't categorize it as \"impossible\". As soon as Tesla demonstrates real FSD there will be *billions* of venture capital available to competitors trying to build an equivalent system. The competitors also won't have to do all the trial and error Tesla did - they can simply try and replicate a Tesla system and learn from Tesla's products (e.g. neural network shaping, etc). If a competitor is close enough with data they could move pretty quickly (mobileye has lots; who knows how much Huawei has) and maybe have something semi-workable out the door in 6 months to 2 years. Considering that Tesla will also have to break trail in getting regulators to accept autonomous driving a small gap like that could really dampen their profits. \n\nAnyways - I don't want to overstate it, because like I said I think it's Tesla's game to lose, but it is the competitive space I'm watching most closely.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thanks bro", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "and you went long before debating these things? interesting.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Elon needs to hire a lawyer and a negotiator to strike an agreement with our Moon aliens.... perhaps a friendly invitation on Craig’s List?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "He needs to implant neuralink and be the world’s first AI lawyer", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "What’s also fishy is someone bought $2m worth of TSLA OTM puts expiring 4/30 on Friday", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "TSLA typically “sells the news” post earnings.

{"title": "I analyzed all 700+ buy and sell recommendations made by Jim Cramer in 2021. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** Jim Cramer is definitely a controversial figure. While argument can be made on whether he is on the side of retail investors or not, what I really wanted to know was how his stock picks are performing. Surprisingly, there were no trackers for the performance of Cramer’s pick in his program (his program is Mad Money, for those who are not familiar). \n\n**Where the data is from:** [here](https://madmoney.thestreet.com/screener/index.cfm). All the 19,201 stock picks made by Cramer are listed here. His stock picks are updated here daily. While Cramer mentions a lot of stocks in his program, I only considered the stocks that Cramer specifically recommended that you should buy or sell. (I have ignored the stocks where Cramer says he likes/dislikes the stock since I felt that it’s a vague statement and cannot be considered as a buy/sell recommendation). \n\n**Analysis:** There were 725 buy/sell recommendations made by Cramer in 2021. Out of this, 651 were Buy and 74 were Sell. For both sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods. \n\na. One Day\n\nb. One Week \n\nc. One Month\n\nd. Price Change till date \n\nI also checked what percentage of Cramer’s calls were right across different time periods. \n\n**Results:** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v6v86fgm5yt61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=46d99ad37e0f07803910a0ee250883aee7be43ee\n\n Cramer made a total of 651 buy recommendations over the course of the past 4 months. If you had invested in every single stock, he recommended and then pulled out the next day, the returns were a staggering 555%. He was also right on 58.9% of the calls he made (Benchmark being 50% since anyone can pick a random stock and the probability of the stock going up is 50%). The weekly performance returns are also a respectable 42% but he was barely touching 50% in the percentage of right picks. One month from his recommendations, the stock return is an abysmal -223% and he was wrong more than he was right on his calls. The returns till date are also phenomenal with 446% return and Cramer being right a whopping 63.6% in his stock picks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tt84a2o5yt61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bc245cf01922010a13705e721d564a4299ebbac\n\nCramer’s sell recommendations performed better than his buy recommendations across different time periods. This stat is particularly commendable since we were in a predominantly bull market across the last 4 months. 57.5% of the stocks he recommended as a sell dropped in price the next day with a cumulative return of -118.9%. This trend is observed across the time period with returns for the sell recommendations being negative. The only statistic that is working against Cramer’s sell recommendation is the percentage of right picks till date being only 42%. But still the cumulative return for all the stocks was -206%. Please note that Cramer made only 74 sell recommendations against a whopping 651 buy recommendations during the same period of time. \n\n**Limitations of the analysis**\n\nThe above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, Cramer has made a total of 19K recommendations in his program. I have only analyzed his 2021 recommendations. The site which provides the data is extremely limited in terms of how we can access the data. Also, currently the data is pulled from street.com which was earlier owned by Cramer. They update the data everyday after the show, but I could not verify if they go back and change the calls down the line (very unlikely with it being a large business). Also, for the return calculations, I have only used the closing price of the stock across the time periods. The returns can theoretically be higher if you consider the intra-day highs and lows. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nNo matter how we feel about Cramer, the one-day returns on both his buy and sell recommendations have been phenomenal. I started the analysis thinking that the returns would be mediocre at best as there were no trackers actively tracking the returns from his calls. But the data points otherwise. It seems that there is a lot of scope for short term plays based on Cramer’s recommendation. Let me know what you think! \n\nGoogle Sheet link containing all the recommendations and analysis: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ah4JvEMIlGopn-zOjNwB8iWCUO4r-W5FV19oX_tM9oQ/edit?usp=sharing)  \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to Cramer or the Mad Money show.*", "id": "mtehdq", "created_utc": 1618758206.0, "score": 7969, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 1146, "comments": [{"body": "Ah yes the Cramer mini P&D.

{"title": "PSFE DD", "selftext": "Paysafe is a new entrant to the fintech field. They went public via spac titled ' **Foley Trasimene Acquisition II Corp** '. And just like every other SPAC in the last 6 months, the stock price has run up then gotten crushed. I personally hate spacs, however if the underlying company is valuable once the merger is complete they can be a good investment.\n\n The Spac is sponsored by Bill Foley, a notable entertainment investor. He made a fortune investing in wineries, golf courses, sports franchises, and hotels. Their CEO is Phil Mchugh, who has a track record working at citibank and barclays. Overall the management team seems pretty impressive. (Especially considering citi handles all wire transfers on earth. The CEO has a lot of experience with credit and merchant payments. I did notice that his linkdin profile is written in the third person, which could be a red flag. \n\nPaysafe is fundamentally a transaction handler. They serve mostly medium and smaller merchants, and transfer money between merchants, currencies, and forms of credit. They have some larger customers, notably including fortnite, twitch, and spotify. The firm handled 92 billion $ of transactions in 2020. They focus much of their business on gaming, and gambling. Which are both attractive and growing markets. \n\nTaking a look at the companies SEC filings, the notable risk factors they list include risk due to brexit, risk of accidentally processing fraudulent claims, and heavy reliance on third parties for much of their processes (payment processing, banking, routing/connectivity, customer support, IT). This leaves me with the question what do they really do? My understanding is that the company provides value to customers by the middleman and acting as a connection between merchants, local banks, and larger financial institutions. They process payments and take a processing fee. \n\nOther notable risks would be the major competitors that the company faces in the fintech world. They are partnered with visa and mastercard, but will have to compete with COIN, SQ, SOFI and many others. \n\nAdvantages? The firm has a solid hold in the European and international markets. It's in a quickly growing industry, and has good leadership. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinances.\n\nPSFE has a market cap of $9.7 Billion. Their trailing 12 months revenue is $1.4 billion, and their gross profit was $891 million or 62.5%, very nice. \n\nThe market cap/gross profit ratio is 9.7bil/891mil=10.8. At this ratio the company is pretty attractively priced. (If you bought the entire company, you'd make 100% profit in 10.8 years assuming no change in valuation). For reference, this ratio on a few other firms.\n\nPLTR-68\n\nCOST-6.3\n\nAAPL-19.1\n\nMCD- 17.1\n\nINTC-6.03\n\nSPOT-27\n\nSQ-42.6\n\nPYPL-31.6\n\nVISA-28.8\n\nRelatively speaking, the price/earnings on this company is a bit low. Especially compared to their most similar competitors PYPL and SQ. \n\nTaking a look at the balance sheet it isn't so sexy, they have a lot of liabilities and long term debt. Not the worst I've seen, they still have more assets. Their quick ratio is 1.35. Perhaps this explains the low P/E. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, the company has stiff competition, but good leadership and valuable customers. They are also specializing in a very attractive market. The company is very undervalued in my opinion, and could potentially have a significant run up to reach a more reasonable multiplier. If it's multiplier were to be similar to its peers (SQ,PYPL), the company would 3x in valuation. \n\nI started off this DD hating this company because it was a SPAC, however after looking into it I think I may invest.\n\nEdit: another notable risk I just at thought of for these guys is currency valuations, they do a lot of transferring between currencies as they have a very large international presence.

The net is what is left after paying for all costs incurred by the company (which you stated, so I'm not sure why you aren't using it). Using your mindset from the post of \"How many years to recoup the cost of buying the entire company\", the net profit is what you could put in your own pocket to make back your money.\n\nNet income (or rather, net income per share) is also the metric used to calculate P/E ratio, which means that your value of 10.8 in the top post is incorrect. PSFE had a per share profit of -$1.01 for the most recent quarter, which means they have a P/E ratio of (price/share) / (income/share) = $13.59/-$1.01 = **-**13.5.\n\nBy the way, Paysafe has had increasingly negative net profits since 2018. However, a main driver of that appears to be depreciation of assets, impairments, etc. Revenue and EBIT (except for COVID) are increasing every year, so profits could well become positive soon enough as those negatives drop off the sheets.\n\nFor reference, here are [Paysafe's SEC filings](https://ir.paysafe.com/regulatory-filings/all-sec-filings).
