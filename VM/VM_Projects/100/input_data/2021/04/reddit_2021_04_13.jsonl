The options premium averaged at around $223 for these contracts, $22.3k per contract - so this position represents a value at risk of about $122m - a substantial short bet.\n- This single bet represented 90% of the 6.1k deep in the money put contracts short bets initiated yesterday.\n- The huge short bet of nearly 20k put contracts at $1,050 and $1,100 strikes that were initiated in late February are still unchanged and are sitting at 9,727 contracts each - May 21 expiry, with an initial position cost of around $750m. This short position peaked at a value of $1.01b in early March (!), but has now eroded down to a value of $729m. This position lost -$30m in value in yesterday's rally alone (!). I'll keep monitoring this short and will let you guys know when/if they capitulate.\n- There's a substantial bullish bias for this week's expiry: about 100k contracts are between $700-$750, 30k between $750 and $800, and 50k call contracts are sitting at $800 alone. There's also 38k DITM puts expiring this week - with a strong delta hedging effect during rallies. Should the ~$710 line of resistance break, delta hedging by market makers will be a substantial force.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for this.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Seems the last bullet point has come to fruition", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "RemindME! 1/2/2022", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 8 months on [**2022-01-02 00:00:00 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2022-01-02%2000:00:00%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/mpvii8/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_april_13_2021/guemcy7/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fteslainvestorsclub%2Fcomments%2Fmpvii8%2Ftsla_daily_investor_discussion_april_13_2021%2Fguemcy7%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202022-01-02%2000%3A00%3A00%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20mpvii8)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Tesla started shipping HW3 upgrades in Europe:\n\n> https://twitter.com/Tesmanian_com/status/1381957817859371008\n>\n> \"Tesla Begins Replacing HW3 for Model 3 in Germany for Full Self-Driving FSD\"\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\n- It signals that Tesla has no \"chip shortage\" problems: if they were worried even a tiny bit about HW3 shortage - which is a critical component for every new Tesla - they wouldn't have started rolling out the HW3 retrofit effort in Europe.\n- It signals that Tesla wants to deliver FSD features to European customers too - which will result in more deferred revenue getting recognized.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah been waiting for this.

But you should not look at this as a “can’t lose” proposition.\n\nHere are things to think about:\n\n1. You won’t lose money on a sold call so long as you’re content to either let it expire worthless or have your shares called away. But you can lose money in the underlying. That brings me to...\n\n2. TSLA moves around a LOT. Huge price swings in both directions are par for the course with this stock. I would not be surprised to see it pull back pretty sharply into the 600s by the end of the week. Nor would I be surprised to see it hit $900. That’s just kind of what TSLA does.\n\n3. If you buy now at $762 and the price drops to, say, $660, think carefully about what this will mean for you. If you have enough money that you’re comfortable taking risk and won’t need to liquidate to pay bills etc., it might be fine. But be careful. You may think you will just keep selling calls until you’re back at a break even or a profit. But a weekly call that’s $100 OTM will get you very little premium. Are you going to sit and sell at a 760 strike for peanuts until the stock comes back? Sell closer to the money and risk your shares getting called away at a pretty significant loss? There are no necessarily right or wrong answers here but you do need to think about it. (I’m stuck selling shitty little calls agains a stock that dropped hard after I bought it and seems like it may stay there for quite a while, and it’s not a fun place to be).\n\n4. There’s also the flip side of the scenario. TSLA could go the other way and hit 900 or even higher before you know it. So if your shares get called away at $780 that may be fine for you this week, but it also means you could get priced out of the play for a while. You can write a put to try to get back in but if it really breaks away and you don’t have more cash to kick in, you’re left selling puts for peanuts while missing all that upside. (This just happened to me with ROKU, which acts a lot like Tesla. I had a cc at $350 and my shares got called away Friday. It opened up high on Monday and the premium on writing a $350 put to get back in is so low it’s barely worth it.

CNBC been ignoring Tesla and talking about ditching tech to rotate into boomer “value” stocks while Elon’s confidently posting memes and Cathie quietly changes her fund rules to be allowed to go from 10% up to 30% of a single security. Add on the unusual call buying activity and this means big money has been buying the fucking dip. \n\n>The recent announcement with Apple and the batteries causes me to believe something big may be underway with TSLA/AAPL but it will likely be with something nobody saw coming. We know AAPL gang is extremely secretive in their moves and the news with them partnering with Kia/Hyundai to make a car never made sense and I think it’s likely a fake story spread by them as a big distraction from what’s really going on. \n\n>Everyone here knows what Tesla brings to the table but let’s talk about Apple. - The king of multimedia/entertainment with all of their video games and content on the App Store which could be cool to see in a Tesla. - Very sticky ecosystem and brand loyalty, people love their stuff. When I was shopping for a work truck last year I picked one solely based on the fact that it had Apple CarPlay and ignored every other feature about the vehicle since it’s only temporary until my CT is ready. - They buy a shit load of batteries and we can assume they have good relationships and negotiating leverage with suppliers. Perhaps they could be utilizing their relationships/capital to help stockpile battery materials and corner the market? - Steve Jobs did have some weird fantasies of possibly doing something with cars one day. - Tim knows Apple is reaching a new glass ceiling and needs to finally do something transformative again. - Apple Maps has grown over the years and I’m sure they have a shit ton of data, if anyone here uses the GPS features on an iPhone it’s fairly good now at following what’s going on with traffic flow because they can use the data from everybody’s iPhone to track movements. Plus things like all the stores/restaurants/parks/location data being tied in with Yelp and integrating with social media is neat. \n\n>A side note I was talking with a friend yesterday who has a friend that works in software development at Lyft who told them that Lyft has been trying to work on some lame FSD/Robotaxi concept by using the GPS data collected from all their users phones but they’ve been having tons of issues and are far behind. Apple has much better data while it’s not enough to develop FSD based purely off that it could be used for interesting applications. \n>Elon posted the transformers meme with it having a massive erection, clearly doesn’t care and knows something Transformative is coming. \n\n>Elon skipped the lame April fools jokes which causes me to hope we have a 4/20 announcement.\n\n\nFor the lazy", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I speculated this way back too.

{"title": "My Update on UWMC: The Equivalent of Counting Cards at the Blackjack Table Baby, or Why are ya'll tripping on this fine Stock?", "selftext": "So, I wanted to wait a period of time before writing a update to my due diligence. Some of you might remember my last two due diligences. Well, I’m happy to say that I’ve bought more. So, let’s actually get to the meat and potatoes.  If you want some theme music for how some of you people with a bad case of FUD who are holding UWMC are feeling I'd recommend Balduin & Wolfgang Lohr - Dizzy (ft. Alanna). Bonus points if you know the anime/light novel and get the meta meme within.\n\nPlease note that this is based on historical monthly median single family home values in the US, that the data is non-seasonally adjusted, and that it is based on sales of existing homes.\n\n· The Median Home Price was $303,900 in January.\n\n· The Median Home Price was $317,100 in February.\n\n· In February, the supply of inventory ticked up by .1 to 2 Months indicating huge demand, and an extreme sellers-market, indicating that home prices will have increased when data in March 2021 is shed on the 25th.\n\nIf you would like to do some more research, you can find the NAR data here: [Housing Statistics (nar.realtor)](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics).\n\nWhile it is true that existing home sales fell, it is not due to a bubble, but due to supply constraints and unrestrained demand. What you can be assured of however is five things, for Q1 of 2021:\n\n1. On a seasonally adjusted basis, home sales have increased as you can see in the NAR data. Furthermore, the per home sale profit has increased due to month-on-month price increases. This is because originations usually cost .5-1% of a home’s value. With UWMC’s increasing margin due to its technology, gain margin should continue, and has been shown to have grown YoY.\n2. UWMC has put out guidance of between $52 Billion and $57 of closed loan volume. Last quarter they had $54.7 Billion in 4Q20. On the Mad Money Interview with Cramer, the man said they were on track to land right around the middle of that. That provides, impetus for me to believe they will meet, or exceed guidance. They had Net Income of $1,001,925,000 after the impact of an estimated effective tax rate of 27% in Q4 of 2020. Total Gain Margin may be a little lower, as they are stating they will have a gain margin of 200-235 Basis Points, as opposed to 305 Basis Points in Q4 2020.\n3. It is important to know that while they do refinance, their bread and butter is and always has been the purchase market. However, in 2020, however, they turned off FHA loans, and Jumbo loans out of an abundance of caution. This meant that while they made a massive $3.38 Billion in net income, their actual purchase volume decreased to $42.9 Billion, as compared to $49.8 Billion in total purchase volume in FY19. As UWMC has returned to doing these offerings, we can expect purchase volume to increase, and offset refinance volume (which is still going very strong, even if it is lower YoY).\n4. As mortgage rates increased, they remained far below the 2019 Interest Rate, and have recently ticked down. Furthermore, UWMC’s rates compared to retail are 15 basis points better (.15%), which equates to roughly $28 in savings per month for consumers. Furthermore, selling a home takes a median of 25 days (the fastest rate ever), and down from 40 days the year before). Moreover, 46% of properties went under contract within a single week and 59% did so within two weeks. However, the time to close is extremely high for Mortgage companies and the average is 58 days on average. However, UWMC’s is 18 days, and it was 16 in December (whereas competitors time to close increased. The Broker Channel is faster, and cheaper, for consumers and that should scale well as the wholesale market continues to take market share generally.\n5. Their issuance of a 700-Million-dollar senior note with a 5.5% interest rate to pay off an MSR facility, and for general corporate purposes is a bullish sign as it indicates to me they are experiencing heavy volume and want to grab as much market share as possible.\n\nGoing Forward:\n\n1. The sale of lots, and the issuance of permits is red hot, and you can start seeing a lot more inventory coming online later in 2021 and throughout 2022. Furthermore, demand going forward should still be strong for a few years at minimum (if, probably, lower than 2020-2021).\n2. “The population of 25- to 34-year-olds is 9% larger than the 35- to 44-year-old group, signaling to homebuilders that a wave of demand is on the horizon. The bank's modeling suggests monthly housing starts will land between 1.7 million and 2 million through 2024, markedly higher than the February reading of 1.4 million.” – Straight from the Jeffrey’s Analyst here ([4 Reasons Jefferies Sees Long and Sustainable Boom in US Housing (businessinsider.com)](https://www.businessinsider.com/housing-market-sustainable-boom-homebuyers-mortgage-rates-millennials-construction-jefferies-2021-4) à I’m not going to mention the other points brought here.\n3. Mortgage Servicing Rights, which UWMC has been acquiring more and more of will act as a hedge against higher inflation rates, and will also serve as a source of steady cash flow through good times and time when the housing market is slower. Considering the delinquency rate for applicants for UWMC is far lower than the average, due to their high FICO scores, this means that UWMC is well positioned.\n\nHowever, this is not what I wanted to discuss. I wanted to discuss the share price, and the fact that the chances of UWMC issuing a stock buyback, issuing a special dividend, and/or increasing the dividend are extremely likely. Not least of all, because he said that they were looking to do so if there was excess cash, and it looks very likely that there will be. You can find their CEO talking about it on the Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript (Page 6 if I recall), or you can just listen to it all.\n\n**The Stock Buyback**\n\nPlease remember the stock buyback authorization lets the company take advantage and buy at any time within a period. I also know that the price will go up on the declaration of earnings and a buyback, but I want to show some wicked math.\n\nBefore we look at a buyback, we should look at how much the annual dividend of .40 (A dividend Yield of 5.32%!), costs the company and if it is able to service its dividend and debts well. The annual dividend comes at around 640 Million, while the 1.5B of Senior Notes comes in at 82.5 Million in interest per year. The sum, therefore, is $722,500,000 that UWMC needs to pay out to shareholders, and to bondholders. Considering the first quarter alone will not only pay all that but leave around $300 Million, or more, in profit we can safely say that the dividend payout ratio is safe and that UWMC can easily service its debts.\n\nHowever, perhaps you can see something here that I see? That is right. The dividend yield is almost as high as the interest rate on these senior notes. Stock buybacks are usually issued to increase prices, but also to improve earnings per share because the share count is decreased. **However,** I much prefer when they are issued on high yield dividend stocks and I will explain why here. This is because while it simultaneously increases earnings per share, it also substantially improves cash flow and profit and helps lower the share payout ratio. It does not matter if they are public float shares, or control shares, when it has a dividend. Either way your profit\n\nLet us do some paper math. UWMC has 1.6 Billion in shares (all inclusive), and a market cap of 12.05 Billion. They have 1.5 Billion in Senior Notes with an interest rate of 5.5%. Let us just go ahead and say that they wanted to do a share buyback of 1.5 Billion (I think this is too high, but I am conveying a point here). That would be 12.4% of all Shares in UWMC. If all these shares were purchased at exactly $7.50, that would equate to exactly 200 Million Shares. 200 Million Shares times the dividend yield (40 Cents!), is equivalent to 80 Million Dollars.\n\nTherefore, between now and 2025, the interest payments on the 1.5 Billion Dollar in Senior Notes will be essentially paid off by the stock buyback. Furthermore, after 2025 there will only be the 700 Million Senior Note left, which means that there will only be interest payments of 38.5 Million per year until 2029 when the Senior Note is Due. That means that between 2025 and 2029, 166 Million will have been saved up and can be utilized to help pay 2029’s Senior Note’s Principal. From 2021 to 2029 UWMC will have saved up 640 Million that it otherwise would have had to pay over that 8-year period. Over a 10 YR period it will save 800 Million.\n\nAs the share price climbs lower (Yes, intended to say climb lower ha-ha because I like buying this cheap), it becomes more and more likely that UWMC is compelled to issue a share buyback as the dividend yield would surpass the senior notes interest & could lead to very significant savings.\n\nHowever….\n\n**The Stock Buy Back + Dividend Raise Trick**\n\nIf UWMC felt extremely bullish, and simultaneously wanted to indicate the markets needed to take it a lot more seriously it could do this sleight of hand. As it decreased the share count, and thus the annual yield by 12.5%, it could raise the dividend by 12.5% to 45 Cents. This would increase your annual dividend yield from 5.32% to 6% while simultaneously increasing EPS.\n\n**Plus, a Special Dividend?**\n\nI personally would rather they reinvest the money in the company than do a special dividend, but they have a fortress of a balance sheet with a good cash balance and equity, and strong free cash flow so…. They could declare a special dividend of .41-.42 cents, which is equivalent to Rocket’s 5.5% Special Dividend. Considering they made around $3.38 in net income last year, they could issue a stock buyback of 1.5Billion, pay the raised 640 Million annual dividend of .45, and do a special dividend costing another 640 Million. That would total 2.78B, leaving them with some profit for the year to put this in perspective. Considering taxes, they probably would be in the red by around 285 Million. Considering their strong cash reserves, they could do it however, but it is not something I’d do (at least with such a high special dividend). HOWEVER, I’d prefer they reinvest the money into new technology and growing market share than a special dividend as they own 35% of the wholesale broker channel’s market share and want to expand that to 50%.\n\n**This Stock Will Pay You to Hold It on Margin**\n\nDepending on your Brokerage, this stock will pay you to hold it. Robinhood Gold gives you the first 1,000 margin free, and thereafter 2.5% annual. IBKR starts at 1.59% and goes down from there.\n\nLet us say you are placing $1000 on margin, and the annual interest rate is 2.5%. That means you pay 25 dollars in yearly interest. That is .068 cents a day. At 7.50, you can purchase 133.333 UWMC shares. That equates to $53.33 per year. A $28.33 profit.\n\nNow, to have a paper loss the share price would need to decrease by 21 cents to $7.29. However, remember that the yield is making you money regardless, and if you believe it will go up long term you do not care. Where this matters however is collateral, or how much you need in your brokerage. I am extremely well capitalized on my utilization of margin so that the company would have to go bankrupt (go to 0) or near enough to it, before I would have to shift money around to make sure I am not margin called. Everyone has their risk tolerance. If you decide to make a play like this, you should know yours and work towards a allocation that is comfortable for you.\n\n**The Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt**\n\nThere has been a lot of bemoaning regarding UWMC, and I can say it has felt a little bit like being DeepFuckingValue here before GME mooned. It has gotten to the point where someone gloatingly asked if I had sold yet like 1-2 weeks after I had posted a DD, and I told them I had bought more instead after it went down further.\n\nI do not care about a daily return, or weekly returns. That is not to mean I do not do them on occasion, but there is such a thing as MoM returns. Especially if it is compounding. Say you have $50,000 last month invested in one stock. Next month, you sell for a 67 percent profit and now have $83,500. That is a month-on-month profit of 33.5%. You repeat that exact same scenario with $83,500, and that turns into $139,445. So over four months, through compounding, your total return is 278.98% for a 4-month period on your initial $50,000.\n\nThe only catalysts I care about are on May 5th, and May 7th. May 5th for Earnings, and May 7 because it is the Russel inclusion list for June Reconstitution. While I don’t really care about the Russel bump, for some reason some people seem to, and I can appreciate the fact that liquidity would increase as volume has been thin recently.\n\nLet me be clear, I do not care if it goes down between now and then, and in point of fact, I **want** it to because I can keep averaging down and increase my MoM average. I bought more today. And if it goes down again, I’ll keep buying.\n\nThe only thing I care about is Forward EPS, and Dividend Payout Ratio. The Analysts think that the EPS FY 2021 will be 1.42. I know that is wrong, and outdated, because they expect only .4 in Q1 2021, and that goes against UWMC guidance completely. Let us say, conservatively, that they make 1 Billion in Net Income after taxes… 1B Net Income/1.6 Billion Shares=.625 EPS for Q1 2021. 800 Million in Net Income/1.6 Billion Shares=.5 EPS for Q1 2021. Regardless, I will just go ahead and state that .4 is fine. That quarter alone will pay off the dividend for the full year under the dividend payout ratio. The FY 1.42 Analyst Expectations (Which is wrong and potentially outdated?), means that the dividend payout ratio is 27.2% which is a very, very, good ratio. The Nasdaq Website shows the Forward P/E at 5.47 on the future EPS of 1.4. However, I believe that EPS for FY 2021 will be roughly around 2-2.22, which gives a forward P/E ratio of 3.75 to 3.378.\n\nAt the end of the day, because of this, I have peace of mind to say I want to buy more if it goes to 7, 6, or 5 before earnings. My thought process is “Oh, a dividend yield of 5.7/6.67/8 percent, with a payout ratio of 27.2% at absolutely MINIMUM, and a payout ratio of 20% or less of -my- calculations? SWEET! Oh, and this share price means they HAVE to do a stock buyback because they save so much fucking money. Fucking WOOHOO!” Furthermore, the company in its first quarter alone is going to earn 1/12th of its market cap in profit roughly, and it is based on its own guidance. So, yes, I want the price to go down. Because I know it’ll go up to its fair value, and my MoM will increase the further down I average.\n\nWall Street Bets likes to think the market is a casino like experience. We have our weekly slots players buying weekly calls/puts, and our momentum/swing traders doing the equivalent of playing roulette. But then there are the people like me, deep value investors, who heads straight to the blackjack table, and then counts. And the best part of it is, it is legal. I look at this stock, and I see one of the easiest deep value buys I will ever make. I don’t care about the journey, since I know where the destination is. I **like the stock**.\n\nBut do not look at me, look at today at around 5. That is when a dark money buyer bought a huge tranche of shares and the share price went from -.20 to +.41. I checked the order book, and the sell orders from 7.61 to 7.92 were all there, which meant they had not bought from the public. Some guy bought a fuck ton of shares.\n\nMy Position: 4,358 Shares averaged at around $8.06, $6 Calls May/21, $7.5 May 21.\n\n**This is not financial advice, I just love the stock.**\n\n**TLDR:** Wall Street Bets likes to think the market is a casino like experience. We have our weekly slots players buying weekly calls/puts, and our momentum/swing traders doing the equivalent of playing roulette.

I **like the stock**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT: A commenter somewhere else told me that the dividend is only for shareholders of Class A shares and not Class D (SFS Corp which the owners own). I mistakenly assumed that it was for holders of all common stock. Therefore, the actual dividend is only 41.3 Million which means stockholder's equity grows much more vastly than otherwise indicated. With that said if you go to the 10-K on page 49 you can see that every single share of Class D stock can be exchanged for Class A stock. Also the stock based compensation of people can be seen in the SEC filing on the UWMC investor relations site. This means a stock buyback can still be done, but it might not be the slam dunk proposition i had thought and that a much higher dividend than I had thought, or a huge special dividend might be something that is more likely to happen as opposed to a buyback.\n\nEdit: I actually went ahead and did some tea leave readings in JPMorgan's earnings.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, down 6%. Consumer & Business Banking net revenue was $5.6 billion, down 10%, driven by the impact of deposit margin compression, largely offset by growth in deposit balances. **Home Lending net revenue was $1.5 billion, up 26%, driven by higher production revenue, partially offset by lower net interest income on lower balances.** Card & Auto net revenue was $5.4 billion, down 7%, driven by lower Card net interest income on lower balances, partially offset by lower Card acquisition costs and higher Card net interchange income. Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, down 1%. The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $3.6 billion, including a $4.6 billion reserve release reflecting improvements in the macroeconomic scenarios compared to a $4.5 billion reserve build in the prior year.

I live in an area where selling your house at the listed price means you fucked up.

Unfortunately, I  cannot find any information on WebBroker for choosing a different  exchange when buying using TD DI.

With the current battle going with GME, AMC and the hedgies, this ticker was easily overlooked.\n\nVIAC has many things going for it, so excuse me if this shit seems all over the place. the more you read and understand, then the more you may agree that VIAC is a good investment.\n\nVIAC bull case:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmb3ry/viac\\_bull\\_case/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kmb3ry/viac_bull_case/)\n\nThen there are these posts as well that offer great DD regarding VIAC, READING IS FUNDAMENTAL RETARDS:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzuo68/does\\_viac\\_have\\_more\\_market\\_share\\_to\\_gain\\_this\\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzuo68/does_viac_have_more_market_share_to_gain_this_year/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/lxmrf2/paramount\\_launched\\_today\\_us\\_latin\\_america/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/lxmrf2/paramount_launched_today_us_latin_america/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l20tf6/viacomcbs\\_viac\\_sleeping\\_streaming\\_giant/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l20tf6/viacomcbs_viac_sleeping_streaming_giant/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/lskxre/what\\_avatars\\_new\\_movie\\_means\\_for\\_netflixs\\_last/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/lskxre/what_avatars_new_movie_means_for_netflixs_last/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/lruoc9/why\\_streaming\\_services\\_becoming\\_cable\\_20\\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/lruoc9/why_streaming_services_becoming_cable_20_is/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgjde2/viacom\\_viac\\_and\\_why\\_its\\_the\\_future/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgjde2/viacom_viac_and_why_its_the_future/)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbmzya/viac\\_and\\_pluto\\_tv\\_get\\_aboard\\_the\\_rocket\\_ship/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbmzya/viac_and_pluto_tv_get_aboard_the_rocket_ship/)\n\nIf you have a lot of time, I also suggest watching their investor day streaming event. Here is the link: [http://ir.viacomcbs.com/streamingevent](http://ir.viacomcbs.com/streamingevent)\n\nNow lets talk about the GIANT that is ViacomCBS.\n\nViacomCBS comprises four major units:\n\n* CBS Entertainment Group consists of CBS-branded assets, including the CBS television network, CBS News, CBS Sports, CBS Studios, CBS Media Ventures, Big Ticket Television, CBS Television Stations, and CBS Interactive. The unit also has a 50% interest in The CW television network joint venture co-owned by AT&T subsidiary WarnerMedia through its Warner Bros. division.\\[47\\]\n* Domestic Media Networks encompasses the pay television channels owned byViacomCBS in the United States, such as MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, BET, Comedy Central, TV Land, Paramount Network, Logo, CMT, Pop TV, Smithsonian Channel, VH1, The Movie Channel, and Flix. ViacomCBS Domestic also controls production facilities for the channels listed above, including Nickelodeon Animation Studio.\n* International Networks encompasses certain international versions of the company's domestic channels, as well as region-specific networks, such as Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, Network 10 in Australia, and Telefe in Argentina. ViacomCBS International also owns a third\\[48\\] of the Rainbow S.r.l. television studio in Italy, as well as a 49% stake in the Viacom 18 joint venture with TV18.\\[49\\] This unit also includes all CBS-branded channels across Europe, which are co-owned with AMC Networks International.\n* Global Distribution Group focuses on the global distribution of all programs produced by all ViacomCBS production studios. The division consists of ViacomCBS International Studios.\n\nOther assets owned by ViacomCBS include the Paramount Pictures film and television studio, the company's flagship subscription streaming service Paramount+, over-the-top ad-supported video-on-demand platform Pluto TV, book publisher Simon & Schuster, multi-genre online video conference VidCon, mixed martial arts promoter Bellator, and media and entertainment company AwesomenessTV. As of November 2019, AwesomenessTV is overseen by its co-founder Brian Robbins, an executive for ViacomCBS Domestic. The company also has an undisclosed stake in FuboTV, acquired in 2020.\n\nSee: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViacomCBS)\n\nFor a list of all assets owned by ViacomCBS: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_assets\\_owned\\_by\\_ViacomCBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_ViacomCBS)\n\nViacom's audience reach is very broad, as their content is vast and appeals to all kinds of demographics. Let's talk about just Paramount Plus alone for. I know a bunch of fucktards didnt like the release of P+ but its not about just yourself, its about the potential appeal to other people who have likes and dislikes that differ from yourself.\n\nP+ not only has a ton of content but also LIVE FUCKING SPORTS!!!!! Here's a look at the more than 1,000 live games P+ is bringing to the table:\n\n* THE NFL ON CBS\n* The Masters\n* NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship\n* PGA TOUR\n* SEC ON CBS\n* The PGA Championship\n* National Women's Soccer League\n* UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League -- *Paramount+ is the only place in the U.S. where soccer fans can find exclusive English-language coverage of every UEFA club competition match, every season.*\n\nIn addition, Paramount+ is expanding its exclusive English-language rights in the U.S. with three more soccer properties, featuring hundreds of additional matches.\n\n* Concacaf -- offering more than 200 Concacaf matches, starting with the Concacaf Nations League Finals in June of this year, which will feature the U.S. Men's National Team. Coverage will feature all 41 national teams from North and Central America and the Caribbean across different competitions, including the qualifiers for the FIFA Women's World Cup 2023, which will feature the defending champion U.S. Women's National Team.\n* Liga Profesional de Futbol -- Paramount+ will stream more than 300 matches a year from Argentina's top soccer division.\n* Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A -- Paramount+ will stream more than 360 matches a year from Brazil's premier soccer league.\n\nThe service will also be the exclusive home of a long-running, original series ***Inside the NFL***. And knowing fans don't stop watching when the players stop playing, Paramount+ will feature CBS Sports HQ.\n\nThis is a no brainer. Sports brings in YUUUUUGE revenue and viewership and P+ will have many different kinds of sports that appeal to all kinds of viewers across the globe. Soccer is literally the most popular and watched sport in the world. Honestly from the sports side, all P+ is missing is Cricket. March Madness alone has broken revenue records and the month isn't even over!!!!! Even if corona were to shut it down, VIAC has already gotten more profit than they anticipated, any additional profit are just more blessings!\n\nP+ will also have a bunch of original content coming in the next coming years. Here you can find a list of content coming to P+. [https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/](https://deadline.com/2021/02/paramount-programming-tv-series-films-streaming-viacomcbs-1234700647/)\n\nThe one that caught my interest the most was Halo. I remember I bought the Xbox console SOLEY for that game alone, along with millions of other fans. I suspect this alone would bring a lot of attention when released to P+.\n\nViacomCBS also has A LOT of their content licensed out to other companies such as Amazon and Netflix. \"Coming to America 2\" was made by Paramount Studios yet is streaming on Amazon. Why? Because of the shit ton of revenue it brings them.\n\n\"When Disney began developing Disney+, it reclaimed every last piece of programming it had licensed to Netflix (though Disney films released between Jan. 2016 and Dec. 2018 may return to Netflix in 2026). In doing so, the Mouse House sacrificed hundreds of millions of dollars in lucrative licensing revenue in order to build an exclusive in-house library. Yet Paramount Pictures spent 2020 selling off most of its theatrical features to rival streamers while Paramount Network licensed cable’s biggest hit (Yellowstone) exclusively to Peacock. Why? Because ViacomCBS President & CEO of Streaming Tom Ryan believes strategic licensing can be a boom for Paramount+ long-term even if it costs the streamer exclusive access.\" See: [https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/](https://observer.com/2021/03/paramount-plus-icarly-netflix-viacomcbs-licensing/)\n\nNetflix has gotten significant attention for its massive spending on content. Over the last year, the company's spending on content topped $14.6 billion. ViacomCBS suggested it spent about $13 billion last year on content. It's no secret that spending on content seems to drive streaming revenue. However, some are speculating the company's recently announced $2.5 billion debt offering could be an act of desperation. There is little doubt that the coronavirus pandemic represents a significant challenge, yet ViacomCBS seems to be positioned better than some of its peers.\n\nFor those worried about closed movie theaters, last quarter the company's theatrical revenue equaled just under 2% of total revenue. It's true that advertising makes up the bulk of the company's revenue, yet the company's consistent high-quality content should continue to attract ad dollars. When people are stuck at home, it's likely they are going to watch more video. Whether that means Pluto TV, the traditional CBS, Showtime, or CBS All Access, the company should be able to grow its audience. As the public health crisis eventually fades, the returning ad dollars, combined with a bigger audience, should serve investors and the company well.\n\nAs proof that streaming seems to be the future of ViacomCBS, the company's subscription and video advertising business is expected to grow by 35% to 40%. ViacomCBS has multiple offerings driving its streaming business. The company's Pluto TV service increased its monthly active users in the U.S. by 75% annually. Paid streaming subscriptions increased by 50% year over year domestically. On the flip side, Netflix is witnessing a split in its membership growth. On the domestic side of the house, Netflix's paid memberships increased by a pedestrian 4.4% annually. International has become the company's growth engine, with paid memberships increasing by more than 31% year over year.\n\nThough both ViacomCBS and Netflix are reporting solid growth in subscribers, the former generates significant free cash flow. In the past 12 months, ViacomCBS generated core free cash flow (FCF) of over $3.4 billion.\n\nThe coronavirus may challenge ViacomCBS' short-term results and cause volatility. However, with a yield of nearly 6% an almost comically low payout ratio, and a growing streaming business, this represents a compelling buying opportunity for long-term investors.\n\nDon't forget Netflix is also cracking down on password sharing. As far as I know, P+ can be shared and streamed on multiple devices at once. I am always streaming my P+ on my computer 24/7 and can watch a soccer match from my mobile device at the same time. Also, P+ doesn't ask me if I am \"still watching\" like Netflix does after some time.\n\nViacomCBS also owns Paramount Pictures, a movie studio that has produced so much great content over the years. Last time I checked, movie theaters are PACKED and movie revenue will continue to explode as we get closer to the summer and as we get more people vaccinated.\n\nAnother interesting thing regarding ViacomCBS is that is currently trading with a P/E ratio of 24.22, much lower than Netflix(85.21), yet Netflix doesn't offer live sports or news and does not generate cable revenue. ViacomCBS is still undervalued and has a lot of room for growth. As of now, the public float of shares is around 543 million shares, while the amount of shares shorted on VIAC is about 19.36% (around 105 million shares). Along with that, there is high institutional ownership of shares (currently 93.86%, see: [https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VIAC&subView=institutional)) and is very possible that an there potential an activist investor has been buying up shares since August of last year. (see:[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-14/viacomcbs-surges-on-bet-that-an-activist-investor-will-emerge))\n\nInstitutional money has some of the BIGGEST diamond hands ever and they are seemingly continuing to buy up shares and hold, another reason you continue to see VIAC have a strong, daily uptrend. With such high institutional ownership and very low insider ownership (0.2% of total float), that leaves about 6% of shares left available (543 million shares).\n\nsee:[http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/](http://www.stocksequity.com/active-stocks/traders-should-take-notice-on-viacomcbs-inc-nasdaqviac-with-the-stream-of-3-26/)\n\nViacom operates a largely decentralized business model. It gets almost 80% of its revenues through a collection of network channels that include MTV, MTV2, VH1, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, TV Land, CMT, BET, and Spike. The rest of its revenues come from Paramount Pictures (film) and Harmonix (video games).\n\nThose subsidiaries have their own management teams that are silo-ed off to act in their own self interest. Even when Sumner Redstone was in his physical prime and applied a micro-managing spirit to his holdings, he wasn’t make individual business decisions–he was firing the managers of his subsidiaries for not meeting his short-term expectations. This isn’t Steve Jobs orchestrating the iPhone; Sumner Redstone did not bring you SpongeBob.\n\nWhile most Viacom shareholders are understandably paying attention to the public spat over board control, that is not the issue that would keep me up at night if I were a long-term shareholder. Considering that 80% of revenues come from network channels, my predominant focus would be: How many minutes are being delivered per month by the channels we own?\n\nWe’ve had four nasty recessions in the past century. These are illustrative for helping us figure out the durability of a company’s profits during times of deep distress and aid us in quantifying the harm posed by perceived risks. In the case of Viacom, it actually grew profits from $2.38 per share in 2008 to $2.56 per share in 2009. Profits went from $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion even as minutes distributed through the network channels declined by 5%. Advertising rates plummeted, and minutes watched declined by a little bit, and yet the media giant still churned out more cash.\n\nViacom keeps its dividends in the low 30% payout ratio territory so that it can repurchase gobs of stock and boost earnings. It has repurchased 35% of its stock since 2010, taking the share count down from 608 million to 390 million. Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.\n\nViacom keeps its dividends in the low 30% payout ratio territory so that it can repurchase gobs of stock and boost earnings.

Viacom is one of the best companies lately when it comes to getting serious about reducing its share count.\n\nProfits have declined $200 million from $2.2 billion to $2.0 billion over the past five years. That also coincides with a significant period of buybacks so that earnings have actually grown from $3.78 per share in 2011 to somewhere in the low $5 range right now.\n\nPut another way: Viacom the corporation has seen profits decline by 1.89% per year over the last five years, while Viacom shareholders have seen their profits climb by 6.17% per year over the past five years.\n\nEdit: good read and news, more income for VIAC - [https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs](https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/bellator-tv-rights-showtime-us-viacomcbs)\n\nThe Play:\n\nI believe VIAC will see $175 or higher by EOY. I already have several calls at different strikes, but I plan on getting many more far OTM calls with 2023 expirations and plan on getting more shares. I believe anything after 4/16 expiration with $90-120 strikes would be a good call to look at.\n\n👁️👁️👁️\n\n\\*EDIT: Although I still believe $175 EOY is possible, I think $150 is more likely and conservative. I can very much so see this stock at $200 in 2022. I have already gotten OTM LEAPS and will hold on to them like your wife holds her boyfriend at night. For shorter term calls, I would look at $52-$60 calls with at least 2-3 months to expiration, obviously more time is better. This week will be important, if the sell momentum has died down, the only other direction this stock can go is: UP!\n\n👁️👁️👁️\n\nAlso I am anticipating YUGE sub growth in this year and next. Even if you hate their streaming service, I'm willing to be that you have watched at least 1 VIAC produced show or movie on any of the other stream services you do like and subscribe to. They are going to make money either from you directly subscribing or you watching their content on other services....\\*cough\\*coming to america 2\\*cough\\*....\n\n👁️👁️👁️\n\nI can imagine a scenario where others who like the stock also like and support the stream with a sub, and unlike other services like Netflix that stops streaming after some time asking you \"are you still watching\", Paramount Plus doesn't. I mean hey, I LOVE VIAC and I LOVE P+ so much that I just  \n👁️watch👁️ shows 24/7. I would love to 👁️watch👁️ all their content, although I do fall asleep at sometimes, but the shows and movies keep playing, so I NEVER MISS OUT. Even while at work, on my other computer I leave the shows 👁️playing👁️ so I NEVER MISS ANYTHING. Could you imagine others loving the stock and company like I do, 👁️watching👁️ all their content NONSTOP? I could only imagine their upcoming 👁️earnings report👁️ would be insane in that case, and would do wonders to my lovely stock... but again, I'm retarded so what the hell do I know right?\n\n👁️👁️👁️\n\nIf you know, you know.... 👁️👁️👁️\n\nNow I also believe there may be a great opportunity here for those who has been hurt or downed in the battle of GME and AMC, and there has been MANY. Look to VIAC as the healing spell that has been cast on the market. VIAC can rejuvenate your tendies, so you can have more ammo to fight against the hedgies! Should you choose let VIAC heal you, I suggest you leave some tendies with VIAC to continue to grow and multiply, just in case if you go back and goto the GME or AMC fight and get hurt or down in battle once again. That way you can return to the VIAC tendies you had left and didnt touch, which have now created tendie clones that you can use once again in the GME and AMC battle, should you choose to do so! For the battle of GME and AMC will be long and drawn out, you must be adequately prepared!!! TENDIES MAKES MORE TENDIES!!!!\n\nVIAC is the water of life, it heals all those who are weary from battle! Use this power wisely, fellow retards, autists, apes and degenerates!\n\nAGAIN, THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!!!! I AM VERY RETARDED, I LOVE TO EAT CRAYONS, MY FAVORITE IS THE GREEN ONE, IT TASTES LIKE $100 BILLS!!\n\nALSO........\n\nI\n\nLIKE\n\nTHE\n\nSTOCK", "id": "mq2amq", "created_utc": 1618320643.0, "score": 248, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "I'm just going to say this once.

To note, most tier 1 channels only operate in one country, so I wouldn't be too upset by it. Also looking at total ratings doesn't tell the whole story - ratings on Adults 18-49 are much more valuable than older ones, and channels that skew towards Men also deliver higher ad revenue.\n\n~~Current P/E is 10 if you look at Yahoo Finance, if you look at ViacomCBS and look at their actual figures, it's over 20 ($3.93 EPS).

I guess I forgot how to divide 40/3.93...\n\nYes, but Disney has a pedigree of delivering excellent films that people go to see. Looking at their finances, Box Office isn't a main revenue driver anyway so it's fair to say you can ignore it. However if they start building strong franchises, then who knows, Viacom might be a strong investment, but looking at what they have coming in this year, it won't be soon. Oscar winning films tend to be part of the $100M club, maybe not the same as the $1B club Avengers is in, but still very strong. Paramount might get 1 film a year in that bracket, could be a couple this year if you consider Mission Impossible a shoe-in to reach that, and then you hope for the best that one of their other big blockbusters is a success.\n\nRe 8B in cash, sure that's strong. 10B total if you count receivables (3B in actual cash). Still 8B in current liabilities, but I am surprised to see such a strong balance sheet vs 2019, I thought with how media was impacted this year it would be worse, but it's significantly better.

Some advice for anyone looking to jump into Silver or Gold", "selftext": "TLDR, Buy PSLV as the buy, hold, and forget trade of the decade, avoid SLV \n\nThis is a quick DD just getting a few facts out there in case anyone searches WSB for gold or silver today in light of inflation picking up.\n\nFirst, on the ‘Citadel owns SLV’ line. SLV is garbage so it kind of makes sense. Secondly, citadel is a market maker. They are long and short pretty much every stock, so good luck avoiding anything they have their hands on. Thirdly, it’s a minuscule portion of their portfolio. Net long position likely less than 0.1% of their AUM.\n\nThe fed is likely to cap rates as they respond to to higher inflation.  They might not announce anything, but look at the size of their purchases when the data comes out.  In many ways they’ve already begun YCC.\n\nThis means that as inflation expectations rise, real yields fall because nominal yields are capped.  This is extremely positive for gold and silver.\n\nI prefer silver to gold because in a raging bull market for PMs, silver will greatly outperform gold.\n\nSilver’s industrial and jewelry use is coming closer to eclipsing the annual production. You may not know that silver is used in solar panels, electric cars, and really anything that’s electronic and expensive. This is because it is the most conductive of all elements.  If you are bullish on green tech, silver is a natural play. As monetary demand comes in, it just doesn’t have the capacity to absorb it, which is why it can spike.\n\nYou may remember the silver squeeze movement that took off for about 3 days on WSB back in late January.  Barely anyone joined that train as virtually everyone was still playing GME (and still are, keep holding GME brothers) and yet it still had a fairly large impact.\n\nThe supply situation is far tighter today than it was 2.5 months ago, so people jumping in the silver train now will be far more impactful. \n\nAlso, we’ve learned that SLV is a scam, and silver surfers probably shot themselves in the face by buying it.\n\nHere’s a very long DD that explains it. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbx510/slv_is_a_complete_scam_its_a_scalp_trade_set_up/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nBroken into 3 parts, that DD addresses SLV being a scam, the silver short squeeze, and the fundamental case for silver.\n\nEssentially to properly buy silver through an ETF you need to buy PSLV, not SLV.\n\nIf you still own SLV because of embedded taxable gains, know that SLV gets taxed as a ‘collectible’ which is super shitty. It means it gets hit with your marginal tax rate up to a max of 28%.\n\nPSLV on the other hand gets normal cap gains tax rates which are always lower at 15-20%.  Even if you have taxable gains now, if you think silver is going to double or more then switching now still means you come out ahead due to the larger future gains getting hit with the lower tax rate.\n\nIn the silver squeeze world there are many ways to play it,\n\nPSLV is like buying shares, it directly contributes to the snowballing of the squeeze. It’s also highly marginable so you can get a leveraged pure play on the metal if you want\n\nMiners are like call options on the metal, but also frequently mine other things than just silver and carry political risk and other types of risk, not a complete pure play, but some of them can be very close\n\nThere are also call options on miners. \n\nMost of the miners are too small in terms of market cap to post here unfortunately.\n\nIf you want more info go read the longer DD I posted in the link above!\n\nPSLV, not SLV\n\n\n\n\nAlso:  PSLV was also banned on Robinhood a few months ago, so if you are still using that shitty broker please switch to one that won’t try to screw your at every turn", "id": "mq2kxl", "created_utc": 1618321598.0, "score": 731, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 400, "comments": [{"body": "You know you can get better returns here: https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower", "score": 329, "replies": [{"body": "There was report this morning that Bank of America has an $8.3 BILLION short on silver.  \n\nSee https://twitter.com/goldseek/status/1381918992412073992?s=21", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Of course they would want to short a direct competitor to how they make the money from (inflationary FIAT currency not backed by anything)", "score": 24, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bank sells derivative\nIndustrial user buys derivative to lock in price.\nBank buys underlying and stores in warehouse.\n\nIt's not a conspiracy and is normal for every single other commodity market.\n\nBut if YCC happens silver and gold will moon!

{"title": "$RIDE with Lordstown – Huge catalyst this weekend and a chart ready for a break-out 🚀 🚀 🚀", "selftext": "**$RIDE – Brief Overview**\n\nLordstown Motors Corp ($RIDE) was founded in 2019 and began developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They got a jump start, relative to other competitors, due to GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/). \n\n$RIDE assembled an [experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple executives & VPs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, Honda, Workhorse, etc. What these executives realized is that the general public isn’t ready for the mass-adoption of electric vehicles right now. So, the way to hit the ground running in this industry, is to sell their electric trucks to commercial fleets. \n\nCommercial fleets are literally the perfect fit for electrification. This is because, when a construction worker gets back from a long day at the job site, he can just plug his truck in to charge overnight before heading back to work the next day. Additionally, electric trucks come with a 25-30% lower total cost of ownership. This is largely because of lower maintenance costs for EVs and, in $RIDE’s case, their truck gets 75mpg equivalent (which is over 3x the mpg that a pick-up usually gets). \n\nFleet managers care about efficiency and cost – so $RIDE makes their truck a no brainer for fleets. Once their trucks are on the open market **this September**, every fleet manager and their brother will be buying these. 🚀 🚀 🚀\n\n$RIDE is showing their level of confidence in their truck **this Saturday** by participating in [one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable for a truck](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/enthusiasts/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/ar-BB1dWYrd) – the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race. The event will take place at Mexico's Baja California Peninsula, and it will be publicly televised. This is called a Proof of Concept (POC), and it will showcase why $RIDE’s truck is a fleet manager’s dream. *No other EV companies out there have the fucking balls to sign their trucks up for something like this.* [$RIDE has been preparing for the race](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1381955618278363138?s=20), and this will show they have a functioning truck. \n\n**20 reasons to invest in $RIDE**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. [The government is proposing massive infrastructure spend](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36017463/biden-23-trillion-infrastructure-plan-electric-cars/). This is a game-changer for EV stocks like $RIDE. It’s also huge for the construction industry, which consists of thousands of fleets that utilize full-size pick-up trucks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. Bringing the first full-size electric pick-up to market, *The* *Endurance*, **this September**. The bestselling 3 vehicles in the US are pick-up trucks – many of which operate in fleet sector. $RIDE is laser-focused on the light duty vehicle market – which will represent nearly a [$1 trillion market opportunity by 2025](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-light-duty-vehicles-market).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. [Backed by GM](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) who sold them a [6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html) over 2 years ago now for pennies on the dollar. 3rd most productive automotive plant in the country.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Utilizes [revolutionary all-electric In-Wheel Drive System](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/tech) with four hub motors & integrated software. [This will change the automotive industry for decades to come](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1331299805147123713?s=20). Aside from $RIDE, [Lexus is considering using this technology](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1124036_lexus-will-pursue-in-wheel-electric-motors-for-future-cars) as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. [Partnered with Camping World](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146315/0/en/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry.html).This partnership will allow $RIDE to leverage over 170 Service and Collision Centers across the US (instant ability to scale across country). This will give fleets the peace of mind knowing there are locations all over the country to get their vehicles fixed if there are issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. They will be able to create multiple vehicles with the same core components because of the simplicity of their state-of-the-art [skateboard chassis](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1130616_lordstown-thrashes-the-skateboard-for-its-endurance-electric-truck-in-wheel-motors-and-all). This creates insanely high production efficiency. They’re already planning to release design for their next vehicle: a van, this summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7. Marcus Lemonis, CEO of Camping World, [tweeted a leak two weeks ago of the $RIDE RV](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) that is being worked on in conjunction with Camping World. The electric RV market is going to be huge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n8. [Already have more than 500 employees](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/ohio/articles/2021-02-17/startup-electric-truck-maker-wants-ohio-to-ok-direct-sales) and will be up to 1500 employees by production this September.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9. Announced an [agreement with Holman Enterprises](https://www.holmanenterprises.com/news/holman-enterprises-lordstown-motors-announce-co-marketing-agreement-and-expanded-alliance/) – a fleet provider that manages \\~ 2 million vehicles.

Signed a [multi-year supplier agreement with LG Energy Solution](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/03/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-will-use-tesla-batteries-from-lg/#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20Electric%20Pickup%20Will%20Use%20%E2%80%9CTesla%20Batteries%E2%80%9D%20From%20LG&text=Lordstown%20Motors'%20CEO%20Steve%20Burns,Model%203%20and%20Model%20Y.), a global leader in battery cell technology, to broaden their high-quality, diverse battery cell supply chain. These are “Tesla batteries.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n11. [GM and LG are building a battery plant right across the street from $RIDE’s facility](https://businessjournaldaily.com/gm-lg-chem-select-lordstown-site-for-plant/). Think about the efficiency of being next-door neighbors with your battery supplier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n12. If celebrity endorsements are your thing, [Joe Burrow](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/work-for-it-joe-burrow) and [Guy Fieri](https://www.foxnews.com/auto/flavortown-mayor-guy-fieri-lordstown-motors-twitter) like to $RIDE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n13. At max capacity, the $RIDE [facility will be able to produce up to 600,000 vehicles each year](https://www.carscoops.com/2020/05/lordstown-motors-ceo-thinks-ev-startup-can-build-600000-vehicles-a-year/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n14. An [article from February](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/shutdown-in-lordstown/lordstown-motors-seeks-state-waiver-to-sell-future-vehicles-directly-to-consumers-in-ohio) that I dug up quoted the $RIDE Director of Government Relations & Corporate Affairs, Chris Kerzich. There was a quote from Chris that said: “Right now it's going to take us a couple of years to fulfill that demand. And that demand does not even include Federal and state vehicles, which those have to go through a procurement process, so we are primarily focused right now on meeting the commercial demand that we have.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\n15. Have been testing their skateboard chassis in both [desert conditions](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1369663762698014724?s=20) and [snowy conditions](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1357335736324866048?s=20).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n16. Have [over $600m cash on hand](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020), which is more than enough to get to full production this September.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n17. Have hit [fully-automated beta production](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20), meaning [robots are welding their vehicles](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1372178838063570944?s=20).This means they are very close to fully-automated mass-production.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n18. Yesterday, a video was shown of [vehicles being sent out for additional crash testing](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1381683369826746371?s=20). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n19. In the final due diligence stage for the[ Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lordstown-motors-corp-advances-next-123000404.html). Receiving this loan would be a huge catalyst for the stock, and an announcement is expected **any day now**. It says a lot that they are in this stage as it means the DOE has been taking a deep dive into their financials, operations, and personnel. If they are awarded the loan, this is yet another catalyst that will send this stock soaring. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n20. The 6-month chart shows $RIDE has made this same violent move downward multiple times, and each time, made a violent move upwards shortly after. I will now explain why this time of FUD is a buying opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**$RIDE – A time of FUD creates a massive buying opportunity**\n\nOkay, so what kind of DD would this be if I didn’t explain to you why the stock has plunged close to 70% from all-time-highs? I want to walk you through the 2 main things that brought the stock down and show you why this time of FUD is a buying opportunity.\n\n1. Short-seller, Hindenburg Research, targeted $RIDE in a research report last month. Piece of advice – never believe a short-seller until you do your own DD. They obviously want retail investors to panic and sell the stock so they can make money on their short position. After all, Hindenburg is literally just a [5-man shop](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nikola-stock-got-torched-by-a-short-seller-11600867055) ran out of an [apartment in New York](https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ny/5471661). I think their ego got too big after they successfully shorted Nikola. Feel free to check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) because it refuted all of Hindenburg’s main accusations against $RIDE.\n\nYou know a short-seller is full of BS when the state of Ohio comes to the defense of the attacked company. At the bottom of [this article](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), Senator Michael Rulli discusses how far along $RIDE is and says “anyone who was in that plant would read that short-report and think it was garbage.” Additionally, U.S. Rep Tim Ryan called the short-report a “bull-\\*\\*\\*\\* hatchet job for the short-seller to make money.”\n\nSecretary of State [Frank LaRose](https://businessjournaldaily.com/larose-visits-lordstown-motors/) also visited $RIDE’s facility to confirm how legit this operation is. Plus, Ohio Governor [Dewine’s Grandson works at Lordstown as a Government Affairs Lobbyist](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2021/02/gov-mike-dewines-grandson-hired-as-lobbyist-for-electric-vehicle-manufacturer-lordstown-motors.html).\n\nThis shows that the state of Ohio is backing $RIDE. It helps to have friends in the right places during times like this. \n\n2. Lawsuits and SEC Inquiry. Basically, there are a couple of lawsuits and an SEC probe that are looking into $RIDE’s pre-orders. $RIDE claimed to have 100,000 non-binding reservations, and there are now questions about whether or not these pre-orders are legit. This does not concern me. Like I mentioned earlier $RIDE Director of Government Relations & Corporate Affairs, Chris Kerzich, already made it clear that demand is robust, and it will take them “a couple of years” to fulfill the current demand. \n\nAll of this has been blown out of proportion based on my research. [Here’s a link of some current SEC probes](https://probesreporter.com/). There are a lot of companies you know very well that are being looked at by the SEC constantly. The reality is, there are 1000’s of SEC inquiries each year into publicly traded companies. The end result is almost always a slap on the wrist. Let’s take Tesla for example. Do you remember a couple of years ago when Elon tweeted he was going to take $TSLA private at $420 a share, which was a premium to the share price at the time? That was literally stock market manipulation by Elon, and it was probably one of the most illegal things a public company could do. There were dozens of lawsuits and a full-blown SEC investigation. Well, [the end result was literally just a $20 million fine for Elon and a $20 million fine for $TSLA](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2018-226). Basically, slap on the wrist. And that was 100x more serious than $RIDE’s non-binding pre-orders. \n\nThe point I’m making is this: Don’t be fooled by the media. They make lawsuits and SEC involvement seem way worse than they actually are. Do your homework and invest in companies with high-growth potential when times of FUD create buying opportunities.\n\nLook at institutional investment too. [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/ride/ownership) and [Fintel](https://fintel.io/so/us/ride) show that institutions have consistently been adding $RIDE to their holdings the past couple of months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n$RIDE is an EV growth company currently trading at a large discount (50% of their asset value). They have a $3B facility and over $600m cash on hand, but only a $1.8B market cap after the recent sell-off. Please view [this investor presentation](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/ef77bce6-b19a-4288-a651-e08089f1362f) for any additional questions on the company. [$RIDE is massively oversold](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lordstown-motors-becomes-oversold-ride-2021-04-05) right now.\n\n***$RIDE*** [***short % of float is now over 21% as of today***](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=ride&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2)***, which is exactly the fuel we need for a massive move upwards.*** 🚀 🚀 🚀\n\nRemember: Bulls make money, bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered. To me, it is apparent that shorts have gotten greedy on $RIDE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position:**\n\n3868 shares @ $12.22. I believe this stock will be back to its 52 week high of $32.00 by the end of this summer, and it will be $40 by production in September. $RIDE currently has one of the lowest market caps ($1.8B) out of all of the EV plays, yet they are the closest to mass production. Lots of upside here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL:DR**\n\n$RIDE stock currently presents a great entry point. People who are doubting American EV stocks are probably the same people who didn’t believe the internet was the next big thing back in the 90’s. It’s very clear that EVs are the future, and $RIDE has a huge opportunity ahead. 🚀 🚀 🚀", "id": "mqa20t", "created_utc": 1618343380.0, "score": 1325, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 922, "comments": [{"body": "So you’re telling to invest in a car company that doesn’t have cars to sell ??
