Because different exchanges use different software even moving bitcoin from one exchange to another can result in your funds being frozen while the government and the IRS perform an investigation, often it's resolved in a couple of days.\n\n\nThere's also the converse, virgin bitcoin, which has only existed in 1-2 wallets from where it's been mined, criminals really like virgin bitcoin because exchanges never turn it away or freeze funds, so they pay more for it.\n\n\nThere are other coins like Monero where this doesn't happen. I'm a big math guy so I could really get into semantic security and modern cryptography and ring signatures with you but really for your common pleb all you need to know is some coins can't be tainted, but bitcoin can be.\n\n\nUntaintable coins like Monero are favored by criminals because of that untaintability property, but that same property also protects individuals from people who would snoop on their funds, or businesses who don't want their funds frozen randomly on any given day.\n\n\nTl;dr - bitcoin has an audit trail, and they're judged on it, so some coins are worth less, some are worth more. Doesn't happen with Monero, which is why I think businesses will make the switch sooner or later, no one wants their funds frozen like with bitcoin, no one wants the IRS snooping through their books on any random Tuesday. Just my 2 cents.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you. Just so I can have more of an understanding, may you go into the math part. You’ve piqued my interest.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ok so I said monero is not taintable and for almost all use cases that's true, but there are some special cases where that's only *sort of* true, but in modern cryptography it's all about being *sort of* true. Let me explain.\n\n\nWhen you secure something using modern cryptography, it's not perfect and the people who created it knew that, there is technically perfect security but its requirements are not suitable for modern communication. It requires a truly random pre-shared private key communicated outside the environment that is at least as long as the message to be encrypted. So perfect security is out, \n\n\nEnter semantic security. Semantic security revolves around being good *enough*. If security is good enough that an attacker would need 10 supercomputers with computing power we won't see for 50 years, 100 years of computing time to break it, we can consider that good *enough*. You may have heard of PGP encryption, it literally stands for \"Pretty Good Privacy.\"\n\n\nThat \"untaintability\" property on Monero is called \"fungibility\" by math nerds, it's the same property that it doesn't matter what 5$ bill you gave me, all 5$ bills are mutually interchangeable. But here's the kicker, just like perfect security is unattainable, perfect fungibility also takes massive amounts of resources or a trusted 3rd party.\n\n\nSo Monero isn't *perfectly* Fungible, but it's semantically Fungible. It uses something called ring signatures. \n\n\nHere we get mathy:\nRing signatures work like this, you want to send money to someone, but you don't want an attacker to know you sent it. So you use a ring signature, where you bundle up some other inputs that have occurred recently called \"decoys\" or \"mixins\", and you can use some cool cryptography where it's mathematically proveably *one of* the inputs in this ring signature signed the transaction, but *we don't know which one*. Further your transaction is locked and your outputs are used as decoys by other ring signatures, called \"churns\", further obfuscating who sent what to where. But there's one big flaw.\n\n\nWhen you combine inputs to send to someone (someone sent you 1 monero, another person sent you 2 monero, and you send those 3 monero to an exchange). Those previous ring signatures and trees of possible payment channels created by the rings and lock time have to be combined somehow. Basically each spend makes a tree of possible spends and combining inputs requires you to use one of the spend leafs from each tree.\n\n\nThe problem is if an attacker, let's say the NSA knows someone sells illegal goods, like online drugs, they can send multiple inputs to a known drug vendor wallet. Each individual input turns into this big tree of possible outputs, one of which is the \"real\" one ( there's also a lot of other transactions going on in the tree). \n\n\nNow if the drug vendor combines inputs and sends to an exchange who colludes with the NSA they can begin to build up a probability that this person depositing funds is the same person as the drug vendor. This is because to send such an output the drug vendor combines two outputs from those previously mentioned trees of possible outputs. \n\n\nNow an innocent 3rd party could have combined outputs from those trees as well, so it's all probabilities and plausible deniability whether or not this person depositing funds is indeed the online drug vendor.\n\n\nSoooooo, Monero isn't *perfectly* Fungible, there are ways to attack it, with this attack being the most cryptographically devastating by some orders of magnitude. A solution that exponentially decreases this attack vector from working is increasing the ring size, that's being worked on as we speak, but we need to use this new algorithm called tryptch so that it doesn't increase fees a lot with increasing ring size.\n\n\nI know it's really only an issue for someone doing illegal things and a government staring and colluding with exchanges and actively sending money and following it, but the fact that *any* entity could *ever* violate privacy is a big big big deal over in r/monero. And sure this is useable by illegal drug vendors, but what about foreign dissidents trying to sell illegal bibles in countries where they're banned? What about a person trying to help uighurs flee China? They should be protected by default in such a way that no entity could *ever* figure out who they are.\n\n\nIn crypto, the whole original point and the one thing it should do at any and all costs is protect against every possible case of potential surveillance.

If you're looking at resistance and support you're trading. You can make money doing that, but to be honest, there are very few famous traders, almost exclusively investors. \n\nIt's also less stressful. Look up dollar cost averaging - basically buying monthly to ensure you're getting a good cost basis. Example: you bought 1 ROKU tomorrow for $370. Next week it falls to $340 you buy 1 more. Then it drops to $300 the week after and you buy one more. Now your cost basis / share price average is $336, so anything above $336 is a profit to you. \n\nTime in the market > timing the market has been proven over and over again. Invest early and often.\n\nIf you're in individual stocks only, find 12-18 you like, preferably from different sectors. Invest in them monthly, and with any money you can spare. Future you will thank yourself!\n\nSo find some good stocks, and buy them repeatedly, and don't bother with the technicals. They don't matter in the long run. \n\nHere's an example portfolio, 12 stocks, growth focused:\n\n8.3% $ROKU (Telecom)\n8.3% $ENPH (semiconductor / green energy)\n8.3% $QQQ (just buy apple, Tesla, Microsoft, amazon, fb, nflx etc together)\n8.3% APPS (ad tech)\n8.3% JNJ (health care)\n8.3% KTOS / LMT (defense)\n8.3% Z / EXPI (real estate tech)\n8.3% PINS (social media)\n8.3% SQ (finance)\n8.3% DIS (entertainment)\n8.3% SWKS / DT (cloud tech)\n8.3% O (real estate with monthly dividend)\n\nA portfolio like this where you just keep buying the stocks every month is basically guaranteed to make you money in the long run.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wow thank you again for taking the time to respond in such detail.

Look, the 20th century was defined by American leadership in the auto industry, especially in places like the Industrial Midwest, where I grew up. There's no guarantee that that will be true in the 21st century. That's why it's so important that the electric vehicle future be one that is made in America. And that doesn't just happen, that actually requires not just excellent work by industry and the private sector, but by the right investments by the public sector. And the best example of that is the President's vision for installing half a million charging stations around the country.\"  \n>  \n>\"So, we think it is important to continue incentivizing and encouraging EV adoption.

The only reason inflation has been so low for so long previous to the pandemic was because almost none of the money created actually got to the general population. If people do not receive extra money to purchase things then the cost of goods can not escalate due to less or zero demand due to no money to purchase them. If people have extra money to purchase goods then producers can ask for more money due to scarcity. Economics is a big circle. When too much money gets siphoned off in one location for too long it fucks everything up. Right now the money is being siphoned to people (stimulus). For the previous 5 decades it’s been siphoned mainly to corporations and the wealthy. (Tax loopholes and straight up cheating) Next up, siphoning some more into the government. (Infrastructure) The only way out for a capitalist society is to grow your way out. More people, more buying, more creating, more consuming.
