{"title": "Replacing entire share position with 2023 LEAPs - Palantir", "selftext": "Hi all. I'm here to ask for your thoughts, both good and bad, about replacing my entire PLTR share position with only LEAPs. I'm looking for thoughts on the strategy, not really the ticker/company.\n\nWhy I'm considering this: \n\n* Although PLTR has slid in recent months, I remain very bullish on its long-term outlook. \n\n* I believe the bull case will take some time to play out. I don't expect huge share appreciation by 2023 unlike others. My target for 2023 is perhaps 50-60/share. \n\n* I would like to increase by position, but do not have cash to buy this dip. This position is in my TFSA (Canadian account, not real money, hahaha, etc. etc.) and this account is completely maxed out. No more ammo to add.\n\n\nMy current position:\n\n* 4000 shares @ 32.5 average, about $130k book value now at around $90k market value\n\n\nWhat I'm considering:\n\n* 50x Jan 2023 20c ($850 each) = about $42000\n* 50x Jan 2023 30c ($575 each) = about $29000\n* 50x Jan 2023 40c ($415 each) = about $21000\n\nAll in all, I effectively replace my 4000 share position with 150 LEAPs controlling 15000 shares. I've been selling covered calls on my position lately, so I suppose I could continue to sell covered calls, 3x as much.\n\nIf PLTR does reach my 50-60 target by 2023, I can significantly increase my profits instead of about a 100% return if I were to continue to hold my 4000 share position. Of course, the risk is if PLTR is below 20 by 2023, I'd lose my entire TFSA account. For example if PLTR is at 60 by 2023:\n\n* 4000 share position = $240000\n* 150 LEAP position (20/30/40) = $450000\n\nI intend to hold these LEAPs all the way out to 2023, regardless of ups and downs. By expiration, I intend to entirely replace the LEAPs with shares, and continue to hold throughout the decade.\n\nWelcoming your thoughts. Thanks.\n\n\nEdit: after running numbers, the \"breakeven\" at which 4000 shares and 150 LEAPs result in no change in return is $42/share.\n\nAbove $42/share, it is more profitable to have 150 LEAPs over 4000 shares (accounting for my cost average).\n\nEdit #2: after more number crunching, if PLTR is 60 or under, the optimal LEAP buys are this:\n\n* 70x Jan 2023 20c\n\n* 35x Jan 2023 30c\n\n* 20x Jan 2023 40c\n\n\n\n\n\n***Edit: thanks everyone for your thoughts. There's a bunch of !remindme's so I'll leave in this post what I decided to do, to look back on in 1 year.***\n\n* As of April 22 2021:\n\n* Sold all 4000 shares @ 23.28\n\n* Bought 33x GME July 16th 200c @ 28.20 each\n\n**Cheers!**", "id": "mvglci", "created_utc": 1619014493.0, "score": 587, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 585, "comments": [{"body": "Why lose money today when you can make an appointment to do so in 2023.", "score": 365, "replies": [{"body": "Amazing 😂", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don’t get the joke...are you saying he’ll lose either way?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "shares have no expiration and he's making a gloomy joke that Palantir won't hit his strikes and expire worthless.\n\nThing is, LEAPS give better leverage.

Saying a company has a particular number of shares available seems irrelevant without considering the price. \n\nIf what I’ve said was wrong in the past, surely the advent of fractional shares makes it correct today?

Basically, it takes a lot of effort to lift a 4 ton elephant, and it take even more effort to lift a 130 ton whale....\n\n**Stock float and Its Impact on Stock Price**\n\nThere are many metrics that traders could follow when it comes to stocks. However, the float of the stock or the stock float is also important.\n\nStock float is important because you can make an educated guess on the volatility and liquidity of the stock.\n\nThe float of the stock measures the total amount of shares that can freely change hands. As you can see the float in a way depicts the liquidity of the markets. The more number of shares there are to change hands, the greater the liquidity.\n\nThe share price of Stocks with lower floats is generally more reactive, and the stock will tend to be more volatile during the early period for a newly listed company. For such low float stocks, a fundamental driven rally creates increased demand. This in turn causes a rapid rise in the price, making the stock more expensive.\n\nStocks with high float tend to be less volatile, and less reactive. This is because due to the large number of shares in the float, it requires big increases in volume to move these highly liquidity stocks. So, while it is common to see 30% or 40% move in a low float stock, this is not very often found with high float stocks.\n\nA high float stock, as the name suggests is one that has a high number of freely tradeable stocks. Larger companies such as AAPL or FB are examples of stocks with high float.\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \n\n**How Do Fractional Shares Work?**\n\nFractional shares work in the same process as a Dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP). With a DRIP, dividends paid out by a company or fund are automatically used to purchase new shares. When this happens, investors can end up with fractional stock.\n\nLimited selection of stocks\n\nNot every stock is available for fractional investing. You might not be able to choose from as many companies as you could if you bought whole shares. Also, you might not have immediate asset liquidity with your fractional shares. Fractional shares may not trade as frequently or as rapidly as whole shares. Brokers wait to accumulate enough fractional orders to buy whole shares, which may reduce the speed of your orders being filled.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Ah yes, it looks like I got the wrong end of the stick... I thought you were talking about the absolute size of the float as opposed to the float as a pproportion of the shares outstanding.\n\nStill coming to terms with the nuances of float since it isn’t reported here in the UK (only entered the US market last summer).\n\nFunnily enough, I invested in Frasers Group somewhat on this basis. As above, float isn’t reported here but there are ways to approximate and with 25 entities owning ~97%, I came to the same conclusion that any positive news would see a significant demand shortage (and oh yes there was!). I’m just surprised that that didn’t cue me to properly understand your post!\n\nAs much as I’d love to have a reason why this isn’t negative for PLTR, you are indeed right... All I can say is there are plenty of other factors which have had a higher weighting in my individual investment decision. (E.g. I like the stock - or at least that what I hear I’m supposed to say on Reddit!)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Ok, I think we actually made a breakthrough here. I'm still baffled as to why PLTR is so popular. Guess we have Cathie Woods to thank for that. And if U like it you're welcomed to it.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Cathie wasn’t much of a factor for me and I don’t understand the craze for her. She made some very good decisions but nothing abnormal. She’s the perfect example of “past performance does not guarantee future returns”. Another fund will pop up in the not too distant future which will have similar returns and the everyone will be screaming about them! \n\nFor me, PLTR are the first AI company that I’ve seen which I believe has a large real world application. I don’t pretend to understand the exact methods by which the system operates, just that it seems to work as specified (I.e. no unhappy clients).\n\nScalability - A common misconception is that to grow, PLTR must do more of the same business, ignoring potential new lines of business. I imagine that scalability is a high priority. Just a thought - AI seems to need application in order to make the technological advancement (basically seeing where it goes wrong). It makes sense to roll out the AI to the widest and most complex use cases to mature it. I am fully expecting PLTR to release a more limited 1 size fits all service within the next 3-5yrs. It will just require the AI improving to the point it can self identify all items within the target network.\n\nProfitability - This one definitely needs to be addressed. Frankly I’m just waiting til the 11th to see if the share based compensation has gone down because the 2020 levels aren’t sustainable. I would hope that the high SBC was a one-off down to widespread staff bonuses relating to the DPO and that  as a result, this quarter will see a much smaller loss. On the whole, I really don’t mind a small loss because it is still a maturing industry but constant and material dilution isn’t going to be something I’ll tolerate.\n\nI’d argue that PLTR is in a similar position to all of the star names like Alphabet, Apple, FB, Tesla etc. in their early days. Not because I think PLTR should have a comparable market cap, but because they are all pioneers. \n\nPLTR isn’t ‘a potentially good business’; It’s a business looking to solve a human lead, inefficiently performed real world function. This ties in to the pioneer status... google monetised giving the world access to more information. Apple monetised the balance of information accessibility and human vanity. FB monetised connecting people. Tesla monetised the move to clean energy (which people still haven’t come to terms with). To me, it looks like PLTR will be monetising the eventual automation of all workplace functions...\n\nWhich leads me to the crux of the justification:\n\nIs the trend towards automation going to stop at unskilled jobs and functions? Personally, I strongly doubt it because of the human desire to improve... even if the improvement yields net negative results for ourselves (see social media)\n\nI’m ready for a very long hold assuming the business continues along the trajectory it has been on the past few years. \n\nLastly, I can see why people aren’t fully sold on palantir. There’s a fine line between pure speculation and a fundamentally based investment in a new industry. My bottom line used to be a small p/b ratio making me think all US stocks were purely and excessively speculative. After 10 years without any vindication from a correction, I reassessed and managed to use other factors to gauge value. At the end of the day we are all human and have our different biases which can make one man see gold, and another man coal!\n\nNone of the above should be construed as investment advice.

This is because OTM LEAPS comprise nearly only extrinsic value with no intrinsic value. When time passes, the extrinsic value falls significantly, that the underlying securities must rise significantly in order to cover the loss of extrinsic value.\n\nInstead, if you would like to leverage your long positions, buying deep ITM (or ITM or ATM) LEAPS offers significant leverage with a much lower breakeven price. Do not listen to the YOLO guys and buy significantly OTM options. Even if you are buying slight ITM LEAPS, you have already YOLO-ed but your risk exposure is significantly reduced.\n\n**2) You also asked after you buy LEAPS, whether you can continue to sell covered calls.** Short answer is yes, and it is true that you can receive a multiple of premium compared to your existing covered call strategy. This strategy is called the \"Synthetic Covered Call\" or commonly known as \"Poor Man's Covered Call\" strategy, a relatively advanced options strategy.

So if you own the 50 calls with the 48 delta, you can expect to make $48.00 on the next 1 pt. move up in the stock. That would be the same as if you owned 48 shares of the stock by itself. This is the main advantage of options. You are controlling in this case 48 shares for a fraction of the cost of buying the actual 48 shares of stock. And to make it better, the deeper ITM your strike goes, the higher your delta goes. This means you are controlling more shares when you are right and less shares when the stock goes against you.\n\nhttps://tackletrading.com/option-traders-meet-a-popular-greek-named-delta/\n\n>Since options delta value is the ratio of how much options will move in relation to the underlying stock, delta value suggests how many corresponding stocks you are effectively buying with those options. 2 contracts of at the money call options with delta value of 0.5 has a total of 200 x 0.5 = 100 deltas. 100 deltas means that you are effectively controlling the exact movements of 100 shares of the underlying stocks and therefore almost as good as buying 100 shares (when the underlying stock rises $1, the options rise a total of $100). If you buy 10 contracts of put options with delta value of -0.75, you are effectively short 1000 x 0.75 = 750 shares. With this in mind, you would be able to calculate the exact number of options to buy in order to be effectively long or short a definite number of shares. If you wish to be long 1000 shares, you could either buy 20 contracts of at the money call options with delta value of 0.5 (1000 / 50 = 20) or you could buy 13 contracts of in the money call options with delta value of 0.77 (1000 / 77 = 13).\n\nhttp://www.optiontradingpedia.com/options_delta.htm\n\nThere's plenty of TT videos where they use it the same way.\n\n>It seems it was hard for you to answer.\n\nSo you did know the answer?

It's just impossible to say right now.  \n\nI guess this is a really long way of saying, if you want to invest for the long term, buy shares and just hold them, sell calls when IV is high and use it to buy more shares.

So if you would have put 10.000$ on your account, after 15 years (by compound interest) you would have gained about 10.000$. So in the world of stocks your bank account would have had a P/E of **15** (!). So there was some good reason needed to invest in a company that gains less earnings than your bank account could do. \n\n  \n\nAt the moment my bank account has a P/E of 278, but we still asses P/Es the same way. In years with QE and a something like 0.25% interests this doesn’t makes too much sense for me anymore.

This is a very critical monopoly that Blackberry will not admit to yet because Congress will then break them up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy monopoly in cybersecurity for IOT?  \nIf you look at all hacking that happened since December on government and enterprise(30,000 companies), none using Blackberry Spark were impacted!!! After Department of Commerce was hacked they immediately switched to Blackberry Spark. Same with Airforce and Canadian Government.  Crowdstrike will be a joke in coming years. Only blackberry has a zero trust architecture out of all cybersecurity company, and that's why they are able to protect governments from hacks like Solarwind and others can't do it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy monopoly in Car EV and Connected Cars?  \nThe Blackberry QNX software is THE ONLY car operating system authorized for connected cars.

The NVDIA controller used by Tesla for their autonomous driving is running on QNX. QNX is inherntly the most secure operating system in the world!!!

NFLX, Dis+, Prime Vid of course produce their own content (high quality too), but dont own the majority of viewership. imo there won't be 1,2 or 3 players - the market is big enough for a wide range of players. what i do see are more mergers and combinations coming up. typical for relatively new markets (streaming), first strong diversification (lots of new companies), then margins shrink and to keep a competitive edge companies start to merge to increase cost efficiencies and deliver better products cheaper. and that's my point b).
