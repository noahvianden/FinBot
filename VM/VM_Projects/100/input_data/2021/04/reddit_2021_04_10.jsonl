This creates a huge demand in a lot of sectors like construction, and on short term the supply of materials in these sectors are limited so that pushes up prices (inflation). Generally inflation is related to interest rates. The central banks generally has a goal of 2% inflation because much higher inflation rates is generally viewed as bad for the economy. So when they start expecting too high inflation rates, they will start performing contractive monetary policies. So they have different tools to do this. One thing they can do i think, is to sell government bonds. Bonds are basically debt and the central bank functions as a lending machine. So when it starts selling debt its basically saying “i don’t want to provide money for loans for these bonds”. When they sell bonds they increase the supply of bonds, thereby putting a downward pressure on the value of bonds. Since the interest rate is basically the price of the bond, the interest rates on the bond market will increase. (This sounds wrong to me)\n\nBanks will act on this and start increasing interest rates on their loans, because suddenly their corporate bonds needs to paid back at a higher interest rate.\n\nPeople won’t be able to loan as much, so that decreases their demand for mortgages etc.\n\nAlso, some people will start defaulting on their loans and then at some point the market will fall back.\n\nSo i think investors are very sensitive to the inflation and thereby the interest rate. If the inflation starts increasing, the investors will start expecting higher interest rates and then start fearing a slowdown of the economy.\n\nHowever the FED has actually been saying that they will compensate for years with inflation below the goal of 2% by getting that inflation at a later point -> they won’t mind an inflation of over 2% -> they won’t be running a very strict monetary policy.\n\n\nI think that’s generally how it works.

Long story short someone unwound a massive bond position, approximately $40B and they do so very very quickly.

Faith investors were dumping loads of money into them, thinking they'd one day be profitable.  People lost faith in these companies as they continued to lose money, and people began to pull money out, which caused the crash.  \n\nPriceline.com was an example of one of those companies.  Originally, they were a company set to take unsold airline tickets, and sell them to consumers for cheaper.  Airlines would sell seats that would normally be empty, consumers would get cheaper tickets, and Priceline would make money from being the 3rd party.  Seemed like a great business, but it wasn't.

It seemed like a very good thing to invest in, especially because they held a monopoly of sorts, but the thing is, even if you're a monopoly, you have to be able to profit eventually.  If you can't, you go under.\n\nThere are a lot of companies today that remind me of priceline.com, and I have a feeling we could see a crash very similar to 2000.  Uber, Lyft, Air B&B and a ton of other services are suffering net losses, year after year.  They hold monopoly positions, but still can't profit.  What'll that mean to the future of the company if it can't ever make profit?  Bankruptcy.  My personal prediction is that Air B&B will go bankrupt at some point in time in the near future.

{"title": "TQQQ is a fantastic long term investment, even with a volatility of 50+%", "selftext": "I am making this post because this information is not out there and it seems like most of the \"real investors\" want to ignore these statistics.\n\nEvery time someone talks about TQQQ they only have negative things to say and they don't talk about it like regular long term investments. There are quite literally zero backtests that treat it as a long term investment. With a long term investment you pick a fund or a few funds, buy in and then consistently put money in no matter what the market is doing. But no one seems to acknowledge that if you chose to use the same strategy with TQQQ, even with it's exorbitantly high volatility, it will ALWAYS out perform a regular LT investment.\n\nInstead when people talk about TQQQ they talk about it the exact opposite way that you're supposed to use the stock market; they try to time the market. \"Leveraged ETF's shouldn't be held for more than a day\" they say. So let me show you what the data says when you continually invest every month no matter what the market is doing for 10 years. \n\nThis is simply analyzing TQQQ, starting with $1000 and putting in 200 every month. Obviously you probably don't want to hold 100% TQQQ and common advice is to put in 10% of your income. 200/month is 10% of your income if you make 24k a year. Whereas the average income for individuals in the us is 31k (3100 a year invested) and the average household income in the US is 68k (6800 a year invested). I will post adjusted numbers for that over 10 years at the bottom.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/RlbXBAN\n\nOver 10 years TQQQ would return 19,237% ROI despite dropping more than 50% 3 times over the course of the 10 years. QQQ, with a downside of no more than 17% returned 3,461% in the same time frame. That is the equivalent of 5.5x greater return than QQQ.\n\nAnd if you want to talk about trading psychology we can do that too. To continue to hold even in a downturn of over 50% just look at the percentage gain over the life of the investment. The investment could lose 96% of it's value (which is incredibly unlikely) and you would still have more than you initially invested. I mean in a bear market most people just distance themselves from the market and just continue to buy despite what's happening in the market anyways.\n\nDo I think this investment strategy is for everyone? No. Its clearly not. But I'm 25, I have 40 years until I need this money anyways. Its definitely not for the feint of heart and if you can't manage your thoughts and emotions in a downturn then stick with regular, low risk etfs. But I can tell you this, the NASDAQ is mostly tech and tech is not going anywhere. Also market indexes are some of the only assets that can and will quite literally grow forever. Over time wealth redistributes; as larger companies die or are split up, smaller company's come up and take their place and indexes pick up these new stocks to continue to grow. \n\nTLDR: the NASDAQ isn't going anywhere, tech will continue to grow, the backtests show that higher volatility (while significantly more stressful) is very much a good thing if the asset maintains value despite fluctuations.\n\nOther results for average incomes:\n1,000 initial investment, 259/month 32,080 total invested, 608,561 10y return\n1,000 initial investment, 568/month 68,040 total invested, 1,261,642 10y return\n\nEDIT: 2 years later after a total downturn of ~80% my tqqq investment is at all time highs today despite being ~60% off all time highs of the underlying asset. The portfolio as a whole is about 10% off of all time highs because the poor performance of treasuries given the debt ceiling issues and rising interest rates.

TQQQ owns stock in each of the QQQ components, swaps with a 10+ major banks, a futures position in the NASDAQ 100.

The bank swaps insure that the futures position maintains an appropriate daily leverage.  \n\nAny change is not because of time decay in holdings of TQQQ, the bank swaps make sure of that.  I understand contango and backwardation, I trade UVXY where that's a key concept, but those aren't a factor in the price of TQQQ at all.  \n\nTQQQ decay is no joke: average annual return for the past 10 years is 47.65%, which is only 2.4x the average annual return for QQQ over the past 10 years (19.92%).

{"title": "The logic behind building up a short call position against SPY 400", "selftext": "Over the last 2 - 3 weeks I've day by day built up fairly large short call positions.  I have these across multiple different stocks. My main positions are in MSFT, PLTR and SPY. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the market has been rising I've sold ITM calls on SPY and PLTR.  Shorting the 400 strike on SPX and the 22 strike on PLTR.  I've also bought some put options and calls in the VIX. Because when I make bets based on vega I want to be paid for the risk I take if I am right. And if I am right, those bets will pay off really well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why I think the SPX short makes sense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople are calling me a perma bear because I've been selling into moves for 3 week (Most of the thing I sold into are down for 3 weeks, like PLTR, but people tend to focus on the few I am losing in - so let's talk about these) - and at this point I don't really care about perma bulls calling me a perma bear. In 2019 I got a lot of shit for being a bear. When I bought the low of March they called me lucky.  I'm used to it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut we've had a drop every single year now for the last 3 years. They used to come every 5 years.  The tails in the market have been fattening since 2019. To me this means the edge on selling puts has decreased since then. A lot of money has been made on the buyers side of these options if they built up positions at the right time.  So to bet on a drop isn't silly. At all. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pz07dss8ics61.png?width=1754&format=png&auto=webp&s=89b871106b480f2330ad1b09444d2a8e9970772a\n\nUsing Bollinger bands to gain some insight into where we'd be if looking at mean reversion strategies we're very extended to the upside.  And it does not matter if you don't think charting works, as an options seller standard deviations are important. And this is just a visual of the SD. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k6ig32htics61.png?width=1761&format=png&auto=webp&s=9396c00e2455d482514e7bd5c4f677d13e0dc8ad\n\nA vast majority of the time when this heads into the upper bands it comes back to retest the middle or lower ones.  And usually this comes in the form of short term capitulation. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vc3uxev2jcs61.png?width=1761&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cb939f411639f9d0c648d5d207c7fae8fc45e6f\n\nPrice can pin to an upper band for a while but rarely for more than 10 candles. We have a lot on there already and to me it makes perfect fucking sense to sell the 400 calls here and sell more of them each time the market is up (And on Friday I stopped because SPX hit 4130 and that's where I sized up my position to a full position. Now I'll wait and see what happens).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSPX has hit a seriously long term trendline.  People often say these do not matter and I should use logarithmic charts. But to this day I've never been shown results better than these charts are getting me. And I do not follow the rhetoric of people if it does not come with results. Lot of people talk about the markets. Most lose in them. \n\nI've added in another trendline from the same period to show what happened when we hit this in 2020. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9oa7nd0pjcs61.png?width=1763&format=png&auto=webp&s=de1e3310c0ec4f002eb9c605c7b91b3827e06e53\n\n\"Works great in hindsight\" - Yeah.

My trades bet on a reversion of 2 - 3%.  I hate when people use the word \"Safe\" for trading but if anything is safe it's betting something that has went up 20\\* what it's average is can come down 2 - 3%. Seriously. My odds of not seeing 5% correction in the next 3 months if very small. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFib retracement levels are useful. And a lot of people say they are not but a lot of us make a living from these levels.  I'd respectfully suggest you stop shouting at us about what works and linking us to papers written by non traders and ask us some questions to see what we know Dr Labcoat might not have. After all, none of us are paid to write papers.  \n\nAnd since fib levels are useful I know it's quite likely if there's a shallow dip in SPX it's probably going to be to about the 76 level.

In stocks and also in different markets that I've not covered because its a lot of work and few people follow them. But a lot of crashes and I looked at the ratios of swings in them. \n\nThe price moves most like the ones over the last 20 yrs are like those of the 1900s. In 1908 and 1918 there were two crashes of about 50%.  In 2000 and 2008 the exact same ratios would repeat. https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/m9enun/a_numbers_game_a_mathematical_look_at_historical/\n\nSo based upon these being exactly the same although close to 100 yrs apart, I started my analysis with the question of, \"Is the following action after the 1918 crash into the 1929 high like our current action?\" \n\nI measured the legs of the roaring 20s and found from making the breakout and going into a steep rise price went up about 75% https://preview.redd.it/1n86ia29too61.png?width=1359&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd1ed342f43c14e8efaeed9aab00a3f00ded948b\n\nAnd then after it got choppy at the top it extended about 25% into the high. https://preview.redd.it/kc1qjjp4uoo61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e2e15d370975430cce994a1137d8e0835f2bb48\n\nI then went to the Dow of today and did the same thing from the 2008 breakout. Found it got steeper and gained about 75% https://preview.redd.it/e8q9843ovoo61.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=faeab07b0bdb2d6f8bb0997e1d3e02c47c93832f\n\nAnd when I seen it getting choppy I decided to bet on it crashing when it was about getting into the area of 25% above that high. https://preview.redd.it/zxbw1i0vwoo61.png?width=1377&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6d7b0cc11d669bca698c5f701a91c0f93fff973\n\nI tested this against 100s of crashes and found it to be profitable. So when the same conditions appeared, I executed the strategy that would have worked in previous market crashes. The market then inexplicably crashed off this zone with unexpected news.  And although I'd no idea what the news would be, I'd seen unexpected news at the same level in multiple crashes. So, I really was not surprised. I did not adjust my plan, at all.

Moderna to reach $600 by 2023.", "selftext": "**MY POSITIONS:** I believe in this company long term and think there's a great short term opportunity to buy it below recent price targets. The stock is trading well below its worth because of recent market turmoil and investors not yet grasping Moderna's endpoint. I have a history of buying call options on Moderna when it went on sale. I have over 1,000 shares of Moderna and also have $30k in call options for 4/30.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26ajcc31n8s61.png?width=1798&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9f28948ce2f58bb5875bad3ec923a057678a11f\n\n**BACKGROUND:**  I'm a scientist and I work at NYU and the CDC. Back in February 19 2020 before there was a single documented case of COVID in NYC my colleague (Dr. Mark Mulligan) hosted a seminar titled \"2019 Novel Coronavirus - A Pandemic Threat\" -- WHO was still hesitant to call COVID a PHEIC and the CDC was currently making recommendations against wearing masks. Mark shared that Moderna was a promising company and poised to deliver a vaccine for COVID sooner than anyone else and faster than anyone else had ever done in the history of the vaccine world. Mark went on to lead the clinical trials for Pfizer. A little over a year later and I'm fully vaccinated with Moderna.\n\nOn May 22, 2013 Tesla announced that it paid of its DoE loan 9 years early. It was roughly $19.42, it's now worth 34x as much. Moderna didn't get a DoE loan but they got grant funding and revenue well ahead of their financial plan. They're in a phenomenal position to do three things:\n\n1. Increase production for their current operations\n2. Fund additional research in flu vaccines and cancer\n3. Pay back debt much earlier than initially projected just like Tesla did\n\nA few times in a decade an innovation comes along that makes a great leap forward. Moderna is one of those leaps forward. In 2012 Alex Krizhevsky started the artificial intelligence boom known as deep learning as he advanced an old idea that NYU professor Yann LeCun pioneered in the 90s, the major difference was timing -- both GPUs and data matured in a way where neural networks could flourish. Less than one year later Rob Fergus at NYU reproduced this work, demonstrating one of the most important conditions for growth -- reproducibility. For the vast majority of biotech companies in clinical trials, you're rolling a dice and crossing your fingers. Moderna's approach works, just like neural networks worked -- they will reproduce and mature their technology and apply it to numerous serious diseases and will soon have an expansive portfolio beyond COVID vaccines. Moderna (MRNA) and BioNTech have shown the technology behind MRNA is reproducible and primed to flourish -- MRNA is on a similar trajectory as deep learning. MRNA isn't a new idea nor were neural networks or electric cars, timing is everything.\n\nModerna makes highly effective vaccines for COVID and Flu (soon) that can be developed in a fraction of the time. That's not even the most exciting thing about this company. Moderna and BioNTech may truly treat cancer and not in the way that clickbait articles promise -- but in the way that we used to see HIV as a life threatening disease and now we see it as a treatable and manageable condition. Moderna will benefit from its highly optimized and nimble operations, it's running at a pace that other companies will struggle to catch up with. While BioNTech has talented scientists they needed Pfizer to hold their hands, Moderna (MRNA) has proven far more self-sufficient in navigating the world of business. AZN, NVAX, J&J -> have proven to be poorer choices. They're slower to deliver, they overpromised and underdelivered (J&J), they're less efficacious and more dangerous (AZN). Meanwhile Moderna is scaling up operations to deliver more than projected.\n\n**Near term catalysts:** 4/14: vaccine day, 4/28: annual shareholder meeting\n\n**Long term catalysts:** Curing some types of cancer \\~2023\n\n**Longer term catalysts:** Making highly tailored personalized medicine to treat once life-threatening diseases \\~2030\n\n**TLDR: Moderna is a game changer** with room to grow.

Biontechs CSO is the woman who actually “invented” the mRNA vaccination and therapy idea as an academic in the 90ies. She’s likely to get the Nobel Prize for it this year. CureVac has the most experience in the field, their vaccine will very likely soon be approved (more opportunities for short term plays there!). Also look up CureVacs technology on vaccine printing which they developed wi rn, you guessed it, none other than TSLA. Both Biontech & CureVac have partnered with big companies for vax production - so they’re out producing (& outselling) MRNA at least until 2022.\n\nThat said, I like all three stocks, am long 40-50 shares in each (not much play money for the market here...).", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well they’re in the same field, but they have little (nothing) to show so far.

On the flip side, they’re still low-ish whereas MRNA, BNTX & CVAC are all trading high, even near ATH.\n\nMy argument would be that nevertheless, BNTX & CVAC (more than MRNA) still have big upwards potential, due to their innovative pipelines (high efficacy influenza vax currently in clinical trials, vaccine printers, etc) and/or upcoming catalysts (covid vaccine trial results for CVAC expected this month, incl virus variants). All that in top of the solid outlook that they’ll likely have a large share in the covid vaccine market for years to come, bc the mRNA technology plus their production capacities positions puts them in an excellent position, assuming we’ll all have to get annual booster shots against new variants in the future.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "He said options would print.

After that, I'll be in for the long hold. But if it pops above 200 at any point, I'll grab another exit, then look for another re-entry on the way down.\n\nGood luck everyone!

Now the agreement with your broker does not change your broker's obligation to have your share available the moment that you decide you want to sell it. So even though your share is loaned out, the moment that you decide to sell your share your broker has the obligation to find a share to replace it for you. \n\nNow let's say the person who borrowed your share sold it short in the market.

{"title": "Apple-backed Chinese ride service Didi Chuxing files privately for IPO with ~$100B valuation", "selftext": "* DiDi is a Chinese vehicle for hire company headquartered in Beijing with over 550 million users and tens of millions of drivers. The company provides app-based transportation services, including taxi hailing, private car hailing, social ride-sharing and bike sharing; on-demand delivery services; and automobile services, including sales, leasing, financing, maintenance, fleet operation, electric vehicle charging and co-development of vehicles with automakers.\n\n*Owner and founder is Cheng Wei, ex Sales Manager of *BABA*, and Regional Manager of Alipay.\n\nIn 2014, Cheng hired Jean Liu (Liu Qing), a former *Goldman Sachs Asia* managing director, as the COO of the company.\n\nIn February 2015, the company merged with its rival Kuaidi Dache and was renamed Didi Kuaidi (later renamed Didi Chuxing or “DiDi”).\n\nIn August 2016, DiDi acquired all assets of the Chinese division of *Uber*.\n\nSince the company was founded in 2012, under the leadership of Cheng Wei and Jean Liu, DiDi has grown to become one of the world’s highest valued tech start-ups.\n\nBy September 2015, Didi Kuaidi had obtained 80% market share in private car hailing services and 99% of the taxis market share. The same month, Didi Kuaidi announced the launch of a rebrand process, including a plan to rename itself \"Didi Chuxing\".\n\n*2016: Acquisition of Uber China*\n\nBy the beginning of 2016, *Uber China*, which started its Chinese operations in 2015, had become a major competitor to Didi Kuaidi. Uber's then-CEO, Travis Kalanick, claimed the company was losing over US$1 billion annually in China.\n\nIn June 2016, DiDi closed a US$4.5 billion fundraising round, with investors including Apple Inc., China Life Insurance Co., and a financial affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. As part of the round, DiDi secured a $2.5 billion syndicated loan arranged by China Merchants Bank Co. This equity share fundraising round is one of the world's largest by any private company, surpassing the previous record set by DiDi.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, DiDi announced that it would acquire Uber China in an acquisition valuing Uber China at US$35 billion. As part of the deal, Uber acquired 5.89% of the combined Chinese company with preferred equity interest which at the time equated to a 17.7% economic interest in DiDi. The transaction also provided DiDi with a minority equity interest in Uber.\n\nIn April 2019, *Uber* released a public version of its S-1 filing ahead of its planned initial public offering. As part of the filing, Uber revealed that at the time of filing, the company owned a 15.4% stake in DiDi. Uber's stake in the company was diluted (from 17.7% in 2016 to the 2019 stake) as a result of new investments from additional investors since 2016.\n\n* 2017–present: business expansion, crisis and safety system enhancement\n\nIn March 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that *SoftBank Group Corporation* approached DiDi with an offer to invest $6 billion in the company to fund the ride-hailing firm's expansion in self-driving car technologies, with a significant portion of the money to come from SoftBank's then-planned $100 billion Vision Fund.\n\nOn 28 April 2017, DiDi announced it closed a new financing round of over US$5.5 billion to support its global expansion strategy and continued investments in AI-based technologies. The round valued the company at US$50 billion.\n\nIn December 2017, *Reuters* reported that DiDi had raised $4 billion for a global push into foreign markets and investments into technologies such as Artificial Intelligence.\n\nIn May 2018 the company received a wave of negative media coverage when a female passenger on the company's Hitch social carpooling service was murdered by her driver. In August of the same year, a second female passenger was raped and killed by her driver using the same Hitch service on the DiDi platform. Following these incidents, DiDi suspended its Hitch services in August 2018, and began to reform its platform with improved safety standards. In September 2018, Didi announced an investment of $20 million in customer service, The app's safety updates included an evolving set of safety precautions and in-app functions, including the formation of an in-app safety center, en-route audio recording, police assistance button and blocking function to restrict service from certain drivers and passengers. The company also invested $20 million in its customer service offerings and increased its in-house customer service team to 8,000 staff. As part of the update, DiDi created an online discussion platform to facilitate online and offline national public opinion surveys in China. Media reported that in 2018, DiDi recorded losses of up to $1.61 billion owing to heavy spend on training and recruitment of qualified and skilled drivers.\n\nIn 2018, the company launched its \"Red Flag Steering Wheel\" program in which verified Communist Party of China members would be visible as drivers. The company also pledged to hire 1,000 Communist Party members as part of its safety drive.\n\nIn 2018, the company launched a bike and e-bike sharing platform and expanded vertically into auto service sector with the spinoff of Xiaoju Automobile Solutions, a platform providing auto sales, leasing, financing, car maintenance, refueling and recharging services to driver partners on the platform and independent vehicle owners.\n\n* Since 2015, DiDi has invested in Grab, Lyft, Ola, Uber, 99, Bolt (Taxify) and Careem, and expanded into Latin America, Australia and Japan. In January 2018, DiDi acquired 99, a Brazilian ride hailing app.\n\n* Services: \n\nDiDi serves 550 million users across over 400 cities with products including Taxi, Express, Premier, Luxe, Bus, Designated Driving, Enterprise Solutions, Bike Sharing, E-bike Sharing, Car Rental and sharing, and food delivery. A total of 7.43 billion rides were completed on DiDi's platform in 2017. \n\nSome of DiDi's services include: \n-DiDi Taxi\n-DiDi Express\n-DiDi Premier\n-DiDi Designated Driving \n-DiDi Enterprise Solution \n-DiDi Bus\n-DiDi Luxe\n-DiDi Bike Sharing \n-Xiaoju Automobile Solutions\n-DiDi Financial Services\n-DiDi Food\n-DiDi English (In May 2017, DiDi released an English-language service in the Chinese mainland. The service offers English language user interface and a real-time, in-app, instant text message translation to facilitate rider-driver communication)\n\n*Technology: \n\n-Artificial Intelligence (AI) : The DiDi Research Institute is focused on AI technologies including machine learning and computer vision to optimize the platform's dispatch system and route planning services. A few hundred scientists work on deep-learning technologies at the institute. To expand on this research, DiDi launched AI Labs in Beijing and in 2018 the company opened DiDi Labs in Mountain View, California. This facility mainly focuses on AI-based security and intelligent driving technologies.\n\n-Big Data Operation : Big data operation: DiDi is building a cloud platform to integrate anonymized data from sensors on vehicles, static information and real-time events from roads with anonymized platform data including pick-up and drop-off, trips and carrying capacity information. This data allows platform supply and demand to be balanced efficiently, and enables mitigation tactics for traffic congestion.\n\n-DiDi Smart Transportation Brain is powered by AI and cloud technology\n\n* Globalization :\n\nAugust to September 2015: invested in Grab, Lyft, and Ola.\n\nAugust 2016: acquired Uber China and obtained an equity interest in Uber.\n\nJanuary 2017: made a strategic investment in 99, Brazil's largest local shared mobility provider.

{"title": "TQQQ is an excellent long term investment, even with 50+% volatility.", "selftext": "I am making this post because this information is not out there and it seems like most of the \"real investors\" want to ignore these statistics.\n\nI posted this over in r/stocks and the reception was not too positive so I thought to myself, \"who would be dumb enough to agree with me?\" Well, here I am!\n\nEvery time someone talks about TQQQ they only have negative things to say and they don't talk about it like regular long term investments. There are quite literally zero backtests that treat it as a long term investment. With a long term investment you pick a fund or a few funds, buy in and then consistently put money in no matter what the market is doing. But no one seems to acknowledge that if you chose to use the same strategy with TQQQ, even with it's exorbitantly high volatility, it will ALWAYS out perform a regular LT investment.\n\nInstead when people talk about TQQQ they talk about it the exact opposite way that you're supposed to use the stock market; they try to time the market. \"Leveraged ETF's shouldn't be held for more than a day\" they say. So let me show you what the data says when you continually invest every month no matter what the market is doing for 10 years. \n\nThis is simply analyzing TQQQ, starting with $1000 and putting in 200 every month. Obviously you probably don't want to hold 100% TQQQ and common advice is to put in 10% of your income. 200/month is 10% of your income if you make 24k a year. Whereas the average income for individuals in the us is 31k (3100 a year invested) and the average household income in the US is 68k (6800 a year invested). I will post adjusted numbers for that over 10 years at the bottom.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/RlbXBAN\n\nOver 10 years TQQQ would return 19,237% ROI despite dropping more than 50% 3 times over the course of the 10 years. QQQ, with a downside of no more than 17% returned 3,461% in the same time frame. That is the equivalent of 5.5x greater return than QQQ.\n\nAnd if you want to talk about trading psychology we can do that too. To continue to hold even in a downturn of over 50% just look at the percentage gain over the life of the investment. The investment could lose 96% of it's value (which is incredibly unlikely) and you would still have more than you initially invested. I mean in a bear market most people just distance themselves from the market and just continue to buy despite what's happening in the market anyways.\n\nDo I think this investment strategy is for everyone? No. Its clearly not. But I'm 25, I have 40 years until I need this money anyways. Its definitely not for the feint of heart and if you can't manage your thoughts and emotions in a downturn then stick with regular, low risk etfs. But I can tell you this, the NASDAQ is mostly tech and tech is not going anywhere. Also market indexes are some of the only assets that can and will quite literally grow forever. Over time wealth redistributes; as larger companies die or are split up, smaller company's come up and take their place and indexes pick up these new stocks to continue to grow. \n\nTLDR: the NASDAQ isn't going anywhere, tech will continue to grow, the backtests show that higher volatility (while significantly more stressful) is very much a good thing if the asset maintains value despite fluctuations.\n\nOther results for average incomes:\n1,000 initial investment, 259/month 32,080 total invested, 608,561 10y return\n1,000 initial investment, 568/month 68,040 total invested, 1,261,642 10y return", "id": "modli5", "created_utc": 1618090552.0, "score": 204, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 359, "comments": [{"body": "So this strategy already exists and is considered a relatively safe investment with at least 30 percent bonds (which would provide you roughy 210% percent exposure to the stock market).
