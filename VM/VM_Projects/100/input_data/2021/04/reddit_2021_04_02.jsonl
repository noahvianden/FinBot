{"title": "PLTR is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail. Here is my bullish thesis.", "selftext": "First of all, I would like to say that in this analysys I did not want to dwell too much into the technical aspects of the PLTR's software product or the financial performance of the company.  I am well aware that those are one of the most important fundamental elements when valuing a business and I did spend a lot of time on them while doing my research, before ultimately deciding to invest in the company. However I believe that most of the redditors on this forum , especially those that are already investors, already have at least basic understanding of PLTR's financial situation and the specifications of its software. In this thesis I will try to give my perspective about why I think PLTR is a low bottom company with significant potential for growth, based on more \"abstract\" and less known factors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nFirst of all, let's take a look at the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S Agency for Disease Control and Prevention, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential models that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.\n\nEven forgetting about the software and PLTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only SaasS company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PLTR's lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of National Intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril Haines is a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, it is that if  the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PLTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200. Unit 8200  is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption.\n\nIf you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold.\n\nPalantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least. He is a juris doctor from Stanford University, and a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt, Germany. He is also a regular participant in the Davos economic forum. Oh, he also actively practices Tai Chi and Quidong. Yes, this guy actually studied the blade, how could you not trust him?\n\nTo sum it up, I will use Alex Karp's own words: “We are going to deliver the world’s best software with the world’s most efficient way of delivering it. Investors will decide what that’s worth to them. And I think you’ll find in a number of years that there will be a consensus: Palantir is a truly special software company that is arguably the most important software company in the world.” -Karp the day they went public\n\nPS: English is not my mother tongue and I wrote this piece in a rush, so please excuse me if there are any grammatical or spelling errors.", "id": "mi8p2x", "created_utc": 1617322503.0, "score": 374, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "WTF!

At any point in that process, if it fails one trial the product, the company's investment all go back to the drawing board. Even beyond the risk of failing the FDA approvals is the risk that, even if it gets approved, whatever product doesn't get used much or another product comes out at the same time that does the same job with fewer side effects or more cost effective or whatever. In other words, it's tons of risk that you have to stick with potentially for years before it might pay off.\n\nIt's an industry I know very little about to begin with (you may have a bigger edge there tbf), and with such high amounts of risk I am staying away from that world.

Red flags abound.\n\n-Under new accounting, Tesla could recognize lease sale as regular revenue so long as the expected future fair market value (determined by Tesla) exceeded the guaranteed buyback price.\n\n\n-But looking closer at the description of these new leases, it seems tailor made to overestimate sales via financing agreemens (repos) with offshore entities. \n\n\n-Only problem is that cars depreciate. In a repo, you pay a higher price at the end of the term than you receive in initially, therefore any sales would have to be written off as the counterparty's \"put\" is int he money - indeed Tesla 1Q2019 wrote off $500M in sales.\n\n\n-To fix this problem, in 2Q2019 Elon and Tesla make the claim that the Model 3 is an \"Appreciating Asset\" based on its potential future FSD capabilities, providing public corroboration to underpin its accounting claim it was about to make\n\n\n-Setting the stage for Robotaxi Repo. By claiming the Model 3s were appreciating asset, they could recognize 100% of revenue for their excess production, without recognizing any offsetting liability or write downs as the estimated future value would exceed the buyback price.\n\n\n-Beginning in 2Q2019 Tesla \"Other\" international revenue mysteriously exploded, as its inventory dramatically shrank. From 2Q-4Q2019 these sales represented 36% of total Tesla revenue. Tesla stopped breaking out this category in 2020.\n\n\n-We estimate $2.5bn of Robotaxi repos took place over three quarters in 2019. Operating cash flow ex. this amount was negative. FCF was -$2.5bn vs $0.0bn as reported. This could have included up to about 100k cars or likely 10%-30% of 2019 deliveries depending on sales price.\n\n\n-All Teslas key metrics rebounded substantially from 1Q2019 and have remained strong going forward.", "id": "minumq", "created_utc": 1617380935.0, "score": 84, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 179, "comments": [{"body": "Anyone else scared to comment on TSLA related content?

Here's an incomplete list of the differences:\n\n- Tesla accrues sales & revenue only when the customer has paid, takes physical possession of the car and all paperwork checs out.\n- Legacy auto (Ford, GM, Volkswagen, etc.) accrues sales/revenue basically the moment the new car leaves the factory, or at the latest when it reaches the dealership - even if it sits on a dealership lot for months. (See the recent scandal about VW \"self-registering\" over 50% of their ID.3 sales in Europe.)\n- Tesla depreciates & amortizes their production equipment on an accelerated schedule of 3-5 years. This artificially increases their D&A expenses on equipment with an expected true life time of 10+ years.\n- Legacy auto depreciates & amortizes their production equipment on a slow pace of 5-10 years - delaying the expenses greatly. \n- Also, most legacy auto factories built today will be scrap metal in 10 years, when most sales will be EVs. There's a large wave of forced write-offs of factories building the wrong kinds of cars looming.\n\nThese are 3 real examples of conservative accounting practices that understate Tesla's earnings significantly.\n\nThe Twitter thread linked to by the OP, conveniently authored by an anonymous person 'TheLastBearStanding', not by an \"analyst\" as falsely claimed in the editorialized Reddit post title, is a hodgepodge of misunderstandings and outright falsehoods about the accounting standards around the treatment of leases.

And it's likely that lease buyers are even less likely to pay for the option\n* In their accounting Tesla hasn't recognized the full revenue from FSD software already sold. Their accountants and auditors say they can't recognize the revenue until they deliver the product. So they've been able to recognize some revenue as features are rolled out\n* Tesla had in the past, and recently brought back, the \"enhanced autopilot\" software option, which is just the existing functionality.

Also, the auditors still haven't let Tesla recognize deferred tax loss as income because they're not convinced Tesla can use it all, but they do recognize this huge future income from buying back appreciating assets?\n\nTo accept that this crazy conspiracy theory would be true we have to accept that the auditors are signing off on extremely creative/lax accounting on leased cars, while also enforcing strict/correct accounting for FSD on all cars.

Year-over-year growth is more than 100%.\n\nWall Street estimates ranged from roughly 162,000 to about 172,000. Estimates had fallen from more than 180,000 deliveries, mainly because of the chip shortage.\n\nTesla didn't mention the chip shortage in its report. It did point out, however, that the Model Y has been received in China. The company began manufacturing the Y in China a few months ago. .\n\nThe result keeps Tesla on track to deliver the Wall Street consensus of roughly 800,000 vehicles in 2021, up about 60% year over year.

Tesla is an absolutely viral aspirational brand, with close to zero marketing costs and actually zero advertising. 5 years ago literally tens of thousands of people around the world stood in line to reserve Tesla’s Model 3 and another few hundred thousand reserved online.

My short answer would be, no it's a bad idea. If you believe in the company you can invest a decent chunk in it but never put all your money in one company. You never know what happens, even the best company with the brightest future can have problems. Even if it's not their fault. That's why you need at least some diversification to bring your risk down. \n\nApart from this, a stock split won't change a thing for you. Imagine a company has 1000 stocks outstanding with a price of 10. You own 100 stocks of them. If they announce a stock split, let's say 1:5. Meaning you receive 5 stocks for every you own. \nWhat happens now? The new situation will be:\n- total outstanding: 5000\n- price of stocks: 2\n- stocks you own: 500\n\nA stock split is to make your stock cheaper, as in easier to buy, but it doesn't change the value. You will end up with the same amount of money. Investing and waiting for a stock split isn't a good strategy. Nothing will change. \n\nNow let's look at the future. My view on tesla is, they will go down more than they already did. Not because they are bad or anything, no because their stock is too overhyped. It's too expensive even if you take their future into account. At least in my opinion. \n\nA measure you can use is the price/earnings ratio. 15 is the avarage and you can calculate it like this: price per stock / earnings per share. With this you can take a look in the future and decide how much profit tesla should make to justify their current price. It's outrageous if you'd ask me. \n\nTldr: never bet all your money at one company, a stock split won't earn you anything and imo it's not a good idea to buy tesla at this price. \n\nDisclaimer: this is my opinion and it's not advice.

This week's top stock and its DD: Taiwan Semiconductor ($TSM)", "selftext": "**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.\n\n**How it works:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nHere is the stock picked by the program and my DD\n\n**Stock:**   **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ($TSM)**\n\nWeek on Week increase in mentions: **130%**\n\nMonth on Month increase in mentions: **324%**\n\nAverage sentiment across mentions: **+29.5%**\n\n**DD**\n\n**Core Product**\n\nTSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, who previously had worked in Texas Instruments. TSMC can be considered as possibly the most important company in the world that few people have heard of. This is because it is practically a chokepoint of the $470 Billion semiconductor industry and is instrumental in supplying chips to almost all the major players. Currently, the company supplies to Apple for their A14 chips and ARM-based chips for their Mac products, Qualcomm, MediaTek, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.\n\nThe company is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry. They are in the pure-play foundry business. This means that they do not produce any processors for their own products but they manufacture and sell chips to companies such as AMD, Intel, and Apple. The main reason for which companies such as Apple and AMD source chips from TSMC is that they do not have to build their own expensive silicon fabrication plants (the CapEx of the plans run into 10s of billions of dollars and it takes an extremely long time to set up) to manufacture their chips. TSMC is currently the world’s 11th largest company by market capitalization ($554 B).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1btw29krq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ce94bf883480c99f5e74a43bdea79bbf9d4d9f)\n\nAs you can see from the above chart, TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market (<10nm, think phone processors) which also has the highest margins. The company effectively controls more than half (54% to be exact) of the world’s made-to-order chip market.\n\n**Financials**\n\nTSMC posted its best-ever quarter in Q4’20 with revenues jumping 22% to a record $12.68 Billion and profits increasing 23% to $5.1 Billion. They are also expected to invest heavily this year with capital expenditure for production and development of advanced chips to be between $25-$28 Billion. (60% higher than the amount TSMC spend in 2020)\n\nThey also have a very strong financial position with $23 Billion in cash vs a long-term liability of only $10 billion (YE 2020). The company has also predicted a record first-quarter revenue between $12.7 Billion and $13 Billion, which is almost a 30% growth from the same period last year. We do have to note that their share price has jumped more than 140% over the past 12 months giving it the current valuation of $554 Billion.\n\n**Potential and Hype Factors**\n\n**Technology moat:** Compared to peers, TSMC is easily the leader in chip production technology. The company has delivered over 1 Billion 7nm chips by 2020 whereas Intel is still trying to master its 7nm development process. For those who are unaware of chip manufacturing, in general, the smaller the node size (measured in nanometer (nm)), the better the performance and power management. This is why the companies making the top-end chips want the smallest node size available.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w6mw9ehakrq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a70944796b31b7b971e743f497854c29d9b797d1\n\nTSMC is currently in the process of producing 5nm chips (20% of their total wafer revenue) and is already ramping up for 3nm production by the end of 2022. It takes a long time to spin up a new silicon fabrication factory (3-4 years is the average time it takes for a factory to go from planning to production).\n\nThis leadership in technology would be one of the key drivers for growth in the coming years. The $28 Billion Capex spending also reflects on the management’s confidence about the long-term demand for the advanced chips.\n\n**Strong long-term demand:** Even though the current shortage faced by automakers is mainly due to a supply chain issue, cars, in general, are getting more and more complicated and EV’s tend to need better hardware and chips. This will force the automakers to rush to lock in future supply. Even though the margins produced from the auto-chips are not as high as the phones/laptops, the producers of the chips are definitely going to benefit in the long run.\n\n**Risk and Competition**\n\nThere are multiple risks associated with TSMC. First and foremost, at the current valuation, the stock is definitely not cheap. The current PE ratio is 33 which puts them in the same bucket as Apple and AMD. While this might be representative of their future growth potential, it is on the higher side for a manufacturing company.\n\nThe company might face a short-term crisis in production as Taiwan is currently facing its most severe water shortage in 56 years. Taiwan’s chipmakers have begun stocking up on truckloads of water to prepare for shortages. During a similar drought in 2015, Taiwan was forced to implement water restrictions for industrial companies. This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC’s EPS as \\~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.\n\nA long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTSMC is currently one of the world’s largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC’s current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

What actually matters is the *transistor density*, which measures transistors/sq mm (two dimensions) instead of just one.  Intel's 10nm has slightly better transistor density than TSMC 7nm, and Intel 7nm will be slightly better than TSMC 5nm, so in reality **if both company's timelines hold** Intel is only one process node behind TSMC.\n\nAlthough Intel is definitely behind TSMC as far as fabrication is concerned it doesn't actually matter that much.  This is because typically TSMC's leading generation is sold out to Apple, which means that for third parties, the difference in choice of fabrication technology is negligible.  Of course, this part only applies once Intel starts accepting orders from external companies (currently Intel only produces its own products in its own fabs).\n\n**TLDR**: Intel being behind on process node doesn't really matter because 1) at the moment they only make their own products and 2) their only products in need of a cutting edge node are in their CPU division, which are still remaining competitive for now.  \n\nPlease note that anything written above not already released by their respective companies may change without notice, and OP's financial disclaimer still applies here too.

This contract is only for the US Army, imagine once the other US Military branches decide they need IVAS as well...\n\nThis is significant for MicroVision because their tech is in these headsets. We know this because the now legendary Hololens 2 tear down by u/S2upid:[S2upid Hololens 2 Teardown](https://tinyurl.com/S2upidHololens2Teardown)\n\nThis is why MVIS spiked 50% following the news.\n\nFull article: [Microsoft Wins US Army Contract](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html) \n\nThis deal will surely lead to an significant increase in MicroVision’s AR vertical revenue, however, the military contract is just the tip of the iceberg...\n\nThe big PR that everyone has been waiting for has yet to drop... MicroVision has best-in-class 4D LiDAR with technical specs and price per unit meeting or exceeding OEM autonomous driving requirements.\nThe company has announced at the last EC that the LiDAR A-Sample will be complete in April 21, and all signs point to a buyout already being negotiated with Google for the Auto Lidar vertical and possibly Microsoft for the AR divisions... there could be a bidding war soon unless a deal has already been inked. \n\nThis video by u/thestocksocks does a great job of breaking down the value and potential of MVIS technology and IP:\n[MicroVision Explained by a Sock](https://youtu.be/PMdtmj6Kz7A) \n\n[10 Signs Your Company is About to be Acquired](https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired)\n(1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 apply to MicroVision)\n\nNobody is defending the price.

(Sign #6)\n\nThe only real argument is that we don’t have a working product that anyone has seen and very little revenue.\n\nThat’s about to change... (See $22B Microsoft US Military IVAS contract and upcoming auto LiDAR A-Sample)\n\nNaked shorts and MM’s are driving the pps down. Bizarre price action prior to upcoming milestones.  (Sign #7)\n\nSeveral BoD’s have stepped down in recent months (to make room for the new appointees) and have not sold their stock. (Sign #8)\n\nLet’s connect some dots...\n\nSummary of the recent compelling events:\n\nNote: Some of the below DD based on summary from u/t-jameson-corazon \n\nFeb, 2020 - CEO Sumit Sharma takes the reins. Sumit used to be Director of Google Glass. \n\nJune, 2020 - Dr Mark Spitzer joins the BoD. Spitzer has ties to Google.  Dr Spitzer is the leading AR expert in the world and came out of retirement to be a part of MicroVision’s journey.\n\nQ3 2020 - Ford announced a stake in Velodyne (VLDR), a competitor in automotive LiDAR.\n\nDec, 2020 - Judy Curran (Ford) joins the Microvision BoD.\n\nJudy Curran previously held executive positions at Ford Motor Co. She has more than 30 years of experience in vehicle program, engineering, and technology leadership. Judy Curran is very pragmatic and would not join the board of a failing company. Curran currently serves as Head of Global Automotive Strategy at ANSYS, a developer of multiphysics engineering simulation software. ANSYS could conduct testing for interested parties to have benchmark data.\n\nFord and Google have a strategic partnership.\n\n2/1/21 - State of Michigan has purchased 1 Million shares of MVIS (not $1 million worth of MVIS, 1 Million SHARES).\n\nFord is based in Michigan.\n\n2/5/21 - Blackrock buys 2.4 million SHARES.\n\nMid-Feb 21 - Ford sold its position in VLDR.\n\nFeb 16th 21, MVIS announces a $50M ATM offering agreement with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. This ATM gave MicroVision the Net Working Capital (NWC) needed to facilitate a Merger and Acquision. This was filed with the SEC in a way that allows MVIS to pay fees based on the current share price and not disclose the future share price (Sign of incoming buyout - This is BAFF (Bullish as Fucking Fuck).\n\nMarch 2nd, 21’ - BoD Bernee D. L. Strom steps down to make room for the newest board member, Seval Oz. (Sign #8)\n\nSeval Oz, the newest BoD, is a recognized global business and marketing leader in mobility, autonomous vehicle technology and intelligent transportation systems. \n\nOz was a Founder and CEO of Aurima, Inc, a multi-sensor awareness platform powered by AI deep learning for autonomous vehicles. She was previously CEO of Continental Intelligent Transportation Systems, a division of Continental AG Interiors Division. She has served as Head of Global Strategic Partnerships for Google[x]'s Self Driving Cars Program (Waymo) where she supported global business and marketing efforts for Google’s self-driving technology commercial launch. In addition, she is an executive board advisor to automotive industry leaders and an investment advisor to several investment funds and holds 10 patents in vehicular technology software.  \n\nSeval Oz - “I am thrilled to join the MicroVision board of directors at this opportune time. I am excited to bring my expertise and experience in autonomous vehicle technology and mobility to the Company as it develops its automotive LiDAR technology and explores strategic alternatives.”\n\nSeval Oz has been on the board for the last month and has not filed a Form 4 with the SEC yet.

The only logical reason for her not filing a Form 3 or 4 with the SEC already is if she is being compensated by the acquiring company (Google). This is BAFF.\n\nSumit has repeatedly stated he is interested in exploring strategic alternatives including the sale of a vertical or multiple verticals. \n\nDirect quotes from the earnings call on March 11 with [transcript](https://tinyurl.com/ECTranscript):\n\n“The ability to deliver a high performing long range Lidar sensor that is designed to meet or exceed current OEM requirements.”\n\n“The scalability of our sensor to meet future price targets.”\n\n“I believe that adding these new expertise and insight to our current board, to augment existing expertise in business, including expertise in mergers and acquisition, strengthens our ability to create value for our shareholders.”\n\n“We’ve pioneered scalable solutions that we believe are far ahead of global competitors.”\n\n“The impact and value of what we’ve achieved was hard to measure (insert SS chuckle) since there were no competitive solutions for these verticals.”\n\n“Our automotive Lidar product addresses an emerging market segment that has the potential to impact millions of lives, in mobility and safety, with potentially billions of dollars in sensor and sales for OEM’s, and multi national technology companies over coming decades.”\n\n“With such capabilities, in our first potential product, we believe a future product could then include a Lidar, and a camera module, combined in a single sensor.”\n\n“As I mentioned in our call last October, regarding our A sample timing, we expect the hardware for demonstration, along with select benchmark data from our development platform, will be available to interested parties, in our April timeframe, followed by complete benchmarking and testing. I also expect that a version of our solid state long range Lidar sensor could be available for sale, in small quantities, in Q3 or Q4 this year.”\n\n“Our solid state long range Lidar sensor could enable any interested parties to perform testing, with our sensor, on their platforms, such as cars, and long haul trucks.”\n\n“We expect to establish a pilot line with appropriate capacity to demonstrate scalability as we have done over the last decade for multi technology national partners. Let me be specific on this. Our capabilities include delivering maps, control plans, supply chain partnerships, automation, and product integrity qualification, for high yield design, that can ramp.”\n\n“In conclusion, we remain committed to exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of the company, in part or whole, to maximize value for our shareholders.”\n\n“I am profoundly optimistic.”\n\n“During the year ending Dec 21st 2020 we applied a total of 2 million dollars against the prepayment.”\n\n“We anticipate the financial statements that we will be releasing shortly, will no longer have a going concern opinion.” (have since been released)\n\n“On our April 2017 customer, we are expecting that royalties in 2021 will increase over 2020, and we’re rooting for that product to do well.” (note April 2017 customer is Microsoft, $22 Billion US Army IVAS contract awarded last week)\n\n“We are a stand alone company right now, but we’re up for sale.”\n\n“I’m always optimistic about the company. A year ago, where we were, people asked, what do you think, you know (insert SS chuckle) MicroVision, you know, even back then, I think it’s worth billions.”\n\n“I’m trying to draw the bigger picture of how important it is to actually solve these problems in these segments.”\n\n“I want to be very crystal about what we’re working on, and our commitment to strategic alternatives.”\n\n“If you solve a key problem, and your extremely valuable, of course I’m optimistic about the company. Hugely optimistic about what it can enable.”\n\n“The demonstration would be for potential customers or other interested parties. It’s not a public demonstration per se, but for folks that were in conversation with.”\n\n“This is a fight for the future. The last time I remember feeling this kind of excitement was what we call the internet age in the late 90’s, mid 90’s, where we knew that there was a big revolution that would impact everyone’s life, so I’m excited. All of us are.”\n\n“This is benchmarking data that is provided for interested parties.”\n\n“Everybody’s thirst for data, will be done, who is working with us under NDA.”\n\n“...we need to give confidence to customers, people, you know, perhaps in a strategic transaction.”\n\n“Save millions of lives, and make billions of dollars over decades.”\n\n“The process continues, but we will not be commenting on any specifics.”\n\nMore dots...\nNo fireside chat after Q4 2020 earnings call (They typically have had these but it seems they are trying to say as little as possible, a sign of a buyout being negotiated).\n\nDavid Allen/Investor Relations, has not been able to answer most questions over email or the phone.\n\nYalon Farhi - BoD who’s funds kept MVIS alive steps down and retires.

Based purely on the P/E ratio, it would seem that shorting would be a good strategy, however, MVIS value is not in the current earnings, it is in the IP of the LiDAR and AR tech, and upcoming buyout.\n\nLook at the short interest, borrowed shares and float. The shorts are all-in and there is about to be a massive short squeeze...\n\nTesla crashing causing increase in liability and eyes pushing for regulation.\n\nSamuel Kang, head of total solutions North America for BYD says last week, “we believe in mvis” and comments after, “they have better tech then Luminar.”\n\nMVIS is considered a Mid-Cap stock since its market cap is over $2B. This has let to a further increase in institutional ownership.\n\nRussell indices reconstitution coming up in May. Today MVIS isn't in any Russell indices since it was below the min $1/share cutoff last year. This year, MVIS should land in several.\n\n[MVIS is the Top Holding of Moonshot Innovators ETF (MOON)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/04/moonshot-innovators-etf-manager-breaks-down-his-new-funds-strategy.html)\n\nCompetitors:\n(Detailed competitive analysis located in Deep Dive link below)\n\nAEVA \nThe new kid on the block, AEVA recently went public via SPAC. Founded by ex-Apple guys, so they have generated some buzz snd have a current market cap of $2.6B. AEVA also has 4D LiDAR, their tech is based on a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) system that integrates onto a chip. Our key advantage over AEVA is timing and speed to market. AEVA has announced they will not be ready for production until late 2023/early 2024. MVIS has comparable if not superior technical specs and has a 3 year head start on AEVA... 3 years...\n\nLuminar (LAZR) \nLiDAR is currently valued at $8B, they were $10B prior to the tech correction, and MVIS LiDAR is superior in terms is specs, size, and scalability (See the Deep Dive link for detailed competitor analysis). \n\nVelodyne (VLDR)\nInferior 3D LiDAR, does not track velocity (4D), inferior resolution specs. Ford had a significant stake in Velodyne and sold it shortly after Judy Curran joined the board of MVIS.\n\nPrice Target:\n\nIf we use Luminar’s (LAZR) valuation as a benchmark, we can estimate the fair market value of MVIS auto LiDAR vertical being at least equivalent to LAZR at $8-10B ($51-$63.50/share). I personally think MVIS LiDAR should garner more since it is superior to LAZR, so I am estimating $63.5-100/share for the Auto LiDAR vertical. More conservatively, we can assume that the Auto LiDAR vertical should be worth at least as much as the LAZR valuation of $8B (~$50/share), and I would expect MVIS should be worth more given our LiDAR is superior to LAZR. That is not even mentioning the value of the Consumer LiDAR and AR verticals. While we don’t know how much these are worth, we know the AR verticals just got much more valuable with the $22B contract. MVIS has a portfolio of over 460 patents. My price target for the entire company is at least $150/share.\n\nMicroVision regarding their LiDAR:\n“We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have a range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any LiDAR with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters, and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This equates to 520 points per square degree.”\n\nIf you want a deep dive, the below link is a comprehensive breakdown of the entire investment thesis and proof of MicroVision’s superiority in LiDAR and AR provided by u/BigBlackWifey\n\nSummary:\n- About the Company\n- LiDAR Verticals\n- AR Verticals\n- Industry Outlook\n- Patents\n- Insider Activity\n- Institutional Investments\n- Recent Events\n- Talent at MicroVision \n- Conclusion/Valuation/TLDR\n\n[Deep Dive Investment Thesis](https://tinyurl.com/2y26hsxh)\n\nHighly Recommend ⬆️\n\nThe below is a link to the MVIS DD Meta Thread, another treasure trove if you want to deep dive.\n[r/MVIS community DD Meta Thread](https://tinyurl.com/MVISCommunityDDMetaThread)\n\nI have been holding and accumulating since May 2020.\n\nI emptied my bank account (again) last week.\n\nI currently hold 10,000 shares in my ROTH and 3,300 shares in brokerage along with 93 calls/LEAPS.\n\nThis is a YOLO for me as I have 95% of my folio in MVIS.\n\nI don’t want to regret not buying more pre-buyout.\n\nThis is the way.", "id": "minugt", "created_utc": 1617380921.0, "score": 1647, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 616, "comments": [{"body": "Yes, big things in store for MVIS.

In this hypothetical, you buy calls on MVIS and afterwards MVIS receives 8b (cash, to make things simpler) for its LiDAR - which will be distributed to shareholders through a special dividend. You sell your calls after the premium on your calls skyrocket to factor in the dividend (since the majority of the time, selling your calls for the premium is more advantageous than exercising). Since you still want in on the other verticals you now have to watch for a reentry point into MVIS once the dividend has been issued, at whatever market cap the other many verticals (the value of which are somewhat speculative at this point in time) are priced at by the market. Choosing the right reentry point on verticals that are at an inflection point and will likely be prone to volatility is a difficulty that call holders have to deal with that people just holding shares would not.

Contractually this means that they are signing up multi year contract to spend x number of $$$ for a period of time on the platform, typically called an EDP (enterprise discount program). These EDPs can be very custom, and can include free consulting, credits to offset their eventual bill, and other offers along with a certain negotiated discount off of any aws service monthly. Depending on the size of the contract this discount could well be into 20% or more off. I've seen credits easily mid 7 figures before. This contract essentially says - you will spend this much money and at the end of the term or at annual periods in the contract if you have not spent, you get a bill for the difference. And also depending on accounting rules - this contract could be considered Capex.\n\nMinimum eligible spend to be able to get an EDP? 500k a year (used to be $1M until recently). Think about how many companies use AWS and would hit this threshold....alot. aws reps also get paid on signing EDPs, so they love them too.\n\n2 - they are going to sell their product on the aws marketplace. The marketplace and having ISVs (which PLTR would be in this case) is relatively new, like within the last 2 years. Only recently (last few months) aws has allowed professional services - not specifically tied to a product offering on the marketplace, to also be sold. The sale process for items on the marketplace can happen several different ways: user finds it and clicks buy, ISV directs customers who come through other sales channels to buy on  AWS (I've seen some offer discounts to do so), or Marketplace specific ISV reps go and specifically sell the product to aws customers and partners (these reps make no money unless someone buys the product). Aws essentially is turning into a software and services disti (comparable distis include SHI, techdata, arrow, cdw).\n\n\nNow - based on the 5 seconds I used ducksduckgo (fuck google) before I started typing this post up, my hunch is the article is referencing PLTR going the way of my #2 meaning. They would be dumb if they were also not under an EDP too though.\n\n\nHow are #1 and #2 related?\n\nLet's say I'm a company who has an EDP, and I didn't know what I was doing when I made the initial commitment and I'm projecting to come up short at the end of my next EDP term. There are a couple ways to fill the gap without spinning up EC2 instances for fun - one of them is spending money on the marketplace (product, professional services). 50% of the value of these spends count against the commitment of an EDP. So, if you are projecting a 50k shortfall on your EDP term - you could spend 100k on the marketplace to cover it and avoid the 50k bill from aws (for nothing). \n\nThat said - companies are moving alot of their transactions to the aws marketplace because of this EDP benefit. Ideally you don't suck and take into account marketplace spend in your analysis for your EDP spend, but alot of companies dont.\n\n\nWhat does this all mean for PLTR stock?\n\nNothing yet. However there are some future indicators to look out for:\n\nJob postings for Marketplace ISV positions, specifically in the ERP space.\n\nPLTR showing up at an aws event in the future (summits or specifically reInvent)\n\nAnnouncements of large companies entering agreements to buy/use PLTR who also use AWS\n\nPLTR Announcing professional services/consulting \n\nPLTR professional services/consulting offers on the marketplace\n\n\nIf one or more of the above happen, it should increase the share value of the stock.\n\nI write this long post as someone who pretty much doesn't own stock (fidelity just puts my money places), doesn't hold any PLTR, and used to negotiate EDPs and was employed by an early adopter of the aws marketplace.\n\nBTW- contino is far from what I'd consider reputable in the sense of using it for any DD.
