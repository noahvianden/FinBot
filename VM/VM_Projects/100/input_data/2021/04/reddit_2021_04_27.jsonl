{"title": "What are y'all bullish on these days?", "selftext": "I am actually quite bullish on tech right now and it's the highest percentage of my portfolio that it's ever been, more than 7%! I have positions in lam research, amd, Snap, and I want back into intel (sold before earnings because it was getting a bit crazy and easy to see the drop coming.)\n\nAMD I scooped up on a dip and have been happy, I bought some more today and averaged up a tiny bit. I am actually not the biggest fan of their pc parts, but it's because I'm old school and just prefer intel CPUs and nvidia gpus. But many enthusiasts are actually using AMD these days, and their numbers have been well. They have a PEG of ~1.5 which doesn't exactly make it great value right now, but I think the stock is undervalued compared to peers. I will hold this and average down if when I get the opportunity.\n\nLam research has a PEG of 1.2 and I expected it to be higher honestly. I bought the stock with the intent to hold for long and average down over time but I haven't even had that opportunity yet. Wish I bought a bit more to trim, but I think I will stick to my guns and hold it long. \n\nSnaps just a long hold, definitely way overvalued, but I expect to average down at some point. I'm honestly in snapchat because my portfolio has been very boring lately, and I've owned the stock before at much lower prices. Their earnings report wasn't terrible, wasn't great, but I think as the years go on the company will be able to do well. I'm not really too attached to this play, it's a small percentage and it's a bit speculative and not really my style, but for now I'm a happy holder especially since they did breakeven on this earnings.\n\nIntel is a powerhouse and many call it a value trap, I think the markets just waiting for them to stop making mistakes and I think Pat will be able to SLOWLY turn them around. Long hold and I will buy some soon, haven't gotten back in it yet.\n\nI'm also extremely bullish on oil and energy. Brent has been doing very well and holding for now, and I think that the debt the oil companies has accumulated was actually beneficial because it's so cheap. Exxon and chevron I love, as well as the pipelines. (I sold all my enbridge early, and may sell some puts to try and get back in at a small discount)\n\nCarbon capture is a tried and true method of reducing emissions, albeit not the best way of going green, but it will be profitable IF Biden can put a price on co2. BP, shell, and exxon all already do this as well as many other companies. Don't know too much about it but I did some light reading for a couple hours and it's old stuff been around since the 70s, but it does work and is a realistic next step in reducing emissions. Definitely not a permanent solution but I see it as a necessary stepping stone and there may be money to be made.\n\nOil is also not going anywhere for at least a decade, probably longer, so I believe these companies are all extremely undervalued even after their run ups. Going forward 2 years I think even when oil prices normalize,  I think the giants will be in a better position overall. \n\nI like GE for their wind turbines as well, although it's much smaller scale and doesn't really bring much to stock price. I believe Siemens does this as well, but I do not own siemens. With Biden in office and oil prices getting high, it's the perfect storm for greener energies.\n\nI went into this earnings season a bit bearish and I still expect it to be rocky, so properly hedging should be on everybodies list as well. But I believe the bull market will be fine over the next year, albeit not completely smooth. Healthcare is a solid industry to invest in during times like these as the big names are quite undervalued. I'm not bullish on healthcare, but it's a savings account and it's not volatile when everything else is, so its a defensive play when IV is very low.", "id": "mzgodf", "created_utc": 1619498660.0, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "Clean energy that's actually *profitable* already (CWEN, AMRC, TPIC).\n\nMOGO.

Currently it trades for $14. Suddenly, a large market sell order for 6 million stocks comes in (fat fingers or a stupid pension fund, your choice); more than the typical volume. This order should fill all buy orders on the order book until all shares that need to be sold are sold, if I am correct. As such, the stock low price for the day is suddenly around $11 (for a brief moment). As this happens in an instant, the price of the stock from day-start to day-end is not impacted and the stock closes not far off from $14, as the market continues to submit buy and sell orders around the same point it was at before this momentary blip.\n\nIs this understanding of how that scenario would play out correct? Consequently, if one found a stock where on a semi-annual basis large market orders (either on the sell or buy side) took place and momentarily dipped the price, would it be a viable idea to place a limit order substantially below the current trading price and wait?

{"title": "I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.\n\nWhat I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.\n\n**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)\n\n**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies. Following is the split of recommendations. \n\n|Rating |\\# of records |% of total |\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Buy|35,158|52.9%|\n|Hold|27,033|40.6%|\n|Sell|4,041|6.1%|\n|Others (Cautious, Speculative etc.)|284|0.4%|\n\n For the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.\n\na. One week after recommendation\n\nb. One month after recommendation\n\nc. One quarter after recommendation\n\nI benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade.\n\n**Results:**\n\n**Performance of Buy Recommendations** \n\n|Avg Change in Price|Stock|SPY|Change over SPY|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|One Week|0.5%|0.3%|\\+40.7%|\n|One Month|1.7%|1.4%|\\+23.2%|\n|One Quarter|4.9%|4.0%|\\+22.8%|\n\n Out of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods were better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analyst made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. \n\n**Performance of Sell Recommendations:**\n\n|Avg Change in Price|Stock|SPY|Change over SPY|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|One Week|0.3%|0.3%|\\-7.3%|\n|One Month|1.8%|1.5%|\\+17.1%|\n|One Quarter|5.4%|4.0%|\\+36.0%|\n\nSell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative) \n\n **Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:** \n\nyou can find the chart [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mznidl/oc_i_analyzed_66000_buy_and_sell_recommendations/)  \n\nI analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley with them making more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains.\n\n**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?**\n\nI did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:**\n\nThe above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks faired.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There has been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of asset you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!\n\nExcel Sheet link containing all the recommendations and more detailed analysis: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Hd6xU4B4p0PmlpV3JULmChU1JQTVkOR/view?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to any investment banks showcased above.*", "id": "mznup5", "created_utc": 1619528230.0, "score": 4646, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 220, "comments": [{"body": "Need an index based on these, weighted on how often each analyst is correct.

So, I just ran a (very) quick & dirty linear regression analysis on the SPY-corrected difference in stock price between baseline and twelve weeks after the recommendation for a subset of the dataset (I only included straight \"Buy\", \"Sell\" or \"Hold\" advices, and excluded the rest, resulting in \\~25.000 advices to still be included). And found no significant association between the recommendation (Buy, Hold or Sell) and the corrected price difference over 12 weeks (Weight of -2.88e-3 and 6.97e-5 with a *p*\\-value of 0.114 and 0.985 respectively for Hold and Sell recommendations, with Buy for reference at intercept 1.01). \n\nThen I decided to \"rate the ratings\" and see if the recommendations were correlated with twelve week price differences. For simplicity I rated the recommendations \"good advice\" and \"bad advice\". Good advice is defined as either a \"Sell\" recommendation combined with a price decrease twelve weeks later (corrected for SPY) or a \"Hold\" or \"Buy\" recommendation combined with a price increase after twelve weeks. A recommendation to sell combined with a price increase OR a recommendation to Hold or Buy combined with a stable price or a decreasing price are all considered bad advice. I didn't run any statistics on this, but based on the numbers you can see that there's about a 50-50 chance the recommendation is either good advice or bad:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Good advice|Bad advice|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Buy|9119|8515|\n|Hold|3032|3033|\n|Sell|583|600|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo basically based on this analysis (which is far from perfect, again: I only did a quick and dirty analysis without being concerned too much about any misshapes in the data and what not + only included \\~25.000 out of the \\~66.000 cases + did not correct for confounders such as year/month of recommendation, which firm gave the recommendation, etc.) I found no association between recommendations and twelve week price difference twelve weeks later.\n\nNow if I can find the time I'm gonna put some more thought in this analysis. A lot of improvements can be made. First of all the inclusion of more recommendations should good. Secondly, you can argue whether you should correct for SPY, because this is only fair if you're looking for stocks that outperform the market. Basically a \"hold\" advice for a stock that will still increase, albeit not as much as the rest of the market, is not really \"bad advice\", since you don't lose any money in that case. Also, I would like to include confounders such as year when the advice was given (not every bookyear shows the same increase/decrease in stock prices overall, although the fact that I corrected for SPY here could also correct stock price for year-on-year market fluctuations. Still, not including the year or even month that the recommendation was given in the analysis as a confounder is an assumption that correcting for SPY will solve this issue, and every assumption is a risk.)

However many older and smaller nuke plants have already been killed by reduced sale pricing from increased gas and renewables penetration. Nuke plants are even more allergic to low CF that cool/gas are as nukes have high capital costs but ultra low variable costs. A key driver for how long they last will be whether carbon is priced - if it is then coal and gas will be killed off first while the nukes stick around, if it isn't then we'll retire carbon-free nukes while continuing to burn gas and coal.\n\nNote I would not advocate building any new nuclear basically because the LCOE is already uncompetitive even without Tony's predictions on reducing CF, But I absolutely hate the idea of retiring existing nukes (especially newer and safer ones) while continuing to operate (or build new!) coal.

This could generate decent revenue during peak usage times, but there could be times when there's lots of power and prices drop to almost nothing.\n\nIf your powerwall (and most other people's are) full and the sun is out and prices are super cheap, it could make more sense to use the electricity yourself if you can generate some money doing hashes. Let's say Tesla could add a cheap ASIC to each powerwall for $2k, that would generate maybe $500/month if it was on all the time. But if it's only on 10% of the time, it would pay for itself in 4 years. Which is decent, about the same payback period as a lot of solar installs. So, not really worth the extra effort at those prices.\n\nBut if Tesla is installing hundreds of thousands of them, and if powerwalls already have a lot of the hardware a miner needs (power, cooling, internet, etc.) maybe Tesla can get the price down to less than $1k for a similar hashrate? Maybe they even develop their own chips to save on costs? If they're really looking out 10+ years at operating massive distributed power generation, then being able to set a price floor by mining bitcoin could make a lot of sense?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well I was wondering if it could actually leverage the “ps5 equivalent entertainment solution” in the new S or X models or could it just rely on cloud computing with something like dojo but I guess that wouldn’t be using your local power (or could you?..)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You could do it while plugged in at night.

Its users link content created elsewhere, effectively siphoning value from  \nother sources via its users.\n2. Its users create new content specifically for it, thus profiting of off the  \nfree labour and content made by its users\n\nThis means that Reddit creates no value but exploits its users to generate the  \nvalue that uses to sell advertisements, charge its users for meaningless tokens,  \nsell NFTs, and seek private investment. Reddit relies on volunteer moderation by  \npeople who receive no benefit, not thanks, and definitely no pay. Reddit is  \nprofiting entirely off all of its users doing all of the work from gathering  \nlinks, to making comments, to moderating everything, all for free. Reddit is\nalso going to sell your information, you data, your content to third party AI\ncompanies so that they can train their models on your work, your life, your\ncontent and Reddit can make money from it, all while you see nothing in return.\n\n## Lack of respect for its third party developers\n\nI'm sure everyone at this point is familiar with the API changes putting many  \nthird party application developers out of business. Reddit saw how much money  \nentities like OpenAI and other data scraping firms are making and wants a slice  \nof that pie, and doesn't care who it tramples on in the process. Third party  \ndevelopers have created tools that make the use of Reddit far more appealing and  \nfeasible for so many people, again freely creating value for the company, and  \nit doesn't care that it's killing off these initiatives in order to take some of  \nthe profits it thinks it's entitled to.\n\n## Lack of respect for other cultures\n\nReddit spreads and enforces right wing, libertarian, US values, morals, and  \nethics, forcing other cultures to abandon their own values and adopt American  \nones if they wish to provide free labour and content to a for profit American  \ncorporation. American cultural hegemony is ever present and only made worse by  \ncompanies like Reddit actively forcing their values and social mores upon  \nforeign cultures without any sensitivity or care for local values and customs.  \nMeanwhile they allow reprehensible ideologies to spread through their network  \nunchecked because, while other nations might make such hate and bigotry illegal,  \nReddit holds \"Free Speech\" in the highest regard, but only so long as it doesn't  \noffend their own American sensibilities.\n\n## Lack for respect for the truth\n\nReddit has long been associated with disinformation, conspiracy theories,  \nastroturfing, and many such targeted attacks against the truth. Again protected  \nunder a veil of \"Free Speech\", these harmful lies spread far and wide using  \nReddit as a base. Reddit allows whole deranged communities and power-mad  \nmoderators to enforce their own twisted world-views, allowing them to silence  \ndissenting voices who oppose the radical, and often bigoted, vitriol spewed by  \nthose who fear leaving their own bubbles of conformity and isolation.\n\n## Lack of respect for common decency\n\nReddit is full of hate and bigotry. Many subreddits contain casual exclusion,  \ndiscrimination, insults, homophobia, transphobia, racism, anti-semitism,  \ncolonialism, imperialism, American exceptionalism, and just general edgy hatred.  \nReddit is toxic, it creates, incentivises, and profits off of \"engagement\" and  \n\"high arousal emotions\" which is a polite way of saying \"shouting matches\" and  \n\"fear and hatred\".\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf not for ideological reasons then at least leave Reddit for personal ones. Do  \nYou enjoy endlessly scrolling Reddit? Does constantly refreshing your feed bring  \nyou any joy or pleasure? Does getting into meaningless internet arguments with  \nstrangers on the internet improve your life? Quit Reddit, if only for a few  \nweeks, and see if it improves your life.\n\nI am leaving Reddit for good.

If not one of the leading competitors, they would have gone out of business long ago.\n\nTherefore, this only leaves a possibility that at the time of manufacture prior to releasing these new lines, the cocoa Futures Market is heavily inflated, which leads to a lower supply of cocoa than anticipated for the actual cookie. Since Nabisco plans batches ahead of time, they are likely left with a huge amount of stuffing ingredienrs (double the amount in fact) compared to cookies, and use this as an advantage to appear as if they are innovating with more stuffing in each cookie. \n\nThe cocoa market is surprisingly volatile, as there are few sources from which it can be found and whenever One Source runs out of supply, many customers flock to the remaining sources to get what they need. In some ways the cocoa market likely holds up our economy; I don't necessarily know how other than the possibility of Valentine's Day and other holidays bringing in much revenue for the overall GDP but my point is this...\n\nTLDR: Nabisco stuffing their Oreo cookies too much comes from a cocoa shortage, which is driven by market corrections and market crashes.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't play with ICE ag futures products but they can definitely get funky when there's a shortage.\n\nTinfoil hat aside people like the standard size the best and the double stuff has been around for 50 years.

{"title": "MNMD Starter Due Diligence", "selftext": "Alright so you've obviously heard the craze by now about psych stocks and I'm sure a lot of it has been gain porn and fat stacks. If MNMD's poor up-listing performance today didn't turn you off, here is some DD that will hopefully give you a better idea of what the company does. Plenty of people seem to think that MNMD is going to be selling tabs of acid and caps of mush to folks, but that's just not it. Take a look at whats below if you're interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Psych Sector Quick Overview**\n\nAt the moment, there are (I think) 28 publicly traded companies in the sector. They are pretty much all penny stocks, except for Compass and Mind Med. This is a nascent sector and most likely an extended play given the time it takes for the drugs to come to market. Basically the sector can be divided into three main groups: **1) Drug Developers**, **2) Clinic companies**, and **3) Recreational Companies**. Many companies blend these different categories but the one we are looking at today is predominantly in the drug development space. The drugs they are working on can be classified into two distinct categories: **1) Classical psychedelic compounds** (Psilocybin, LSD, DMT, etc.) and **2) Novel psychedelic compounds** (Derivatives and Novel Formulations). MindMed is focused on developing a blend of these two. There's an incredible wealth of research that has gone into these substances and how they are presumed to be far more effective than traditional therapy options in treating a variety of psychological disorders and ailments. In fact, **Ketamine is already being used** in assisted therapy in many places around the world. The sector had quite the run last fall and early into the new year. Looking like there might be another run based on a couple of big-name catalysts in the coming weeks. Because of the volatility and anecdotal hype, plenty of people have likened the sector to weed. But anyone who has felt the benefits of these drugs knows it's not the same. Sure, most of the companies are going to fail, and many don't have a lot to offer at all. However, MindMed is one of the biggest names, with the biggest backers and the most expansive drug pipelines, so it's nice to think they are in a league of their own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mind Medicine:**\n\nTo get us started, their mission statement: “MindMed’s mission is to **discovery, development, and deploy** psychedelic inspired medicines and therapies intended to treat diseases in the areas of **psychiatry**, **neurology**, **addiction**, **pain**, and potentially others such as **anxiety disorders**, **substance use disorders** and **withdrawal**, and **adult attention deficit disorder**.”\n\nThe company breaks its process down into three parts that I’ll preface here so that you can reference them as you read through:\n\n* ***Discover:*** This is where new compounds are being discovered, formulated, and tested in pre-clinical settings. Making sure things are safe and effective.\n* ***Develop:*** Where the clinical trials start-up and the big money is spent.\n* ***Deploy:*** Commercialization, distribution, scaling, access; the business side of things.\n\nWill touch more on these different stages and what they have going on further down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***MindMed: Financials and Company***\n\nDrug development is crazy expensive, and MindMed has taken the opportunity many times to raise capital to finance its growth and development over the last year. Investors have complained quite a lot about it over the previous year, but it’s a reality we’re just going to have to deal with. Also, on this note, keep an eye out for up to CAD $500 million to be raised over the next two years; the base shelf prospectus has been filed and will be effective in the near future. \\*Sorry, I really don’t feel like doing all to currency conversions between USD and CAD.\\*\n\n***Funding –***\n\n* *Total Funding:* As of March 30, 2021, MindMed had a **cash balance of $203 Million (All in CAD)**\n* Tranche 2: February 18, 2020 MindMed completes second tranche for **$9,227,000 CAD**\n* Tranche 3: February 26, 2020 MindMed completes third tranche for **$10,252,000 CAD**\n* Offering 1: May 26, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal financing for **$9,582,000 CAD**\n* Offering 2: October 30, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal for **$28,751,000 CAD**\n* Offering 3: December 11, 2020 MindMed completes bought deal for **$34,523,000 CAD**\n* Offering 4: January 7, 2021 MindMed completes bought deal for **$92,100,000 CAD**\n* Offering 5: March 8, 2021 MindMed complete private financing deal for **$19,500,000 CAD**\n\n**Base Shelf Prospectus:** On April 9th, 2021, MindMed filed their final short form prospectus, pretty much laying out a way for them to more easily ***raise up to $500 million (CANADIAN) whenever market conditions are optimal for the next 25 months.*** *So be on the lookout for some pretty decent money-raising when/if the share price is looking crispy*\n\nMindMed has never shied away from milking the pockets of eager investors; nor should they. The consistent interest from investors is a great sign; it's not as if people are scared of throwing their money into this company.\n\nMindMed **burned through $24.2 million** CAD in 2020. **Total comprehensive loss** for the year of 2020 was **$35.1 million** but was offset by like $8 million.\n\n***Expenses –***\n\nOne of MindMed’s recent filings laid out how they intend to allocate their funding over the next year or two reasonably well. If you’re looking for this kind of information, you can find the MD&A filing on SEDAR. They also lay out how they anticipate allocating funding from specific offerings to specific programs. It’s a lot of information, but I’m not going to include it here. Quite a few of MindMed’s acquisitions have been predominantly made via the offering of shares, so they haven’t had the same level of cash burning as some of the other emerging companies in the sector. For example:\n\n* **55 Million Class A shares were offered for their 18-MC program**\n* **81,833 Multiple Voting Shares** (8,183,300 equivalent) were **issued to acquire Health Mode** (plus a cash payment of $286,000)\n\n***Fair Value of Common Shares:*** Haven’t been able to find any estimates or projections. If you know of any, just send a message, and this will be updated. The recent offering prices and warrant exercise prices might give you an idea of what investors have been willing to pay for the issued shares. Will put those below. Also, the up-listing today saw some tremendous volatility and the stock reaching all time highs. (RIP to the fella who bought for over $8 USD premarket lol)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Offering Close Date**|**Unit Price**|**Warrant Symbol**|**Exercise Price / Date**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|***May 26, 2020***|**$0.53 CAD**|**(MindMed).WT**|**$0.79 CAD – May 26, 2022**|\n|***October 30, 2020***|**$1.05 CAD**|**(MindMed).WS**|**$1.40 CAD – October 30, 2023**|\n|***December 11, 2020***|**$1.90 CAD**|**(MindMed).WA**|**$2.45 CAD – December 11, 2023**|\n|***January 7, 2021***|**$4.40 CAD**|**(MindMed).WR**|**$5.75 CAD – January 7, 2024**|\n|***March 8, 2021 (Private)***|**$3.25 CAD**|**N/A**|**$4.40 CAD – March 9, 2024**|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Company and Investments –***\n\nTo build the company MNMD has focused on acquiring compounds, partnering with labs, and acquisitions. The partnerships they have with labs for R&D are reputable academic institutions that MindMed has agreed to help fund. In turn, MindMed has exclusive access to trials, data, and discoveries. The chart below is taken from their filings hopefully, it gives you a sufficient idea of what the companies structure is looking like.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ctohyh20sv61.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=a37d60137e163a5e925fffdf9f51a97049bd849f\n\n**MindMed: Pipeline**\n\nMindMed has a pretty comprehensive pipeline of drugs they are developing. This pipeline has started to expand more due to their partnerships and acquisitions. Through their partnerships with labs, universities, and researchers, MindMed has exclusive licenses, including DMT, MDMA, LSD, Psilocybin. There are currently **four trials going on at University Hospital Basel**, and **13 have already been completed** giving MindMed some very valuable data to help push their approvals and research along with faster than they otherwise could have. Here’s an overview of their programs, compounds, and trials, along with their stage of development.\n\n***Discover:***\n\n* April 2020, MindMed signed a nice **exclusive collaboration deal with** **University Hospital Basel’s Liechti Lab** (some of the most prolific psychedelic researchers). All IP, trial data, and tech that’s developed here are MindMed’s for the foreseeable future. This originally only gave them **access to LSD trials** and data, but they’ve since upped their game and expanded the deal to include trials and data on **MDMA, DMT, MDMA-LSD (candy flipping), and Psilocybin**. Any solid discoveries or advancements will be integrated into MindMed’s pipeline. For example, MindMed already gained data from an ongoing **P2 LSD-Anxiety trial from UHB.**\n* February 11, 2021,  **MindMed announced a partnership with MindShift** out of Switzerland. This partnership is **focused more on developing novel psychedelic compounds** to add to their pipeline. This has been a huge trend in the sector. Companies are trying to modify the compounds to be more conducive to the therapeutic process. Lots of talks have been had around **taking the “trip” out of the trip**. They are basically allowing people to feel **the benefits without hallucinating**. Their CEO said some **compounds have already been identified** for development, but there’s not much on what exactly these secret compounds are. However, patents have apparently been filed over these compounds, so if any of you sleuths can find them, it would be much appreciated.\n\n***Develop:***\n\n* Once psychedelic compounds are identified, they’ll move onto this stage. As of now MindMed has a couple big ones in the works which you’ll be able to find more details on in the chart below. The trials of focus right now investigating 18-MC and LSD for different purposes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Company / Partner**|**Compound**|**Disorder / Purpose**|**Progress / Stage**|**Rights / IP / Data**|**Market Competition**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|MindMed (Project Layla)|18-MC (ibogaine derivative)|Opioid Use Disorder, Withdrawal, and Potentially Other Addictions|P2a (Q3 2021)  P3 (**at the earliest** **2023)**|Provisional patent filings (MindMed Assignee)|Company focused on developing other Ibogaine derivatives.|\n|MindMed (Project Lucy)|LSD|Anxiety|P2b (Second half of 2021)|UHB Data|Many companies in the sector are focused on treating anxiety|\n|MindMed (UHB)|Ketanserin|Psychedelic Antagonist (The Naloxone of Psychs)|P1 (ongoing)|MindMed + UHB have filed a patent application preserving worldwide rights|Benzos have been used to kill trips.|\n|MindMed (UHB)|LSD|LSD Cluster Headaches|P2 (ongoing)|UHB Data and Rights|Some other headache type trials going on, but not as far along|\n|MindMed (Project Flow)|LSD|Adult ADD|P2a (approval granted Q3 2021)|UHB Data and Rights|No ongoing trials in other companies investigating this|\n|MindMed|LSD|Microdosing (focus, creativity, mood, anxiety)|(Starting soon)|Honestly don't know|First ever P2a clinical trial for microdosing LSD.

However, they are the assignee of a family of patents in the US, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand for psychotherapy using **3-MMC**. The disorders it covers are distress, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder. A lot of other MindMed IP is being held as trade secrets for the time being, so there’s not a lot to say about it at the moment other than they are expanding their pipeline significantly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**MindMed: Partnerships and Technology**\n\nAlright, so now that we have all the major trials and compounds pretty much covered, the third part of the MindMed process is the ***deploy*** phase. This is where their technology projects and other partnerships come into play. The chart below should give you a decent overview of the three biggest developments to come out of MindMed in this front.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|**Partner/Project**|**Purpose**|\n|:-|:-|\n|Project Albert|JR (CEO) has been stressing the importance of *Project Albert* for some time now. He has repeatedly emphasized that MindMed is a drug development *and* technology company. *Project Albert* is based on designing and integrating digital therapeutic tools into the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy process. They’re looking to integrate wearables, tracking, platforms, and other tools into the therapy process so that it can be more patient-personalized, effective, and informative. They’re also hoping that this part of the company improves the access people have to these medications through telemedicine.|\n|MindMed + HealthMode|MindMed added HealthMode to the company to expand *Project Albert*. Using AI, MindMed aims to help speed up the clinical research process and improve patient monitoring efforts. MindMed took on HealthMode’s entire team and portfolio and will begin to integrate what they have into the trails being developed as well as future patient monitoring platforms.|\n|NYU Langone|MindMed is now funding a program at NYU Langone Health to train and prepare the future psychedelic researchers and psychiatrists for the future when these drugs come to market. This isn’t so much a revenue-generating project as it will benefit the sector at large by having professionals prepared to deliver these therapies.|\n|MindShift Compounds AG|I know I touched on this briefly earlier, but the MindShift partnership is where MindMed will gain access to second-generation psychedelic compounds. We all know about the classical psychedelic compounds (LSD, Psilocybin, MDMA, DMT, etc.); second-gen compounds are being tailored specifically for different therapeutic purposes allowing companies to engineer more effective and, in some cases, safer compounds. Tons of companies are going down this path, so it’s good to have this partnership to add to the portfolio.|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully that helps some of you out and get you familiar with MNMD. Below this is information on the compounds and trials that MNMD is pursuing. If you aren't interested in a bit of science feel free to cut it off here. If you are, keep reading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Information on Compounds and Trials :**\n\nSections in Order:\n\n1. **LSD Neutralizer**\n2. **Cluster Headaches**\n3. **LSD for Adult ADHD/ADD**\n4. **LSD for Anxiety**\n5. **18-MC for Addiction**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***LSD Neutralizer***\n\nAs I’m sure a lot of you know, LSD trips last a while. When we are looking at LSD as a compound to be used in assisted therapies, that trip duration brings up some major question marks.\n\n1. Assisted therapies require trained professionals to guide the sessions. Therapy sessions aren’t cheap; the cost of therapy alone is a major barrier for many people seeking out mental health support. Couple the cost of the compounds and the specialization required for extended psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy sessions and you have a recipe for some potentially pricey treatments.\n2. LSD is not toxic to the human body. You don’t see the same type of physiological or neurotoxic potential that traditional drugs have. However, that does not mean we’re home free here. It’s important to recognize that LSD does have some potential health harms that we should all be aware of. Improper use can lead to potential physical harm. Bad trips can lead to emotional distress. If you don’t screen for underlying psychological conditions like psychosis and schizophrenia some people can experience serious cognitive harms.\n\nThis neutralizer technology is purported to act as an off switch for LSD trips. Quick pill and a little while later the trip is over. This funky little compound is called **Ketanserin** and it’s a major part of dealing with the two issues I mentioned above. If you’re able to control and attenuate the trip, you’re able to reduce the time needed to conduct the therapy session. This can reduce costs related to therapy  making it more affordable for a greater number of people. In theory, it could also allow people to take higher single doses, should the therapy demand it, and have the effects neutralized when needed.\n\nNow onto the harms… Luckily for all of us, the harms mentioned above can be managed/mitigated. Proper psychological screening can work out issues related to underlying conditions. Managing set and setting helps reduce the potential for harms related to improper use like stupid behavior and bad trips. This LSD neutralizer is just another great tool in the therapist's tool belt that can be used to mitigate harm during therapy. Being able to stop the experience allows for a failsafe on the therapy sessions which ensures that no one comes out of it worse than they went in. As an add-value, this compound could be sold to recreational users (in theory) to ensure safe at-home use and could also be used in ER departments where occasionally, I'm sure some people come in experiencing bad trips.\n\nCool beans, so how does it work? Well, let me use a quick analogy to get the ball rolling.\n\nWe are all aware of opioids and how people can easily overdose on them. Guaranteed many of you have also heard of Naloxone, the antidote for an opioid overdose. Think of Kertanserin as you would think of Naloxone.\n\nNaloxone and Kertanserin are both antagonists that act against the effects of their respective counterparts. Opioids produce their effects by interacting with the four opioid receptors we all have in our brains. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that works by binding to those receptors and knocking the opioids off of the receptors for a duration of time; allowing for people to seek the additional help that they need. [Source here](https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/understanding-naloxone/) (If you’re in Canada, go to the pharmacy and get a free Naloxone kit.. you could save a life)\n\nThis brings us to Kertanserin and LSD. The psychedelic effects of LSD have been theorized to produce their effects through partial serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism. (Agonism being the opposite of Antagonism) Kertanserin works as an antagonist to the same receptor, allowing for the effects of LSD to be attenuated. [Here is a study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-017-4610-0) that substantiates the claim that Kertanserin fully blocks the subjective effects of LSD. [Here is another one](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.12.030)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Cluster Headaches***\n\nYeah, you get headaches, but do you get cluster headaches? I sure hope not. If you do, oh boy does MNMD have the treatment for you. Cluster headaches multiple short, debilitating headaches that can occur repeatedly for expended durations of time. Cluster headaches can go away for a while and then spring back up on you years later. They don’t affect many people [(\\~0.1%)](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/188/3/217.3.full.pdf) and there isn’t a lot of information out there on what causes them. Regardless, they are painful and people shouldn’t have to deal with it if they don’t have to.\n\nTraditional treatments for cluster headaches include oxygen and sumatriptan for single attacks; and verapamil, lithium, corticosteroids, and more for cluster [attack periods.](https://doi.org/10.1177/0333102410363490) However, anecdotal evidence has suggested that LSD and Psilocybin are both more effective in dealing with individual attacks and attack periods.\n\n[One study](https://ck-wissen.de/ckwiki/images/1/14/IHS_IHC_2009_BOL_Halpern.pdf) using a non-hallucinogenic analog of LSD, 2-Bromo-LSD (BOL), found that three single doses of BOL can either break a series of cluster headache attacks or reduce their frequency and intensity. Furthermore, for some, BOL allowed them to achieve remission from their previous chronic cluster headaches. No adverse outcomes were observed in the study. The interesting thing about this study is that the researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of action is unrelated to the serotonin receptor agonism that scientists are theorizing is responsible for hallucinations. This means that it isn’t so much about the hallucinations, but something else that these beautiful compounds have in store. They theorize that the positive effects are the result of serotonin-receptor-mediated *vasoconstriction*.\n\n[A very recent 2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13311-020-00962-y) study backs this up when evaluating the migraine suppressing effects of Psilocybin. The study found that ONE SMALL SINGLE DOSE of shroomies magic chemical, psilocybin, was far more effective than traditional treatments in dealing with migraines. Furthermore, the suppressing effects of the psilocybin on migraines were sustained over two weeks. Again, this study backs up the previous claim that the effects are independent of the hallucinogenic properties of the drugs.\n\nThe current phase 2 study going on at UHB in Switzerland [can be found here!](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03781128?term=LSD&cond=Cluster+Headache&draw=1&rank=1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***LSD – For Adult ADHD***\n\nStimulants suck for a lot of people who had ADD/ADHD. They often kill your sex drive, they make you irritable, and they sometimes make you lose weight among many other things. Having a viable alternative is something many of us have dreamed of for a long while. I guarantee you’ve all heard the stories of Silicon Valley execs micro-dosing LSD to improve their productivity and creativity. Well, it looks like our ex-silicon valley CEO now wants to lay down some hard science on this practice.\n\nSo what does the anecdotal evidence say?\n\n[Study 1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02791072.2020.1761573?casa_token=FGgn9elCDA4AAAAA:P3_F-W3CDq-kHsfupA86zgGYB-guSujfCYtu-F3yHZ1IZOeYvNs3M9uwdWrt_HkQvEIqD4aPYtRW):\n\n* General effects have been described as “a really good day”.\n* 80% of people surveyed reported a positive or neutral experience.\n* The most common reason for stopping the micro-dosing regime was that people felt the practice was ineffectual.\n* Many patients reported positive impacts on depression and anxiety.\n* Some patients felt that micro-dosing long-term exacerbated their mental health issues.\\*\n* 69% person of surveyed college students who micro-dosed reported at least one negative side effects from the practice. The most common negative side effect was hallucinations (44.2%). (Maybe from inaccurate dosages?)\n* One other very common concern was the legality of the practice. (Gotta hate those stupid laws)\n* Multiple studies reported that people consistently felt great improvements in creativity.\n\n[Study 2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02791072.2019.1593561):\n\n* Many patients reported that they wanted to microdose for their diagnosed ADHD/self-diagnosed attention issues.\n* Most surveyed reported productivity increases and that they procrastinated less.\\*\n* This study proposes that despite LSD and Psilocybin acting on different neuroreceptors than traditional stimulants, that their effects could be positives because they are still stimulating drugs.\\*\n* A substantial amount those surveyed reported substituting micro-dosing for their stimulants.\n* Participants reported improvements in home life including a more giving, patient, and open attitude with family members.\n\n[Study 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00672/full):\n\n* The most prevalent mental disorder diagnoses in this study were depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and ADHD/ADD.\n* Microdosing was rated more effective than traditional treatment options for ADHD/ADD.\n* The study theorized that micro-dosing is often preferred because it doesn’t come with as many negative side effects.\n* Specifically for ADHD, micro-dosing did not come with the same crash that stimulants did.\n* An additional advantage was that there was not a need to microdose daily. Rather the psychedelic doses were taken every few days (usually).\n\n[Study 4](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881120953994?casa_token=LL80YSLkwSMAAAAA:YE-Nf67RFWcQKBHN6CDxKm_eJJQEQVpNoDudsrmGscL9AMU1vdW3rwXzpHN4EsTnzOehk_eQMhtK):\n\n* The most commonly reported effects of micro-dosing were improved mood and creativity.\n* A previous study found that participants performed significantly better on a divergent creativity task following a small dose of psilocybin.\n* A 2019 study found that the acute effects of a microdose of LSD were an increased feeling of vigor, friendliness, energy, and social benefit.\n* The most commonly reported challenge related to micro-dosing was reported to be “none” (lol)\n* Some challenges include impaired focus and physiological discomfort. These may be once again due to improper/high dosages.\n* Lack of precision in terms of the compound you are purchasing can also contribute to negative effects.\n\nIf you are wondering about the theorized mechanisms of actions and stuff I would recommend you check out [this study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881119857204). There is a lot to it, but you can sift through the section titles quickly. I would recommend reading Question 5, 6, 7, and 8. (Page 1043-1046)\n\nUltimately there isn’t much clinical evidence to back this one up. I’m glad MMED is taking the steps needed to address this gap in the literature. It will for sure be one that I am paying attention to. Consistent themes in the studies included some negative effects related to dosage. I think that a clinically dosed regime would resolve a lot of these issues especially if a determined dosage scale based on body weight, metabolism, and other factors was developed. However, one major concern I have is that there is anecdotal evidence of microdosing exacerabting underlying mental health issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LSD – For Anxiety**\n\nA lot of the current focus in terms of LSD and anxiety has been its use in palliative care. People who are faced with some pretty scary diseases have reported some great improvements in their condition after psychedelic experiences. Anxiety is a very very broad category of diagnosis. I won’t be able to cover them all here but I will list the 12 broad diagnosis possibilities the DSM-V gives us. The ones I focused my research on are bold.\n\n* Separation Anxiety Disorder\n* Selective Mutism\n* Specific Phobia\n* Social Anxiety Disorder\n* Panic Attack\n* Agoraphobia\n* **Generalized Anxiety Disorder**\n* Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder\n* **Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**\n* Other Specified Anxiety Disorder\n* Unspecified Anxiety Disorder\n\n[***Study 1***](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269881114555249?casa_token=J8Q8H2JouXYAAAAA:95_8VljUYfbiwXvmRWPb50WxwavksJhfR26xxtf8mSS1GIHYTDxR_V2rENfuYS5KOR1iHxilvy22)***: LSD-Assisted Psychotherapy for Anxiety Associated with a Life-Threatening Disease***\n\nThis study interviewed 10 participants who had undergone LSD-assisted psychotherapy to assist in dealing with their palliative-related anxiety. After 12 months the patients were interviewed and none of them reported any lasting adverse reactions or effects. 77.8% of patients reported a reduction in anxiety and 66.7% reported a rise in quality of life.\n\nIf you’re interested in reading about the first-hand accounts I would recommend reading more into this particular quallatative study. Some of the effects and stories are very profound.\n\n[***Study 2***](https://www.nature.com/articles/npp201786)***: Modern Clinical Research on LSD (Very Comprehensive)***\n\n*Mechanism of Action: (For the Science People)*\n\n* LSD potently binds to serotonin 5-HT receptors (1a, 2a, 2c), dopamine d2 receptor, and a2 adrenergic receptor.\n* The hallucinogenic effects are mediated by the drugs affinity for 5-HT2A receptors. This has been proven due to the ability to block these subjective effects using an antagonist (See the LSD Neutralizer).\n* The full scope of the mechanisms of actions has not been fully identified. However, one key mechanism is the activation of frontal cortex glutamate transmission.\n* LSD binds more potently to 5-HT2A receptors than does psilocybin.\n* Unlike other serotonergic hallucinogens, LSD binds to adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. In humans, LSD may enhance dopamine neurotransmission. (COOL)\n* LSD increases functional connectivity between various brain regions. (COOL)\n* Functional brain imaging showed more globally synchronized activity within the brain and a reduction of network separation while under the pharmacological effects of LSD.\n* LSD decreased default mode network integrity.\n* LSD reduced left amygdala reactivity to the presentation of fearful faces. (COOL)\n\n*Adverse Effects:*\n\n* Moderate increases in blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and pupil side.\n* Adverse effects 10-24 hours after administration include difficult concentration, headaches, dizziness, lack of appetite, dry mouth, nausea, imbalance, and exhaustion.\n* No severe side effects have been found and it is physically non-toxic.\n* Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) is a rare disorder stemming from psychedelic use. Occurs almost exclusively in illicit use or patients with underlying cognitive predispositions **like anxiety**. (Uh oh)\n\n*Effects on Patients:*\n\n* Profound anxiety or panic was not experienced by patients of one study.\n* LSD mainly induced blissful states, audiovisual synesthesia, changes in the meaning of perceptions, and positively experiences derealization and depersonalization.\n* At 200 micrograms, LSD acutely induced mystical experiences in patients undergoing psychotherapy. This is important because previous studies with psilocybin have shown that mystical experiences are correlated with improvements in mood and personality and **better therapeutic outcomes in patients with anxiety**, depression, and substance use disorders.\n* Music has been used to produce greater feelings of transcendence and wonder in patients.\n* LSD impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces and enhanced emotional empathy.\n* LSD produced moderate ego dissolution.\n* LSD produced lower fear perception which may be useful in psychotherapy.\n\n*Mid/Long Term Effects:*\n\n* The use of classical psychedelics is associated with lower psychological distress, lower suicidality, and lower mental health problems.\n* LSD in healthy subjects increase optimism and trait openness 2 weeks after administration and produced trends towards decreases in distress and delusional thinking.\n\nThere isn’t a ton of research on LSD for treating anxiety out there right now. You’re far more likely to find literature on psilocybin. This could be for a variety of reasons but regardless it is fantastic that MMED is again, researching to fill the gaps here. My biggest takeaways here are that LSD is showing some significant promise concerning treating anxiety. The effects that it has on the human brain make it a fantastic candidate for integration into therapy sessions. However, something that is often overlooked is the importance of the role of the therapist. I’ll have to look harder into what MMED is doing to develop therapeutic processes but like [Study 3](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1454576/FULLTEXT01.pdf) iterated, the relationship between the therapist and patient is imperative. Additionally, the patient needs to be equipped to deal with any adverse outcomes or reactions that could arise throughout the treatment. I think this part in particular bodes well for MMED since the LSD neutralizer is a fantastic way to ensure safety throughout the entire therapeutic process.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**18-MC – For Addiction**\n\nAhhh 18-MC, MMED’s promise child… Addiction is a bitch, there’s no doubt about that. The toll it has and continues to have on the world is horrible. Opioid overdoses are consistently increasing, alcohol dependence continues to destroy families and lives and cocaine abuse is no joke.\n\n[STATS](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf)\n\n1. 52 million people currently use opioids.\n2. Opioids are responsible for \\~2/3 substance abuse-related deaths.\n3. 11 million people inject some form of opioid on a daily basis.\n\nI could list all the addictions in the world but I’m sure you get the picture. It’s a serious issue, one that MMED seeks to resolve with 18-MC.\n\nBefore we look at 18-MC we have to talk about Ibogaine. [This study](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf) gives a great overview of Ibogaine but I’ll give you the summary here. Ibogaine is a psychoactive alkaloid that is found within the *Tabernanthe iboga* plant in West Africa. The plants' root bark can be consumed in both refined and crude forms, and in high doses can produce trance-like states with visual and auditory hallucinations. Ibogaine has been theorized as an effective natural treatment of substance use disorders.\n\nHow Ibogaine works on the human body and mind is still speculative. Ibogaine serves as an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist. This particular receptor is a molecular target for several abused drugs. [A previous study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816684/#:~:text=Glutamate%20plays%20a%20pivotal%20role,for%20several%20drugs%20of%20abuse.&text=These%20ligands%20include%20the%20NMDA,partial%20NMDA%20agonist%20d%2DCycloserine.) on NMDA receptor modulators found that agonism of these receptors has some limited benefit in treating drug addiction. However, without further study, the way it produces its anti-addictive effects are still in question. For all the science buffs out there, [this study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0077262) rules out one other mechanism of action of Iboga Alkaloids.\n\nIbogaine has previously been investigated as [a treatment for opioid use disorder](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf). A study in 1999 focused on ibogaine in the opioid detoxification process. Patients were treated using different doses of ibogaine based on bodyweight. 76% of the participants did not experience opioid withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours. Furthermore, they did not seek out their substances of choice for the three days they were under observation post-treatment. Another 12% of the patients did not experience withdrawal symptoms but still decided to resume drug abuse.\n\n[Another study](https://www.theibogainestudy.com/uploads/5/8/7/4/5874884/a_review_of_the_pharmacological_cultural_and_psychological_literature_on_ibogaine_.pdf) on individuals who sought out treatment for their opioid use disorder found that after 12 months, 75% of participating patients tested negative for opioid use. To back this up, a later study found that one month after treatment, 50% of patients reported no opioid use for the following 12 months.\n\nDespite this promise, Ibogaine has the potential to be a dangerous compound. There have been 19 documented fatalities from Ibogaine, one of which was under medical supervision. [Ibogaine induces body tremors](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Szumlinski/publication/227933445_Glick_SD_Maisonneuve_IM_Szumlinski_KK_18-Methoxycoronaridine_18-MC_and_ibogaine_comparison_of_antiaddictive_efficacy_toxicity_and_mechanisms_of_action_Ann_N_Y_Acad_Sci_914_369-386/links/5dfa3722a6fdcc28372907e6/Glick-SD-Maisonneuve-IM-Szumlinski-KK-18-Methoxycoronaridine-18-MC-and-ibogaine-comparison-of-antiaddictive-efficacy-toxicity-and-mechanisms-of-action-Ann-N-Y-Acad-Sci-914-369-386.pdf) at moderate doses. In high doses, Ibogaine is neurotoxic. Ibogaine also has the potential to decrease the human heart rate and impact blood pressure. These possible dangers served as the impetus of **Stanley Glick (Big Stud)** and colleagues to try and produce a safer synthetic iboga derivative. 18-MC is born\n\nSince 18-MC and Ibogaine are so closely related I’m going to pull from some more recent studies on both of them to give insight into the efficacy of these drugs on addiction.\n\n[This study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00952990.2017.1320802) found that the clinical effects of ibogaine on opioid withdrawal symptoms appeared to be comparable to those of methadone. In this particular study, 50% of patients reported no opioid use during the previous 30 days, 1-month post-treatment, and 33% reported no use in the previous 30 days at the 3-month mark. These rates of reduction in use were greater than those who had been treated with buprenorphine. Drug use scores were improved relative to pre-treatments and were (moderately) sustained over 12-months.\n\nIn one of Glick’s [early studies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karen_Szumlinski/publication/227933445_Glick_SD_Maisonneuve_IM_Szumlinski_KK_18-Methoxycoronaridine_18-MC_and_ibogaine_comparison_of_antiaddictive_efficacy_toxicity_and_mechanisms_of_action_Ann_N_Y_Acad_Sci_914_369-386/links/5dfa3722a6fdcc28372907e6/Glick-SD-Maisonneuve-IM-Szumlinski-KK-18-Methoxycoronaridine-18-MC-and-ibogaine-comparison-of-antiaddictive-efficacy-toxicity-and-mechanisms-of-action-Ann-N-Y-Acad-Sci-914-369-386.pdf) on 18-MC in rats, he and his colleagues found that it shared all the purported anti-addictive effects of Ibogaine. The advantage of 18-MC is that it is theorized to **not have the same hallucinogenic activity as Ibogaine** since it does not bind to serotonin receptors. Furthermore, it is **less toxic than Ibogaine both physiologically and neurologically**.\n\nIt is theorized that 18-MC will be able to assist in dealing with more than opioids, however. Alcohol, amphetamines, and cocaine have all been mentioned as possible substances of abuse that can be addressed.\n\nOne important thing to take out of all of this is that one of the studies found that abstinence from drug abuse lowered over time. This means that there is a potential for repeat treatments over time. Despite this, the frequency in which this would have to occur appears to be significantly less than current alternatives like methadone treatment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Mind Medicine is developing drugs to treat all your mental health needs.

MMDCF is ~$1.50/share.\n\nMMDCF has an exercise price ~$5.50. Translation: Buying one unit of MMDCF = buying the right to buy a share of MNMD for $5.50.\n\nSuppose you spend $15 today on MMED (3 shares) and $15 on MMDCF (10 shares). Time passes and MNMD reaches $10/share. Here's your profit margin:\n\n**MNMD:** $5 shares now worth $10 -> your 3 shares are worth $30  (**100% profit**, 2x orig investment)\n\n**MMDCF:** each warrant lets you buy a share worth $10 by paying $5.50 on top of your initial $1.50, for a total profit of $3. You don't actually have to lay out the cash to exercise; you can just sell the warrants to someone else. So your $1.50 shares are now worth $4.50 -> your 10 shares are worth $45 (**200% profit**, 3x orig investment)\n\nThe higher the share price ends up, the better the multiplier. And the lower you share price when you buy, the better the multiplier.\n\nSince options aren't currently available, warrants are the next-best thing, and probably the best thing outright if you're looking to invest for a year or longer.\n\nMMDCF is good.

I didn't mind that they were issuing shares to raise capital, because I figured they were going to use the opportunity provided them to make a big move to be able to come into reopening with a real jolt. Maybe a $PLAY acquisition or at the very least a partnership. Use the time to retool their operations to an all in one entertainment option of some sort instead of the tired old model of $20 movie tickets and overpriced chicken sandwiches.\n\nInstead, executive leadership used the money to hand themselves fat bonuses for \"saving\" the company when they literally didn't do anything but let the share price be elevated on sentimentality and meme status and act like they had something to do with it.\n\nThen they asked to issue even more shares. No vision. Just cashing in and using the company like an ATM.\n\nSo I voted no. Millions of times. Then spent a few days unwinding my position. The company is dead to me. I don't know why anybody would invest in them. They had an entire year to come up with ideas on how to grow their operations or make a move, and they literally just collected their paychecks and raided the company coffers.
