{"title": "I tried to predict the stock market every day in March. Here's how it went - and what I learned.", "selftext": "Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.\n\nI had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.\n\nTo celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.\n\nHere's the first one:\n\n**I can't predict the stock market.**\n\n*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.\n\nYou can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:\n\n* **Direction:** 65% correct\n* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%\n* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%\n\nI was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.\n\nPart of the problem was this:\n\n**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**\n\nWhen J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.\n\nI wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month\n\n[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)\n\nJ. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.\n\n**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**\n\nI've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: \"Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?\"\n\nOne thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.\n\nAAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.\n\nI saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: \"Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?\" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. \n\n**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**\n\nOne of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the \"bond yield\". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.\n\nIt never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.\n\nI'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:\n\n* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March\n* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.\n* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.\n* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech\n\n**... but sometimes it is.**\n\nThat doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.\n\nAnother huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.\n\nThis story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.\n\nPeople really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.\n\n**I still think the stock market can be predicted**\n\nWhen I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.\n\nThey probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.\n\nEverything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.\n\nIf you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.\n\n[You can see today's prediction here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/kHRAC)", "id": "mhvteb", "created_utc": 1617285307.0, "score": 5285, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 460, "comments": [{"body": "The variation of the prices of AAPL MSFT GOOG and AMZN are not explained by the movement of the nasdaq.

Instead closing>open would hopefully be your save if you never hit your target.\n\nOf course this also cant account for day like yesterday(?) where a strong spike in the closing minutes might have got you above open but you'd have to be waiting to pounce on it.\n\nAnyway, you had a great comment there and I enjoyed reading it.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Not a dumb question. The core issue with this is the part where you \"ignore how it opens\". You cannot ignore more recent data and still expect your endpoint to reflect what the probabilities were back when your older data *was* the most recent data. A simple example: I tell you that given that it rained yesterday there's a 40% chance based on historical data that it rains tomorrow. You go to sleep planning on not bringing an umbrella tomorrow. In the morning before you leave for work, you look outside and see it's overcast and gray outside. You cannot simply ignore that fact or say \"That's not a part of my predictive model\" because fundamentally, the chance of it raining today is now >40% (and this would be true even if your model ignored it by not looking outside).\n\nApplied to stonks, if I gave you nothing but the open and current price and asked you to predict a close, I guarantee your guesses would be more accurate later in the day. This is obvious because as time until close approaches 0, current price approaches close price -- my prediction 5 milliseconds before close will almost always be right, and that effect cannot be ignored.\n\nOkay now translate this into how you'd place orders. If you want to realize that 74% close>open probability, the ONLY way to do this is if the stock is green premarket, you place a buy order at 0930. You must do this every time its green premarket (no matter by how much) and not sell until 1559 in the afternoon, no exceptions. Doing anything else pulls you away from 74%, because now you're just refusing to look outside in the morning.\n\nTo capitalize on the intraday day dips, at 0930 you might send a trail stop for say, 0.25% above a dip. Here's the issue: every time this order executes, what it actually represents (in terms of whether it's a profitable) is the chance of a up close as a function of (1) the amount below open at which it executes (if NASDAQ is 10% down at execution, there is no longer a 74% percent chance it closes above open), (2) the time at which it executes (the probability of close > open was 74% at 0930, but if your order executes at 1400, it's no longer 74%), (3) a bunch of other factors inducing noise into the model that you'd probably want to account for. You can easily imagine cases where this loses you money over the guy that sent the market order at 0930:\n\n1. The price trends up all day long, your order never executes, while the 0930 market order shows a strong daily profit.\n\n2. The market hits an early high of +1.50%, then a dip down to +1.0% and your trail stop executes at +1.10%. The market then dips some and closes at +0.75%. You book a loss while the 0930 market order books a profit.\n\nThere would also be times when you come out ahead of the market order, but at the end of the day that's factored into part of the 26% of losing days. Meanwhile, those two examples I gave are part of the market order's 74% of winner days, that you missed out on. Fundamentally, what you're doing is making a buy/no-buy decision bases on many factors beyond what went into that 74% number, but acting like that 74% still represents your decision to buy or not. As soon as you deviate from the conditions under which that 74% was calculated, the probability that your buy/no-buy decision will realize deviates from 74% too.\n\nThere's so many factors that can potentially affect this decision that it's easy to see why many firms choose to go the machine learning route: it can intake hundreds of different variables and return you a buy/no-buy decision that's profitable without needing to \"look under the hood\" of what it's using to predict. Even this is fallible because you don't know the computer's reasoning, so humans may distrust it. Maybe one day in Fall 2007 the computer starts screaming at you to sell, and DJIA is still rising, do you actually sell? If not, you've acted based on factors beyond your model, and you'll lose big very soon and never realize the gains the model was supposed to net you.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Hey thanks for this post.

Obviously there is always a delay between news/events and share price, but eventually, and within a pretty short time-frame (as in your example), things almost always get priced in... sometimes it just take a minute (or...100) for everyone to make their moves. I 100% agree that you can get ahead of it (i.e. be one of the first to buy into a stock when they announce good news)... BUT I also think that also takes a significant amount of time, effort, and quick-wittedness to do this with a notable level of consistency. In fact, I would think there are probably some people who have software that analyzes news articles and immediately makes buys/sells based on sentiment analysis. There is an ETF ($AIEQ) which uses AI to determine when a stock us under/over valued and makes buys based on that algo... but it would be an interesting strategy to do the same with news articles instead of balance sheets. However, as is typically true with most strategies - if the strategy is successful, it won't be successful for long because someone else will copy it. EMH.\n\nAlso, I argue that what's priced in is not events/facts, but rather the **risk/odds of those facts/events occurring**. So for example, when a bill, say to outlaw gas cars, is introduced in the Senate and the market thinks it will have a 50% chance of passing, TSLA will not move, but when the first senator votes \"yes\", the price should become Previous\\_Value\\*Expected\\_EV\\_Revenue\\_Increase\\*(1/100) because there are 100 senators and now there is 1 yes vote vs 99 unknown votes.... Many times when things like this happen, stocks continue to go up for several hours or even days... but at t=0 **there is still risk.** If a $10 stock goes to $15 on good news, and then slowly continues upward to $18 on that same news, there is still risk that the stock is overhyped... the market is continuously evaluating this fact. When the stock hits $18, it could just as easily fall back to $15 when a large investor realizes the stock is overvalued - and then smaller investors may decide that because the big investor sold, there is now more perceived **risk of a retail-led sell-off** and so it would be rational to sell at $15, even though they bought at $16 two hours ago. The reason why it took so long to increase from $15 to $18 was because as the price increased, the market was saying there is an increasing chance of a reversal - which is intensified when a large investor closes a large position and therefore is at risk of initiating a large reversal.   \n\n\nTL;DR risk is everywhere and in all things.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Will you do it again to see if your predictions become more accurate?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I did this in March 2020 much more volatility is way more fun I gambled with about 30k I walked away with 140k by November before election.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The largest component of the nasdaq is extremely large tech companies.

{"title": "Not a bull, not a bear. How I see things right now.", "selftext": "*\\[This was a response to another commenter that I felt like could generate some good discussion. As I will mention a couple of times below, I'm new to investing, so consider this me working through my ideas and please do not take it as financial advice or the absolute truth of things.\\]*\n\nSo - I don't really love the bull case \"Omg new paradigm, low interest rates, never bet against the USA!\", nor the bear case (predicted 20 of the last 5 recessions). TBH to me it just seems like nobody can ever truly know... imperfect information and what not.\n\nI'm totally new to investing, but I did get my degree in economics. The market is definitely running hot right now, but then again, we can kind of afford it at the moment with all the easy money - the Fed is printing money precisely so that markets are more liquid. This is expected. We're also not totally detached from the fundamentals like we were with the dot com bubble. I mean, MSFT at 32 P/E ratio makes sense taking into account future earnings. You could say it makes sense for most of the S+P.\n\nThe problem is that it has to stop at some point. I mean, future earnings could account for the kind of P/Es we have now, but when we start reaching into 40,50, 60... then you're really getting detached from any sort of fundamentals. The other thing to look at is how much leverage is being used. [Right now, it's a lot.](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2021/03/17/margin-debt-and-the-market-up-another-1-9-in-february-continues-record-trend)\n\nBut again, that's to be expected because borrowing is so cheap right now. This is what the Fed wants. The Fed wants people to borrow, spend, invest, etc. Keep the wheels of the economy spinning.\n\nBut everything has limits. At some point the Fed has to pump the brakes on this. They say that's what they will do. But as unemployment is still high and inflation is still below target, they're not there yet.\n\nThat raises a couple of questions for me:\n\n1. Will they actually pump the brakes when its time? Or will they continue to keep interest rates low in order to monetize US debt? Low interest rates means it's easier for the US government to pay back its debt. In theory, the Fed is independent of the US government. I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist so I do believe the Fed will act independently to raise rates when the time is right. But it's still something we won't know for sure until they actually do it. And there's also a question of *when*. I'm worried that things get too far ahead of fundamentals... ie, the easy money becomes too easy and the Fed loses control of the ship before it is able to act.\n2. When they do start pumping the brakes, how will the markets react? It was actually the Bank of Japan trying to slowly put out the speculation fire (by raising rates) that caused the Japan asset bubble to crash, leading to the Lost Decade. There's a real concern, IMO, that the markets cannot sustain these valuations without the Fed's support. As soon as the Fed steps in, people might fear the party is over, panic sets in, and we crash.\n\nSo, what am I doing given all this uncertainty? I'm going for a middle-ground solution. I've got about half of my portfolio in a target retirement fund (various index funds) that I've been adding to for a few years, and I've got the other half in individual stocks that are either good, reliable businesses or very defensive stocks. Some are mining stocks in the event of inflation. I'm also holding some dry powder as well as some inflation protected bonds as another place to dump money that isn't cash.\n\nBasically I'm playing the middle ground. If things go well, I will be able to ride the momentum. Not as well as everybody who is 100% in VOO, or 100% in winning tech stocks if they do rally and continue to do so. But I'll still do decently.\n\nIf things go poorly, I'll lose more than someone who was 100% defensive or purely in cash, obviously. But I'll also do a whole lot better than anyone who was 100% VOO or 100% tech.\n\nI'm new to investing so take all of this with a grain of salt. Do your own research. But I think my econ degree, plus all of the research I've been doing the past 2 months or so, has given me some level of understanding of how things tend to work. I think my plan is appropriate given the uncertainty right now as well as my risk tolerance (which is not too high).", "id": "mi8017", "created_utc": 1617320227.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "Opinions are like assholes, everyone’s got one", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": ">Opinions are like assholes\n\nI try to break apart as many as possible.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Username checks out", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "lmao, tbh there so many people trying to predict or explain how the market works that it makes me stay off reddit sometimes😂", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Well since we're all trying to put our hard-earned money somewhere, I think it makes sense to have a general notion of what you're doing and why, no?\n\nAs I said, I was just sharing the way I see things.

It's not a \"both sides are the same thing\". There's lots of people in every Tesla sub and forum who are critical of Tesla. Tesla misses deadlines or someone has bad customer service or gets a car with uneven panel gaps or they're just critical of the performance of FSD or something. There's lots of discussions around topics that aren't just constant praise for Tesla.\n\nTesla is doing *amazing*, so we should expect to see lots of positive stories. And if someone is constantly negative about everything they do, they should expect pushback. Reality isn't neutral, Tesla isn't an average company that's doing average, so we shouldn't expect all the news and discussion to be neutral with equal views on both sides.\n\n> That's why I like sub to the r/RealTesla lot too - just to see if they ever have any valid points.\n\nI used to do that too, and realized that they've had essentially zero good points that weren't already highly publicized elsewhere. When Tesla screws up it's well known and gets lots of links and views in this sub and on the news and every automotive blog and twitter account on the planet.

Take that away and all \"RealTesla\" has left is constantly trying to put negative spin on neutral and good news.\n\nSomeone crossposted a thread from RealTesla here a couple weeks ago and I ended up commenting over there for the first time in years (I'd honestly thought they'd shut it down at some point), and I was just shocked at how little since everyone was making.

{"title": "CVS is incredibly undervalued", "selftext": "Hopefully most of you are getting your vaccine and you’re thinking about how important your health is. Now I may be called a boomer with this pick I can promise you I’m not. CVS Health is the largest healthcare company in the US with about the 4th/5th largest amount of revenue of all companies. They are projected to earn about $7.50 this year and over $8 next year which at the current price of $75 in insanely cheap in a market seeing the overall market trading at ~25x earnings.\n\nWhy is so cheap you may ask? Well I’d argue it’s for two reasons 1) Constant fear around Amazon 2) Concern they paid too much for Aetna a few years back. People always fear the unknown and it’s usually from a place of misunderstanding. Let’s take Amazon first. Amazon awhile back said they were going to get into Healthcare and formed a venture with Berkshire and JPM called Haven. I think CVS stock and others dropped 15% on the news when first announced. Now these are big companies and if anyone is going to upend the model it would be them. Well flash forward a few years and they disbanded the operation citing it was too challenging or something like that. This past year Amazon also made news by launching Amazon Pharmacy and more recently Amazon Telehealth for employers. I get what you’re thinking oh no here they come it’s over. This is absolutely hilarious if you actually understood how CVS makes money. Let me tell you how:\n\nCVS has a few primary businesses: CVS Caremark, CVS Aetna, and CVS retail.\n\nCVS Caremark is the largest drug dealer in the US. They are what is referred to as a PBM or prescription benefit manager. As an employer whether it be a public government agency or private employer like Amazon you go through a PBM to acquire your drug benefit coverage for your employees. CVS has thousands of employers ironically including Berkshire, JPM, and Amazon as clients. There are really only three main players in the space (Optum, Express Scripts, and Caremark) which are owned by United Health, Cigna, and CVS which also happen to be health insurers which we’ll get to later. This is where scale really matters. As an employer you want to give your employees the cheapest drugs. As a PBM you use your purchasing power across your customers to buy drugs from manufacturers at the lowest cost. This is why these 3 companies have an impenetrable moat in this industry. Caremark probably buys almost 1/3 of the drugs dispensed in this country. This is why I laugh when I think about the Amazon fears. There is no way they could ever reach the scale of buying power to price drugs low enough to entice employers and government agencies to switch. Unless they’re throwing in a free Prime membership for everyone I think it’s basically impossible for them to break in unless they buy one of the big 3. So what is Amazon Pharmacy you ask? Amazon Pharmacy is just a re-branding of Amazon Pillpack their mail order pharmacy they acquired a few years back. Is it not a threat? Not in the least and that goes back to the pricing model many people don’t understand. Let me explain. If you’re covered by Caremark as an employee of say Wells Fargo you can go anywhere to fill your prescription...CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Costco, or even Amazon. However if you go onto GoodRx and enter your insurance info you’ll see that there are a variety of prices for the same drug. It will always be cheapest at CVS as Caremark will give CVS the best rates. What’s better is all those other places actually pay CVS to be included in their network and have access to their PBM network. So if you fill at Walgreens they make money and if you fill at CVS they make more money. So when people say Walgreens is just a drug store but CVS is more than a drugstore this is part of it. Walgreens and other places you fill drugs don’t have PBMs that represent a huge % of America’s insured.\n\nNow let’s get to the real undervalued gem in their business Aetna. Aetna is the health insurance side of the business and fastest growing. This is the other part of the equation for employee benefits and again same major players in United Healthcare and Cigna. This business encompasses health and dental insurance. Aetna was acquired a few years back in one of the largest acquisitions and largely funded by debt. As you can imagine Wall St hated the deal except for the bankers that did it of course. What’s crazy is CVS was surprised and ecstatic that the deal even closed as it was heavily scrutinized by the Justice department at the time. What I would say about a deal that large is no Board would sign off on that if there wasn’t huge upside to the deal. I mean talk about YOLO let’s borrow a ton of money ($60B) and buy a company. If you are doing that there better be 3x or more the upside, right? So what was Wall St missing? Well first you have to understand the health insurance business which is the same premise as any insurance business which is to insure against risks. Geico insures you against a major car accident while Aetna insures you against a major medical surgery or cancer treatment. What many people don’t understand is the #1 cause of a major medical expense is usually preventive maintenance. Yes exercise but more so taking your medication. I like to say this is akin to Geico being able to tap your breaks if you start to speed in your car. CVS has your health data and if you’re an Aetna member they’re insuring you. So CVS can use that data to intervene early to prevent a major medical event they’d have to pay out on down the road. This is a win/win for all involved and is how CVS is going to change healthcare. I mean this is a health flywheel that will just allow them to win more business.\n\nWhere I’m most excited for them is for their Health Hub strategy. If you are unfamiliar think of it as urgent care within CVS stores. Why I’m most excited is because of what it allows them to do that their competitors can’t. I’m a parent and my wife and I have had many ear infections that we’ve had to run to the Little Clinic which is a similar concept you may have seen in Fry’s grocery stores. Today with our insurance an ear infection and a Little Clinic visit is about $75. Well Aetna is rolling out $0 co-pay plans for these acute care needs at Health Hub stores. $0 is pretty nice! So next time we have an ear infection we can roll up to a CVS Health Hub and get the kiddos checked out, pick up the script for meds, and pick up a bottle of wine for us on the way out. This has huge implications for the industry that nobody is quite grasping yet. It also has huge implications for the retail part of their business that will drive a ton more foot traffic and profits. Just today they said by 2030 they are looking to do 75 billion health interactions. For reference Teladoc did 15M last year in a pandemic year. \n\nSo hopefully I’ve cleared up a lot of misconceptions about CVS and the true business they are in along with who their true competitors are. They are really in an oligopoly with 3 players who have paid the price of admission which is having a PBM and Health Insurance business combination. If Amazon truly wanted to play in this space my belief is that they’d have to acquire one of the 3 as they would have to buy business to compete with the scale/spend on drugs. I honestly think they realized with Haven that this is a tough nut to crack. So oligopoly businesses are usually good to invest in but the one you want to own is CVS because they have a monopoly in stores. There is a CVS within a few miles of everyone in the US which allows them to unlock a lot of value that people have written off as useless before.\n\nValuation:\nCurrently trading at $75 which is ~10 earnings in a market that is over 25x. So it’s way too cheap here but this isn’t a stock to YOLO weekly calls on this is stock to own for a long time. A couple years back they put out an investor presentation showing 10% EPS growth annually past 2022. The best part is it was based on 28% tax rates so tax increases baked in. If you actually model this out this decade you’re talking $19+ dollars EPS in 2030. Throw a 15-20 multiple on that and you’re at $300+. Now I know stocks were going up like that in a month (ahem GME) but for the most part investors shouldn’t ever expect those returns overnight. SP500 annual avg. return is 10% and with where valuations and interest rates are at I suspect we’ll be lucky this decade to average that. So going back to CVS at current price of $75 with $300+ at end of this decade in the cards that works out to a pretty nice avg annualized return of close to 20% assuming you reinvest the dividends. And people might scoff at the thought of them doing double digit EPS growth but if you look up pre Aetna they did just that. Even if they fall short you might see 15% avg annualized which as an investor you can’t expect much better.\n\nWould love to hear everyone’s thoughts!", "id": "mhn92l", "created_utc": 1617250123.0, "score": 143, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "Should wait for the dip.

So atm three weeks out cost about 2.3% but let's say 2.5% to have some room for error.\n\nAt 70 the calls should cost 70*.025=1.75(cause we bumped it .2% to have room for error.)\n\nWhen it goes back to 75 the profit will be 75-1.75-70=$3.25 per call\n\nSo let's say we buy 50 lots that is 5,000 calls it would cost altogether 8,750 your return would be 5,000*5=25,000 for a net profit of 25,000-8,750=16,250\n\nEasy low risk two bagger.

{"title": "Crash alert. Infra plan is a disappointing trojan horse for taxes", "selftext": "The details of the Biden infrastructure plan are now out and let's just say that it is a huge disappointment. We were hoping for unbridled spending instead we get one time, highly precise spending items and a reversal of the Trump tax plan and then some more...\n\nThe reconciliation was meant to allow the dems to spend without any concession of tax increases but it seems that progressive dems want to raise taxes...for the purpose of raising taxes. The sellside is only starting to catch up to this reality.\n\nFirst here is a summary of the tax initiatives by GS:\n\n**A 28% corporate rate**: President Biden proposed this during the presidential campaign. Each percentage point of corporate tax rate increase raises a little over $100bn over ten years in tax revenue, so this proposal would raise between $700-800bn/10 years. *We think Congress can raise the rate to 24-25%, but might start to run into resistance among centrist Democrats between 26% and 28%.\\**\n\n**Tightening GILTI**: Similar to the Biden campaign proposal, the White House proposes to raise the effective tax rate on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) to 21% from an effective rate of 10.5% today, move the system to a country-by-country basis that would keep companies from using tax credits from high tax jurisdictions to offset GILTI earnings in low tax jurisdictions, and rescind the policy that applies the tax to income only above a 10% return on physical capital. This would mean that the GILTI regime would apply to most companies with foreign income rather than just to IP-intensive industries like healthcare and technology, and would likely also raise taxes for companies that currently have little to no GILTI exposure. The Tax Policy Center estimated the campaign proposal would raise $442bn over ten years.\n\n**Other international tax changes** The White House release appears to contemplate replacing the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), saying that it would replace “an ineffective provision in the 2017 tax law that tried to stop foreign corporations from stripping profits out of the United States.” It also proposes to eliminate Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), which encouraged US-based companies to hold their IP in the US by setting an effective tax rate on that income similar to the effective tax rate on IP held abroad and taxed through the GILTI regime.\n\n**A minimum tax on book income** The proposal would also establish a 15% minimum tax on corporate book income reported to investors, which would serve as a check against companies that report large profits to shareholders but no profits to the IRS. The campaign proposal would have applied this globally on a country-by-country basis, but the White House release indicates only that it would apply this only to “the very largest corporations.”\n\n**New restrictions on inversion**s The White House does not define what this would be, but inversions are likely to play a larger role in tax policy if the rest of the proposal were to pass, as the US would then have a high tax on the foreign earnings of multinationals compared with most other developed countries that rely on mainly\n\nterritorial tax systems.\n\n==============================================\n\nGS Estimates a 9% hit on EPS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7ow3gjfujq61.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8f975ac24b51f5a267719f2b32163fc49168bf4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5ag5dhgujq61.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb110ba1a3f932b9260ad331939d5cd590bab722\n\nBAML Estimates a 7% hit to EPS 2022 (currently consensus at 200$\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g4whch0hujq61.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=a088bffcffb6a4595c138380aa8fd82482f96783\n\n**Ed Yardeni**, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, wrote this week that Biden's proposed 28% corporate tax rate, if implemented, \"would reduce S&P 500 earnings per share by $15, to $200 in 2022.\"\n\nThat 7% haircut is likely more than Wall Street has been pricing in. **UBS** equity strategist Keith Parker wrote on March 9 that he anticipates a 3.6% hit to EPS from Biden's tax plan.\n\nParker wrote that hiking the tax rate on long-term capital gains from **20% to 39.6% could slice 1.5 points off the S&P 500 P/E multiple,** potentially another 7% hit. UBS expects that not quite half that tax hike will become law.\n\n==============================================\n\nThe only reason the sellside isn't outright bearish yet is because they seem to think that only a watered down version of this bill will pass. that's not true. via reconciliation what Biden wishes is what happens there is only one limiting swing vote in practice and that is senator Joe Manchin. Guess what the man is fine with a tax hike of A*T LEAST 25% so he LOVES THIS:*\n\n>While he didn't predict a price tag, Manchin said Congress should do \"everything we possibly can\" to pay for it. He said there should be \"tax adjustments\" to former President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law to boost revenues, including by raising the corporate rate from the current 21 percent to at least 25 percent.\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-calls-enormous-infrastructure-package-paid-new-taxes-n1261949)\n\n## So for now i definitely don't see how the market can get away with pricing NONE OF THIS. BUY PUTS.\n\nMoving on to other asset classes which will explain why I only anticipate a drawdown of 5% :\n\nthe phasing of the plan is problematic in that infra plans tend to take a long time to start hitting GDP while the taxes hit will be immediate hence it will reduce 2022 GDP growth. Without writting a whole article about the situation at the FED, the market is currently pricing a full hike in 2022 DEC. That is the most insane thing this market has ever done since GME. IT IS NOT HAPPENING.\n\n## BUY ED DEC 2022\n\nand the pricing out of these hikes that are not happening will help with NQ's valuation and compensate for a point or half a point of P/E hence the 5% figure.\n\nTLDR\n\n**SHORT USDJPY, USDCHF, USDGBP**\n\n**LONG GLD, QQQ vs DIA, TLT**\n\n**BUY SPX OTM PUTS**", "id": "mhthzn", "created_utc": 1617277428.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "Is it me or does $100B over 10 years of a tax increase to make those companies \"pay their fair share\" somehow not come close to wanting to spend $2T.\n\nMaybe it's just my smooth ape brain.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "You forget legalizing and taxing marijuana.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Pipe dream of you to think Marijuana will get legalized at the federal level.

I was just critiquing the idea that you presented of currency only possessing whatever power over you that you give it.  I was saying there's many circumstances where that statement wouldn't hold up, which means when you evaluate the validity of that claim (money only possessing the power you give it) it simply isn't true in many circumstances.  The power money has over your behavior is directly related to the severity/priority of what it's presence/absence will yield.  The statement is too simple to explain the relationship that people have between themselves and currency.  Currency allows people to acquire healthcare services, food and shelter, that's the baseline, when those critical aspects are threatened for themselves (and whatever they consider their family/tribe) then money has a good deal of power of the individual regardless of their choice.  This doesn't mean that they have to be unhappy, it is just that money does hold a lot of power as they have to dedicate themselves to its acquisition in some way regardless if they want to or not.\n\nAn obvious example, if you have a child who requires an expensive surgery of some form for their survival, in instances like this money has TREMENDOUS power over you without you deciding it does or not.  In scenarios like this, it would be like telling a starving person \"food only has the power over you that you give it\".  Yes it only has power over you that you give it, but often you don't have a choice how much power you give it because the result of said money and successful acquisition/loss of it could rob you of things you find to be the most important in life.  I'm just saying there's a lot of cases where you actually don't have a choice how much power it has when it no longer becomes optional.  The power money has over us is directly correlated to how much it is needed for things we consider a necessity.\n\nI get what you're saying, the try to enjoy life regardless, money comes and goes aspect.  I'm just saying that the relationship between people and currency is much more complex than that and currency itself is a system of power which controls critical parts of our lives that are directly correlated to our survival.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't what you mean by \"I'm guessing you've still only ever been on the one side of this feeling\".  I've struggled for long periods, done very well in others.  That isn't really relevant to what I had said either way though cause you can critique the validity of a statement by seeing if the statement remains true under differing conditions.

I'm not saying that the sentiment can't be true for you and the conditions which you currently exist, I'm saying that said conditions vary by circumstance, that the power money holds over us fluctuates based on various conditions, which I think is a pretty reasonable assertion.  To say that a single line catch phrase without specific conditions outlined has summed up the relationship between survival, currency and the individual in all conditions is something that no person has ever been able to do except maybe for a small handful of physicists because the matters they deal in are so general.\n\nI think you're misinterpreting me as some free market capitalist that is saying \"you must submit to the power of money\" but that's not remotely what I'm saying.  I'm a Marxist in many regards theoretically.  I dislike the current state of global capitalism and its extreme irrationality and advocate for movement towards more rational forms of production.  The idea that all power exerted by currency is voluntary is a fairytale for anyone trying to live in an ethical manner though, to deny that it has any power or impact over your behavior is false (we're literally on a gambling subreddit, if money had zero power over us, we wouldn't be here in the first place).  Someone who is having to take care of their children, sick, elderly, etc can't just \"shoot up north and live in a forest for a year\".  Again, I'm not trying to convince YOU to think differently, I'm not telling YOU not to do those things, I'm not saying anything about you and your behavior or your mindset not being true for the circumstances in which you exist.  I'm saying that your statement, when evaluated in a general non-specific sense, under certain conditions, such as where an individual has people who heavily depend on them for survival, is false because the need for resources is very real even if the goal is to reduce the need for currency (which typically requires resources to ensure initial acquisition of resources needed for an autonomous life).  In certain circumstances like that abandoning the pursuit of resources and the involuntary power it holds for their own selfish reasons means unethically abandoning others who are dependent on you which many are not willing to do because they don't view those things as optional which is often rooted in deep biological/psychological truths of our operation.  The statement is heavily dependent on certain other conditions remaining true for its validity to hold up, to say that your sentiment holds up unequivocally for all people regardless of these conditional variants is just kind of absurd.

{"title": "🌋 🐳 W2W REPORT: BLACKROCK-AGEDDON (ICLN/INRG OVERHAUL)", "selftext": "🐰 🐰 check your email inbox if you did the thing. Happy Easter 🐰 🐰 \n\n🚨 **UPDATE: 9 AM PST 4/2** 🚨 \n\n**Just got off the phone with SPDJI, you have to be a LICENSED subscribe**r (key word licensed I certainly am fucking not) to get the file delivery of the pro-forma results today \n\n**LETS DO THIS TOGETHER:** take a look at the weighting documents and **PLEASE pm or chat me thoughts on inclusion**. We can do this. \n\n****\n\n**BLACKROCKAGEDDON**\n\nUp too late last week, I found this odd-sounding article titled [Clean Energy ETF May See Big](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-energy-etf-may-see-030000958.html) Overhaul What it meant was so amazing I could not believe it:\n\n>In the latest consultation, SPDJI is now planning to increase [their holdings] minimum to 100, more than tripling the current number of companies featured in the index. This will have a major impact on the exposure of the world’s largest clean energy ETFs, the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) and the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN).    \n\nYou’re probably thinking “...oh...um...okay. Whatever?”  Well, let me break this Greek down.  **These BlackRock ETFs (INRG and ICLN) track the S&P Clean Energy Index, and because the index hasn’t been updated in 14 years, it only has 30 holdings.  The new rule proposal means that ICLN/INRG (the BlackRock ETFs) will be required to expand from 30 tickers...to 100...right now.**\n\nSo, BlackRock currently owns WAY too disproportionate a weight in a small basket of stocks that got pumped during the Biden boom post-election (see: PLUG).  **The BlackRock ETFs currently have a stake of 8% or more of EACH of almost a quarter of the stocks in the Index.**  This rebalance means that on a massive scale and in a specified time frame, *ICLN and INRG are compelled to sell and buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stake in EACH of the companies already in the index it follows, AND they would PURCHASE initiating stakes in up to 67 other companies.*\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/NwenIEq.jpg\n-ICLN TOP TEN HOLDINGS. SO. MUCH. PLUG.\n\n[I found a document from SPDJI called a “consultation” that lays out the process.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210324-1345159/1345159_spglobalcleanenergyconsultationexpscorecountweightingresults3-24-2021.pdf). The next morning I e-mailed SPDJI representatives to confirm, and they replied with key information. \n\n[My email chat with SPDJI confirming dates and processes](https://i.imgur.com/xMrOMxR.jpg)\n\nSo, there it is.  **On the 19th of April, according to the criteria listed, 67 new companies are being added to the S&P Clean Energy Index**—the underlyings of which are to be purchased in large quantities by the BlackRock ETFs.  **As 42 Dugg once rapped...IT GET DEEPER.**\n\n****\n\n**Investment Firm Société Générale released a memo to their clients breaking down the financial implications for current ICLN and INRG holdings—what BlackRock’s gotta buy, and what they gotta sell.** As of this writing they have not answered my calls--apparently the SpotRambo name does not carry much international clout--but [this FT Article had some info on winners and losers currently in the ETF:](https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610)\n\n>This would mean the iShares ETFs (BlackRock) would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind and GCL-Poly Energy.\n\n>This buying spree would be counterbalanced by a wave of disposals. The ETFs would need to sell $405m worth of stock in New Zealand’s Meridian Energy, SocGen estimated, equivalent to 47.6 days of typical turnover.\n\n>For the US-listed American depositary receipts of Brazil’s Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, the implied selling of $248m of stock would represent 57.7 per cent of the free-float market capitalisation, SocGen said.\n\nWhoa!  This is a lot of critical information. **Recap:**\n\n**What we know**: On **4/19**, The S&P Clean Energy Index is undergoing a massive overhaul and adding 67 fresh stonks.  BlackRock ETFS ICLN and INRG track this index, and will therefore participate in a frenzy of buying and selling on/before/around that date. **On 4/2 the pro-formas are released indicating the weighting and therefore candidates**. \n\n**What else we know**: New purchases and redistributions--LITERAL pumps and dumps--are a requirement for the BlackRock ETFs.  **According to SocGen, this includes among others: $400m pump for NEE, and extreme dumps for CEG and others.**  Pumps and dumps so large that they represent 40-50 days of the stocks natural trading cycle.\n\n**What we’re pretty damn sure of**: My mans G has been helping me out with some digging.  We are pretty damn sure **PLUG** will go down HARD  once BlackRock divests to spread the wealth.
