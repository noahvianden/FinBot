I mean, if all you care about is leverage, sure, it looks ideal. But what if you care about dividend income? Or ownership rights? Or margin equity?\n\nI've already summed up my opinion. In order to obtain 2x to 4x leverage on an asset you intend to hold for more than a year, you need to accept an asset that declines in value over time. And even if it doesn't decline in value, it forces you to make a decision by a specific deadline. What if the market is in correction at the time? That does not seem like a good trade-off to me, except for the two cases I already mentioned, PMCC and Leveraged Lifecycle. \n\nThe latter is touched on in your linked comment (drilling down in the links in that comment). 2x leveraged deep ITM SPX or XSP calls that you plan to roll in less than yearly intervals has many advantages over just buying SPY shares, if you are early enough in your time horizon. But that's a very, very specific application. If you are more than a quarter of the way into a 50 year time horizon, it is no longer \"ideal\" and you'd be better off just buying SPY shares. Not to mention that the Leveraged Lifecycle *only applies to the S&P 500 index*.

{"title": "I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.\n\nWhat I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.\n\n**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)\n\n**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8dddldhpyiv61.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=87815030b030a145b4b28699755dca67aada1f1b\n\nFor the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.\n\na. One week after recommendation\n\nb. One month after recommendation\n\nc. One quarter after recommendation\n\nI benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade.\n\n**Results:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9aejospqyiv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4333db3ef1bdf35e4e9bb235de1bdda5a331e129\n\nOut of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods was better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analysts made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tiz3b3qsyiv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=65233193d329d16067c7f594f4de19f1455c49ae\n\nSell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative)\n\n**Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0gekgktyiv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f2d186f3339e0578a72903c507560b415652a41\n\nI analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley with them making more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains.\n\n**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?**\n\nI did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:**\n\nThe above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks faired.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There has been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of assets you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!\n\nExcel Sheet link containing all the recommendations and more detailed analysis: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Hd6xU4B4p0PmlpV3JULmChU1JQTVkOR/view?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to any investment banks showcased above.*", "id": "myygs8", "created_utc": 1619446019.0, "score": 1767, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": "That's a lot of work.

{"title": "I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.\n\nWhat I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.\n\n**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won’t allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)\n\n**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n790ugjr9jv61.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=07845e5d4b41a4877dd6cd180ae1faa450adfc46\n\nFor the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.\n\na. One week after recommendation \n\nb. One month after recommendation \n\nc. One quarter after recommendation \n\nI benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade. \n\n**Results:** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k2lc2u1t9jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffbb6b197286b47782ede7f068f6648eacf492ae\n\nOut of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods were better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analyst made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y39cv6iu9jv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e24eec21c5018c01febdcdc234136935a0a01b6\n\n Sell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative)\n\n**Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5cx0ov1x9jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=50549713d2ae8696b3012add7dbc2fe68ddad8a0\n\nI analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley with them making more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains. \n\n**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?** \n\nI did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** \n\nThe above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks faired. \n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nI started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There has been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn’t. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of asset you have under management, in this case at least $100MM! \n\nExcel Sheet link containing all the recommendations and more detailed analysis: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Hd6xU4B4p0PmlpV3JULmChU1JQTVkOR/view?usp=sharing) \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and in no way related to any investment banks showcased above.*", "id": "myztnx", "created_utc": 1619449740.0, "score": 2170, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 133, "comments": [{"body": "Good work bud. \nSo your recommendation is we pool in our money into a SPAC and make it worth $100M and then invest? 😛", "score": 316, "replies": [{"body": "Then aggregate the message and put out your own recommendations based on the reports and charge people\n10 dollars a month for exclusive access to inside information.

If the investor was only able to carry 50, or 100, open positions - their picking of 50 out of 1,650 is really like them doing the stock picking themselves.

Which would be horrible.\n\nFalse positives are equally as annoying, given the car is directed to break by the vision system, and directed to keep going by the radar system. But in this circumstance I imagine that the vision system would overrule and the car would slow down.\n\nI still think that there is an issue for vision based systems during certain weather environments, but I guess, the FSD might not be avaiable during these types of conditions.

My suggestion, and I trust that the engineers at Tesla have better insight, is that as machine learning/AI has a percentage of confidence in the accuracy of it's interpretation of the surroundings, if the that value was low, it'd start trusting the radar more. If it was very confident in the surroundings, it would ignore a false reading of a phantom object by the radar. However, you could do this same confidence percentage on radar,  and at some point the two may 'battle' with each other, such as an edge case where they are both the same percent confident, leading to a possible phantom brake.
