{"title": "Covered calls are good for getting called away, not so great for income. AAPL example.", "selftext": "Yesterday, I replied to a post (on TTG) where the OP was struggling with what to do on a covered call that had gone in the money. My reply was \"I'm always surprised people don't do Iron Condors in place of covered calls\" which sparked a bit of a discussion. I thought the discussion was worth a longer post and a bigger discussion here.\n\n**Covered calls** are like an entry drug for options. They are extremely straightforward and serve a very useful purpose. That intended purpose looks like this: 1) an investor owns the stock 2) they'd be willing to sell it higher. 3) If they sell OTM calls they have the chance to lower their cost basis before eventually being called away in the stock. 4) IOW, for those wanting to sell stock higher, a covered call strategy is a lot smarter than a GTC sell order in the stock.\n\nWhere covered calls get misused (IMHO) is as income generation against long stock. I would argue credit call spreads vs stock are better than covered calls, and I would take it one step further and argue that Iron Condors are better than both. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, let's start with the **expected move**. You may have seen me talk about the expected move as useful for strike selection. It's also useful for understanding something like a covered call strategy. The way an expected move generally works is that roughly 65-70% of the time the stock finishes at or inside that expected move. The other 30% that goes outside the expected move include some disproportionally big moves. The reasons are aplenty but think blow-out earnings moves, breakouts above resistance, crashes on bad news, etc. That 30% outside the move is much wider than it seems.\n\nSo now think about a covered call strategy where the call is at or just above the expected move. The math says it should work 2/3 times before being called away. Maybe even 3/4 depending on delta. The issue is that time it doesn't may be the big move higher. And if your strategy is income, rather than just a smarter way to sell your stock, that move you missed in the stock may be enough to wipe out any income you had collected leading up to that point.\n\n**Iron Condors vs Covered Calls for Income -** Here's a direct comparison of a covered call and a credit Iron Condor using Apple with a May 1st expiration as an example. The Expected Move would put the bullish consensus around $140 (currently trading $130). The 140 call is about 1.80.\n\n*If an investor bought 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) for $130. Then sold 1 May 21st $140 call at $1.80. That lowers their overall cost basis in the stock to $128.20 ($130.00 - $1.80).*\n\nIf the stock is at or below $140 on May 21st the investor would collect the entire $1.80. An ideal situation is if the stock goes higher, but not higher than $140. However, if the stock goes to $150. They are called away in the stock at 140. If they want to remain long the stock they need to buy to cover the call at a loss, in this example the call would cost at least $10 to close.\n\nAs an alternative, a credit Iron Condor is a strategy that looks to collect income by selling both an out-of-the-money credit call spread and an out-of-the-money credit put spread. Traders use credit Iron Condors for several purposes, often outside of stock ownership. The first is simply as a neutral or range trade, looking to receive a credit if a stock stays within a range. A second use is to short volatility, especially farther out in time. Here we'll discuss a third use, as potential income generation for a long stock position. One that does not necessarily cap potential gains in the stock. Here's an example, using the expected move for May 21st ([trade GIF](https://learn.optionsai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/null.2021-04-08-15_24_45.gif)) via Options AI :\n\n*An investor owns 100 shares of Apple, bought for $130. They sell the Apple May 21st 115/120/140/145 Iron Condor at 1.50. This lowers their overall cost basis to $128.50.*\n\nIf the stock is between 120 and 140 on May 21st the investor would collect the entire $1.50 as added income to stock gains, or as a small buffer vs. losses. Here's how the options position looks on the chart:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/h0u83m1ma8s61.gif\n\nThis trade looks to collect 1.50 if the stock is between 120 and 140 on expiration, roughly the same as the 140 call sale that looks to collect 1.80. The difference is if the stock goes through that level, losses from the Iron Condor are capped at 3.50, whereas covering the covered call is undefined. The Condor see its max loss with the stock above $145, however, the long stock would resume gains as it moved above that level.\n\nFor example, if the stock is 150, the attempt at income via the Condor would have cost $3.50 vs gains in the stock, with the next $5 in the stock still captured as gains. The attempt at income via the covered call would cost north of $8, wiping out all the gains in the stock above $140.\n\nOr course, the Condor has risk in both directions. If the stock is below $115 on May 21st $3.50 is lost, adding to the losses in the stock. That differs from the covered call where the $1.80 credit is still collected. But if the intent is to be bullish, retain the stock over time, and add income, that occurrence would not be a deal-breaker unless the stock did a long sustained outsized move lower over multiple expirations.\n\n**Summary**\n\nA covered call is often thought of as a bullish strategy. And it is, up to a point. But the investor is capping potential gains in the stock. If the investor is simply looking to add income while holding onto a stock longer term, an Iron Condor could be a more pure expression of that view. Even comparing the Condor to a Credit Call Spread, which would share the ability for gains resuming in the stock w/o the risk of losses on the trade if the stock went lower, the Condor is still a more pure expression of income generation over time, as it is directionally agnostic, and collects more. Edit:  I've turned this post into a longer post with a little more detail over at [Learn](https://learn.optionsai.com/covered-calls-vs-iron-condors-for-generating-income-on-long-stock-an-example-in-apple-aapl/)\n\n**Update:**\n\nI somewhat cheekily picked a fight with a beloved strategy and that was intentional. My point on a covered call is there’s a lot more going on than meets the eye. And people miss the effect of lost opportunity cost. Which is real money. That’s why I used the example of Apple going to to 150. The covered call actually “loses” money versus the condor there. Here’s a next level way to think about it:\n\nA covered call is .... actually a synthetic short straddle with some leftover stock.\n\nI’ll explain. If I own a 1000 shares of a stock. And sell 10 calls. My resulting position is short 5 calls, short 5 synthetic puts, long 500 shares of stock. If I were to sell 20 calls. I am short a synthetic straddle 10 times with no long stock.\n\n(Short a call and long stock is a synthetic put). Wherever the strike is of the call is the center of the synthetic straddle. That’s why it’s “somewhat bullish” if the call it OTM. And is fairly neutral if the call is ATM.\n\nIOW: When a stock gaps higher though a covered call that pain you feel is you covering a short straddle against your stock.", "id": "mnkpww", "created_utc": 1617984940.0, "score": 681, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 496, "comments": [{"body": ">If an investor bought 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) for $130.

In most cases, the  higher the volatility, the riskier the security. Volatility is often  measured as either the [standard deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/standarddeviation.asp) or [variance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/variance.asp) between returns from that same security or market index. \n\n\n\nIn the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big  swings in either direction. For example, when the stock market rises  and falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is  called a \"volatile\" market. An asset's volatility is a key factor when  pricing options contracts. \n\n\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n \n\n* ***Volatility represents how large an asset's prices swing around the  mean price - it is a statistical measure of its dispersion of returns.***\n* There are several ways to measure volatility, including beta  coefficients, option pricing models, and standard deviations of returns.\n* Volatile assets are often considered riskier than less volatile assets because the price is expected to be less predictable.\n* Volatility is an important variable for calculating options prices.\n\nThe only time you have ZERO volatility is when the price doesn't move. \n\nInherent in volatility is price movement.  \n\nIf you expect downward volatility you expect downward price movement compared to the mean price. \n\nThis doesn't mean you expect the stock to lose significant value, that would be a bearish sentiment. It does mean you can calculate the mean price, and bet that it will be at or below that price and pick the next strike above it. If you felt the price would be volatile on the upside of the mean price you would not sell calls you would but calls or do synthetic longs. \n\nYou are acting like price and volatility are divorced from each other, when rather volatility is a statistical representation of price action over some period of time.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "😂 dude I worked in equity derivatives. “The problem is your misunderstanding of what volatility means.” GTFOH.

If you sold it for .60 and then you’re locking in gains .49 then that could be for any number of reasons, but it’s something I do frequently. I’m not doing it to avoid getting called. I may see it’s worth it to find a different higher strike later dated option and sell that to continue putting my shares to use, but make no mistake I’m not anything but bearish the entire time I’m selling a CC.\n\nIt’s important to note that the original poster talked about selling options OTM and then rolling when they move ITM, where your example still isn’t (although close). It seems they were alluding to this operation being consistently profitable which is a bold claim making a number of assumptions (namely its all IV but IV varies wildly for a number of reasons well outside the stock being considered, so I find the sustainability of this play dubious). It’s about as reliable as saying “I have a haunch this stock will go up so I’m buying calls.” Good luck with that. It might work and it might not, but it’s by no means a strategy to consistently win. Selling OTM calls and rebuying then ITM is a money loser over the long run, no matter how you try to dress it up.\n\nBut without any additional information what you’re missing is that if PLTR continues going up than the premium will continue to appreciate and in another few weeks you’ll be nearing ITM and if you *wanted* to keep your stock you’d likely either pay more premium to buy to close your current position and “roll” to a later date (typically also a higher strike), or get assigned. Will you be able to collect more premium on the later execution date than the difference in cost from your lost premium? *Possibly.* but it’s far from sustainable.\n\nIt sounds to me like you’re not neutral at all about your position. You’re bearish. You’d collect the premium happily if it goes down and you’re fine being assigned if it goes up.\n\nI always think of selling an option as having your head in a guillotine. I don’t want to be in there any longer than is necessary. Especially with ANY NUMBER of things that could happen that can cause the overnight surges you described. If you’re constantly selling OTM , rebuying ITM, and keeping your head over that blade for months on end you WILL get smoked eventually.\n\nSo yeah, you can “make” .03 to keep your head in that PLTR guillotine for another 30 days, and then another 30 days after that. You may even be able to do that by collecting a couple cents premium for a while.

What I'm might disagree with is the getting smoked or guillotined analogy :). Let me elaborate:\n\nSo \"it sounds to me like you’re not properly evaluating the risk\". absolutely possible! In my thinking there are 3 types of trading risk (so DD, analysis  and fundamentals are a a separate thing for me):\n\n1. Margin risk: Am I in any way, shape or form in risk of getting margin called, ending up in negative? If Yes, then I'm not doing it.\nFor example in the aforementioned cases, if you have bought the shares on margin and now selling covered calls on them below a strike where you could cover the margin then indeed the risk would be too outsized for doing it. (Even just holding the shares would, so I'm not going there)\n\n2. \"Losing my original investment\" risk: **Am I in risk of realizing loss against my will?** For example simply holding shares of a stock which takes a nose dive does not force me to realize loss, its up to me whether I do or not, and I'm okay with that. However If I would sell covered calls with a strike below what I have bought the shares for, that could force me to realize loss. I'm not willing to do that.\nIf the shares takes such a dive that its no longer possible (or economical) to sell covered calls on it above my buying price, then I usually consider it a perfect time to start selling itm puts on it to pull down my average by acquiring more. Also If I'm looking to roll up and out then I'm not going to do that into a losing position. Here we agree again, if it not possible to exit my position by rolling forward at a gain, then I'm going let it execute.\n\n3. \"No income\" risk: **Is somebody paying me to do what I'm planning to do?** In my mind whatever I'm doing on the market, somebody should be paying me to do it. For this reason I try to buy and sell through options, and if I'm planning to hold something that's not paying dividends then generate some money through selling calls or strangles (and rule 2 bars me to do that if the strikes would lose me money)\n\nI try to force myself to think about \"Possible winnings\", \"Opportunity cost\" and \"Upside\" an all that good stuff completely separately and only after these risks are mitigated. The reason for that is that on hand I'm simply not (yet) confident enough in my stock picking ability to pick the next Apple or Tesla. So right now not making income on my portfolio seems like a way bigger risk, then capping my upside. \nOn the other hand in the last year my portfolio \"experienced\" white swan events on stocks that I had no covered calls on more then a dozen times. The only time I had the ability to capitalize on it was with Tesla. In every other case I just kind of sit through it and then watch it come back down like a dumb idiot (Did not sell palantir when it shot from 25 to 39 in a week, or lemonade from 122 to 180 in a week, etc..., etc...). \nWhether they would have been called away, or I was rolling them for those measly 3 dollars I would have more money right now.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I think you’ve got it pretty well ironed out! And I don’t think you needed my help lol! One thing I was just really trying to hammer away is that having a consistent and coherent strategy is paramount. Your 3 risks are pretty sound. Just be sure one of the risks you factor is the emotional risk ie: don’t sell a call that you’ll feel compelled to close out at a loss because deep down inside you don’t actually want to get assigned.\n\nA covered call is certainly not a super risky trade, especially at strikes above your cost basis. But *it is* overly risky if it’s incoherent with your feelings on the price direction. I was certainly being overly dramatic  by characterizing your head in a guillotine, ha! But if you’re bullish on the share price selling a call is about the most self inflicting wound you can deal to yourself. Sure, the worst that happens if your setting strikes above your cost basis is you come away from the deal with a profit, but you’d be leaving a lot on the table by doing so if it keeps moving up like you were thinking it might.\n\nsecond, and more importantly, my experience with flirting with a similar strategy is that *sometimes* you’re net positive rolling out, but certainly not always. It becomes a very serious “good money after bad” scenario if you start paying $10 or $15 to roll out because you don’t want to get called away... but your still hoping the market will relent and you’ll finally expire worthless one of these months (which is sort of what the OP was suggesting)... and that’s just what it costs *to roll it.* If you surrender completely because great news comes out and you really don’t want to sell your stock, then you’re absorbing the full cost of closing it out. That *will* feel like getting smoked for sure when you pay a couple hundred bucks to keep your own shares. \n\nBut again, this doesn’t really sound like information you need because it’s pretty clear you’ve got a plan and your capable of reevaluating your situation when things change.

Not at all. \n\nLets be clear here about what I am saying. \n\nA Covered Call, is a Bearish Play. After all your expectation is the stock will end below the strike price you are selling for. \n\nThat your call is covered does not change selling calls from Bear to Bull, you have simply hedged the risk that the stock will runaway leaving you with massive losses.\n\nI disagree with the author that an Iron Condor is a better play, because it requires more legs, has risk on both sides of the trade and is suitable for stocks that won't wander out of the range. Vertical Spread better represents recapture of most the profits should the stock catapult past your strike significantly.  \n\nTo reduce losses to theta the higher strike call should be done further out in time, and rolled forwards to be no closer than two weeks where theta really begins eating larger chunks on a daily basis.  You then sell the weeklies, near the money where theta loss should be highest and profits greatest because of the potential for being ITM. \n\nIf you feel the need to protect against loss you can buy Puts, but there is little point to doing so unless there is a high risk of falling, why? Because if the stock is falling, the value of the covered call is acting like a makeshift put. If it falls enough you can close that position and open a new one closer to ITM to continue capturing money on the way down.\n\nIf you so mistrust your stock that you need two levels of puts (selling one strike and buying another) I would suggest you are in this case either overly risk adverse or you don't trust the stock you are in to retain its value, which is another matter. \n\nAny drop in value if you are a long term holder, will be covered by the income generation of selling the covered calls, and should they be called away on a large move you have the purchased calls to ensure that you are not out too much. \n\nJust one man's opinion.

The stock retreated back to the $330 range and traded as low as $318. This could be due to yields, or Archegos, or just a normal correction. I was down, and my normal strategy would be to ride it out and wait for it to come back up.  I knew earnings are due on 4/20, and confident the price would recover in Q2.\n\nBut I wondered if I could speed that up.   Noting that the stock was stuck in a new sideways pattern between $320-330, I also noticed that calls for this stock were fetching very good prices, even in the 2-4 week range. This was likely because of the recent runup which had now run out of gas.\n\nRule 1: When a stock's volatility suddenly decreases, i.e., it takes a rest, there's a few week period where options are overpriced. \n\nI sold covered calls (4/16 expiry) at 335 strike against part of my long position while the stock was trading around 330, collecting around $4500 in premium.\n\nAt the same time, I also sold off some of my long shares at 330 and bought them back same day in the low $320s, lowering my basis.  The stock has refused to go much higher, but there is a decent intra-day volatility between $320-330.  My new basis is now below $335 on the total position. \n\nRule 2:  Get paid while you wait for something you expect to happen, to happen.\n\n Today GS closed around $331. It's starting to come back. The covered call has increased in value of course (hope its one of you lucky bastards).  If the price gets to $335 I'll get exercised, but I'll be ahead by about $10k when that happens.

After unionizing, a contract was negotiated for 20.54/hr max pay with defined raises from one's starting pay. Benefits became amazing $10/month ($60/ mon precontract) for a ppo w/ a $400 deductible ($1600 pre contact) and $2500 max out of pocket ($11000 pre contact). Weekly hours were capped at 54 hours. There were many weeks I told my manager to \"fuck off\" and that i wasn't coming in for my next shift because I was capped on hours. \n\nIn addition to this, I was a union steward and executive board member. I saved multiple people's jobs and got punishments reduced via the contractual grievance process.\n\nI have this person's permission in writing to talk about his grievance. In this grievance, a technician had his personal phone stolen out of his pocket while being battered by his manager. At least that's how I presented it during the grievance meeting as the manager reached into a technician's pocket (battery) to retrieve the phone (theft). After I threatened to call the cops and discussed the company's policies on battery and theft once he admitted it during a recorded conversation, he happily back paid the technician for the 5 day suspension the technician received for having the phone on his person (this is against company policies). \n\nWhereas in that particular story, no one was doing what the company's expected of them, I have dozens of stories similar to this one- many where there was no fair on behalf of the technician.\n\nThere aren't many things I am completely sure if, but I am one hundred percent sure that this same garbage happens to Amazon employees too.

The TCJA had very little impact (except that it may have impacted retail interest in the market from the individual income tax changes).\n\nThe major change brought in by the TCJA that may have had some impact was the shift to territorial tax, but as US companies that were trading abroad had, de-facto, done this themselves by having international headquarters abroad with US subsidiaries to manage the Americas taxes, the impact was limited.\n\n>no doubt many of these big companies swiftly recovered from the  coronavirus recession.\n\nMostly due to the CARES act, in my opinion. Many of these companies took money intended to be used to furlough instead of fire employees and kept it.

Wondering how this  would play out in terms of broad market growth.\n\nCorporate tax rates are something of a red herring in my opinion. To reduce corporate tax avoidance you need 3 things (some of which were tackled by BEPS).\n\n1. Gobally agree where money is taxed. At the moment companies take advantage of differences in the territoriality of taxation. A simple example would be if Ireland does not tax income not earned in Ireland, where the US taxed income earned worldwide, and Germany taxes income based on where it is booked. So a US company sets up an Irish company and books its European earnings there, legally avoiding German and US taxes. This is a very simplified view of what's actually happening but as an example it shows that differences these rules  can make taxation easy to avoid for large multi-nationals.\n2. Legacies of empire need to be wound up. Jersey, the Bahamas, the Dutch West Indies, the Cayman Islands, and others for historical reasons have preferable conditions for transferring money from their former Imperial overlords (the UK and the Netherlands are notable for this in particular). This means that taking advantage of item 1 gets the money to London/Amsterdam cheaply, then can be moved to the offshore accounts cheaply. This flow should be disrupted so it's taxed before it leaves. Companies like can borrow at incredibly low rates because they use the capital building up offshore as collateral, then declare any interest as an expense and write it off.\n3. Do what Ireland did and remove all the exceptions, and put the headline rate to what you actually want. Ireland have a tax rate of 12.5% and take in 12.4%. France have a rate of 36% but depending on location, business, and incentives, a company could be paying 6%. The US had a rate of 35% but again depending on a multitude of factors companies are paying less than half that. Cut all tax breaks on corporations, remove location incentives, and reduce the rate to match what you expect to actually take in (around 16-18%) and the overall tax take would rise.\n\nI was reading that psychologically, people dislike subtraction if addition is possible in basically all contexts. The tax code everywhere is a shambles of overlapping rules because things just get added. Simplifying this would lead to less lawyers and accountants having jobs, probably, but would provide a boost to business by empowering medium sized business to compete more effectively although multi-nationals will always have some advantages.\n\nAnyway, a bit of a rant.\n\nThe short answer to what you actually asked is any discussion like Yellen has started will cause skittishness in the market, particularly if it looks like going anywhere, but the impact will be small and short lived unless it's actually enacted and the details of that will be very important.", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "Excellent comment.

This isn't the final evolution of this system. In the same way it would be stupid to build a subway line from one airport to a hotel for the 100-500 passengers daily, currently, this is the correct implementation of the system.\n\n1. Unlike a subway, you can change the vehicle easily to improve capacity.  Model 3 to Model X. Model X to electric passenger van/bus. \n\n1. Let's look at a case study of 1,000 people, getting from A, to B, C, D, E, F. 200 people per stop, with Boring vs Subway. All numbers are made up, for the convenience of talking through this problem. \n\n##Areas of comparison\n* **Dwell Time** Let's say that for a subway, for 5 stops, each stop has 30 seconds of dwell time. (Where I'm from, It's more like a minute of dwell time). That's 2 minutes difference for people going to stop F, than people going to stop B. (Dwell time is the time that a train is in a station, to allow for boarding and disenbarking). It's also faster to empty a car than it is to empty a train. \n\n* **Speed up / Speed Down** It takes time to get up to speed after leaving each station, and to slow down for each station. Let's say this takes 30 seconds before and after each station, to get back up to speed, and the average speed during those sections is half. That's a total of 30 seconds per stop that the vehicle is effectively not moving. \n\n* **Maximum Passengers** When designing subway stations, you have to design based around the idea that a train will pull up and you will have 500+ people emerging at once and needing to walk through the station. If you only have smaller vehicles, then that reduces the total passengers you need to be able to cater for at any one single moment, ie the max pax. This also offers time savings, because it takes longer for 500 people to walk through a corridor at once than it does for 100 people.\n* **Wait time** While most busy subways operate turn up and go time tables, even these usually have a 5-10minute wait time. For less frequent or busy services, it can be as infrequent as 30min to 1hr or worse.\n\n##All together\nSo in a completely made up example, just to give more of an idea of what goes into a comparison between Boring Company vs. Mass Transit,  you could see a scenario that plays out as follows:\n\nPerson is going from stop A to stop F. \n\n1. Dwell time delay is 2 minutes longer with mass transit\n\n1. Speed delay is 2 minutes longer with mass transit\n\n1. MaxPax delay is 1 minute longer to exit station with 200 other people with mass transit\n\n1. Wait time delay is 5 minutes longer with mass transit (assuming that our passenger arrived exactly inbetween a 10min turn up and go service.\n\n## Results: \nBoring Company saves a passenger to stop F 10 minutes.\n\n## Capital intensive\nOne final note, Mass transit is extremely capital intensive. A lot of cities delay investing in mass transit because of the cost. If you can develop a basic system like BC for 1/20th the capital cost, and scale up that system as it grows for even the same cost as it would cost to build a mass transit system, then it's a lot easier for cities to start the project, then going all in to a system that will take years to build, decades to determine the success of, and decades to pay off.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This comment deserves more attention.\n\nI think your point about the less capital required is spot on.

It would take 5-10 years, huge capital costs, and just to go down a spiral of lowest cost race to the bottom?\n\n**This** is why no company has managed to invest into beating Apple's iPhone, beating Google's search engine or beating Facebook's social network. Each resulted in a ~trillion dollar valuation - so the motivation is there.\n\nIt should be easy to give a counterexample: give me a **single** example of a $500b+ first mover being commoditized. I'm not aware of a single one.\n\nI see no reason why autonomy would be any different - in fact it's ***harder*** to commoditize than most of the other tech I listed.\n\nAs long as Tesla is a benovelent monopolist that is content with say 30-40% profit margins & doesn't abuse their monopoly, there's few entities able to duplicate their tech, and governments won't interfere much.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">It should be easy to give a counterexample: give me a single example of a $500b+ first mover being commoditized.

The company doesn't make any money, the drivers hardly do any better, and the cost still seems high to customers.\n\nSo Tesla will sell autonomous vehicles to fleet owners, who save the cost of hiring a driver, but have to pay extra for the autonomy piece.  And customers will demand an even lower price. And many fleets will compete with each other.  But before long the fleets will undercut each other to oblivion and won't make any money, and definitely the Joe and Jane individual Tesla owners won't be able to make any money, only the fleet owners with the largest economies of scale will be able to.\n\nSo I think Tesla ends up only selling as many autonomous ride vehicles as there are yellow cabs.  The idea that anyone with a Model 3 can let it work for you when you're not using it to have it pay for itself is a fantasy.  I don't think there's any long term demand from that piece.  Short term, sure, right until everyone drives the profit right out of it.  Then we'll be stuck with an expensive AF autonomy option but little incentive to make it pay for itself.

The TSLA shares held by market makers are not tradeable either, and are not part of the float.\n\nThis is unusual, because TSLA's options open interest is - again, provably - 8x-10x larger than comparable peers such as AAPL, AMZN or MSFT. So the delta hedging inventory effect is **far** more significant.\n\n**Third:**\n\n- as I mentioned it in my comment, hedges related to convertible notes should not be taken as part of the regular equity short interest. This is an estimated 1-2% factor (Gary Black), which I'd subtract from the real short interest figure.\n\nSo yes, if I put 10 patient and knowledgeable enough investors who'd look into the details of this, I submit a good majority would agree that these factors should be considered and a precise calculation of the float should be reduced with all non-tradeable shares, not just Elon's.\n\nNote that these details don't really matter for other megacaps like AAPL, MSFT or AMZN, because their short interest is around 1.0% or lower. The exact percentage is so close to zero that the base 'float' denominator doesn't have any significant impact.\n\nBut for TSLA, the factors I listed are significant.\n\nI have supported or can support each and every point there with primary sources.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I disagree with your analysis (please don’t ban me for it). \n\nThe short float is a correct representation and anything else is just speculation.

Miles per year are now the product. \n\nThe US has about 3.25T miles per year and all my models assume the US will be 40% of the addressable market. Later this decade that could be 3.5-4.0T miles. The average driver makes 13k miles per year. Each percentage of the miles that you get relate to a scenario where people stop owning a car. So let's say someone barely needs a car, they'll pay more because the fixed costs of ownership outweigh the benefit of lower costs per mile. They might also have more problems parking and stuff like that. That might be the first 10%, they might pay the $1/mile. After that, prices need to drop fast to increase the market.

For example they might temporarily divert all the compact cars and dedicated robotaxi units to the fleet, but also a big portion of the 3/Y production for a short period of time.

Then the margins we get on robotaxis are entirely dependent on price competition (or lack of) and the price elasticity curve of the consumers. \n\nThe US needs about 50 million robotaxis at 55k occupied miles per year. Div 0.4 and the developed world needs 125 million total. Elon hinted winner takes 25%, my guess is more like 40% especially in the short term. At full saturation prices will be sub $20c/mile, but cheap dedicated robotaxis could still profit $9c/mile if we do it right. That caps out the robotaxi operating profits for Tesla at around $250B long term on about $500B of assets, which is still huge.

There have been so many cases of pltr’s software saving companies hundreds of millions of dollars. The software is fully vertically integrated and unlocks so much potential value of a company. In this sense, Pltr is basically a ticking time bomb to explode to 40+ a share once investors realize this is almost a mandatory software for any major corporations. Pltr’s software is too complex for any competitor to imitate or compete against. Pltr has already become too important of a company for US and western world to fail. Karp takes immense pride that Pltr aid US to  have the best military and industrial software in the AI arms race. Now finally on demo day, Pltr is proving their deep value in commercial application of Foundry software from consumer retail to pharmaceuticals. Last demo mainly focused on Gotham and the fundamental structure of Foundary. For this upcoming demo, Karp will present how Pltr’s software compliments every single industry and companies in Fortune 500. It is not an exaggeration that all 500 of the Fortune 500 companies will be using Pltr software one way or another in the next decades. Karp sees this happening himself and the guy is not joking. Karp is very cautious about not drawing too much attention to the stock but it is no secret that Pltr’s true value is far greater than 23 a share.

Intel is about 12, but I bought in at 10. \n\nThe next year or 2, they will sell silicon regardless if it's actually any good, people will still need work laptops and roll out small buisness server deployments, and it's not always about the very best, but what you can get for the price. They still have incredible sales channels for big clients too, and AMD splitting it's silicon priority 3 ways between GPU, desktop cpu and Server cpu means they just won't have enough capacity to satisfy demand. The launch of Intel GPU's could be a great move too, however short term I don't expect them to be fantastic until they split their architecture between productivity and gaming.\n\nI remember looking back at AMD, and the hiring of Lisa Su. She joined at $3-4 per share and now they are $80, but the huge shareprice growth wasn't really seen until about 3 years after her joining.\n\nIf Pat Gelsinger is the man to turn Intel around, he has to change it's culture and objectives. They have the talent, they have the resources, they have the clients, they have the branding. They have literally had everything to be successful available too them over the last 10 years, and have been heading the wrong direction.\n\nI see Intel as a long term buy & hold.
