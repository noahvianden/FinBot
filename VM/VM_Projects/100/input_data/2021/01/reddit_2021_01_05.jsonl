LA to NYC is not \"real world\" driving.  The freeway system is hyper standardized and compartmentalized.\n\nI would be interested in the specific test run because the claim of 'urban' in that statement is highly dis-informational.   The claim of \"urban\" implies pedestrians, bicycles, road-hazards, construction, lack of painted road lines(!), etc.\n\nI'm not anti-automous vehicles.   I'm fully aware technologically they'll happen.  However, I'm very sceptical of Tesla's route to this.  Which isn't only a problem with Tesla.\n\nIn the past ten years people have conflated \"AI\" with \"expert system\".  That's a term not really used since the smartphone/etc boom of this century.  However **every** system today in Facebook/Google/Tesla/SpaceX are much more accurately described by the term expert systems than the rubric AI.  AI is used because it's futurey sounding to lay people and conveys the 'general' concept to those lay people.  It does little to nothing to describe the actual algorithmic processes in use.\n\n\n\nAnyway, the relevancy of that is Tesla is basing their autonomous vehicles on the \"predictiveness\" of data driven heuristics.  This is an excellent mechanism for driving ad content, \"also liked\" content etc to End User screens related to their consumer consumption.\n\nIt is NOT a robust means by which to autonomously control a vehicle.  I'm not claiming Tesla is alone in this:  The US DoD is making a similar mistake in their autonomous vehicles, except you'll notice they have made a real-world concession to this problem:  those vehicles do not have autonomous \"attack\" ability - they can navigate, target etc, but only the \"human in the loop\" can press the \"fire\" button.\n\nThe reason for that is no amount of infinite historical data can reliably predict whether to destroy another person.\n\nWith Tesla the situation is slightly less murderous, however nonetheless  acute.  The underlying premise of current autonomous vehicles is that \"the car can drive everywhere a few thousand people have already driven.\"  That is, the historic data stems from collecting driving habits of many people.  This sort of car is useless in a situation \"out of band\" in which the car is the first vehicle \"going this way\".  That doesn't sound significant -- and to the vast majority Tesla is betting it won't be a problem - but to many people I suspect it will be a hurdle as equally difficult to surmount as are electric vehicle's ability to get over the \"battery range\" fears/phobias of people (granted most of that was created by anti-EV dis-information, the resulting fear is still present among buyers).\n\nAnyway, those are my thoughts.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "Yep.

They don't write code to make it turn left or right, the neural network produces a value that tells them what needs to be done and they write code to apply that action. For example, the neural network produces a value between -1 and 1 for the steering wheel position with 0 being straight, and the Tesla code turns the wheel to that position. All the logic is contained within the neural network. That being said, they only know what it will do through testing. The engineers can predict what it might do in a certain situation based on testing, but there's no way to know for certain what it will actually do because it is an independent intelligence.

Since you paid 250 for it, it has to go 250 below 480 (480 - 250 = 230) for you to make 100% on your bet. \n\nSo hell no you shouldn't do this. \n\nOh and 4, even if you think Tesla is too high its hard to be against a company that is going to be growing at 50% per year. IT is pretty high but it could stagnate over 500 for 2-3 years and still be fine and you'd be fucked for 25K. \n\nThis is such a bad trade. \n\nWhen I trade options, I try to make sure I will make 100% super easy!

One robotaxi, in 2030, might drive 100k miles a year. It doesnt need to sleep or take breaks, and that's about 300 miles a day. Of that 100,000 miles, say 60 percent of them are making money. \n\nThat's sorta low. \n\nSay Tesla charges the USA federal tax deduction for mileage, 0.58 cents a mile. Math it out, you get 0.35 per mile revenue. \n\nA Tesla costs a private citizen, right now, .09 cents a mile to drive 100k miles. I got that by Google Tesla cost per mile and scaling from 15k to 100k. Tesla owning the car would not need to pay for the profit margin(about 30%), would insure itself, get all sorts of scale related discounts, and by 2030, would have a more efficient battery. It already has a more efficient battery, actual - it'll put the 4680 in cars this year. \n\nAnyway, cost per mile is .04 cents. You dont need to pay a driver, after all. So profit then is 0.31, or 31,000/yr for each car. Tesla will stop selling cars altogether and just use production to grow its robotaxi fleet. If taxi fleet starts at 2 million in 2023 and grows by 50 percent a year, Tesla would have about 100 million cars. \n\nNow, that seems a little high to me, mostly because last year Elon Musk has said he'd top out at 20+ million cars per year, and the last year of that calculation is 37 million. But then, I think they'd grow the fleet faster, and the profit numbers are ridiculous anyway. \n\nSo sure, 100 million cars, 31,000 a year is 3 trillion in profit a year. So you could cut the car number in three to 30 million and end up with 1 trillion profit. \n\nAn overly reasonable multiplier (Amazon's is 90) of 33x would make a company that made 3 trillion in profit worth 100 trillion dollars, or 100k a share. \n\nThat shit ain't priced in even at 10k price today. And it doesnt require world domination, either. 100 million is the number of new cars sold every year. It requires them to solve FSD and get regulators to agree. \n\nThat's the bull case, everything works, great success. \n\nWhat's priced in right now is if Tesla does not succeed at a single thing it's trying, it just continues scaling and making good EVs, then the price would be 2500 in 2030, and 12 percent a year growth from 2020 would give you a stock price of 803. Which looks damn familiar, doesn't it? \n\ntl;dr: Tesla stock has priced in Tesla's steady growth in making EVs, and not a single one of the further innovations they're going for.

Extending it out to 10 years gets you 98 million total, with 37 million for the last year. That last does seem faintly silly, as I'm pretty sure Tesla would cap out at 25 million a year. I think they'll be making more than 2 million cars a year in 2023, though, so that evens it out and ends up with roughly 100 million cars in the fleet again if you add a cap. \n\nTheir are roughly 70 million new cars sold every year, and about 1.42 billion cars on the planet, according to google. 273 million cars in the US. And clearly Tesla doesn't just service the US. That really would be capped, way lower, as every taxi drives much more than the average person. \n\nStill think the 100 million is the weakest bit of the model.

Macerich currently owns 51 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 47 regional shopping centers.  Macerich owns some of the nation‚Äôs highest-earning malls, including Tysons Corner Center in Northern Virginia.\n\nhttps://wamu.org/story/20/12/18/despite-the-pandemic-and-popularity-of-online-retail-shoppers-are-still-flocking-to-tysons-mall/\n\n$MAC is an owner of a multitude of well-positioned, high-end shopping centers. \n\nWe aren‚Äôt talking about your local mall that is half vacant and has been for years, their properties are high-end, destination attractions:\n\nhttps://www.macerich.com/Leasing/Find \n\nThe low interest rates benefit REIT‚Äôs and allow $MAC to do deals like this:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inquirer.com/real-estate/commercial/preit-macerich-fashion-district-control-bankruptcy-gallery-20201217.html%3foutputType=amp\n\nI know what you are thinking, malls are closed, no one is going to bricks and mortar, but as you saw above at Tyson‚Äôs Corner, people are out and shopping. \n\nPent up demand + stimulus = profits.  \n\nAs of October 7th all 47 of the Company's major retail properties nationwide were fully open for business, now that LA County has approved indoor mall reopenings. \n\nIn LA as of 12/27:\n\nhttp://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/docs/protocols/Reopening_ShoppingCenters.pdf\n\nREIT‚Äôs - Real Estate Investment Trusts - some of the most beaten down stocks by the pandemic and this one, I believe has significant upside from its current price level.\n\nWhat I like about $MAC is this:\n\nRent collections continued to improve, with collection rates increasing to approximately 81% in October of 2020 and 80% in the third quarter of 2020, up from approximately 61% in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nMall portfolio occupancy, including closed centers, was 90.8% at September 30, 2020, compared to 91.3% at June 30, 2020.   \n\nMall tenant annual sales per square foot for the portfolio was $718 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, compared to $800 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2019. This sales metric excludes the period of COVID-19 closure for each tenant.\n\nAverage rent per square foot increased 1.8% to $62.29 at September 30, 2020, compared to $61.16 at September 30, 2019.\n\nApproximately 93% of the square footage that was open prior to COVID-19 is now open and operating. \n\nCash receipts continued to improve, increasing to approximately 80% in the third quarter of 2020 from approximately 61% in the second quarter of 2020. \n\nAs of November 2, 2020, the Company has collected approximately 81% of rent for October. \n\nWith continued improvement in operating cash flow, liquidity also continued to improve. \n\nCash and cash equivalents increased from $573 million at June 30, 2020 to $630 million as of September 30, 2020.\n\nBottom line, this company is getting healthier and owns prime real-estate, with stimulus and vaccines upon us - the animal spirits are ready to be unleashed. \n\nWhat I like THE MOST above the value is the potential short squeeze that is coming (re: $GME and dare I say $TSLA). \n\nShort Interest (Shares Short)\n80,670,000\n\nShort Interest Ratio (Days To Cover)\n14.7\n\nShort Percent of Float\n58.46 %\n\nShares Float\n137,990,000\n\nLastly, I put this together for everyone that has said I‚Äôm just a ‚Äústeel pumper‚Äù.\n\nI‚Äôm anything but. \n\nI believe Tech has had its year in 2020. \n\n2021 will be the year of finding value with all of the current stretched valuations. \n\nCommodities, travel, shopping, real estate - they will all benefit from a weakened dollar, vaccines, stimulus and low interest/borrowing rates. \n\nGood luck and do your own research.", "id": "kqov54", "created_utc": 1609815364.0, "score": 346, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "Can‚Äôt do it.

A few years back, Simon Properties $SPG tried to take them over for $90 per shave. That tells me $MAC is surely worth a lot more than $17... the number crunchers at Simon can't be that far off? Can they?\n\nSome quotes from the CEO from last quarters call (Q3):\n\n‚ÄúBy October, for centers opened at least 8 weeks, sales were up to 90% of pre-COVID levels‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAs of today, we have significant liquidity and currently have approximately $675 million of cash on the balance sheet.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLooking at traffic, in general, it‚Äôs running about 80% compared to a year ago. Some of that has to do with capacity limits, particularly for restaurants and also for having no seating in the food court. Sales, on the other hand, are running on average 90% of a year ago, which means there, I‚Äôd say, higher capture rate.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOne thing I would point out is, given the current cash flow, even though it‚Äôs less than had been forecasted at the beginning of the year, it‚Äôs significantly in excess of the current dividend level and that ought to allow us a fair amount of cash flow from operations to use in the near-term for de-levering, and that would be the play.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúLooking at the balance of 2020, the pandemic has shown that good retail is not going away, especially in A quality centers. Digitally native brands appreciate, more than ever, the profitability of their physical stores. Big format retailers got active again in the third quarter and you‚Äôll hear some of the specifics from Doug. Although we are still in the midst of COVID, our centers are operating at 90% capacity, sales levels of 90% pre-COVID. And even if you look at one of the more challenging categories, restaurants, in our portfolio, we have 247 restaurants and 94% of those are open today.‚Äù\n\n6) Even after this whole mess of a pandemic. $MAC is still cash flow positive and paying a dividend of $0.15/share per quarter.\n\nThis does not sound like a business that is dying...

DOW got further lifted by action from BA, GS, CVX, and INTC (who's really only being carried by MU). Small caps eclipsed SPX and IXIC today with RUT/IWM up as high as almost 2% during intraday high as value play starts looking more appealing. RUT closed up 1.7% and IWM closed up 1.61%.\n\n* \"I'm totes not dead.\" Says Jack Ma, according to a person familiar with the situation who's relaying the info to a CNBC  reporter on Ma's whereabouts. The beleaguered CEO who's in the crosshair of the CCP is keeping it easy and out of the limelight after running afoul of his overlords by talking up CCP's heavy handed action towards Ant Group. Who knew if your fucking financial empire touches the livelihood of 90% of the country there may be consequences if you don't toe the line. BABA closed the day up 5.51% to $240. Meanwhile, PDD touches new ATH and closed the day up 12.24% to $187 while JD is up 10.61% to $95.\n\n* Many underlying in the Chinese ADR/ADS sector also gets a lift today partly thanks to NYSE's overnight about-face on delisting Chinese Telecoms. BILI hits new ATH and closed up 8.15% to $102.46 thanks to favorable reception from their secondary listing on the Heng Sheng while TCEHY closed the day up 5.23% to $76.66.\n\n* Semi sector is on a run today thanks to MU, with Citi upping the NAND and DRAM manufacturer from Sell all the way up to Buy with a PT of freaking $100 as we enter another cyclical season. RBC Capital also raised PT from $57 to $83, Deutsche Bank from $75 to $83. Will MU $90 be back in favor and no longer a meme strike? Find out later this week. F in the chat for MartyMoho. If only he bought fooking shares and ride through two more additional cyclical season and a global pandemic. Ez dub. MU closed up 4.33% to $77, LRCX closed up 3.46% to $494, and AMAT closed up 3% to $89. MU reports earnings later this Thursday after market close.\n\n* GM popped 2% when news broke at 10:29 on positive US sales number from Q4, and while shares were fading slightly as the market digest the news, eventually the positive momentum took over and shares closed the day up 2.84% to $41.66. ROKU pop to close up 5.44%, closing at $335 thanks to WFC analyst raising PT from $275 to $414 (yep) and keeping his overweight rating. \n\n* Today's big movers: FUBO was up as high as 21%, ~~M-A-R-A was up as high 23% while B-N-G-O drilled more than -30% during intraday lows after an initial halt in the early mornings.~~ FUBO closed up 12.83% to $27.35, ~~M-A-R-A closed up 23.43% to $13.59, and B-N-G-O closed down -31.25% to $4.95~~.\n\n* The GA run-off election is on the market mindset as voters are heading to the polls. Meanwhile, Congress is set to confirm Biden's win over Trump, a procedural formality that generally receives little news coverage but not in the current timeline. Expect POTUS to rage over Pence on Twitter later tonight if the latter confirms Biden's Electoral College win. Look to weed and clean energy sector for pops if the Dems somehow wins both seat. No doubt many WSBer have already loaded up on FDs to showcase the sick gains porn tomorrow if the magic happens.\n\n* In WSB meme stock land, PLTR is up more than 5% but those with OTM Jan 15 calls are likely having their ass handed to them by the greeks, while a similar story exist over at GME as the stock fades away morning gain to close the day up 0.70% as theta rampage $20c, $22c, and $23c (if your strike is even further out then RIP to you). MT and steel gang are faring better, with the stock retaking yesterday's high and closed up 2.84% to 24.63. Steel prices continues to rip and earnings will be early next month on Feb 11th.\n\n* Affirm, the online installment loan lender for Americans who can't fucking afford whatever they're buying, is planning to IPO by offering 24 mil shares at $33 to $38 per share.

I mean you obviously care enough to worry about what everyone thinks.   I on the other hand don't need to see it since i don't give a shit about your gains or loses.   \n\n2.5 to 15.5k?   wow.     I also invested back in 2018/19.   roughly the same amount as you did on the calls (that you lost) and then a bit more in 2019 as it fell under $200 pre split to average down.    Today's price with the AH price went up $24.17 when I posted.   That means my original position (that i never sold) gained almost 16k in value.   Today.  In the last month it is 76k.   In the last 6 it is 311k.  In the last year 431k.    So yes you are right.  I have no idea what is going to happen with the stock price short term.

The strategy you pick depends on what your objective is. Yes I could pick a long term movement strat that will have a much higher probability of being successful, but the tradeoff is you get a lower return. If you want higher returns and you want them soon(like I do) you will have to take on more risk. \n\nFor example my trade here (the first spread) is risking 8.6k for a potential 55k gain or 639%, if TSLA closes 5.4% lower on Friday than it closed today. So for this to be a good trade the probability of that happening needs to be greater than 1/6.39 or 15%. I think the probability of that happening is 60-70%. Is my estimate right? Maybe not, maybe it‚Äôs much lower or higher, and whether your estimates are relatively accurate or not will become clear to you over time. \n\nThe reason I pursue the short term strategy as opposed to the long term one is because I want to make a lot of money quickly.

And then in 2023 you should be sitting on 5 million.  Then in 2025 50 million.   50 million in 6 years starting with 50k.  Virtually guaranteed.   Sounds easy.

Is that luck?  well i am sure there is some element to it.    But you know what is even harder then buying a company?    Holding a company through the ups and downs.  That isn't luck.   That is having conviction in what you believe about the company you are investing in.  \n\nI took my first major position in 2018 when the stock price was around $60 (split adjusted) only to watch the price slowly bleed down to $36.   So what would you have done?  I took a very significant amount if money and invested it only to watch the paper loss almost hit almost 50%.  So here is the point where people will differ.  Someone looking for the quick score who has no understanding or belief in the company would probably cut their losses.   But instead I reevaluated, decided I still saw massive potential and averaged down.   I took a very significant risk when I did this because I have to liquidate other more stable investments to do it.   But I did and that has paid out.  \n\nNow even further then that.   Now that the stock price has gone on a tear what did i do?   Did I sell when I hit a 100% gain?  People with no understanding or conviction would.   Or at 200%. 500%   what about when the stock hit the skids in March because of COVID?   Did I sell then to lock in gains?
