Many large North American cities which are tourist destinations, including Toronto, New York, Vancouver, and San Francisco, are currently facing a housing availability crisis. AirBNB has contributed to the problem by increasing property values to the point that many residents can't afford them, and by effectively removing real estate from the housing market. I understand that AirBNB is not the only contributing factor, but they are a factor and laws have been passed specifically targeting their business model:\n\nIn January 2018, San Fransisco passed short term housing laws: \"San Francisco's strict short-term home rental laws just kicked in on Wednesday, and are already having a big effect on SF-based Airbnb.

Right now the majority of major cities do not have similar laws, and I believe AirBNB's share price is blind to that risk.\n\nI also personally don't like the fact that AirBNB's current interface demands that guests submit scans of their driver's license as a condition of booking.

{"title": "Complete PLTR DD ahead of Demo Day (Valuation Included)", "selftext": "# Company Overview\n\nPalantir technologies is an American software company founded in 2003 and headquartered in Colorado that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nThey started building software for the intelligence community in the US to assist in counterterrorism investigations by helping them identify patterns hidden deep within large datasets.\n\nLater they realized that similarly to the intelligence community, commercial institutions did not have the most effective tools to manage and make sense of the data involved in large projects.\n\nPalantir has now developed two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham which serves primarily the intelligence community, and Palantir Foundry for commercial purposes.\n\nPalantir went public on September 30, 2020 through a direct public offering. The company opened for trading at $10 a share, giving it an initial valuation of about $22B. As of the date of this publishing, Palantir stock is trading at $25.98, with a Market Cap of $44.26B, and 52-w high of $33.50.\n\n# Understanding the Business\n\n**Value Proposition**\n\nInstitutions often rely on various single-purpose software solutions which support the specific workflows of their operations such as customer relationship management and financial planning. Each new software creates a new silo within an already fragmented data landscape.\n\nWhen it comes to making operational decisions, institutions are left spending significant time and resources to unify their data. By the time the question is answered, the underlying data may be stale.\n\nA central operating system for data\n\nPalantir’s software allows institutions to reorganize the various independent data systems that support their operations into a unified data asset which facilitates advanced data analysis, knowledge management, and collaboration.\n\nAugmenting existing data systems, not displacing\n\nAt a large manufacturer, Palantir does not build machine production ERP software, instead, Palantir’s software connects their production ERP data with other relevant systems. By integrating existing solutions into our central operating system, organizations can choose to maintain key historic investments without having to rebuild their entire data infrastructure.\n\nMaking data actionable\n\nGotham and Foundry enable their users to put data in context, using language that people understand. They transform data into objects that make sense to everyone in an organization. Data is represented not as cells in a spreadsheet, or exports from a single system, but as entities, events, relationships, consequences, and decisions.\n\nTheir ontology management systems allow organizations to create their own description of the world, starting from a set of basic components: objects (such as people or events), properties (attributes), and relationships that tie objects together.\n\nUnderstand the history of data and decisions\n\nPalantir’s software tracks each piece of data in the system to its source and records all changes that have been made to a dataset or data object. Users can distinguish between data derived from a source system or data created by another user, and if a dataset has been updated/modified, the user can also identify the fact that the data was updated, the action, and the logic used to perform the update. This allows users to easily explain where the data, logic, and decisions originate.\n\nEnable users to work together even in the most complex circumstances\n\nThe versioning and branching capabilities of their software enables thousands of users across departments and organizations to work on the same datasets, and actively collaborate on new models and analysis.\n\nUsers can safely branch a view or a dataset into an isolated sandbox where the user is able to build or experiment as they wish and may merge successful experiments back into the main dataset. Each version of a dataset is saved so that it remains protected and available for concurrent access.\n\nEnforce rigorous and reliable data protection\n\nPalantir’s software was designed to embrace the complexity of security clearances, institutional boundaries, and varying data sensitivity levels. Organizations are able to secure each piece of information and define the privileges users require to perform a specific action on a specific resource. The central authorization system creates an audit trial of user activity which allows oversight officials to monitor behavior, identify potential violations, and investigate anomalies.\n\nAI/ML and operational change through data-driven decisions\n\nTheir software infrastructure also enables organizations to combine simple math, third-party black box models, and machine trained models of the different components of their businesses in a graph made up of nodes (for example, each node can be a manufacturing unit and distribution site in a supply chain) where each model can describe the properties of a node, resulting in an interactive digital simulation of an entire supply chain.\n\nThe AI/ML interface surfaces critical information about models, including plots, validation statistics, model stages, parameters and metadata.\n\n**Revenue Streams**\n\nPalantir’s revenue streams consists of their two main software, Gotham which was designed primarily for the defense and intelligence sectors, and Foundry for the commercial sector. However, the platforms are not exclusive to either sector, for example, Gotham is also offered to commercial customers in the financial services industry. The two platforms can either be used separately or bundled together as a single ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, revenue is more or less evenly split between the government and commercial sector.\n\nIt is important to note that for the government sector Palantir has to participate through a procurement process against other contractors who also sell custom tools.\n\nGotham\n\nIts main tools include:\n\nGraph – a whiteboard like interface for users to explore, visualize, and interact with entities, their properties and their networks. Users can create or edit data in the graph and resolve duplicate objects to ensure robust data quality.\n\nGaia – lets users plan, execute, and report on operations via a shared live map. Live maps track real-time data and users drag and drop objects from other Gotham applications directly into Gaia.\n\nDossier – is a live collaboration document editor to share analysis and discover intelligence. Users can collaborate across teams and organizations to create a living, interactive, and up-to-date document.\n\nVideo – an application designed to interact with both streaming and historical video data.

The TAM for the government sector is $63B and for the commercial sector $56B. Within the government TAM, $37B is international and $26B is domestic.\n\nAccording to [Statista’s market forecast](https://www.statista.com/outlook/14000/100/software/worldwide) revenue in the software market is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 7.4% between 2021 and 2025.\n\n**Industry Fundamentals**\n\nEmbrace digital transformation or risk getting disrupted\n\nIt has become evident that companies which embrace digital transformation persist, while businesses that fail to transform or transform too late will disappear. According to a [Harvard Business Review report](https://hbr.org/sponsored/2017/07/digital-transformation-is-racing-ahead-and-no-industry-is-immune-2) digital disruption extinguished 52% of Fortune 500 companies between 2000 and 2017.\n\nWe have repeatedly seen that pathbreaking institutions that use data to transform their core operations are the ones that win.\n\nBuy or Build\n\nInstitutions often resort to the default approach of attempting to build a custom solution themselves. However, according to a recent [report by The Standish Group](https://www.standishgroup.com/about), of 50,000 custom software projects from more than a 1,000 organizations, only 23% that were started from scratch were completed on time and on budget, while 56% of all projects were either overdue or over budget. Additionally, only 12% of organization-wide digital transformation projects were considered successful.\n\nAdditionally, according to the [NewVantage Partners 2020 Big Data and AI Executive Survey](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200106005280/en/NewVantage-Partners-Releases-2020-Big-Data-and-AI-Executive-Survey), business adoption of Big Data continues to be a struggle, with 73.4% of firms citing this as an ongoing challenge.\n\nPalantir provides the example of a U.S. Military department which spent more than $1 billion building an enterprise resource planning system from scratch. The system was never delivered, and the project was terminated.\n\nCrisis & Instability\n\nA [survey from AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/blog/news/agents-of-transformation-report-2020/) reports that 71% of IT professionals said COVID-19 has caused their businesses to implement digital transformation projects within weeks rather than the typical months or years, and 65% of respondents said they implemented digital transformation projects during the pandemic that had been previously dismissed.\n\n# Competitive Landscape & Risks\n\n**Competition**\n\nPalantir’s main competitors include:\n\nInternal software development – At first, organizations frequently attempt to build their own data platforms with the help of consultants, IT services companies, packaged and open-source software, and sizable internal IT resources.\n\nAnd two software companies with very similar business models:\n\n[Alteryx](https://www.alteryx.com/) – founded 23 years ago and based in California, Alteryx is a public company with FY 2019 revenues of $418M and more than 1,290 employees. Alteryx is focused on providing solutions to the commercial sector and as of 2019 they had approximately 6,100 customers in more than 90 countries. Amongst their main customers are Chevron Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, Nasdaq Inc, Netflix, salesforce.com, Toyota, Twitter, and Uber Technologies.\n\n[Semantic AI](https://www.semantic-ai.com/company) – is a privately-held software firm based in California, Semantic AI was founded in 2001 and after 9/11 it was used as “platform by choice” by the intelligence community. Similar to Palantir, they have gained significant adoption in the Defense and Law Enforcement communities and have recently launched their enterprise intelligence platform.\n\n**Competitive Strategy**\n\nCustomer acquisition\n\nPalantir’s customer acquisition strategy targets large-scale, hard-to-execute opportunities at large government and commercial institutions. The high installation costs, high failure risks, complexity of data environments, and the long sales cycle associated with these opportunities raise the barriers to entry for competition.\n\nAdditionally, in the first phase of Palantir’s customer acquisition strategy, they provide minimal risk to their customers through short-term pilot deployments of their software at no or low cost to them. As the customer increases the usage of the platform across its operations, Palantir’s revenue and margins grow significantly.\n\nSoftware engineers on the front line\n\nIn order to fully address the most complex challenges of their customers, Palantir sends their Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs), in order to experience and understand the problem firsthand. By working alongside their customers, FDEs gain a deep understanding of their needs, how and why they make decisions, and how they calculate trade-offs.\n\nLeverage experience in both private and public sector\n\nTo the commercial sector, Palantir offers software which was designed to be secure enough to handle national secrets and stable enough to support soldiers’ wartime decisions. To the government sector, they offer software which incorporates and reflects Palantir’s experience of working across 36 industries and years spent in the field.\n\nPalantir’s strategic relationships last for years\n\nBy the end of 2019, Palantir’s top 20 customers had an average relationship of 6.6 years.\n\nPalantir has chosen sides\n\nTheir software is exclusively available to the United States and its allies in Europe and around the world.\n\n**Growth Strategy**\n\nBecome the industry default\n\nPalantir’s current and potential customers are some of the largest enterprise in the world. They intend to broaden the platform’s reach through partnerships that establish their platforms as the central operating system for entire industries.\n\nThis model has been successfully implemented in the aviation industry where, through its partnership with Airbus, work with more than a 100 airlines and 15 airline suppliers.\n\nContinue to grow their direct sales force\n\nPalantir’s decision to grow their sales force in recent years has resulted in a number of significant new customers, including Fortune 100 companies as well as a number of leading government agencies in the U.S. and other countries.\n\nIncrease their reach with existing customers\n\nTo drive revenue growth at an account, Palantir uses a number of sales and marketing strategies which include:\n\n* Creating partnerships to extend the platform beyond the customer’s four walls into the operations of their partners and suppliers\n* Selling additional productized cross-industry software capabilities\n* Selling strategic implementations of Palantir’s software against specific use cases\n\nFor Q3 2020 Palantir’s average revenue per customer had increased 38% compared to the same period last year.\n\nBecome the default operating system for the U.S. government\n\nPalantir’s software has been tested and improved over years of use across industries and various government agencies in the U.S. who have been able to deploy Palantir’s platforms rapidly with minor configurations.\n\nPalantir already works with government agencies such as the U.S. Army, Navy, and Airforce, CDC, Department of Homeland Security, FDA, and SEC.\n\nNew methods of customer acquisition and partnership\n\nAs Palantir considers growing into new markets outside the U.S., they may consider entering into partnerships with strategic organizations that operate in their target market.\n\nFor example, in Japan they launched a partnership with SOMPO Holdings, Inc.. one of the largest insurance companies in the country, to help grow their commercial and government business in the Japanese market.\n\n**Moats**\n\nR&D expenditure\n\nSince 2008 and up to 2019, they have invested a total of $1.5B in research and development.\n\nNetwork effects\n\nEvery data source that is integrated to the system, and every action taken by a developer, data scientist, or operational user, is made accessible to all other users at the institution.\n\nAt a financial services customer, network effects enabled Palantir’s software to scale from a single use case to more than 70 workstreams across compliance, front office, risk, and internal audit desks. Each new application was built on a shared foundation of integrated systems, user groups, and existing applications.\n\nAdditionally, each customer on their platform generates network effects. Palantir can leverage the knowledge acquired and capabilities developed for a customer within a specific industry and incorporate it into the platform for the benefit of all customers across industries. For example, capabilities of Palantir’s platform that were originally developed to help optimize production of crude oil, has been adapted by manufacturers of medical equipment to optimize supply chains.\n\nIn addition to supporting individual institutions, Palantir’s platforms have the capacity to become the central operating system for entire industries and sectors.\n\nRegulation\n\nSection 2377 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (“FASA”) requires the U.S. government to first consider readily available commercial items before pursuing acquisition of custom developed items. Palantir’s software is a commercial item within the meaning of the law. A custom government solution built by a consulting company, is not.\n\nIn 2016, Palantir won a lawsuit against the Army, challenging its decision to pursue a software development contract for the replacement of its battlefield intelligence system. In 2018, the ruling was upheld, and the US Court of Appeals ordered the Army to consider existing commercially available products. After testing real products, the Army selected Palantir’s software to deploy tactical units across the force.\n\n**Other Relevant Risks**\n\nPrivacy and civil liberties\n\nPalantir is not in the business of collecting, mining, or selling data. They build software platforms that enable customers to integrate their own data – data they already have. Palantir claims to be committed to ensuring their software is effective as possible while preserving individuals’ fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties.\n\nCustomer concentration\n\nFor the 9 months ended September 2020, Palantir’s top 3 customers accounted for 27% of their revenue.\n\n# Financial Summary\n\n**Proforma Balance Sheet**\n\n[https://postimg.cc/ykzC91FN](https://postimg.cc/ykzC91FN)\n\n**Income Statement**\n\n[https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4](https://postimg.cc/yD1qQLp4)\n\nPalantir’s revenue has had a CAGR of 68.8% since inception, and 27.6% for the last three years.\n\nFor the 9 months ended September 2020 compared to the same period last year:\n\n* Revenue of the government sector increased by $177M (73%), of the increase 84% was from existing customers.\n* Revenue of the commercial sector increased by $80M (30%).\n* COGS, Sales and Marketing, R&D, and SG&A expense increases consist primarily of an increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to recognition of cumulative stock-based compensation expense upon the Direct Listing related to the company’s restricted stock units. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in traveling expense related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPalantir uses a Contribution Margin as a key business metric to evaluate their financial performance, which has improved consistently over the last 4 quarters. In short, by achieving a higher contribution margin, the increase in revenue required for Palantir to break-even is smaller.\n\n**Proforma Cashflow Statement**\n\n[https://postimg.cc/64CsSgNw](https://postimg.cc/64CsSgNw)\n\nFor the 9 months ended September 2020:\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of common stock\n\n# Investment Decision\n\n**Valuation Results**\n\n[https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv](https://postimg.cc/kBF3v0cv)\n\nThe result of my [Valuation Model](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zMy8dkNFib7h-FkFtPZMf9bhH8DjE3XKf5t-HB_c5eY/edit?usp=sharing) indicate a **Value of Equity per share of $28.38**\n\nMayor assumptions of the valuation model include:\n\n* By 2031, Palantir will gain 6% Market Share of a $119B market that grows 7.4% annually. This implies Palantir’s revenue will grow at a CAGR of 30% for 10 years.\n* Palantir will achieve US GAAP operating margins of 23% by 2031.\n* Terminal year growth rate of 5% and WACC of 7.5% after reaching a Beta of 1.0.\n* Risk free rate of 2.5% and Equity Risk Premium of 5.5%\n\nFollow the link to view the valuation model, it include references to all assumptions. Please feel free to download it, play with it, and share your conclusions.\n\n**Investment Decision**\n\nI believe that at its current price PLTR is a buy opportunity for the following reasons:\n\n* The model’s revenue and margin growth assumptions are achievable and likely to be exceeded if PLTR successfully executes their growth strategies.\n* The industry is driven by strong fundamentals, organizations that do not embrace digital transformation and big data will cease to exist.\n* Even though Palantir’s moat is currently narrow, it could expand significantly if they are successful in establishing their software as a central operating system for various industries.", "id": "l2d1wp", "created_utc": 1611279546.0, "score": 3437, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 391, "comments": [{"body": "This is how everyone should post a DD about a stock they want to promote.

If you look at the financial statements alone sure maybe they paint a nice picture but without detailed review of the notes you never know what really is going on.\n\nAnd if expense increases are primarily due to stock based compensation and direct listing costs shouldn’t that make you suspicious? Especially since your main thesis is growth than a significant R&D expense or even higher SG&A is not a bad thing. \n\nAnd what if they are actually doing significant R&D but they decide too early in the development process that the software they are developing is feasible and can be sold. If this were the case (I’m not saying it is, I haven’t even looked at their 10-K) then their assets would be growing unsustainably and could mean significant write downs to come.\n\nThis is the type of stuff you should be on the lookout for and that sort of information is not available on first look at the financial statements.

I used margin to buy 100 shares in premarket for $864.75 and sold a call at open, that paid $4834 later near the low of the day I sold another which paid $3939 and used margin to buy another 100 @ $821.96.

{"title": "Blackberry ($BB) DD – Why $BB is Mooning and heading to Mars $🚀$🚀$🚀$", "selftext": "(Discretion: First post here. Go easy on me fellow WSB. I also put a lot of 🚀🚀🚀 here but pleaseeee do your own DD if you're gonna buy $BB)\n\n**Intro:**\n\nMost people look at Blackberry (formerly known as RIM) as a dead cellphone company. A company that’s basically a prehistoric dinosaur at this point with a small cybersecurity portfolio left of their business. Their inability to adapt against cell phone companies such as Apple & Android vendors has caused their main revenue driver to plummet into non-existence. However, their business has been able to keep afloat in the past few years due to their competitive advantages around cybersecurity. Many government officials & corporations till this day still use QNX from BB as their mobile/security platform due to these advantages.\n\n**Word on the street:**\n\nAround last year summer, word on the street was that BB is looking to partner with Amazon on a EV platform around data sensors, automation, and cybersecurity. Stock prices at the time was around $4-6 CAD. Just looking at financials alone and the amount of $ revenue they bring in compared to the industry standards, $BB stock price seemed quite undervalued in comparison. However, this made sense since $BB has failed to deliver and disappointed shareholders over the past years.\n\nWhether we’d like to believe it or not -- EV (electric vehicle) is the future in the next 5 years. Whether that is one day where we run out of fossil fuel… or people moving towards environmentally friendly options, there is much to be explored and the market is relatively immature.\n\nIn today’s world, every automotive company is chasing EV currently and wants to avoid becoming the next “Blockbuster” prehistoric company. The question we need to ask next is, “Do they have the necessary tools & solutions to help them transition in that journey?” To answer this, I will give a quick example. Most farmers do not build a tractor to farm their crops. They instead go out and buy one than to waste precious time seeing their crops die. I believe this holds true for automotives as they lack the necessary skill sets to develop a platform that can run cybersecurity, data sensors, and automation for their cars. If you didn’t know already, popular car services such as Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto all already operate on top of QNX today in our cars today. Amazon’s partnership will only help accelerate that movement as QNX will be linked to their public cloud to do over-the-air monitoring, upgrade, security, collision crashing assistance, autonomous driving, AI machine learning, and many many more.\n\n**What’s happened recently**:\n\nWell… their partnership with Amazon came true around December. In addition to this, they’ve sold off their 💩 cell phone patents to Huawei so they can finally focus purely on Cybersecurity and EV.\n\nIcing to the cake, they’ve recently won a settlement against Facebook so they gotta pay up that $$$ to $BB which hasn’t been reflected in their quarterly report yet.\n\nSpaceX, Zoom, Qualcomm, governments, and many more are working with $BB as we speak today. Sony recently just announced their partnership with $BB for their next upcoming car last week. Overall, lots of exciting news back to back.\n\nThis explains the excitement around $BB and why it’s been taking off recently. I believe they will continue to do so as the EV and Cybersecurity market continues to evolve from its infancy. (With other digital \"currencies\" growing, would there be a bigger cybersecurity play for $BB? Who knows)\n\n**So.. what are the Risks:**\n\n3 things I can think of currently:\n\n1. No Revenue Growth despite all of the above\n2. EV doesn’t take off as much as it should. COVID is impacting sales of cars or sales of anything in general. Self-explanatory there\n3. Someone creates a better platform over $BB\n\nThis all depends if $BB is capable of hiring great salespeople to execute on their job. Only time will tell.\n\n**TLDR; In Conclusion**\n\nMost boomers will avoid $BB because they think it’s a cellphone company. Anyone that’s googled it recently will know that this isn’t true. I personally think $BB is very undervalued and with the reasons I’ve explained above, I feel there’s much potential for the company to grow. Lots of people are going to be selling it when there’s a bit of a profit but I think the company’s barely scratched it’s potential.\n\nFinally, the ret….s WSB from reddit are using lingos such as “to the moon” and “Rockets 🚀🚀” for $BB so we all know people are dumping hard on this to make it the next big thing.\n\nLet’s head to Mars bro📈 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nYours truly,\n\n🚀🚀🚀 🌝👽 🛸\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(editing to say thank you for upvoting, awards, comments, and PMs!

EV have sensors so sure. Automation as in self driving? Sure but QNX IVY isn’t about self driving and would be very late to the game if it was.

That’s the only possibility for it’s up value to be real. \n\n\nStocks are overlooked all the time. \n\n\nMaybe no profit last 4yr because reinvesting and research expenses etc. and accounting write downs (non cash). But cash flow from ops is also negative I think, or not great. \n\n\nEV or not, car sales are probably not spiking any time soon so nothing changed on the sales front for BB IVY, unless these new deals are guaranteed revenue. We’d have to know their details. \n\n\nTech price to sales is 5-10x. MSFT is at 10 P/S. Is BB on par with MSFT? \n\nBB was at 3-4 P/S and now is at 7.5 P/S which is more reasonable for them. (TTM - trailing 12mo) (https://ycharts.com/companies/BB/ps_ratio)\n\n\nP/S doesn’t factor in growth of the future. If sales growth then the ratio will go down unless the stock goes down.\n\n\n If we can confirm based on the items above that BB sales will increase (which, without the details to confirm it I would argue yes; how much, unknown) then there is room for BB price to increase. \n\n\nBB price is fair to increase a bit from its current price as well to perhaps 8.50x P/S. That would put the stock at $14.11. \n\n\nThrow in some growth there and in a year it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see **$18.43 share price. **\n\n\nAgain this assumes the initial above points are all vetted and the revenue is strong.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "are you an equity analyst or something?

{"title": "$GME Thesis: We have near no effect on Gamestop's price, what's really happening and big brain shit inside -- oh and rockets", "selftext": "Disclaimer: This is all satire, my thoughts, from my brain. If you take investment advice from someone on the internet you should rethink shit a bit\n\nI wrote a comment today (pasted below the rocket ship horizontal rule) -- but people said I should make a post out of it. I don't give a fuck what you think about it, do with it what you will.\n\n**TLDR:** GME🚀 bears r fuk\n\n🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎  🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎\n\n**The questions you should be asking...**\n\nPeople have left out all the fund traded shares that are owned (likely locked into place unless it moons and they have to rebalance). You're leaving out all the synthetic shares floating out around because of the shorts, and the facts the institutions or their allies are front running those shorts likely. Citron has also ignited a fight with some funds that have a bone to pick.\n\nYou're leaving out that the shorts also ARE NOT GETTING DELIVERED. Just because a broker has the shares on their books to short does NOT mean those shares are delivered.\n\nHow do I know? [https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)\n\nGameStop's been on it far too long.\n\nBut brokers don't give a fuck, because SEC doesn't give enough of a fuck to do anything about it. They also don't give a FUCK about you. They only give a fuck with someone that matters enough does something wrong enough that someone else who matters enough gets hurt. Why did Elon get charged? There were a few institutions betting against it, remember?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Questions for you**\n\nHave you checked institutional inflow estimates? Have you checked L2 aggregated orders? Have you peeked at the bulk order flows?\n\nDo you actually have any idea how fucked the shorts are? Because if you did, you'd second mortgage your fucking house and put it on the line (do **NOT** do this you fucking idiot, it's a figure of speech).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**General thesis as of today:**\n\n* Institutions are fighting each other, not just us\n* Enough people have enemies within Wall Street, they're willing to pad their bottom lines after a year like we've had if the risk is minimal and greater for the other side (because one side has to give in first, humans can only take so much punishment)\n* Citron is obviously, blatantly manipulating the stock via the methods I describe below (note, today there were shares available to be loaned, and right before his stream, there was a massive short attack and then VIOLA there were no more shares to borrow. I don't know if this is coordinated with institutions, but the fuckers only worth $5M, he doesn't have the money to do what is going on by himself. **It could easily be algorithms just picking up news** on the wire and inappropriately acting on it.\n* Institutional inflows, bulk orders, and dark pools allow the type of wars we're watching (explained below)\n* I think there's just general interest in the stock, the added upside is that Citron and Melvin get fucked in the process of us owning a revolutionary gaming company\n* Cohen is going to change things, and hopefully he goes on Benzinga tomorrow to give commentary\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎  🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 💎✋💎\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**On how the volume is behaving and what is going on likely:**\n\nAs far as institutional inflows those and bulk order flows sometimes go together. Also, some dark pools aggregate their orders so what looks like a bunch of 1000, 500, 250, 50, 90, 110 share lots when people are selling are actually a single lot of 2000 etc.\n\nThese dark pools are used as back channels for some private funds that have broker access to the street, and help to disguise institutional movements mostly for hedge funds and speculative funds.\n\nBy looking at inflow estimate reports (you have to be in the industry to get access to most of this, it comes from extremely expensive research firms that brokers pay, or they have a team in house doing it) along with bulk orders, and trying to match those to the T&S tape ticker, you can start to see perhaps who is moving what.\n\nIf someone transacts let's say, 1M shares, and you can attribute it to a single individual somehow (if the pool didn't aggregate their order into another order to mix it into the execution cycle which normally they do to try and hide it) you can get an idea of what the true tradeable float is (if you don't get why, it's because you don't buy a million shares of something to day trade it, those are sitting at home for awhile, a long while).\n\nThose institutions buying those shares will let the price fall, then throw 50-100k of their shares through. You don't just execute a buy or sell of 1M shares @ $40, it's a thousand here, thousand there and the algo tries to get you the best price possible. Often you'll see dips, massive buy spikes, then buy/sell walls go up at price points where their average is to try and build a retail base also. Considering originally there was a low percentage of outstanding shares traded per day, building that base will take time because institutional ownership is so huge. Once that is built, they just have to counter act any shorts, and see even 50 basis point increase in volume could set this entire thing off.\n\nThose short attacks will stop once the shorts get out of their position but the base will remain and the hunger for the shares will remain. If the short float falls a bit, it actually will help us believe it or not, because the people that are going to get fucked here aren't the institutional traders - it's the big retail whales and 9 figure individuals betting against this. The big firms are already hedged, I promise you.\n\nWith the short volume being met by institutional buying volume, I estimate the actual float to be much, much, much smaller than the numbers we're seeing. Institutional ownership is over 100% -- this is ONLY possible by buying synthetic shares that are shorted.\n\nAll of this combined shows me that we have firms going at each other. A couple retail whales come in and upset that balance of power, and we're going to see this thing rip upwards. What you're likely seeing is firms day trading calls on swings (yes, calls, not puts) and forcing those swings to help them profit some, then cover some of their shares and slowly reduce the delta of their positions. They're not trading puts because that just exaggerates their delta, they trade the calls in case the thing fucking flies to the moon, their losses are capped as it sits now, and they're likely trading portions of their share position. 10% at a time, and if they have enough capital, they can drag this fight out for a long fucking time. There's no benefit for them to unwind all at once, it could set this thing into the stratosphere. It's potentially possible many of them have various dated $20 calls to help cover their short (and by possible, I mean likely, because the algos probably hedged as soon as it saw the price/volume explode when it moved off the $20 mark and identified the possible buttfucking their short position was about to give them) and they're just slamming volume around trying to create volatility because that's the best for the people writing the options (them and their friends). For all we know, some of these shorts are completely hedged just building it up to profit off the squeeze. If the shares rip up once they get out of the position, they don't care, because they'll hold to expiration for hedge, exercise, take the gains, and tank the stock again and short it on the way down while hedging the upside again. If the stock goes down, they can dump the calls and just let their short ride back down a ways. The calls are their cap -- similar to people buying a debit spread instead of long calls.\n\nBut with Melvin's puts likely expired and not re-upped in any identifiable way, that means we know one guy is really under the heat and already way fucking down on his position, which causes desperation. Humans can only take so much. Match that up with Citron's extreme fucking failures over the course of the last two years, we got a couple guys with reputations and millions on the line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FOR THE NOOBS\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **ELI5**\n\nGME🚀 bears r fuk\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **When is the short squeeze going to happen?**\n\nI have no idea when. Whenever the institutions are happy with their positions, probably.\n\nDays to cover means shit, for every person that covers, at this point, someone else is going to take their spot because enough firms think that it's going down and they would love that because they want a better entry on the long term. Believe it or not, regardless of Credit Suisse's way off price target, there's numerous VC firms and big whales looking at this right now wondering if WSB got something right, and if they understand the industry better. Most these guys don't understand gaming, it's a new, growing industry.\n\nThe catch is that someone has to be the first one to jump, like cliff diving into water you don't know the depth of. If one firm jumps, others may join. But if they jump and are wrong, they're tied into that investment and can't be non-directional if they're making an investment based play since that would be bad to suppress price for the company they're invested in and a violation of fiduciary responsibility.\n\nThis is part of the reason that long term, we could benefit from a pullback. Let some of the assholes off the hook so the real price can be determined by the market.\n\nI used to post DD and stock picks on here under another name. I may start again soon, I stopped for personal reasons and deleted that account, that was almost 2 years ago.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Meta: How do I learn to be good at trading?**\n\nLearn the market first, learn how to trade without any of the finance knowledge. This knowledge really doesn't help me trade all that much, it helps me understand why I win or lose, but knowing how to pick entries/exits and how to control my emotions is the best thing I've learned although I'm unhinged on Melvin and Citron\n\nHow I Made $2M In The Stock Market by Nicholas Darvas, then review Bill O Neill's shit with a grain of salt, don't follow CANSLIM to the T, but some of the ideas are sound like how to identify growth companies.\n\nAfter that, mess around trading shares and just make a goal to profit. If you're down, analyze the position and thesis and decide if you will get a profitable spot later, if so, learn discipline and hold. If not, cut it loose and start another trade.\n\nDo it about 50,000 times over 10,000 hours and you'll get good at it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***In Conclusion:*** If you're in the industry, you have access to shit others don't (not implying I am, or how I know these things). You should be able to watch a price/volume chart during the day and instantly identify institutional activity.\n\nFuck Melvin and Fuck Andrew Left and Shitron. It's one thing to be in a firm and short a stock for fundamental reasons. It's a whole other thing to let your ego get in the way after you drove the price down to $3 and go for the jugular just to make yourself feel better. The guy deserves the fucking $200-$300M loss he's about to eat at the current price, probably more considering the options he had expired and he's likely got some other hedges in place that won't work out for him.\n\nThis isn't to flex knowledge, it's to tell people you should be careful just spreading info around this board and getting people on board with a thesis. We're all mostly right on the idea that there's a squeeze coming, but it isn't for the reasons that we're saying.\n\n**The mania around here now has the public viewing us as some goddamn conglomerate pump and dump scheme. That shit has to stop. We're just dudes with small accounts compared to the real big fish, and we believe in $GME.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SECOND DISCLAIMER: This is all just my fucking opinion.

The actual shares that are transactable however are much much less, meaning there’s basically a hidden lower supply? Like if volume is 50m and there’s 10m outstanding but we see 60m because of shorted shares, that would drive the price up like crazy wouldn’t it? I think I get what you’re talking about.

{"title": "Future of WSB", "selftext": "**I've been mainly lurking for a few years and in my opinion, there are currently a few issues regarding this subreddit:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* too much publicity\n\nWSB was originally a small community of autists wanting to make big gains with smart plays. Today WSB is more like an open discussion board, that's all over the news, and everyone can join and try to make some gains.  It's good to have a decent amount of players here but let's keep the information to ourselves and off the newspapers and CNBC. There is only a limited amount of gains to be made, let's keep the gains to ourselves and the boomers away. Also, what was the point of expanding to Twitter?\n\n* too many new wannabe autists\n\nWSB is on the frontpage of reddit like every other day with memes, and it attracts a lot of new members. Those new members aren't true autists and they clearly have hard time adjusting to our culture. This has caused attacking certain parties that we don't agree with, pump and dump schemes, lots of stupid posts and upvoting them, that nobody would have upvoted 6 months ago and so on. In general this is much more like a meme subreddit now, even when we are approaching the most important earnings week of the year. A good portion of the new members don't even understand the last sentence.\n\n* this isn't WallStreetMemes, this is WallStreetBets\n\nAnyone who's been here longer than 3 months, knows that we used to have much more useful posts or gain/loss porn in the frontpage of WSB, now it's mainly memes. It's fine to have memes here and there but most of them are just low quality karma farming memes and they get old real fast, unlike loss porn. I bet anyone who has been here longer than a year, would like to see people tattooing stupid shit, drinking piss, GUH their wife's boyfriend's savings away, and just see people act like the true autist they are, rather than these boring new memes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to fix this?**\n\n1. We had the rule for not allowing posts to be in r/all for like a whole 10 minutes back in the days, and I think we need that back. If someone is a true autist, they will find their way here regardless.\n2. Keep the WSB inside the WSB. No Twitter, no news, no sucking Cramer's dick to get to CNBC. We already have enough autists here to be a big player in financial markets. We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.\n3. GME to the moon\n4. WSB needs to be kept under control. True autist never attacks anyone, we just troll people, make tendies and jerk to loss porn. It's pretty simple and if you can't accept it and follow the rules, you deserve to get banned.\n5. Let the new members become true autists, absorb our original culture, and I think WSB can be like it used to be. But if we constantly have a lot of new wannabe autists coming in, they are gonna take this sub over and there's nothing we can do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\npositions:\n\npronebone, 156 shares of TSLA, 80 shares of GME, lots of leap calls and smaller positions", "id": "l2kdlt", "created_utc": 1611308341.0, "score": 9378, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 1014, "comments": [{"body": "Bring back the two phrases that filtered out the wannabes:\n\"Proof or ban\"\n\"Positions or ban\"", "score": 4732, "replies": [{"body": "One saying as old as the internet is most appropriate for newcomers  \n\n\n\"Lurk moar\"  \n\n\nYou should probably lurk for at least 3 months before you enter the fray", "score": 1064, "replies": [{"body": "This is exactly what I did and it's started me down the path of a true autist", "score": 432, "replies": [{"body": "Can confirm.

If not for the collective DD into GME I would not have invested heavily into GME, which I believe has long term potential. (obligatory: 🚀🚀🚀)\n\nThat said, I understand the concerns regarding branching out onto other platforms, and I believe the general sentiment expressed by vocal members was pretty spot on. The value of the twitter handle, and how it was being used seems to be a step too far. Are we the next collective group like anonymous? No. But it's easy to create fake sentiment and perception often dwarfs reality.\n\nSo the question of what the future holds? I don't think there's much wrong posting gain/loss porn and fanboy meme stocks. I am also under the impression members of reddit are somewhat shielded by a rogue mod (not to imply the mod did / didn't go too far) based on the (probably) 100s of pages of TOS and Policy (I didn't actually look, but it's an educated guess). That's not to say you are shielded if you post something that violates SEC / local laws. Everyone should remember that they can type whatever they want, but others can respond to that in more ways than just hitting reply...\n\nI believe the biggest threat to WSB comes from blatant disregard of collusion / inflammatory speech (which will become more regulated). I also have seen a lot of members post about \"the good old days\" and I, relatively new to wsb, do sympathize for that view. Even from when I first browsing WSB about 2-3 months ago to today there's been an exponential increase in what some view as \"spam\" posts regarding a single topic (i.e., GME). In recent days I have seen (I think) an attempt to control that by focusing the majority of that content to a single thread. I feel that is the right approach. The real challenge is to make sure users do not directly or indirectly violate any SEC laws / regulations. \n\nI think recent events have shown that just about anything can be challenged in a court of law regardless of merit, and that does open up some of the members to risk regardless of the merit.  \n\n\nI should note I am not a lawyer / financial advisor, so everything I state in this post is speculation / opinions.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

{"title": "How luck plays an important role in the stock market (GME and others)", "selftext": "Fellow retards,\n\nI noticed that this sub is going to hit 2 million people soon, and I have decided to put aside my project assignments to write this DD (albeit more towards psychologically) on why luck is extremely important in the stock market, and what you can do to potentially get in favor of luck. Before I start, I want to congratulate you on being here. You have came a long way in life, and there’s more to come. Be happy.\n\n**TLDR at the last paragraph.**\n\nI want to talk mainly 3 things; luck, the psychology behind investing and what you should do to maximize profits. \n\n**Luck**\n\nIn the book 'The Drunkard's Walk', under chapter of 'Illusions of Patterns and Patterns of Illusion', and I quote: \"In 1978, Koppett revealed a system that he claimed could determine, by the end of January every year, whether the stock market would go up or down in that calendar year. His system had correctly predicted the market, he said, for the past eleven years. Of course, stock-picking systems are easy to identify in hindsight; the true test is whether they will work in the future. Koppett's system passed that test too: judging the market by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it worked for eleven straight years, from 1979 through 1989, got it wrong in 1990, and was correct again every year until 1998. But although Koppett's predictions were correct for a streak of eighteen out of nineteen years, I feel confident in asserting that his streak involved no skill whatsoever. Why? Because Leonard Koppett was a columnist for *Sporting News*, and his system was based on the results of the Super Bowl, the championship game of professional football. Whenever the team from the (original) National Football league won, the stock market, he predicted, would rise.\"\n\nIn the book 'Fooled by Randomness', the Prologue mentioned \"...luck disguised and perceived as nonluck (that is, skills) and, more generally, randomness disguised and perceived as non-randomness (that is, determinism). \"\n\nIn the book ‘The Black Swan’ by Taleb Nassim Nicholas, Page 119 mentioned \" A successful person will try to convince you that his achievements could not possibly be accidental, just as a gambler who wins at roulette seven times in a row will explain to you that the odds against such a streak are one in several million, so you either have to believe some transcendental intervention is in play or accept his skills and insight in picking the winning numbers.\" More often than not, luck is rarely on your side. I can provide many other articles, but I believe you get the point. **To emphasize it, \"the habit of mistaking luck for skill is most prevalent - and most conspicuous - and that is the world of markets.\"**\n\nSo why am I saying all these? What I am trying to imply is, do appreciate your GME gains, or whatever astronomical gains that you have. These gains, more often than not, are results of extremely lucky happenstances, where most people are incapable of harnessing them. Yes, there are tons of good DDs. But you yourselves are incredibly lucky to be part of WSB, and personally reading the DDs yourselves, and lucky enough to decide that you would be retarded enough to take the risk. You should be happy and grateful about it, because like I said, this is hugely, and heavily dependent on luck. Humans are flawed, because we have the tendency to look for specific causes that lead to effects. We often find it hard to accept that an event can be the result of total randomness, but sometimes it is. In financial forecasting, several times random volatility is mistaken for accurate prediction. In a group of many analysts, it is normal to expect that someone's predictions will turn out to be true (u/DeepFuckingValue). So, in case you get way too ahead of yourselves thinking you are absolutely a genius for having triple percentage gains in your portfolio, remember you're most likely just lucky. And since you're lucky, be appreciative and do not be complacent. \n\n**Psychology behind Investing**\n\nSeveral studies have fooled people into believing they are in control of something they actually have no control over. In fact, human decision-making shows systematic simplifications and deviations from the tenets of rationality (‘heuristics’) that may lead to suboptimal decisional outcomes (‘cognitive biases’). There are currently three prevailing theoretical perspectives on the origin of heuristics and cognitive biases: a cognitive-psychological, an ecological and an evolutionary perspective. To simplify that, it basically means that cognitive biases arise from intrinsic brain mechanisms that are fundamental for the working of our neural networks. Your mind is always on the cautious side of things, because it is trying to protect you.\n\nRemember a time when you were very near the edge of a building/cliff, and all of a sudden you feel hypersensitive to the surrounding around you? You are aware of every rocks and stones that might sabotage you. Another example can be that you shiver when peeing, because your body is exaggerating the signal that you are rapidly losing body heat, and is trying to shiver up the muscle fiber to keep you warm, etc. You get the idea. \n\nThis unfortunately, applies in investing as well. Your mind will inevitably forces you to be on the safer side. A dip? Oh no... you panic. But relax, that is normal. In my last point, I will explain what you can do to overcome it.\n\n**What you can do to stay calm?**\n\nSo now you know that it is in human nature to be a paper handed bitch. The first step is realizing that your own neural networks are playing a huge part in giving you a paper hand. When you realized that it is your own mind that is keeping you on the safer side, perhaps you can be more self-aware. Being impatient in the market is the worst mistake that you would commit while investing in the stocks. You have to know that if you do not have good patience in the market then you would find difficulty in getting the right stocks for your investment. You have to finally take your own decisions when you wish to select the stocks. Remember however, you do have to be lucky to hit the jackpot on certain investments as per my first point. \n\nConfirmation bias is also a bitch. As philosopher Francis Bacon put it in 1620, \"the human understanding, once it has adopted an opinion, collects any instances that confirm it, and though the contrary instances may be more numerous and more weighty, it either does not notice them or else rejects them, in order that this opinion will remain unshaken.\" This happens very often in WSB, and I want you to be cautious as well. To show you how easy confirmation bias is, imagine I have 5 numbers here. After presenting you these numbers, I want you to guess what is the rule of the game. Here are the 5 numbers: 4 6 8 10 12. What will your next 3 numbers be? What is the rule of the game? The rule is: >!Increasing Numbers, the next 3 numbers can be 13 14 15!< Most of you might have guessed \"increasing even numbers and provided with 14 16 18, when in fact it is not. \n\nLuck does not solely come from deciding whether to listen to another retard's DD on a thread, and YOLO-ing your life savings onto some stocks. It also comes in the form of your birth status, etc. Having a $100,000 head start in the stock market, is almost always better than someone having $1000 as a starting capital (or worse still, negative capital simply because your parents are poor, that's unlucky).\n\nThat being said, I believe all of us here are in some way privileged to be gathered here and discussing individually. The poor kids in some countries have to fight for clean water and food. So the next time you realized that you are earning money in the stock market, remember, it is incredibly hard to do it, and you should be proud of yourselves. And in the scenario where you lose your money, well, you shouldn't be surprised either way. You are bound to be losing. \n\nHere are some books you can refer to if you're interested: The Drunkard’s Walk by Leonard Mlodinow (How Randomness Rules Our Lives), Fooled by Randomness by Taleb N, The Black Swan by Taleb N, Who’s in Charge? by Michael S. Gazzaniga (on Free will and the science of the brain), Success and Luck by Robert H. Frank, The Most Good You Can Do (How effective altruism is changing ideas about living ethically) by Peter Singer. \n\nClarification: Some people mentioned if this post was directed to \"diminish the contributions of skill and the hard effort of anyone\". Absolutely not. ~~This post is assuming that in the top few % (if you're reading this, yourself included), everyone is just as talented.~~ But to be part of that 1% in that 1%, to be the richest among the richest, you have to be incredibly lucky. \n\n**TLDR**: If you make huge gains, go and give some of it to other people that may not have been so lucky. Go and give it to the homeless people at the unemployment line, who ain't so lucky as you. Maybe buy him food. Get him clothes. Donate to your local charities. Most importantly, give it back to your parents, because your parents are the one who, most likely, set you up in this direction, and you are lucky enough to be here today. If you did not make any gains, remember, it is perfectly okay.\n\n**Shorter TLDR**: Be happy, be grateful.\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "id": "l2nqva", "created_utc": 1611322196.0, "score": 813, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 137, "comments": [{"body": "Fully agree and that’s the reason why I always get annoyed when people make some gains and then act all superior and think they are biggest fish in the pond or the next buffet.\n\nYes, we do DD, we read DD, we have opinions, ideas and convictions and maybe we are right, but there is also luck involved in this", "score": 179, "replies": [{"body": "Luck and taking advantage of that luck.

{"title": "GME MOASS Update: ORTEX Data (1/22/21)", "selftext": "Hi all, it's your friendly neighborhood fellow retard, u/fieryskyes.\n\nLooking to open up a discussion thread about today's GME Short Data. I'm attaching an image from ORTEX after today's beautiful share price action. You bet that GME will be making news rounds all over the world after today, over the weekend. We're only getting started. If any of you have read my MOASS price target post from around a week or so ago\\*\\*, you would know that I kept on hammering the term 'zero point' over and over. It just means it's the starting point (whether it's your portfolio value, or the share price, or both) prior to a face-ripping MOASS. Well, if you've held on to GME the entire time since that post, congratulations. Your zero point has just grown a substantial amount, **especially** after today's close @ +51.08% (as per Yahoo! Finance GME closing price). GME today even touched \\~+-80% intra-day @ $76.76, breaking the previous Share Price ALL-TIME-HIGH of $63.77 (dated Dec. 7, 2008) from ***\\~13 years ago*** (data gathered using TD-ToS trading platform), *and then, closing at the new share price ALL-TIME-HIGH closing price @* $65.01 (as per Y! Finance GME). It's some fucking tendie-town shit.\n\nAll the mathematical power and beauty of consecutive-day compounding interest is now to GME LONGS' advantage. The inverse is true for shorts: they're getting seriously fucked by many things; face-ripping, ass-gaping, wife-fucking compounding interest only one among them. (Also, RIP to Citron Research AKA. Andrew \"Left for Dead\" Shitron.) Yeah, you read that shit right: SHORTS are about to get inflicted with MAXIMUM MATHEMATICAL PAIN. It sounds nerdy af I know, but ain't that the truth.\n\nI don't claim to be an expert on GME short metrics & data, and so I leave it to the experts to hopefully analyze what I'm attaching here, hence a discussion thread. *AKA. WHAT DO THESE CRAYONS ON THE SCREEN MEAN, DADDY?*\n\nHowever: based off off what I see on the data attached, I have come to believe that shorts have started to unwind their positions, albeit ***only slightly***, relative to the entire short position. (I could be wrong, and if so, let me know in the comments. Let's discuss.) Still, as the data presents below, it seems that the SHARES SHORTED still stands at a HISTORIC >100%, at 102.29%. *Goddamn. My asscheeks just clenched a little writing and thinking about all the trapped shorts (RIP). What an absolutely titanic and colossal failure of risk management.* Can't complain though lmao. *Tendies all day, everyday, bitch!*\n\nAgain remember, on WSB, we take into account TRADEABLE % of FLOAT, where, according to some DDs posted in the sub, is estimated to be running at around 200%+, due to (we, at the very least, assume) '*fixed'* massive institutional and insider ownership, that cannot/will not/*might not* sell, *all while* the shorts are fucking drowning and thrashing around, desperate to get some breathable air--in the middle of the goddamn *Atlantic Ocean* with no boats nor ships in sight. It's like *Titanic*, but they're Jack, and you're *the sexy-ass rich bitch* named Rose. Only one survives. *(Spoiler alert: It ain't Jack.)*\n\nAll said, I think we have a ways to go before all the shorts are fully covered (*we're talking potential MULTIPLES of current price, and, ergo, your DADDY-AS-FUCK GME PORTFOLIO)* e.g. more tendies to come. Focus, get ready, and have a plan. This could be *THE* trade of your lifetime.\n\n[CRAYONS TO TENDIE-TOWN, BITCH. \\/ You like that, daddy? The image attached is in FULL 4K RESOLUTION. It's some RICH-PEOPLE SHIT.

Rod is--among many titles--the Prime Author of the GME DD website, accessible to anyone curious about GME-GameStop Valuation Targets : [$GME DD](https://www.gmedd.com/) ) He was live on BENZINGA this morning, giving a NON-RETARDED & INTELLIGENT REPRESENTATION of GME LONGS and Retail Investors alike ([$GME With Rod Alzmann & CJ Trades | ZingerNation Power Hour - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLzTU87MJMM), starts at around 18:39); and I watched as the MARKET FUCKING RIPPED THE SHORTS TO SHREDS (EVEN INFLICTING MULTIPLE TRADING HALTS) WHILE HE WAS BEING INTERVIEWED LMAO. Even the Benzinga hosts couldn't fucking believe it themselves. Appreciate the good work, brother. Fucking cheers!! Maybe Ryan Cohen next? 😎\n\n**GME = WHALE-MAKER** 🐳 🐳🐳🐳\n\n**Long live WSB, and Long live GME. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**\n\n**Positions**: 100% GME. Diversified at 2/3 in Shares, 1/3 in April calls, and I rode these fuckers to war even during and after the **Q3ER** share price crash, due to paper hands and heavy short-seller action. **#WeRemember** and **#WeWillNeverForget.** **NOW, it's time for the Shorts to pay lmao.** (Current Value in $ : *more than tree fiddy,* and *more than enough* *to finance* Andrew \"Left for dead\" Citron's onlyfans as a tax-deductible charity expense.)\n\n*Note: none of the content of this post is to imply any right/wrong financial decision.

I'm as curious as all of you about SI after today but want to make sure these numbers are right.*  \n>  \n>u/fieryskyes: *Hey man, good catch! Actually, the numbers CHANGED while posting this entire thing, RIGHT AFTER today's close. I literally had to re-type the data. The graph, I will agree, however shows Thursday 21st. Not sure what to make of that exactly. We will keep updating on this for sure. But from what I remember, the \"%FREEFLOAT ON LOAN\" data changed from 98.68% to 102.29% (as it stands now). Good comment. I will include this in the post itself.\"*\n\nYea, the \"%Free float on loan\" actually increased by \\~3.5% while I was posting/writing this, as the CLOSING BELL struck (I use TD Ameritrade's Thinkorswim platform like a real trading daddy should, and it rings the bell at close 4PM EST SHARP. So ya I fucking remember that moment like a Pavlovian bitch.) It *could* mean that the ORTEX data reflected up-to-date data then. Fucking coincidence, amirite? Regardless, WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO before all short positions are covered, if they even have started to cover today in the first place. So chill, daddy, it's all under control and shit. Sit back, relax, and continue to jerk off to your KINGLY GME gains.\n\nDon't worry my brothers, I will keep on watching ORTEX data, even on Monday. We will track this bitch in every possible way. *Shorts will not get out alive.* Also, you can get ORTEX data yourself, with a free 7-day trial period. Not affiliated with them in any way.
