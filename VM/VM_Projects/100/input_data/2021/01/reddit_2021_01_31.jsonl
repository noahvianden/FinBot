{"title": "An explanation of what caused the trading halt and a defense for small trading apps", "selftext": "I can tell you right now with complete confidence that the only thing brokers who halted trading are guilty of was bad PR and nothing else. I was pissed when trading was halted, but now I’m just upset that I’m hearing people trash some trading apps which did absolutely nothing wrong and has done so much good in the past years. People are piling on, politicians from left right and center are wrapping their own agenda around it, and somehow we finally saw AOC and Ben Shapiro agree on something. People are thinking “they” control it from the top and they stopped it because they were scared of us. I can assure you none of that is true, it is conspiratorial thinking and it is all nonsense and unfounded.\n\nWanna know why? Read on, education ahead, and it’s good for you. \n\nWhen people in aggregate from exchange A buy 1 million dollar worth of a stock, if there’s not enough people selling that stock on exchange A, that stock needs to come from exchange B. That means that 1 million needs to be transferred from exchange A to B. Money transfer is very complicated (as you’ve probably seen with wire transfers) and take 2 business days to clear even for the big guys. Now, what would happen if before money clears, exchange A collapses and goes bust? Exchange B is fucked. It still promised and have to give its users  by law who sold those shares a 1 million dollars. Enter: Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation(DTCC)\n\nDTCC is probably the biggest bank in the world and you’ve never heard of it. It acts as the man in the middle insurance company of sorts, it’s a self regulating private entity on wallstreet who’s existence is required by law. It exists to absorb all the risk of ripple effects of an exchange going bust and impacting other exchange. They basically want to take the risk of “what if that market we’re trading with doesn’t pay us?” completely off a brokers book. Also note, DTCC is not just for stock brokers, it’s for banks, institutional investors, hedge funds, mutual funds, all of them.\n\nIn my example, DTCC fronts exchange A the cash by guaranteeing the 1 mil for exchange B. All good so far right? Well there’s a small catch, DTCC needs to still protect itself from going insolvent, since it’s basically the backbone of the market, their chances of going insolvent cannot be even 0.000001%. \n\nSo they have this formula that calculates an upfront collateral for a particular stock. This collateral needs to be given cash to DTCC on the time of the trade. It’s not speculative, it’s just math and it takes a lot f factors in like the broker’s finances(how much cash they got on reserve, etc.) and also factors in the stock being traded. Usually it comes down to 1-4% of the security. Say that 1 mil I mentioned earlier was all SPY stock, since it’s safe and all the upfront fee is 1%. So when the 1 mil buy happens, exchange A immediately gives $10,000 to DTCC, and starts a wire of 1 million to fund B. Once the transaction clears, DTCC gives the $10,000 back.\n\nAll that was happening with GameStop, but then the morning the guys got block, DTCC raised their collateral requirement for the meme stocks to 100%. Why? Well, because it’s volatile as fuck and they did not like the odds of keeping it lower. We all know that this is a bubble and given that so many retail investors are buying this stock on margin at $300+ which is for sure crashing to $20, most likely in an instant, there’s a solid chance some exchanges might go broke over it, so they can’t insure it.\n\nNow what does this mean for exchange A? That means for every 1 million dollars of GameStop, exchange A needs to wire 1 mil to to exchange B AND immediately send another million cash to DTCC. Well now we got a sticky situation, at the current market cap, we’re talking hundreds of billions (that’s not a typo) that these firms need to cough up to DTCC for 2 business days! They simply don’t have the money so they halted it. That’s it. Then the next day they secured some loans, and managed to re offer the stocks at a limited quantity that their loans enabled them to.\n\nOne small clarification, I simplified my explanation by combining clearing firms and brokerages as one entity. In reality they’re usually separate(sometimes they’re not, for example the popular trading app I can’t name does their own clearing), the connection goes broker -> clearing firm -> DTC. Clearing firms are actually the companies that are trying to secure loans to support more, and it’s the clearing firms who don’t have enough money to pay DTC, so they just tell brokers “sorry, no GME, can’t clear it”\n\n\n“Dude fuck DTCC, they’re evil, they’re the ones controlling from the top they should’ve left us be” \n\nWell last time they were too slow to raise the collateral was 2008. Lehman which was a clearing firm collapsed. Finally DTCC did what it was supposed to do! They paid out $500bn to clear all of Lehman’s outstanding transactions. But that’s not all, since DTCC was slow to raise their rates for certain securities at the time, they were legit at the risk of going insolvent if more banks and hedge funds collapsed. Enter Bailout, a loan to help everyone sort their shit out, clear out their transactions and not collapse. Had enough banks and hedge funds collapsed to push DTCC into insolvency, the entire United States paper market(stocks, bonds, etc.) would’ve collapsed(total market breakdown). Little known fact: DTCC technically owns almost all paper assets in the US, including yours and mine in a trust. Technically we are just beneficiaries of those stocks. Also, government has every right to take those away from you due to “national emergency”. Fun fact eh?\n\n“DTCC is helping out their wallstreet buddies” \n\nNo, they’re protecting the system, they raise collateral for all ultra volatile securities. They’d do it if hedge funds were profiting too.\n\n“But why some markets did allow buying?” \n\nWell their clearing firms did, and some did their own clearing and they had enough cash to allow trading. And if you noticed, it was a ripple effect. TD was a clearing firm that was first to stop doing GME, then a bunch of brokers ran to other clearing firms, and now a clearing firm is servicing their existing brokers and all the refugees from TD, and naturally they got overloaded with GME. So they fell, and now two sets of refugees went and crash another, and eventually almost all brokers stopped offering GME and friends. \n\n“Why sell only then?”\n\nSelling doesn’t require DTCC collateral, cuz a stock is going out not money. The stock is just a digital signature in DTCC’s database, it ain’t going anywhere, it’s not gonna go insolvent. Money on the other hand is more complicated and not just a digital signature on a database, it’s no guarantee you’ll get it from a buyer until it’s in your vaults, so you need a collateral until you get it\n\n“Why was so and so broker selling GME without my permission”\n\nAlright dude this one on you for getting a margin account, you agreed to it and all brokers do it. You know how those boomers always tell you don’t get a margin account? This is why\n\n“Why do we need DTCC anyways?”\n\nThey prevent cascading failures that doomers wish for on their birthdays. If a broker goes bust, suddenly that $2bn that broker was supposed to send to some other broker goes poof, and now that other broker is in the negative and goes bust, and so do all their debts to other companies\n\n“Does DTCC raising the collateral requirement mean we were at risk of collapsing the financial system?”\n\nYea probably, but that’s why they raised the rates\n\n“Why can’t markets just trade inside themselves and avoid sending money and DTCC”\n\nThey still need a transaction with DTCC because you all have your own bank accounts on a brokerage and DTCC being the owner of all stock needs to know which account which stock belongs to\n\n“Wtf why does it take 2 business days to transfer money? Can’t they Zelle or some shit?”\n\nIt’s how things work at that large of a scale, they record transactions all day, end of the day they add it all up and move the money. One day to take the money from broker the clearing house, one day to move the money from clearing house to the receiving broker. It’s the same system as ACH transfers, which stands for automated clearing house\n\n“Why is DTCC private and so centralized, break it apart!”\n\n[blockchain shills have entered the chat]", "id": "l90an8", "created_utc": 1612053898.0, "score": 660, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 497, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "This......they should stop lying and just say what it actually is.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Dumb bastard probably thought he was \"taking one for the team\" while in reality he was being used as the scapegoat.", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "They're not a bank, they don't have fractional reserves.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Fun fact.

If your clients can only buy shares with cleared cash funds, you should have no problem executing unlimited trades.\n\nThis was negligence and dishonest PR *at the very best*. The more likely scenario is that there were hands behind the scene helping guide them to the decision.\n\nCouple different things that bug me about everything:\n\n- First and foremost, Thomas Peterffy. He is the CEO of IBKR and was responsible for *most* of the non-Robinhood related outages. He said on a recorded interview with Bloomberg TV that his decision was in no way to protect his own company, nor was his company in any risk of not meeting liquidity/collateral requirements. He explained that he made the decision for the sole purpose of slowing down momentum in these stocks. **That is an admission of price manipulation**. You can take all the blocks of text you want, but the person that made the decision flat out said why he did it in [this interview](https://youtu.be/kV_P8wnY854) and for some reason nobody is talking about it.\n\n- Second, Robinhood/Citadel/Melvin Capital. Melvin Capital had massive short positions in several of the \"meme stocks\". They were over-leveraged and un-hedged in unlimited risk positions, and the market found out and took advantage. Melvin Capital was literally going bankrupt. Now, Citadel has no financial stake in Melvin Capital. But they extended a $2 billion dollar loan (important for two reasons) to keep Melvin afloat. But back to Citadel. They *do have* a vested financial interest in Robinhood, because they own a substantial amount of equity in them. They also make a ton of profit off of the retail order flow they purchase from Robinhood. There are *a lot* of financial reasons Citadel would want to keep Robinhood successful. What we now know is that *the only reason Robinhood had to restrict trading was lack of capital*. Didn't Citadel extend $2B the day before to a friend they had no vested interest in? So the common sense thing is that they would extend whatever capital it takes to keep Robinhood solvent. Protect their actual investment, and future order flow supply. But they let it happen (and I think facilitated it happening). They let Robinhood completely implode their future when all they would've had to do was extend a short term capital loan, knowing the equity they had would end up worthless when Robinhood ceases to exist after this.\n\n- Third, let's focus more on Robinhood. Prior to Friday, Robinhood was able to raise $1B in investment capital and a $500M loan. So they raised $1.5billion they did not have available the prior day. However, they effectively had the same restrictions in place at market open Friday - with the share limits that also factored stock you already owned and had cleared the 2 day waiting period, nobody could buy shares. Not only that, but the list of stocks kept growing and growing. After raising $1.5billion, they enforced *more restrictions* than the previous day. They also pre-liquidated positions at random times throughout the day. Many accounts, mine included, had positions liquidated at the absolute low of the day ($256-$260 range around 2:20pm). If it was a liquidity issue, why were there even more restrictions after raising $1.5B cash?\n\n- Fourth, let's go back to the $2B loan to Melvin Capital. Ignore the lack of any vested interest in Melvin Capital prior to the loan. In order to loan $2B to a company, you need to have some reasonable expectation you will be paid back. As of the time the loan was provided, *there is not a reasonable person on Earth that would have expected Melvin Capital to be able to pay that back*. The squeeze hadn't even started yet, and Melvin was still stuck in their short positions. **The only saving grace for Melvin Capital at this point would have been some sort of divine intervention.** And what do you know? The next day, the overwhelming majority of the investors that are putting the pressure on this short squeeze got kicked out of the game for two days.\n\nI fully understand the mechanics behind the reason we are being told that the buy-side of trading for hand-picked stocks was restricted. I don't believe that's the real reason. Especially because one of the biggest players that directly made this decision for many platforms flat out said the reason was to stop the squeeze. Lastly, if this was a legitimate issue, trading for the stocks should have been frozen. There should never be a scenario that one side of the deal is restricted. You're artificially creating one way price movement, and that's stock price manipulation. There is no way around that. The specific action taken manipulated the stock price, and it was very obvious what that action was going to do.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Just raising margin requirements isn't enough, when your cash pool is muppets' lunch money.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The point is they would never get into this cash position if they weren't extending margin immediately to every new user before they even clear a dollar into their account.\n\nIf they ran their company poorly enough to run out of cash, they never should have been extending margin based on uncleared funds.

I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits.

We've all been waiting for some type of margin call once the stock price has risen so high that would trigger the squeeze. Aren't we well past that point now? The stock is up nearly 500% in a week. Shouldn't the squeeze have been triggered by now? Doesn't this tell us that they're probably out of their small dollar shorts?\n\n3.

If I hold and set a $42,690 sell limit, I'm not going to get filled as long as there are millions below me. Shouldn't the strategy be to try and double/triple your money and then get out? Once all the shorts buy, there is not going to be any market for this stock above $1,000, let alone $300, $200 or $100. If you miss selling during the squeeze, you're done for.

{"title": "Prisoner's Dilemma - Hold $GME", "selftext": "This is not financial advice. I'm not a financial advisor. These are just my opinions and do not represent the views of this community.\n\nEarlier today I [tried to debunk](https://www.reddit.com/r/explodinghedgefunds/comments/l8jed7/gme_autistic_epiphany/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) the fUnDaMeNtAlS argument against holding shares at these new prices.\n\nThen I read this awesome post about how [we're being manipulated](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l928lr/obfuscation_misinformation_propaganda_and_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) from all sides.\n\nThis made me want to come up with the simplest win strategy for every retail investor, acting on their own, no matter what bullshit comes our way over the next week or more. Yes, we've already figured out that this means to hold $GME. However, not everyone will not understand the method to our madness and chalk it up to the fact that we're just a bunch of degenerate gamblers. We need them to know why this time.\n\nEnter the $GME [prisoner's dilemma game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma). Here's the setup. The hedgies and banks can secretly coordinate a crash without being punished. If we cooperate on a short squeeze, it is publicly visible and can result in consequences for us. Still, last week proved the fact that humans, acting individually, have a bias to cooperate on a collective good (see wiki link at start of this paragraph for source). This is our ace in the hole.\n\nThe only way they can win is when we betray each other (we won't) like prisoners being pressured by cops to rat on each other in separate interrogation rooms. The cops (hedgies and banks) will try everything to manipulate, scare, sow distrust, and incentivize the prisoners (retail investors) to rat on each other. The only way the prisoners get the best outcome is if they HOLD $GME 🚀.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium for this game is for the prisoners to rat on each other. That's the mathematical equilibrium/outcome. However, I'm arguing that we've demonstrated our ability to surpass that. We're using our human bias to act individually (not cooperatively) for the collective good to overcome this math. We're maximizing the collective gain, not the individual gain. This is the whole point of a short squeeze that sticks it to the hedgies.\n\nTLDR: HOLD\n\nEdit: A throw away account commented that this is sometimes called [superrationality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superrationality) and then deleted their comment...", "id": "l9chts", "created_utc": 1612100486.0, "score": 162, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 124, "comments": [{"body": "instructions unclear.

This is a bigger deal than seems:\n\n- Even a German component manufacturer such as Bosch will generally only get a module/part of a particular automotive subsystem, and their revenue greatly depends on sales of that component. The organizational motivation to apply \"no part is best part\" design philosophy is not just zero which would be bad enough already, but ***negative***: they'll argue very intensely that this particular part is very much needed, and that it should become larger, more important and more expensive ...\n- This results in the loss of whole-system design, whole-system optimizations and overall organizational efficiencies. Volkswagen's software chief recently complained that they have over 30 different computers with different software ecosystems in their cars, and that they'd love to reduce this to ... maybe 6, in a maybe 5-year project. Tesla meanwhile uses **one** highly integrated software ecosystem, which they run even on their industrial robots and which they standardized on all programmable equipment across their whole factory.\n\nI believe this negative of outsourcing eclipses all of the other factors, for a very obscure seeming technological reason, which is that power efficiency of EVs is very much a \"whole system\" optimization that takes many years and hundreds of steps to achieve:\n\n- ICE corporations on the other hand were able to utilize the abundant electrical energy provided by their generators connected to the ICE engine - utilizing a small fraction of that energy.\n- Tesla, due to its Silicon Valley heritage, went fully vertically integrated early on almost by accident, and managed to leverage this into unparalleled power-efficiency of their cars.\n\nI believe this is by far the biggest deal that has irreversibly doomed about 80% of ICE companies by today.

That money, plus excess profits, will fund the next Taycan iteration.\n\nThe Taycan made obsolete in 2022 by the Plaid and humiliated in 2023 by the Roadster 2 is not something that is in their business plans ...\n\nSo innovations like the Gigapress could only be adapted by them if their product cycle happens to start right now. As it happens, I believe only BMW is still at the planning stage of their first bigger EV push - but maybe they are already beyond that.\n\nI.e. awfully long adaption latency by legacy auto. They are still struggling to beat the 2010 Model S - let alone what Plaid will bring...\n\nNo low hanging fruits that I can see. It's all a decade of sweat & thousands of small innovations that Tesla relentlessly invested into their tech - a survival trait in Silicon Valley, but it's an utterly unknown process to legacy auto.\n\nIMO, and I said this in 2018 already, by far the best use of legacy auto would be to liquidate their assets and rebuilt an entirely new organization from the funds, utilizing their brands perhaps - but even those are dicey, as for example Volkswagen will forever be associated with poisoning our children for profits.\n\nOnce the outsized influence of legacy auto over the mainstream media through the channel of advertising wanes due to fading profits, the brand image repercussions will be intense IMO.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Great points and I agree.

I did some late night thinking about my portfolio and wanted to run it by you guys. I am not taking anything said as investment advice, I just want to make sure my logic seems reasonable.\n\nI have a brokerage account, Roth IRA, and TSP. I have been maxing out my TSP as a general investment strategy (as well as Roth IRA, but that isn't in play in this scenario), but I am starting to doubt that approach due to the lackluster returns compared to my brokerage and Roth IRA accounts and the limitations with eventually drawing down from the TSP when I am older. The TSP is of course very limited in the funds that you can invest in - currently tracking S&P 500 for the most part, but does have very low fees.\n\nI am thinking about reducing my contributions to the employer match level and then taking the rest and putting it in my brokerage account. The thought process being that if I do retire early, the funds will be more accessible in the brokerage than the TSP. (I have also read a bit about SEPPs and utilizing that process for early access to 401k type accounts.)\n\nAll of the above seems like a no-brainer, but I also am thinking of taking a TSP loan in order to be able to instantly throw that into my brokerage and TSLA, potentially a March 2023 LEAP - 1200 strike or lower. LEAPs are down with the dip and seem like a pretty good play right now. TSP loans are very low interest, 0.875% plus a $50 processing fee. I am looking at around a $25k loan, repayable over 3 years, which would work out to a total cost of $25,383.77. Repayment for the loan will automatically be deducted from my paycheck and the decrease in my TSP allocations mentioned above should increase my paycheck enough to cover that payment. Essentially I would be taking an advance on those reductions in contributions for the next three years at a very low interest rate. Obviously there is some opportunity cost in lost returns from my decreased TSP equity for the next 3 years.\n\nWanted to get some feedback on all of this.

My original comment might not age well. And quite frankly, every time I predict a red day I want to be wrong.

Don't get me wrong. I like them and I agree with them, however I don't think this kind of news is going to get us over the $900 hump. Although I would really like it if this news kept us in the $800 range for good and we can wave the 700's goodbye. The only way I see us getting over the $900 is some really good FSD news later in the year or just a big pump when money exits GME and goes into TSLA. You know the WSB Boys they love TSLA lol. I think if we get the FSD news we'll see another huge rally from TSLA and probably blow past $1000 as well. But we'll see how we go. I think we'll be humping that 800-900 price range for months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the feedback on Apple. I actually really like the company myself, I do totally agree with you that it is lacking innovation. It's hard to see the stock sky rocketing like TSLA potentially could this year. I'm already so deep into TSLA that I kind of want to hold some other stocks, then if Tesla does suffer a bad quarter or some bad news I can sell off something and put it into Tesla on a dip if that makes sense? Holding a stock like AAPL is almost similar to holding cash. Very stable, very liquid, less susceptible to huge market pullbacks. Doing something similar with PYPL and DIS too. Basically i'm bullish on all these stocks but ultimately if TSLA becomes a nice price i'll sell these stocks even at a loss to get into more Tesla lol.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yea I agree with you on the positive news and the movement of the stock price tomorrow. If it does end up mooning, I believe it’ll recover some of the losses but won’t be hitting 900. Probably float around 830ish for a bit.
