That's literally how savings works. I and anyone that saves could find plenty of enjoyable things to spend our money on, but choose to save and stay in a budget.

Their approach is long term (3-5 years) investing in companies solid growth prospects but with minimal risk. The minimal risk part means you likely won't see insane gains like on WSB. More valuable than that is their articles on Investing that are very educational and easy to understand for newbies.\n\nOnce you're comfortable (at least a year) you can keep looking for more and more advanced things like options and futures trading.

This seems to be the argument you are making.\n\nHowever, I do believe that Tesla is likely overvalued. While I haven‚Äôt done any calculations myself, the video narrator seems to be under the impression that Amazon only sells books. Yet, Amazon integrated other products and turned into more of a shipping/middleman company than an online bookstore. Hence why Amazon is as valued as it is today.\n\nTesla on the other hand is a car company. Elon Musk‚Äôs way of doing things is a testament to the fact that it is incredibly likely that Tesla will remain as a car company, as any other needs can be fulfilled with a separate entity (I.e. all of Elon‚Äôs companies are specialised, so if he wanted to do something else I don‚Äôt see why he wouldn‚Äôt start up something else). All values for Tesla‚Äôs valuation are calculated on this basis, proving how overvalued Tesla really is.\n\nI do also agree with you on your last statement, but again not because of Tesla‚Äôs size. Tesla is currently a growing company. It‚Äôs still producing factories - in fact, now that I think of it I do remember hearing about Musk wanting to perfect the factories for his vehicles so that he can then sell factories as well. Of course it can make those massive losses, but Tesla probably planned them in the first place.\n\nSorry for my poor writing.

Remember in the 80‚Äôs when the US government was building and paying $400 for toilet seats?  They will come up with projects and contracts with mills to supply steel. \n\nThere will be a short supply and US businesses will be looking for import material that will come from the largest steel maker in the world - $MT.  Well positioned in Canada and Mexico. \n\nOh, and I‚Äôm just giving you the US situation. \n\nImagine the same around the globe in all developed nations. \n\nNot a lot of people realize that government is big business - the biggest when they want to be.  \n\nThrow all the global tension in there as well with all major country‚Äôs expanding their military‚Äôs - do you know how much steel goes into building naval vessels?  Tanks?  This is why there was a section 232 enacted - steel production is necessary for our safety and self-defense.  Lastly, I once sold steel as part of a nuclear reactor project.  Do you know how many truckloads of steel alone went into the building of one nuclear reactor?  1,600 - 24 ton trucks. 40,000T. To build one aircraft carrier?  60,000T.  \n\nCheck this out:  https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2442969/statement-from-deputy-secretary-of-defense-david-l-norquist-on-the-department-o/\n\nWanted to share as a lot of you keep asking. \n\nI‚Äôm bullish on steel. \n\nMy first post said this was a short term play - to trade out in 6 months or when steel prices go sideways for 60 days straight. \n\nI‚Äôm starting to believe this is a LONGER TERM PLAY. \n\nI‚Äôm pushing out to August at this point.  \n\nBased on what Biden announces and will get passed - this may be a 2021 play into 2022. \n\nDon‚Äôt get crazy yet.  \n\nWait for the Vito blessing. \n\nHope Saturday night has been good.  \n\nMore NFL tomorrow - bet the STEELERS TO COVER. \n\nThey win by 25 - guessing that will also be the price of $CMC after earnings pre-market. \n\n-Vito", "id": "ku7yj8", "created_utc": 1610255109.0, "score": 521, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 324, "comments": [{"body": "Guys!

{"title": "They'll have to prize my GME shares out of my cold, dead, perfectly formed hands", "selftext": "I want to add to the GME backlash-backlash by explaining why I'll never sell my shares as long as Ryan Cohen is in. I'm a bit older than a lot of you weirdos, and us Gen Xers might have an extra perspective on the GME saga that I haven't seen mentioned that often.\n\nI remember **Pets.com,** and there's no reason why I should because I was busy going to raves and dropping E or whatever (i.e. studying). But I do remember it, because it was hard to miss. In 1998-99 it exploded as this dazzling symbol of everything that was vibrant and excitingly fucking totally mental about the dot.com boom. Amazon threw money at the startup, it had an enormous media presence and apparently a great online store, and it raised over $80 million on the NASDAQ (I looked at Wiki for that).\n\nAnd then Pets.com so entirely and rapidly collapsed that it became a laughing stock for years. FOR YEARS. The parody ad that was aired during the 2001 Super Bowl was only the start. I don't live in the US (we couldn't even buy from the company over here), but I remember everyone laughing their heads off over the mess that was Pets.com.\n\nAnd in the following years, when people were still wiping their eyes from crying or laughing at this god-awful lesson, Ryan Cohen was thinking about setting up.....a fucking online pet store. It should have been the last thing anyone would have wanted to touch. From my own limited DD, the granddaddy of US pet companies, Petsmart, had been a B&M store for about 15 years already, and the difficulties it experienced from 1996 meant it wasn't exactly a guiding light either.\n\nSo the 25-year-old Ryan Cohen decided to open Chewy and was abruptly - and logically - turned down by 100 investors. They smiled politely and ran a mile. But according to Cohen, he **'moved forward and never changed his business strategy'** despite having 100 doors closed in his face. Eventually, one of those investors got back to himself and cofounder Michael Day and said they liked the numbers and would throw a bit of money at the new company.\n\nCohen and Day proceeded to turn Chewy into a behemoth. Less than one year after being founded, Chewy had revenues of $26 million, though it was losing money, and then from 2014 to 2015 it grew from $205 million to $423 million, due to its focus on customer service and emotional connection etc. We all know about Petsmart buying the outfit for **$3.5 Billion** in 2017, only six years after starting up.\n\nThis whole story is the thing that sticks in my head, more than any hope of a squeeze or the likelihood of a slow, long turnaround under the current board.\n\nAnd Cohen's latest tweet about the roller-coaster only adds to my possibly demented thinking, because in his keynote speech he gave to the Florida Venture Capital Conference in 2018, he compared growing a business to having a child, saying,\n\n'It is a huge act of selflessness and dedication and if you are ready for it, **it is going to be a crazy,  crazy, crazy roller-coaster and it will be the journey of a lifetime.'**\n\nSo, to people looking at the excellent but pessimistic technical analysis, the gloomy outlook over the upcoming earnings and the conference tomorrow, and the hit pieces that are popping up at the moment like wildfire, you can shove them up your hole.\n\nRyan Cohen has a screw loose, and I'm betting on that beautiful screw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Pos: ca. 300 shares @ ca. $17; not much, but everything's relative)", "id": "kuhaca", "created_utc": 1610295411.0, "score": 863, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 190, "comments": [{"body": "Started with 1000 shares @ $13.
