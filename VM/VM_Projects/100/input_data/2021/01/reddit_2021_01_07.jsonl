It is top of mind.\n* Future strategic options numerous: US/global transition, a la TikTok, still isn't out of the realm of possibility.... acquiring or partnerships with other \"brands\" such as Sanrio/Hello Kitty, Rilakumma, Doreamon etc., or creating homegrown franchises and creating Disney-like content umbrella also not out of realm of possibility.

Liability is high, and the manufacturing process itself has to be ultra precise. And you've got different tooling and dies for every single caliber, and there are a FUCKLOAD of different calibers; then you've got different ammo grades and the different bullet weights and types and it all just spirals out of control.\n\nSetting up a new factory is very expensive, not just because of that but because you're dealing with insane amounts of hazardous chemicals you're using to manufacture explosives, some of which are of the \"you drop it and you no longer exist\" variety, and that's the kind you have to stuff into a little brass cup that will reliably go \"bang\" when it gets hit hard enough but will net you a mere $0.04/ea. Could Remington or Federal build a new factory? Absolutely.

I walked into my friendly local AK store a few weeks after the panic hit; they didn't have a single handgun left and everything on the walls under $1.5k, collectible or not, had been sold.

By the time this stuff takes you could end up with a whole new next-gen thing that comes out of left field.

Simply put they are running out of people on earth qualified to join (have connectivity) and an interest. Once you hit market saturation, you slow down. Unfortunately for them, the US economy is fixated on the idea of growth. Being successful or profitable isn't as important as growth. Growth is what makes the stock go up. How will they deal with this problem? They'll need to they can come up with a plan to show growth in something other than users. \n\n>2. Facebooks original demographic is disenchanted. It's no longer elite, private, interesting. It's noisy, commercial, public. Who wants to friend their grandmother? Who wants their aunt seeing their drunken mistakes from the night before?\n\n>3. People get bored of things after a while. People get bored of things on the internet even faster.\n\n>4. Facebook's only major perk was \"keeping you in touch\", but the cost was privacy and oversharing. Several alternatives are popping up with a lower cost across all of Facebook's platforms. \n\n>5. People prefer less intrusive tools. The best tools are the least intrusive. The reason the cell phone is superior to the landline is it doesn't tie you to a location. The reason a car is superior to a horse is it doesn't require as much maintenance, can go faster for longer. Facebook is very time intensive for the gain of \"keeping in touch\".
