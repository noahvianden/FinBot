If a call has a large IV isn't it because buyers are willing to pay more and sellers are demanding more premium? Hence, isn't the market telling us the underlying asset is likely to increase? Shouldn't the curve be skewed to the upside, or not centre on zero?\n* I understand why for European options the call and put IV's should normally be the same, all things being equal. However for American style options am I right that if a call has a high IV and a put has a low IV for the same strike price / expiration date, then the market is anticipating a move upward?

If the CEO is conservative and talking about trying to get finances in order and fixing the balance sheets, it’s probably gonna stay kinda flat or drop a bit.\n\nYou can also just go long in progressive companies in things you believe in, particularly if it’s something a lot of other people believe in. That’s why EV stocks have been blowing up, lots of people believe in them and a lot of those companies are being really aggressive. \n\nThere’s metrics that should be taken into account as well while doing your DD, balance sheets, debts, contract deadlines coming up if applicable, the market they are in and whats going on etc etc. These things I usually check last personally because if I don’t believe in what a company is doing and trust it’s leadership I don’t care about the rest.

That 10% market share puts Tesla in fourth place behind SAIC-GM-Wuling, BYD, and SAIC's own brand, and also puts Tesla behind the combined sales of the \"start-ups\" Li Auto, WM Motors, Xpeng and NIO, which totaled a combined 14,800 units in October.\n\n> In May, by contrast, Tesla delivered 11.362 units in China according to the CPCA, representing 17.3% of the monthly total of 65,728 BEV deliveries in China.  Tesla has been able to maintain monthly deliveries in the 10,000-12,000 unit range, but that is well short of the company's published capacity of 250,,000 units annually in China (or 21,000 per month.) and clearly the competition is eating into Tesla’s market share.  \n\nMusk is trying to buy his way out of the poor design and quality of build problems by spending money on new factories overseas and hiring talent to improve these quality issues. \n\nhttps://www.teslarati.com/tesla-design-chief-china-hiring-25k-car/\n\n> Once a director is hired for China, Tesla will reportedly be filling in the county’s dedicated design team, which would comprise around 20 people.

The facility will also be creating the final three-dimensional models of vehicles. Research on Chinese consumer tastes will reportedly be conducted by the studio as well, allowing the company to operate a rather independent branch in the Asian country. \n\nThis is what Musk actually needs to do if he doesn't want his company's car sales to fall off a cliff. He has to build factories in other countries and create an entirely new design and engineering leadership, process and culture. In effect, he has to use the boatload of investor cash he's been gifted with to buy his company into being better than it currently is capable of being.\n\nTesla's high stock price valuation is based on there being exploding EV sales growth. But Tesla will have an increasingly small piece of that growing pie. Because it was the first out in the market, its market share is currently about 18% of that market.

Personally, I predict that the EV market share will more than double to between 7 and 10% of the global auto market in 2021 alone.\n\n> I expect Tesla is going to grow its sales by roughly 50% next year, which is going to help, but I think that Volkswagen with the ID.3 and ID.4, Audi with Q4 e-tron, Ford with the Mustang Mach E, Nissan with Ariya, and many more, are going to have an even greater impact than Tesla increasing sales by 50%.\n\nSo while EV sales will explode, Tesla's sales will not if you compare what Tesla is selling to what its competitors are offering. Other car companies sales will grow more/faster than Tesla's sales. \n\nThe vast amount of money that Musk can throw at his improving production build and design quality is also less of an advantage going forward, now that Apple, Bidu and other massive companies with deep pockets are entering the market.\n\nUltimately, Tesla is going to be more and more marginalized in the EV space until it's a niche company for quirky people who are attracted to the cult product aspect of the company.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I'm confident in China's government that if it senses Tesla's hurting its own EV companies, China will find a way to pressure Tesla and promote its Nio or whatever EV companies it prefers.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Except Tesla sells much more cars in China, time will tell.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "All it takes is 1 sanction to take that market away from Tesla though", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "What do you mean?

I did not say \"buy the market leader and stay with them forever\", I said to buy the best of breed, there is a difference between those two things; the best of breed isn't always the market leader. The best of breed could be the up and coming company that you are referring to.

I don't think you will find anybody come to that conclusion with boomer logic.\n\nAnd you shouldn't just look past companies that are still innovating and growing just because they have already runup a lot. Five years ago, some people were thinking that Amazon and Apple had already runup so much that it was too late and that they needed to find the \"next Amazon\" and \"the next Apple\". In the 5 years since then, we have seen that the \"next Amazon\" was Amazon and the \"next Apple\" was Apple and I don't think anybody would have been disappointed with the returns that they got from those two companies over the last 5 years. Are there companies that had even better growth? Of course, but you can't tell me that you would not have been thrilled with the returns that you got from Amazon and Apple and you can't tell me that it would have been easy to find a company that gave you better returns. It did not matter that Amazon and Apple had already runup a lot five years ago, they were still clearly by far the best of breed and they still clearly had mega growth opportunities in front of them so it was silly to just look past them. Now, people are doing the same with Tesla and thinking that it is too late. It is not; their growth opportunities are just beginning.\n\nAnd I'm not saying that you should not try to find the next up and coming company; I'm always looking for up and coming companies, but I think that if you go into that search trying to find the \"next Tesla\", you are likely to fail because if people are calling them the \"next Tesla\" then that means that they are just living in Tesla's shadow and it is clear who the best of breed still is. I think that you should be trying to find the next up and coming company that is doing their own innovative thing; one that is not trying to be the next <insert successful company here> but is instead doing such amazing things that they are building their own identity that separates them from everybody else.

It looks like a 6 month long trend is changing. The reflation trade was immediately crowded into by active managers on the 1st, and now everyone is trying to back off a bit from the consensus trade. Furthermore, the reflation trade is dependent on a weakening Dollar which many thought was reinforced by the Dem sweep/+stimulus spending. However as yields on the 10yr are rising, there's a stronger than expected bid for the Dollar and yields from places that are still stuck for 0 yields. Metals and commodities are selling off as well and rising yields are making negative carry trades seem more unattractive than many predicted. All of this is leading to a risk-off mood.\n\nMeanwhile Fed Bostic spoke today and caused a bit of a down-spike mid-day as he firmed up against yield curve control. So Growth continues to looks prone to continue to be rotated out from, but people were rotating into +reflation which is crowded and hitting a Dollar snag, thus it's just risk-off.\n\nYou're in for a rude awakening if you're taking the post '08 yield landscape for granted.

{"title": "Time to Sell Tesla...Tesla March 2021 CONVERTIBLE Senior Notes Due - Add $30B+ shares to the markets", "selftext": "These days its all about \"Tesla to MARs\" but time to be careful. With Tesla trading at $880, take your profits before a correction.\n\nTLDR of the below: Sell Tesla, or/and buy puts. Lot of new shares/liquidity of shares coming on to the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Whats happening:**\n\n$1.2B of debt was issued in 2013 in relation to the 2021 convertibles. Each at a face value of 1,000Therefore there are 1.2M NotesEach note can be converted by the unit holder to 13.8940 shares of Tesla.Total shares = 16.6728M shares\n\nAt the closing price of $880, thats $14.672B in added liquidity - these are non restricted shares that can be sold right away, and therefore can encourage \"shorting\" by the holders.\n\nTesla also issued warrants for the amount of 19.2M additional shares. These however are not \"dilutive\" as they entered into essentially an options contract to purchase those shares at the effective conversion price for the notes. But these are still shares that were previously being \"held\" and will not be on the open markets.\n\nThe 19.2M \"additional shares\" are currently shares likely held by a hedge fund against the options contract written to Tesla. This means that those 19.2M shares are essentially being added to the open markets upon exercise of the warrants. Adding an additional \\~$17B in liquidity.\n\nTotal: 35.9M shares to be added to the open market, or approximately $31.7B worth.\n\nThe equity dilution will be limited to about \\~$15B, but a total of $31.7B more shares will be available on open markets. Note this is 6x each of the previous offerings still, and could add significant downside pressure to the stock.\n\nAdd the above to natural profit taking at record highs...well I would expect a big correction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExpecting: <$600 by March.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the Financials:\n\n2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 NotesDuring the first quarter of 2020, we classified the carrying value of our 2021 Notes as current liabilities as the maturity date of the 2021 Notes is March 2021. During each of the quarters of 2020 through September 30, 2020, the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of each of our 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; causing the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020. As the settlement of conversion of the 2021 Notes would be in cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, cash and/or shares of our common stock for any conversion premium at our election, we reclassified $26 million, representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2021 Notes and the carrying value as of September 30, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020. As we now expect to settle a portion of the 2022 and 2024 Notes in the fourth quarter of 2020, we reclassified $249 million and $32 million, respectively, of the carrying value of the 2022 and 2024 Notes from debt and finance leases, net of current portion to current portion of debt and finance leases on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020. Additionally, we reclassified $13 million and $9 million, respectively, representing the difference between the current portion of aggregate principal of our 2022 and 2024 Notes and the current portion of the carrying value as of September 30, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020. As the settlement of conversion of the remainder of the 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes would be in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof is at our election, the liability is classified as non-current. Should the closing price conditions be met in a future quarter for any of these notes, such notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. The debt discounts recorded on the 2021 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2024 Notes is recognized as interest expense through the respective maturity dates of each note and early conversions can result in the acceleration of such recognition.As adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes is now convertible into 13.8940 shares, 15.2670 shares and 16.1380 shares, respectively, of our common stock, which is equivalent to conversion prices of approximately $71.97, $65.50 and $61.97 per share, respectively. Under the note hedge transactions we entered in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes, we have the option to purchase 19.2 million shares, 14.9 million shares and 29.7 million shares, respectively, for the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes at prices of approximately $71.97, $65.50, and $61.97 per share, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. Additionally, in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 19.2 million shares, 14.9 million shares and 29.7 million shares, respectively, for the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes at prices of approximately $112.13, $131.00, and $121.50 per share, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from approximately $71.97, $65.50, and $61.97 per share, respectively, to approximately $112.13, $131.00, and $121.50 per share, respectively.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTransactions relating to our convertible senior notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.The conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes issued by us or our subsidiaries would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of such notes by their holders, and we may be required to deliver a significant number of shares. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect their prevailing market prices. In addition, the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of such notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of such notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock.Moreover, in connection with certain of the convertible senior notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions, which are expected to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable notes. We also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties, which could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants on the applicable expiration dates. In addition, the hedge counterparties or their affiliates may enter into various transactions with respect to their hedge positions, which could also cause or prevent an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible senior notes.\n\n\n\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm", "id": "kuqyaw", "created_utc": 1610324728.0, "score": 88, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Have you seen what happens to this stock post dilution?", "score": 124, "replies": [{"body": "Buddy doesn’t understand if all of the shares sold it would drop the stock 1.5% in dillution.

The main purpose is to catch stocks that have dropped a lot and may be on the way back up soon (BABA, I'm looking at you very bigly...)\n\nWhat criteria are you using to decide whether a stock is worth buying a call on?\n\n***\n\nTo anyone else curious, I wrote my Python bot using the talib and yfinance libraries. Really all it does it save me a shitload of time in checking charts every day for a list of well over 50 stocks. It's also written specifically to help me find good prospects for long-term holds, which I realize might not appeal to many of the people in this sub who like to flip shit fast. (Proper long-term investing is boring as fuck.)\n\nHowever, the past few years have taught me one indisputable lesson: I would have made much, much more money if I had just bought and held stocks rather than tried to flip them. I have probably left well over 50K on the table in the past four years by thinking I am some kind of wizard who can buy and sell all day long. Nope. I had NIO at under $3, for fuck's sake. I had ROKU at under $70 and the list goes on. \n\nIt has also had another very positive and unanticipated effect: not only is it working to alert me to interesting moves, it's also helping me hold off on making stupid impulsive buys. By paying close attention to historical trends for a stock and waiting for certain indicators to be met, I hope to really limit my ADD clicky buy finger activities.

Public opinion might be divided, but the current law is clear. \n\nThis started WELL before 2014. Legal scholarship happily uses loose connections to past issues and interpretations because the reasoning behind them are often meant to be as timeless as possible, and they usually explicitly state otherwise if they only want to be super specific for a finite item. Here we are talking about free speech, as they were in the 1700’s. They were concerned about pamphlets and shit, and the tyranny of printing control. Twitter doesn’t really change much of the legal equation (again unless Congress changes established laws). Fucking laws about goddamn old timely innkeepers are a backbone of our telecommunications laws. I’m serious when I say the topic is interesting.\n\nThe twitter debate most closely has roots in 90’s court cases about moderating forum content in the age of dial up internet. And they formed legal arguments based on other past cases and laws. Then congress made a new law. Ad infinitum.

I can’t find a great, quick summary connecting everything, but these innkeeper rules turned into “common carrier” laws that affect phones, railways, and other random shit.

It might be possible to make a legal argument that Amazon servers are a common carrier service and thus cannot discriminate against hosting Parler, or something like that.

{"title": "For all the 🌈🐻 s saying GameStop (GME) will go bankrupt due to gaming moving away from physical discs to digital sales, Daddy Ryan has already thought of this", "selftext": "We all know that the 🌈🐻s are calling GameStop (GME) blockbuster because the gaming industry is going digital away from physical discs, etc. However, these peak autistic retards (and not in the good way) think that our lord and savior Daddy Ryan (RC) has not addressed this issue. RC has indeed addressed this problem. In fact, that's where the ***greatest*** opportunity lies.\n\nFirst off, let me start with some speculation on where RC will be taking GME. There's a lot of speculation that GME will now become the Amazon of the gaming world as the one stop shop for all things gaming. Even if GME is unable to capture gaming sales due to the transition to digital sales, GME is still massively undervalued. GME's collectible business alone generated *737M* in 2019. Fucking action figures and shit. GME's market cap is roughly *1.35B.* Theoretically, GME running solely an online collectibles business would be undervalued right now. Don't forget, these  🌈🐻s are betting on *bankruptcy*, ie the stock going to 0. GME just needs to produce a sustainable business model to beat the shorts. Not only that, there's always going to be gaming hardware and supplies sales like consoles, controllers, headsets, gaming chairs. GME also sells TVs, monitors, gaming PCs, etc.\n\nFrom the holiday sales update, we saw GME's E-Commerce sales are up over 300% and now account for 34% of company sales. This is exactly what RC is looking for. GME is already involved in the digital sales business by selling digital games, digital subscriptions, digital gift cards, etc. If GME were to truly becoming a one stop shop for gaming, people would use GME instead of buying directly through their console or PC because while they shop for PS/Xbox games using GME, they can also shop for games for their PC, all while buying gift cards for their friends or purchasing gaming subscriptions like PlayStation Plus.\n\nBut here's the real reason why people will use GME for purchasing digital games. *Online trade-ins.* Say it with me, you beautiful retard. ***Online trade-ins.*** In RC's open letter to the board, he wrote:\n\n\" Significantly upgrading e-commerce can provide for greater revenue capture across larger gaming catalogs, digital content and community experiences, ***online trade-ins***, streaming services and Esports. \"\n\n[https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC\\_Ventures\\_Letter\\_to\\_GameStop.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/RC_Ventures_Letter_to_GameStop.pdf)\n\nGME's highest margin revenue stream is physical disc trade-ins. However, if GME is able to create a digital ecosystem where its customers buy all their digital games through GME across all platforms (PC, PS, Xbox, etc), they would be able to trade in their digital games for store credit to buy new digital games. For example, if someone trades in a digital PS5 game, they could use that store credit to buy a PC game. This would keep customers coming back for the same reason people go back to GME today. Furthermore, RC addresses the move towards digital by specifically pointing out \"digital content and community experiences\" and \"streaming services and Esports\". Daddy Ryan is here to transform GME, not just make what it's currently doing better.\n\nPositions: 2000 shares at 18.64 (1300 purchased this morning after RC news), 1 LEAP ($25 strike, Jan 2023) - all positions purchased on margin like a true degenerate retard\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nTLDR: GME creates an online platform for customers to buy all their games digitally across all platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox, etc) and RC plans on giving customers online trade-ins for store credit to buy new digital games to keep them coming back.", "id": "kvcard", "created_utc": 1610399685.0, "score": 555, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 213, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 288, "replies": [{"body": "Has WSB gone so autist that we've looped around and are now boomers investing in value stocks?\n\nOr were the boomers the real autists all along?", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "That level of autism just couldn't be sustained.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "RAD and some other deep value plays were before all this EV/TSLA gang crap.

In fact, most of the times you can find deals in stores for physical games, but for digital you only have Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo as the seller (I know some webpages sell keys but they normally come from bundles that include a key for a game, no disc, and MS has started to not give you a key but rather have the game already linked to the console you bought, to avoid the online resell) so they sell at the price they want to sell and make way more profit than in physical, as they are cutting down the middle man, distribution, manufacturing, etc. And, the point of this discussion, the digital games cannot be traded-in or sold to another person.\n\nSo the benefits of digital (apart from environmental which is good on itself) for the costumer are just the convenience of not having to move their ass to a store, not having to swap disks when they want to change games and the possibility of sharing their digital games with other people (this is somewhat complex and requires confidence between parties, you basically link the account where the game is bought with 2 different consoles, one which is the console where said account is normally logged in and another one which is the receiver of the share. This way both accounts have access to the same license of this game). Microsoft and Sony probably know that people share the digital licenses by this method, but allow it because they rather have players buy digital than physical (hence why they pushed it with the new consoles).\n\nThe biggest point against digital that I read in online forums is that you cannot trade the games, neither with a store or another player. I have no problems imagining MS and Sony (Nintendo's policies are retarded) banning this license sharing but allowing for trades with stores and maybe with other players. This may reduce their current profit on digital sales as the sharing method is somewhat complicated and I'd say most people don't do it but it'd allow them to push harder for digital gaming which is what they want. In the end, more people going digital = more profit, both from having most of their games sold digitally and also (and this is a stretch) they can stop manufacturing consoles with disk readers but keep the price of the consoles as if they had the disk reader.\n\nHope this was somewhat useful :)", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Because unless Sony and Microsoft are going to get in the business of selling games that only run on the others' consoles, they need to get a third party involved so that I can \"trade in\" my copy of God of War 4 for Halo 5. \n\nThere needs to be a system for verifying when a game has been deleted from one system/account and credit has been issued, and a system for using that credit towards another system/account's game(s).

It sounds more like they want to arm GameStop with incentives to push more products to Xbox fans. Try doing the same with Walmart/target/Best Buy I don’t think you get the same result \nbecause while they sell video games they don’t specialize in them. \n\nAs far as the investors they each have come out and said why they like GameStop.

This is a strong foundation for him to work with along with 60m loyalty customers. He’s not starting from scratch so to just say he will likely fail is overly pessimistic.

It shows this company isn’t as fragile as they are making it out to be. \n\nWhich leads me to my last point. Every cycle bears say there will be no more disks but it will cripple Sony/Microsoft if they do this and basically tell their customers all of their previous investments are now worthless and no longer playable without repurchasing them online. I think we may keep seeing this 2-Console model from the manufacturers so they don’t alienate their customers. But let’s assume they don’t. People wanting to play their old games will need somewhere to either purchase the older consoles and/or older used games. GameStop now enters the chat. \n\nAll of that though, assumes nothing changes with the business model. Cohen really wants to shake this company up and honestly we have no clue where he can take this thing. But they have turned the company around in a way where he has a great starting point, a lot of cash, growing revenue thanks to a new cycle, and low amounts of debt.

If you know exactly what your target audience is buying, how much they are spending, when they are buying it, it can dramatically improve your marketing campaign and sales. Data is a powerful tool these days and if used right by GME can be monetized very well. GME is an agnostic retailer, they can leverage this data by selling it to any publisher they wish. They also offering digital advertising to publishers/vendors on their platform in tandem with this data so it becomes as efficient as possible. It can be a big cash cow if done right. Cohen knows this.\n\nCurrent management hinted towards doing so in their 2019 turnaround plan called 'GameStop Reboot', however they have not mentioned it since nor does it look like they have begun.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312520148780/d918174ddefa14a.htm\n\nSee page 14, second pillar, 4th bullet point.\n\nIts just another digital revenue stream for the future of GME.

The windshield alone will make people want to have one. Although I haven’t seen one in person, I do know of the designer; Derek Jenkins. He’s the guy who brought us the [VW Sirocco Concept](https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g18123426/volkswagen-iroc-concept-gallery/) and eventually the [ND Miata](https://www.caranddriver.com/photos/g15330684/2016-mazda-mx-5-miata-first-drive-review-gallery/). You can see the beginnings of soft, organic shapes stretched over wheels pushed to corners. It will not doubt look beautiful in the real world, with sunshine over the body. I’d gamble that having a background at VW will also bring specific attention to materials inside as well. Napa leather and “natural” materials (exotic wood and alloys) as trim. \n\nWith the batteries being small, yet the car using a lot of them, cost should be a bit better compared to the traditional set up of a single, large cell. I’d imagine this is also a cheat on their efficiency too, since the weight would be kept down. Weight and ballast management is arguably the second most important thing as to how a car performs on the road (wheels and tires being most important). We won’t know for sure though until they boys over at C&D or R&T can test it.\n\nThe only real hang-up I see is pricing. $160K is such a small sector of customer in the auto industry. Don’t get me wrong-it’s typical for new companies to sell a “premium” product in the beginning of business; it helps to generate cash for future growth. But a price as high as that will only appeal to a certain customer, and like it or not, you can buy a lot of car from other very well-established companies for money like that. This is where TSLA has an advantage over everyone right now. \n\nFor me? I know the EV thing is popular with investors these days, largely due to the success of Elon’s offering, but there will be several companies try to capitalize on the interest without necessarily focusing on making a good product. I’d be pretty conservative on my initial investment come IPO. If for no other reason than this: it’s hard as Fuck to make a good car. No matter who you hire, what your research is, where you’re at, or what you got, you simply can not plan for what happens in the real world. There’s always going to be some form of happenstance that catches you off guard. I won’t be going hard in the paint with Lucid until they have a far on the street, in the sunshine. There’s simply too much to risk this early in the game. \n\nGME to the moon retards\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌖💎✋", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "im 2 retarded what is ticker", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "CCIV", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Posted after it mooned.
