{"title": "If the Markets Shut Down Tomorrow for 10 years, What Would You Invest in Today? - A Buffett Exercise", "selftext": "“Only buy something that you'd be perfectly happy to hold if the market shut down for 10 years.\"\n\nAs The Great One likes to point out, investing isn't complicated. He's consistently preached about investing in good companies with great management or investing in within your circle of competence. Sure, he's missed out on the tech boom, but results are results. His teachings span across all generations and his quirky teachings make investing seem so simple. \n\nWe're now in an environment that many say is a bubble (though that's been the case for 20 years), uncertainty about the FED artificially inflating the price of stocks, and an army of young investors YOLOing it all on garbage companies, perhaps exploiting how easily the market can be manipulated. But for Buffett, the dude just grabs his McDonalds sandwich each morning, heads to work, sucks down a Coke, and reads for like 8 hours...completely ignoring all the noise. Why? He's invested in good companies with good management. \n\nSo assuming you could only invest in 6 stocks, (1 of which is completely speculative just for fun) and TOMORROW the markets shut down for 10 years, which companies would you invest in TODAY?\n\nHere's my list in the order from highest to lowest portfolio %\n\n1.

What are you talking about? \n\nYou seem to fundamentally misunderstand what a stock is. It means you own a portion of a company. The stock has an intrinsic value which will go up or down depending on how the company performs, regardless of whether the markets are open. It will pay dividends, and the price of the stock will update when the markets reopen.

Then the markets close for 10 years, there is no exchange on the stock market, no buyers, no sellers, even if X has a huge rise in profits the price is still 200 because no one can basically sell it for more (or less). How else would the price change if there are no buyers?\n\nIn the meantime, the economy is still on the go, and inflation is affecting the prices of common goods. So technically for the $200 you're holding you are not able to buy the same amount of goods anymore which means your money is worth less than it used to at the time of buying the stock. As a side note even if the markets are not closed inflation is eating a portion of your money.\n\nOf course, you may say that after these 10 years when the market opens the price of your stock will immediately skyrocket to reflect its real value (if there is some real value, after all, it's always regulated by supply and demand which in this case is frozen for the whole time).

Then the market closes for 10 years. The market price of a share of $X is not $200 as you suggest, but $0, because there is no market for $X during this time. Inflation is completely irrelevant to this discussion (except insofar as it affects X's operations), because you own 1 share from when you buy until when you sell.\n\nWhen you buy a share of a company: that's what you have, a share of that company. It doesn't deflate or inflate. While your broker might track the market value of your portfolio, you don't actually have $200 in your account after buying a share worth $200. You can't buy common goods with your share.\n\nIf you buy a share of a company, you are buying a portion of the ownership of that company, no more no less. The point Buffet and every other great investor makes is: when you buy a stock, don't worry about what the price of the stock will be in a week or in a year. Concern yourself with how the company will do. If the company does well, you'll do well. If it pays dividends you'll get dividends.

As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit.

{"title": "$GME DD- Fundamentals: Why WSB Just Bought a Value Stock.", "selftext": "I saw u/Unlucky-Prize post about the technical factors for $GME and felt inspired to make a post about the reasons why I‘m long this stock, which is the fundamentals.  I don’t do options or techincal analysis so please refer to other posts for that info.\n\n$GME had been on my radar for quite some time but I finally dipped my toes in two weeks ago.  The basis for that wasn’t the potential for a short squeeze or short interest but the underlying fundamentals behind $GME.  I had posted a long comment in a previous thread and will expand on that to explain why I’m bullish long term for $GME.  I hope this helps.  This post is meant to be a personal opinion and not advice to buy or sell Gamestop.\n\n🐻 Case: \n\n1.  Digital sales will make Gamestop the next Blockbuster.  \n\nThe digital game sales argument, like all 🐻  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the 🐻 are right, but they’re right in 8 years which means they’re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels as more\npeople go back to stores.  This trend should continue if the pandemic improves.  Additionally game publishers don’t care about the fractionally\nlarger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical. \n\nBlockbuster died because Carl Icahn got involved, killed Blockbuster’s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model by offering an online rental service and Blockbuster’s old business model relied on late fees.  Icahn insisted that Blockbuster's greatest asset was its physical location and late fees, killed the pivot and forced them to triple down on their old strategy.  Carl ended up losing 98% of his investment in Blockbuster.  There continues to be demand for physical movie rentals as evidenced by Red Box locations and Netflix still has a few million dvd by mail subscribers.\n\nGamestop has also recently started to pivot away from software sales into other areas and now software sales now make up large minority of Gamestop's total sales.  They're pivoting more towards physical goods and not just Funko Pops but also plan to expand more into new areas like PC gaming and hardware.  \n\nEveryone knows that they signed a revenue agreement with Microsoft where Gamestop will get a cut of the lifetime revenue from Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.  This shouldn't sour the relationship with Sony or Nintendo.  If anything, Sony and Nintendo should be compelled to offer a similar revenue share agreement because Gamestop will inevitably push Microsoft products if Gamestop stand to profit more from it.  This will be a bigger deal in later years as console availability increases and consumers actually deciding to cross shop consoles as opposed to getting whichever new one is available right now.  Sony and Nintendo won't stop selling products through Gamestop because of this agreement with Microsoft, it's too large of a sales channel to give up.\n\n2.  Gamestop will go bankrupt\n\nThis is highly unlikely to happen.  Gamestop managed to survive the single worst brick and mortar retail sales environment in modern history and ended the year with a cash surplus of a few hundred million.  Now its the new year and the beginning of a new console cycle.  This console cycle should last as long as the previous ones which is close to a decade, plus or minus a few years.  During that time, they will be printing money hand over fist selling consoles, new games, used games, accessories, protection plans, etc.\n\n3.  Brick and mortar retail is dead.  Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.\n\nGamestop's average lease durations are actually quite short.  A lot of brick and mortar shops have lease duration lasting a decade but the average lease duration for Gamestop is just 2-4 years.  This allows them to close underperforming stores and open new ones very quickly.\n\nGamestop's saw e-commerce grow by 250% last quarter.  The company has been and continues to pivot towards a \"digital-first, omni-channel ecosystem for games and entertainment\"\n\n🐂 Case\n\nThis MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in all of 2020 as many continue to bet against Gamestop, instead of a sharp spike like Volkswagen, where Porsche played a large role in spiking the share price.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  \n\nThis isn’t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  \n\nThis has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next Chewy, you’re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don’t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  \n\nSimply put, if I told you there was a business that served a $200 billion total addressable market with very discerning and loyal customers with a lot of disposable income to spend on this market.  They have over 5,000 retail locations all across the world.  Last quarter, they saw Ecommerce grow by nearly 300% and ended a year where many other brick and mortar retailers went bankrupt with hundreds of millions of dollars in extra cash.  This company has a database called PowerUp consisting of tens of millions of customers that pay them a yearly premium membership.  They're starting a multiyear pivot into several new growing areas and have new board members that are industry leaders in each of those respective areas at the start of a new product launch cycle that will last a decade.  A young visionary founder who made his billions by creating a customer centric experience that defeated Amazon, who is well known to focus on one idea to the point of obsession, just became this company's largest shareholder and now controls the board.  I tell you this company trades at .5 sales.  Would you short or long this company?\n\n\nTLDR:  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 But not because of the MOASS.\n\nEdit: I forgot I had 5000 shares in my YOLO account so position is actually 35,000 GME", "id": "kyyoa0", "created_utc": 1610855274.0, "score": 787, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 218, "comments": [{"body": "I’m doubling down on Tuesday. 🚀", "score": 234, "replies": [{"body": "Same here.

Demo Day is coming on Jan 26th, and leading up to that will be a buying opportunity, because Palantir’s is 🚀going 🚀to 🚀the 🍆fuckin’ 🌖moon, boys. Get your helmets on, and strap in. This 🚀rocket’s about to blast off.\n\nPalantir’s pretty well-established in the Data Analytics community with Big Government contracts pouring money into it's R&D projects. You don’t need to turn a profit when the Government uses you for their skunkworks dept. Especially this early on the explosion of industry that is Surveillance.\n\nSpeaking of surveillance... let’s take a little walk down memory lane, shall we. Y’all remember Barack Obama, right? Tan suit? Dijon mustard? The guy who [wrote annual Presidential Executive Orders declaring a continued State of National Emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_the_United_States) that brought us the NSA cell phone bullshit, along with all the other erosions of our privacy we are now totally accustomed to, and largely gave us the rise of Mass Surveillance? Turns out, ol' Barry had some pretty colorful characters working for him. One of those characters was this total badass named [Avril Haines.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Haines)\n\nIf you don’t know about her, [you should.](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/30/939722113/the-winding-journey-of-avril-haines-bidens-pick-to-lead-u-s-intelligence) Again, because she’s a badass. Studied Judo in Japan, apparently became bored with that at some point and casually studied theoretical physics at University of Chicago. Somehow that wasn’t exciting enough for her, so in her down time, she ended up buying a used-up, junk-ass Cessna airplane, and rebuilt the avionics herself. Once that little weekend project was completed, she tried to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and crash-landed near the Newfoundland coast. No shit. I mean, who does that?! A badass judo hobbyist who dabbles in theoretical physics, that’s who. Now, she did crash, yes, but: her co-pilot ended up falling in love and wife’in the shit out of her. I mean, can you blame the guy? They cuddled for awhile and opened up a little bookstore in the ghetto of Baltimore, hoping the danger of a drug riddled city could hold her lust for excitement and adventure. Shocker: it couldn’t.\n\nBy the early 2000’s, she was bouncing around government jobs doing lawyer stuff, and that’s when she met Joe Biden. Several high-profile positions followed, but the one I want to focus on happens in 2010, when she gets a seat at the table to be Deputy National Security advisor. Three years later? [She replaced Michael Morell, the CIA's deputy and former acting director.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cias-deputy-director-to-be-replaced-with-white-house-lawyer/2013/06/12/8fc2118e-d383-11e2-8cbe-1bcbee06f8f8_story.html)\n\nThat’s right, you heard me. The CIA.\n\nSpeaking of Joe Biden... guess who he just nominated to be the Director of National Security?. If you said Avril Haines, you get a good star.\n“Daegoba; what the fuuuuck does this have to do with Palantir?” Well... do any of you degenerates know who was the first investor in Palantir? [A little company called In-Q-Tel; the venture capital firm of the CIA.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel) They kicked Thiel [a cool $2 million waaaaaay back in 2003, just as he got the company off the ground.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies)\n\nNow, wouldn’t it stand to reason that maybe, just maybe, it would be a safe bet to assume that the company who helped kill Osama bin Laden, with all these old friends getting together to run the US Government over the next few years, will see a little bit of success? You think!?\n\nIf this isn’t your next big play over the long term, I don’t know; you should full send your window licking hobby and surrender your RH account to your wife's boyfriend. Palantir will be a giant in the next two years at the very least, and a Juggernaut in Data Analytics long into the foreseeable future.\n\nNow, go. Invest in Palantir, and retire early.

Its now valued at $40 Billion, granted anything eccommerce now gets money thrown at it like a stripper in a high flying strip club or some shit , so dont listen to me, so it may well be a bubble. Regardless the thing grows its revenue like bacteria doing binary fission on agar jelly 🚀🚀🚀🚀.\n\nTHEY SELL FUCKING PET FOOD. the market for that is like what? $1?. Gaming is going to the moon and is basically recession proof because of how cheap game is compared to other things for how much you get out of it. Any bears saying that Gamestop cant compete with digital or with amazon. Ryan cohen already slapped amazons head in with a no name brand. Hell fucking do it again. About digital everyone here already knows, microsoft deal, Ryan cohen also mentioned the possibility of having \"Digital game exchanging\" or something, image below.\n\n[Online trade ins.

This is the literal smell of money. Go to your Gamestop to build your PC with your kid? Gamestop is already the goto place wher your parents go to get you your latest digital fix so now they can go build PC's and it cant go tits up?\n\n**Now for some pussy boomer talk (aka fundametals or something).**\n\nThe expected Q3 EPS was -0.84$ or something close to that. The actual loss was -0.53$ but boomzoids only talked about the revenue drop. No shit sherlock its closing all its dead weight stores.\n\nIn the holiday report I will talk about a bit more below, 11% of stores were closed and revenue dropped only 3%. Comparitive store sales increased nearly 5%. They cant get enough consoles to sell so expect the momentum to carry on for the whole year I expect. Eccommerce is up 300% over holidays. In Q3 they reported 800% to date. In 2020 Gamestops eccomerce went up 24x. YES YOU READ THAT RIGHT. Online sales now account for \\~33% of Gamestops sales now. This is literally gold dust for ryan cohen.\n\nWe are still trading at 0.38 P/S at this price. The average P/S for the SP500 is 2.753. Massive upside on these two numbers alone.\n\nBurry got in this for the MOASS and the intrinsic value. At the time intrinsic value was like $22 and this will pump up as RC takes it to new heights.\n\nGME in Q3 somehow halved the expected loss. Big Bad Boomer sherman somehow didnt fuck it up that bad by saying \"omnichannel\" at the speed of light. Yes the revenue dropped 30% but thats covid for you. As the PC kiosk post above shows GME now sells small items basically so fast they have to have fake stock lmao. The new console cycle always spikes the share price sky high too, as youll see in a crayon drawing later. The potential revenue that this console cycle brings in could be huge. Biggest ever is potentially a true statement and Gamestop sells every fucker they get. Combine the fact that they share game pass ( a massive hit) revenue from the xboxes they sell, something no other retailer has, revenue could be sky high.\n\nNow I know you autists are starting to develop short term dyslexia or something but keep reading. This could be the most important piece of shit you read in your life. How do you think I feel? My brains overheating just trying to write coherent sentences.\n\nHoldiay report was a bear trap imo, saw people saying the decrease in revenue was bearish blah blah blah. Lies. Comparitve store sales rose 5% and thats with some towns having like 4 gamestops. When the leases dont get renewed and these stores get liquidated (Also in Ryan cohens letter) they can just get this influx of cash and pay down debt and invest in logistics and marketing and new growth. Gamestop realistically needs like 1/2 the stores they have now and just need to improve efficiency.\n\n[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/349890) this article the messiah himself wrote. In it he states:\n\n>At Chewy, we had maniacal discipline when it came to how we spent money. The company-wide culture of frugality came from his example. Free cash flow was our unwavering governor of growth. We grew Chewy from $200 million in sales in 2013 to $3.5 billion in 2018 while spending only $130 million in capital, all of which went into opening distribution centers across the country and acquiring new customers.\n\nManiacal.

Bears are stupid if they think MSFT didnt vet GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome valid bear thesis left now (the only ones left) ----> Ryan Cohen dies.\n\n# 2. Now some analysis on the short squeeze and some technical data on puts and calls and ortex data.\n\nOk everyone on here and their cat, dog, bedbugs and wifes boyfriend  knows about the squeeze. Jimmy chill aka cramer even talking about it. Gamestop is literally the most shorted stock of all time and space. The squeeze makes every autist salivate because its basically free money while cucking big money out of like what 1% of their fund.\n\nAlthough I know all you cucks hate shares, and hate holding, if the squeeze doesnt happen selling is probably the most retarded thing anyone could do. Its literally buy high sell low and you fucking disgust me. STONK ONLY GOES UP.\n\nThis squeeze is so monumental that its been sucking sharks in like fresh blood. Most of the funds where shorting this from 30-15 dollars before this year so they didnt really care. It all changed with 2 people. u/DeepFuckingValue and Dr. Michael Burry. These guys are as OG as it gets with GME. I think u/DeepFuckingValue may have even sniffed this trade out before the legend himself. Since then funds will have churned this through their rules and started jumping on this train. Ive been in since $13 with 125 shares. If I had more money Id be buying but im just some stupid student ok. Im merely a medium for this money made information.\n\n**The stats for this stock now short wise are, from ortex:**\n\n*Concrete* short interest as of 31 December 2020: **71 Million**.\n\n*Estimated* short interest, *January 11th data:* (This isnt predicted, this is from data in flow, has margin of error) : **77 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan 7 days ago: **50 Million**\n\nShort shares on loan *now* (This breaks the bearish margin calls affect longs more thesis): 54.2 Million\n\n% of known float short: **147%** as of 31 December 2020\n\n% of know free float on loaned shorts: **108%** as of January 11th.\n\nSome [guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyocql/updated_potential_holdings_of_gme/) on here took into account extra buying on wednesday, Institutions, Burry, RC's extra 7% and WSB ownership (something so stupendously  retarded no serious firm will do it) that float on short could be in the 100s of %. Total short float now I would say could be **200-400%** if the numbers are correct.  This pisses on all other short squeezes. Some countries ban shorting above 100% cos of how autistic it is.\n\nThe recent hike in interactive brokers available shares is probably a mix of sell off on friday (remember  some guys are now buying lambos with GME money. If they held they could buy 10), calls exercising and puts being covered and brokers ditching the shares. Nakedshort even reported 5 million naked GME shorts on friday. This is bullish as fuck because the best the shorts could do on a red market day was **-10%**.\n\nGamestop is still on the SECs threshold list for 27 days now.\n\n[This shows naked short selling and downwards pressure hasnt capitulated](https://preview.redd.it/xsetax08pwb61.jpg?width=1083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=172439b81f509ba01ed3e6489671d6f009298e84)\n\nNeed rockets 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀:\n\nOk so now if WSB owns an estimated 6-8% of the stock and we all know to move over to cash accounts now to avoid margin calls, we should be minimizing longs getting margin called. Every bear on stockwits is a clueless cuck who spouts \"blockbuster\" and these guys dont even know what margin even is so my bet is the colossal **54 Million** shares short on loan are gonna be affected by the margin calls more. Why? Because every long on margin is in the green, and now a true zealot/extremist/autist for ryan cohen so will supply their account with collateral to avoid margin call. Shorts are in the massive red zone. How do I know you ask?\n\nOrtex data from Jan 4th 2021:\n\n[This is the data from ortex for short interest for Gamestop for Jan 4th](https://preview.redd.it/urqb3c3zbwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=d874cd908bad7fe3e8aa4486b5a294f5c1d5724e)\n\nSo this shows for jan 4th the estimated short interest is 66.98 Million shares. From the exchange reported 71 Million on december 31st this makes a lot of sense because the share price fell from \\~21 to \\~17 so shorts took profits. The shares on loan arent for longs too. This is all purely short data, and 47M  shorted at $17 this shows.\n\nThese shorts are in a circle of hell we cant comprehend and makes satan scared.\n\n🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nNow for the data for this week:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ortex short data for Jan 14th for Gamestop](https://preview.redd.it/5ryumpl1dwb61.png?width=1152&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb80c09e1be7b2f36f6d3745983cef4ce2b2df9b)\n\nSHARES ON LOAN HAVE GONE UP.  BUT 87% OF LOANED SHORTS WHERE SHORTING AT SUB $20.\n\nCost to borrow is also up, estimated short interest is up to a cataclysmic amount.\n\nLongs on margin need to supply collateral, but we are in the massive green zone, shorts are underwater. Margin calls will ravage the shorts and sting the longs. We also have the uptick rule in place until the end of the day, so shorts can only short on the way up. Im not saying itll happen but this shit is skewed in our favour big time. we need to 💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/)💎[🙌](https://emojipedia.org/raising-hands/).\n\n🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n**Seen a lot of talk about Gamma hedging and delta.**\n\nYou realize that the fucking bankers and brokers dont understand gamma hedging right? That shits up their with the black-scholes equation and feynman-kac solution. Forget about it. The retards claiming to understand it are either payed by hedge funds or lose money. The guy who took out outs thinking options exercising and gamma hedging would lead to a collossal sell off on friday lost money on his puts because **no one** except some quants in a goldman sachs server room know this shit. The idea is simple about neutral delta on options that people take out, but the simple system interacts with every other thing in the stock market, and wow who couldve guessed it, like nearly any other element of the stock market predicting something by the day is nigh impossible. That guy talking about Gamma , Delta and margin calls is on weeklies. Hes no more autistic and equally retarded as all of us. Hes a chill guy though so dont berate a fellow brother.\n\n**Now weve established the likelihood of longs getting margin called is far smaller than shorts, on to the options distributions**\n\n**Two images now: Top one is before the end of the 15th, the other one is after market close:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This shows the suspected melvin puts \\(51000 contracts, 5 Million shares, rolled up from july, strike price $24\\) and lots of big ITM calls.](https://preview.redd.it/t8odq9btgwb61.jpg?width=821&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61bb8a66e0ed83f0315921c295d1851a3c20c6c0)\n\n🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n[This shows the big put contract didnt get rolled over and the big ITM calls got exercised on friday. Large puts are underwater big timem while calls are in the big tendy zone.](https://preview.redd.it/3nqb33f0hwb61.jpg?width=675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dc83f542dcc3565ae0424121146101b73cf0083)\n\nThese two graphs, show before market close and after. As we can see the massiver 51000 put contracts didnt get rolled over and the chances that those were melvins july puts rolled up is very high. They expired worthless. Lots of calls are printing big time while huge amounts of puts are worthless and bleeding money.\n\nSomething else we can extrapolate from the charts is that massive options trades are not present on the scale we saw before (tens of thousands).\n\n🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nWe are seeing a discrepancy in the number of puts/calls opening up at the higher prices with calls gaining fast. This could show that some funds are now becoming optimistic on the long or short term prospects of gamestop. There are also more puts than options and if we assume this for shorts vs longs on margin (without even taking into account that all shorts are borrowed shares and pay interest further bleeding cash) then shorts are likely on more margin than longs.\n\nRegardless fellow autists my main point is two show that the bears are underwater and the bulls are flying high with regards to options.\n\n**Now lets compare this possible squeeze with others.**\n\nBear in mind this is the most shorted stock of all time, but differences in free float change the share price differently.\n\nKodak went from **$2.16 to $33.2**\n\nVolkswagen went from **\\~200 euro to nearly 1000.**\n\nOverstock went from **\\~$21 to $123**\n\nBlue apron went from **$2.31 to $18**\n\nIve been seeing some estimated that 1 million shares is roughly a dollars move in share price. This maths is about to be pretty autistic so bear with me degnerates.\n\n$1 now is 2.81% of the share price. Everything in the markets is exponential and based on percentages. So if we assume a full squeeze of ortexs estimated short interest (This assumes no sell off and no new shorts, new shorts can be positive or negative depedning on when in the squeeze they happen) **$35.5 \\* 1.0281\\^77 = $299.** GME to moon. 🌑 .\n\nThis shit can happen. Hold on.\n\n**GME has squeezed and been manipulated before and it always happens around the console cycles. Shorts never win and they wont win now.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This post right here I found months ago and got me in the squeeze from the honourable and valiant u\\/Uberkikz aka Rod Alzman](https://preview.redd.it/4ysv7bzclwb61.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=27ac6ac58b6366f81b53fa75966733b8a8d61d3c)\n\nBasically the crayon chart shows green (outstanding shares) orange ( short shares) purple (Market cap) and cyan (Share price). In 2006-2008 the share price rose in tandem with short interest ( Like now ) Until console releases when you can see an abrupt squeeze happend mooning the share price.\n\nThis happend to a degree in 2013 with the xbox one but worse conditions for the company and a worse console launch lead to slow short covering but the share price still mooned.\n\nNow we get to the best part. History is repeating itself for the third time and the shares sold short are literally higher than the outstanding shares, which have been decreasing since 2010. Short shares are also at the highest point ever and GME hasnt had a brighter future, well ever. Ps5 and Xbox Series X. are the two most hyped consoles since the Ps2. This is setting up the foundations for massive price movements weve never seen before. This shit has literally never happend, ever. Uncharted waters and we are the captain.\n\n**For the insurmountably retarded autists who think that the squeeze has happend look upon this and despair:**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme\\_gang\\_there\\_hasnt\\_been\\_a\\_short\\_squeeze\\_yet/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwpf6k/gme_gang_there_hasnt_been_a_short_squeeze_yet/)\n\nIHOR IS A MEGA WIZARD\n\nIhor I quote:\n\n>**A long-buying tsunami ... is the primary factor for the price move**\n\nIhor Dusaniwsky is managing director of predictive analytics at S3 a firm similar to ortex. He told bloomberg that the squeeze hasnt happend yet and that this was long buying. If someone knows this shit its him. He was talking about the tesla squeeze in january 2020. He has access to resources we can only imagine. Barrons cut his comment that the squeeze hasnt happend yet out it was that fucking bullish. All the media ramming down \"Short squeeze has happend\" down peoples throats because bears are fucking scared.\n\nThe bots on stocktwits spamming bearish sentiment should show how rattled they are.\n\nEdit: **You fucking degens just enlightened me that cramer pump is real, funds are ruminating over the long weekend, and stmmy bills pumps stonks and that stimmy bill buys many an xbox.

Moody’s and S&P have GME at B3 and B-, which is rated “highly speculative”. Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).\n\nEdit 6: We are scraping 42 in frankfurt.

While that is true, I still don't see much to get excited about long-term.  Digital distribution is unlikely and physical distribution is dramatically decreasing.  Without long-term viability, the size of the short squeeze is limited\n\nIt's hard to believe that GME will ever get a foothold in digital distribution\n\n* Microsoft, Sony and Steam have been doing it well for years.  Google is a new entrant too.\n* GME will have to make an immense investment of time and money into a platform that can service the digital distribution.  (eCommerce of physical stuff is easy from a tech perspective... Magento.  Don't believe there are many frameworks for video game distribution).  Mgmt and even Cohen lacks experience here ... Even if they contract out, they still need people/mgmt on their end to understand what's going on.\n* Even if they do get a platform to distribution digitally, Sony and Microsoft will have to let you use it.  You'd have to be able to download the GME app on your console.  This app would take money away from the maker of that system ... incentives not aligning ... especially for Sony which currenlty does not have a partnership with GME.\n\nI understand Ryan Cohen is the wildcard.  Genius dude ... maybe he can do it.  However, beating Petco at selling dog toys is much different than beating Microsoft and Sony at distributing large complicated software to their consoles ... Especially when Microsoft and Sony already have a significant head-start.  This is orders of magnitude more challenging  and significantly different than the Chewy success story, IMO.\n\nTo me, GME value is its 56million users.  The time and money to acquire that number of users is significant.  I understand why Ryan Cohen would want to at least try ... this is a huge saving on digitial marketing spend (i.e. a major cost for any eCommerce company).  However, I suspect it's much more likely that Microsoft or Sony will buy GME, once its stock comes down, and obtain GME customers... It could be that Microsoft is already doing this. I know they entered into a partnership where GME will be using Mircosoft tech at locations ... Microsoft will have access to the data?... did mgmt give away the only thing of value in the company?...\n\nIt is possible that GME could stick to physical products sold online. Maybe this will be successful long-term ... probably not ... all other entertainment is moving to digital/service model ([something which COVID has sped up, slim majority of sales have been digital](https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/11/21363951/video-game-sales-digital-online-xbox-one-ps4-publisher-figures-ea-activision-2k-games) in 2020, up from 5% of sales in 2009.).

This sub has become a cult trying to trick itself its clever and is winning against wall street. I wrote two posts on monday trying to warn against the squeeze happening and then that the crash would probably come, this is the TLDR from my deleted posts:\n\nThe fact that the short interest fell from 80M at peak to 27M now, and that 27M includes the horde of new shorts from the $300 range. Days to cover is way lower too and this means shorts could have fairly easily masked the covering in all the volume, as days to cover is now precisely 0.77 days. The cost to borrow was at peak a week ago 82% I think, now 25%, so its far cheaper to mantain short positions too. If we compare the new shorts resilience to that of melvin or maplelane , we can assume that they entered in the $5 - $10 range, and got squoze out at the $80-$300 range so with this assumption it bounds them at a (8x-60x) range to be squoze out. Taking the lower bound, this means from the assumed entry point of roughly $300 for new shorts would they have to exit at $2400 to start another squeeze? The capital needed for this is in the hundreds of billions, but even if that could happen the squeeze has far less juice in it than before, only 27M shorts left. This renders the price targets in the 1000s basically impossible. Ive seen 30000 touted round here and that places the Mkt Cap at 2.2 Trillion which is nearly the same as apples lmao. This sub likes to say \"you are here\" and point to the dip on the VW graph, but if we could compare these two completely different scenarios together than the dip is most likely the one from last monday, $160 to $60, which came right before the massive squeeze. However we cant really compare VW to GME directly as they are mereley facets of one idea, however the underlying environments where completely different, the tradable float for VW was basicaly 0 because porsche and the german goverment owned nearly 99% of VW, so when this news came out the effetive days to cover was massive, and every short tried to exit immediately and payed any price to do so, leading to the infinity squeeze. Porsche then bailed them out for profit. GME however has massive volumes, doesnt have a float approximating zero, and has a very low days to cover. Paired with the fact the old shorts have been squoze out I think and the new shorts are virtually unsqueezable without massive capital injections, this seems to me like the squeeze happend.

I have sold about half my position which I started at $8, and sold July 55 calls against 25% of my position.\n\nYours is amazing research.  And I can't rebut much of it because it's so wonderfully detailed and beyond my capacity.  \nBut there are 4 things that are not aligning on a more macro level.  \nThe first is that this weekend all the brokerages apparently raised their margin requirements and as others have said, that should require shorts to put up more cash.  Large shorts who can afford to do so are not the issue but the retail investors who will have a problem.\n\nYet here we are near the end of the trading day and we've been steady all day around 40 after the pop to 45, which is about what we've seen every day.  I know most brokerages give a few days for margin calls to be met, so I'm sure there are people insisting the rocket will take off on Friday or Monday.  Yet given that short interest is supposedly so high and no shares are available, it seems to me that we should be much higher at this point.  I have to wonder if the retail shorts have met margin calls or been forced to cover at this point.  \n\n\nThe second issue is that I saw this same argument with Revlon. With 89% of shares owned by Perelman and him going out to the market to sell the company, everyone suggested this would be a big squeeze as well.  It didn't really happen, although obviously the circumstances here are different.  Yet again, short interest was extraordinarily high.\n\nThird, as it happens, I actually know Andrew Left.  While he may very well be short, I expect any discussion of short interest to be truthful, so it would probably be unwise not to listen to what he has to say.  That element is the thesis under which this infinity squeeze is based.  \n\n\nI'm not trying to pour cold water, because I'm still long and would be delighted for it to go to the moon.  Yet the exuberance -- and this is item #4 -- with which everyone here and elsewhere exhibits towards this thesis feels more like a contrarian indicator.  Infinity squeezes are not anticipated events.  They catch everyone by surprise.  \n\nThis isn't a commentary on the ability of RC to turn the company around.

Why? Consols as we know it are dead after this generation. \n\nConsoles have been a loss leader for manufacturers for a while now. They use them as a way to solidify the relationship with the customer and ultimately make that money off game royalties. \n\nNow we know Microsoft inked some kind of deal with GME but its pretty vague. All we know is that both companies will benefit. So far we've only seen GME benefit with a cut of every Xbox sold but what does MSFT get out of this deal. They certainly don't need GME stores to push the current gen Xbox. \n\nA few other relevant things:\n\n* We've seen Microsoft grow its game studios and it continues to make up the lions share of revenue for the gaming division. \n\n* We know that Microsoft has been pioneering [streaming games to other devices from Xbox.](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/remote-play)\n\n* We know Microsoft and Steam have grown closer over the past few years and there seems to have been rumors of the ability to stream Steam games to [Xbox directly] (https://www.altchar.com/game-news/rumour-xbox-app-adds-steam-integration-in-the-wake-of-partnership-rumours-asGmE2t4hp9q)\n\n* We also know that Steam tends to be a near monopoly in the streaming game space and charge a hefty 30% charge for distribution rights. \n\nMy theory is that the next generation of consoles are going to be cheap systems that stream games from another platform (think chromecast/roku type devices). But it has to be streamed from somewhere. That somewhere is going to  probably be a gaming PC. But PCs have a higher barrier to entry - this is where the physical GME stores come into play - ensure widespread adoption of gaming PCs so that MSFT can focus on game development and cheaper/higher margin devices and accessories. \n\nBut it doesn't stop there. Those gaming PCs are still going to need some kind of DRM manager/store/etc...of which the only (real) option right now is Steam.  \n\nThis has already been hinted at by GME with talks of online game trade ins. But there is huge potential there. There were rumors in 2019? That steam was in acquisition talks but they sort of fizzled out. This could be a potential play for MSFT or Sony. But more likely GME could create their own competing platform to try and take away some of Steams huge market share.\n\nEither way this is MSFTs play with GME. Use it to supplement their need for 'traditional' gaming consoles - consumer friendly access to gaming PCs - and then get in bed with the GME e-commerce (be it in house or steam aquisition) platform that will roll out with all these PCs - so that they have priority placement. Then focus on high margin game development and accessories.\n\nTLDR: bullish regardless of squeeze \n\nAlso 🚀🚀🚀", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Im sorry but the squeeze likely happend. This is why I think so:\n\nThe fact that the short interest fell from 80M at peak to 27M now, and that 27M includes the horde of new shorts from the $300 range. Days to cover is way lower too and this means shorts could have fairly easily masked the covering in all the volume, as days to cover is now precisely 0.77 days. The cost to borrow was at peak a week ago 82% I think, now 25%, so its far cheaper to mantain short positions too. If we compare the new shorts resilience to that of melvin or maplelane , we can assume that they entered in the $5 - $10 range, and got squoze out at the $80-$300 range so with this assumption it bounds them at a (8x-60x) range to be squoze out. Taking the lower bound, this means from the assumed entry point of roughly $300 for new shorts would they have to exit at $2400 to start another squeeze? The capital needed for this is in the hundreds of billions, but even if that could happen the squeeze has far less juice in it than before, only 27M shorts left. This renders the price targets in the 1000s basically impossible. Ive seen 30000 touted round here and that places the Mkt Cap at 2.2 Trillion which is nearly the same as apples lmao. This sub likes to say \"you are here\" and point to the dip on the VW graph, but if we could compare these two completely different scenarios together than the dip is most likely the one from last monday, $160 to $60, which came right before the massive squeeze. However we cant really compare VW to GME directly as they are mereley facets of one idea, however the underlying environments where completely different, the tradable float for VW was basicaly 0 because porsche and the german goverment owned nearly 99% of VW, so when this news came out the effetive days to cover was massive, and every short tried to exit immediately and payed any price to do so, leading to the infinity squeeze. Porsche then bailed them out for profit. GME however has massive volumes, doesnt have a float approximating zero, and has a very low days to cover. Paired with the fact the old shorts have been squoze out I think and the new shorts are virtually unsqueezable without massive capital injections, this seems to me like the squeeze happend.
