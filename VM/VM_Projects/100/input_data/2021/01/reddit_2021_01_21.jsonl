{"title": "138% sHoRT fLoAt! Why it's wrong (and right) to compare GameStop to Volkswagen", "selftext": "Conservative estimate on why GME will squeeze to $69 ($68.85) AT THE MINIMUM.  üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ\n\nI've seen a bunch of people on here directly comparing the Volkswagen short float (13%) back in '08 to Gamestop's short float (138%). And since GME has 10x the shorts, it'll squeeze harder or 10x harder. Stop doing that. Here's why.\n\nFirst, you have to understand why Volkswagen squeezed so hard. While a 13% short float seems insignificant, what happened was Porsche secretly gobbled almost all shares of Volkswagen behind everyone's backs. Then one day, they announced that only 1% of shares were left in the public float (% of shares available to retail investors basically). Hence,  shorts rushed to close and Volkswagen squeezed. What's important to take from this is that the effective short float was 13 times the true public float. This 13:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions was what caused Volkswagen to triple (2.9x) from ‚Ç¨348 to over ‚Ç¨1K in the single day that it squeezed.\n\nAs for GameStop, 138% is the short float that gets thrown on here pretty often, but this is dumb. While this is true, it doesn't take into account all the diamond handers and institutional investors other than Cohen and execs. If there truly were a 1.38:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions, GameStop wouldn't squeeze that hard - but there isn't. So I went ahead and calculated the true, effective short float of GameStop so we can compare it to Volkswagen. These numbers are VERY conservative. I didn't include many Hedge Funds who filed 13Fs; while some might diamond hand through these times, we'll never know. So I only included Cohen, ETFs such as Vanguard who won't sell, Mutual Funds, and WSB. I included the two biggest WSB whales u/DeepFuckingValue and u/LemniscateSideEight and placed WSB institutional ownership at a conservative 5% based on a bunch of studies (done months ago so it's probably increased since then).\n\nInstitutional Certified Diamond Handers\n\n|**Fund**|**Shares Held**|**% O/S**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC|9,534,090|13.67|\n|RC Ventures LLC|9,001,000|12.91|\n|BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.|7,897,907|11.32|\n|Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund|6,801,757|9.75|\n|The Vanguard Group, Inc.|5,288,116|7.58|\n|iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF|3,514,708|5.04|\n|Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund|2,000,679|2.87|\n|Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund|1,468,071|2.1|\n|iShares Russell 2000 ETF|1,368,843|1.96|\n|DFA U.S. Small Cap Value Portfolio|1,121,503|1.61|\n|Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund|817,863|1.17|\n|Vanguard Strategic Equity Fund|703,551|1.01|\n|Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund|634,259|0.91|\n|WSB: DeepFuckingValue|50,000|0.07|\n|WSB: LemniscateSideEight|1,562,262|2.24|\n|rest of WSB estimation|3,800,000|5.4|\n\nOutstanding shares (not the public float) is 69.7M (nice). The people that won't sell or diamond handers adds up to 55.5M shares. Subtract that from the outstanding shares 69.7M-55.5M and we get a true public float or shares floating around of 14.2M. So based on this super conservative estimation, not including Hedge funds and most individual retail investors, we've come to an effective short float of 14.2M. If you take the latest short interest of 71M shorted shares, you get a 5:1 ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions. This is not as great as Volkswagen's 13:1 ratio, but it's still solid. Obviously, this stuff isn't linearly correlated and is more complex, but assuming GameStop squeezes 5/13 as much as Volkswagen, GameStop will squeeze 76% instead of Volkswagen's 190%. A 76% from GameStop's current share price of $39.12 is $68.85, so basically $69 (nice)!\n\nAgain, these were conservative calculations, if you play around with the numbers and include the 2 largest funds not included: Susquehanna International Group, LLP with 4.4M shares and Dimensional Fund Advisors, L.P. with 3.9M shares, this reduces the true ratio of outstanding shorts to shares available to close short positions to 12:1, which basically matches Volkwagen's 13:1 scenario that tripled the stock so you could expect a GME squeeze \\~$120 from this scenario.\n\nPositions: 365 shares", "id": "l1s627", "created_utc": 1611207970.0, "score": 389, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 174, "comments": [{"body": "Please add my 100 share and recalculate", "score": 622, "replies": [{"body": "üòÇ", "score": 81, "replies": []}, {"body": "I really wanted to upvote this but it‚Äôs sitting at 69 so have one of these ‚¨ÜÔ∏è", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "Respect", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Hey!

Please explain the points you made like the institutional inflow estimates, L2 aggregated orders and bulk order flows. \n\nWhat do you feel about a potential debt upgrade considering the corp bonds are trading well above 100 now?", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "As far as institutional inflows those and bulk order flows go together. Also, some dark pools aggregate their orders so what looks like a bunch of 1000, 500, 250, 50, 90, 110 share lots when people are selling are actually a single lot of 2000 etc.\n\nThese dark pools are used as back channels for some private funds that have broker access to the street, and help to disguise institutional movements mostly for hedge funds and speculative funds.\n\nBy looking at inflow estimate reports (you have to be in the industry to get access to most of this, it comes from extremely expensive research firms that brokers pay, or they have a team in house doing it) along with bulk orders, and trying to match those to the T&S tape ticker, you can start to see perhaps who is moving what.\n\nIf someone transacts let's say, 1M shares, and you can attribute it to a single individual somehow (if the pool didn't aggregate their order into another order to mix it into the execution cycle which normally they do to try and hide it) you can get an idea of what the true tradeable float is (if you don't get why, it's because you don't buy a million shares of something to day trade it, those are sitting at home for awhile, a long while).\n\nThose institutions buying those shares will let the price drop, then throw 50-100k of their shares through. You don't just execute a buy or sell of 1M shares @ $40, it's a thousand here, thousand there and the algo tries to get you the best price possible. Often you'll see dips, massive buy spikes, then buy/sell walls go up at price points where their average is to try and build a retail base also. Considering originally there was a low percentage of outstanding shares traded per day, building that base will take time because institutional ownership is so huge. Once that is built, they just have to counter act any shorts, and see even 50 basis point increase in volume could set this entire thing off.\n\nThose short attacks will stop once the shorts get out of their position but the base will remain and the hunger for the shares will remain. If the short float drops a bit, it actually will help us believe it or not, because the people that are going to get fucked here aren't the institutional traders - it's the big retail whales and 9 figure individuals betting against this. The big firms are already hedged, I promise you.\n\nWith the short volume being met by institutional buying volume, I estimate the actual float to be much, much, much smaller than the numbers we're seeing. Institutional ownership is over 100% -- this is ONLY possible by buying synthetic shares that are shorted.\n\nAll of this combined shows me that we have firms going at each other. A couple retail whales come in and upset that balance of power, and we're going to see this thing rip upwards. What you're likely seeing is firms day trading calls on swings (yes, calls, not puts) and forcing those swings to help them profit some, then cover some of their shares and slowly reduce the delta of their positions. They're not trading puts because that just exaggerates their delta, they trade the calls in case the thing fucking flies to the moon, their losses are capped as it sits now, and they're likely trading portions of their share position. 10% at a time, and if they have enough capital, they can drag this fight out for a long fucking time. There's no benefit for them to unwind all at once, it could set this thing into the stratosphere. It's potentially possible many of them have various dated $20 calls to help cover their short (and by possible, I mean likely, because the algos probably hedged as soon as it saw the price/volume explode when it moved off the $20 mark and identified the possible buttfucking their short position was about to give them) and they're just slamming volume around trying to create volatility because that's the best for the people writing the options (them and their friends). For all we know, some of these shorts are completely hedged just building it up to profit off the squeeze. If the shares rip up once they get out of the position, they don't care, because they'll hold to expiration for hedge, exercise, take the gains, and tank the stock again and short it on the way down while hedging the upside again. If the stock goes down, they can dump the calls and just let their short ride back down a ways. The calls are their cap -- similar to people buying a debit spread instead of long calls.\n\nBut with Melvin's puts likely expired and not re-upped in any identifiable way, that means we know one guy is really under the heat and already way fucking down on his position, which causes desperation. Humans can only take so much. Match that up with Citron's extreme fucking failures over the course of the last two years, we got a couple guys with reputations and millions on the line.\n\n***TLDR:*** If you're in the industry, you have access to shit others don't (not implying I am, or how I know these things, but I know them). I can watch a price/volume chart during the day and instantly identify institutional activity.\n\nFuck Melvin. It's one thing to be in a firm and short a stock for fundamental reasons. It's a whole other thing to let your ego get in the way after you drove the price down to $3 and go for the jugular just to make yourself feel better. The guy deserves the fucking $200-$300M loss he's about to eat at the current price, probably more considering the options he had expired and he's likely got some other hedges in place that won't work out for him.\n\nThis isn't to flex my knowledge, it's to tell people you should be careful just spreading info around this board and getting people on board with a thesis.

VIAC is the next big pick for WSB and the markets are taking notice before the WSB can get in on the fun. \n\nYes I‚Äôm trying to help! Yes I want the tendies! And yes you probably think this is stupid, what are you talking about GME all day bro. TSLA to the moon bro. \n\nNo stop it. I‚Äôm talking about one of the most undervalued stocks in the hottest market segment, no this is not a motley fool boomer pitch, this is Viacomcbs. This is the fucking rocket ship. We are looking at a 4-5 x return once streaming potential is even partially realized.\n\nLittle secret, VIAC is n third place in streaming with 18 million paid subs. Other plays are stuck with their botched launch, VIAC has 2 services that have been profitable and open for 6 plus years. CBS All access soon to be paramount plus and showtime. \n\nThe biggest play for the company isn‚Äôt paid streaming although it will be a huge piece of business. No the real opportunity is in Pluto TV which is the leading FREE AD SUPPORTED STREAMING TELEVISION. FAST. \n\nFast is free tv paid for by ads. It‚Äôs basically the internet‚Äôs version of a 2005 cable box from Comcast. \n\nYou have so much old content that can still generated revenue. Look at the recent Netflix VIAC deal\nFor narcos on Pluto or look at the library content they have. \n\nI am trying my best but it‚Äôs hard to break through the loud voices of GME right now. \n\nI would hate to see y‚Äôall miss this boat, it‚Äôs finally becoming safe enough for me to want to mention it. The turnaround is finally underway for real and we are still at the beginning. \n\nThe Investor day is 2-24-2021 and that‚Äôs the big trade right there. \n\nI‚Äôm about to buy more options for 3-19 45c 50c 52.5c as well as leaps and some equity. Almost all in over 20k at risk. \n\nThis is your moment to break the shackles of your losses. If you are sick because you missed GME or TSLA or any other big profitable moves this is your chance. \n\nI can‚Äôt help but feel like no one is gonna pay any attention until it‚Äôs too late to buy but y‚Äôall can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt try and raise the alarm. \n\nAll traders need to pay attention and look for new ideas. Not just OTM calls on TSLA and GME. \n\nI am using OTM calls for this as well but it‚Äôs much safer with ITM calls.", "id": "l21526", "created_utc": 1611244595.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 118, "comments": [{"body": "Bro you gotta be able to take a joke holy shit", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I keep that thing on me ready for battle.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "**I am a bot and identified and tracked the following options picks within this post:**\n\n|**Ticker**|**Strike**|**Type**|**Exp**|**Recorded Premium**|**Recorded Stock Price**|**OI**|**Volume**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**GME**|**$45**|**BUY CALL**|**2021-03-19**|**$7.75**|**$39.8862**|**647**|**34**\n\n[Realtime ROI](https://www.pickmojo.com/pick/ckk71jz0e9gbg0776hmp387cf) | [Track Record](https://www.pickmojo.com/user/greggo92/) | [Bot Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/pickmojo/comments/he9ghu/options_picks_tracking_bot_information/) | Leaderboard: [Week](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/best-this-week-reddit), [Month](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/best-this-month-reddit), [All](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/top-reddit) | [Exit this position](https://www.pickmojo.com/reddit_redirect)\n\n**^(*My owner is monitoring these posts, reply with feedback!

The present was only a bridge and on this bridge they are still groaning, as the world groans, and not one idiot ever thinks of blowing up the bridge.*\n\n**Henry Miller, Tropic of Capricorn**\n\n*I was wrong! Blow the bridge! Blow the fucking bridge!*\n\n**Tugg Speedman, Tropic Thunder**\n\nHello again GME Gang! It‚Äôs been a while since I last ranted at you, but I know we‚Äôve been in some very good hands here at WSB with all the great DD folks have posted over the past few weeks. So no need for CPT Hubbard to go for 11 again on the Thumbscroll Dial (until today, that is). I‚Äôve enjoyed a lot of these posts very much, so thank you on behalf of myself and the attention-deficient Rocket Children for continuing to deliver that 100% Chaff-Free GME-grade Wheat at such a feverish clip.\n\nNow, I am going to get to Hong Kong‚Äôs [Lamest Outlaw](https://www.scmp.com/business/money/investment-products/article/2009448/hong-kong-finds-citron-researchs-andrew-left) and his disconcertingly vacant eyes here shortly. But first I want to take you on a journey back to Christmas Eve, in the year of our lord 2020‚Äîa heady time in all our lives. We were all so young and innocent then, weren‚Äôt we? Fresh off the run up to 22. Blissfully oblivious that we were living in the last moments where the question What is The War of 1812? was the only acceptable Jeopardy question for the answer: The Last Time the Goddamn U.S. Capitol Was Stormed. This was also before we all became irresponsibly overleveraged in Cathie Wood‚Äôs Ornamental Gourds ETF. It was a wondrous, confusing time.\n\nBut before we get too off topic, let‚Äôs all hop in my 1985 DeLorean (purchased with proceeds from my Jan 15 calls ‚Äì thanks RC!), fire up the ol‚Äô Flux Capacitor, and get that shit to 88 because something happened that evening that is Worth Pondering‚Äîparticularly in light of recent events. And just as a friendly reminder: even though you‚Äôre going back in time in a DeLorean, no one here has to deviate funds away from GME shares to Save the Clock Tower and you are under no obligation to fulfill a scenario where you wind up making out with your Mom (unless your Mom is Cathie Wood like mine‚Äîin which case maybe just some quick over-the-clothes stuff).\n\n**On the Subject of How It Once ‚ÄòTwas The Night Before Christmas**\n\nSo what in the holy fuck happened on the night before Christmas, Captain? Well, while all you Gentiles were sleeping soundly after lying to your children about benign home intruders and before gorging yourself on the teat of late-stage capitalism, me and the rest of the Chosen People were up late eating Chinese food and thinking about tendies (Ba-zing!). But then: when out on the electric twitter machine there arose such a clatter, I sprang to my phone to see what was the matter. And what to my wondering eyes did appear, a mysterious tweet from a Rich-Ass Viking who had a lot of fucking interesting things to say about this whole GME situation that‚Äôs what.\n\nThis tweet, buried as a reply to a tweet sent by Mr. Rod Alzmann (@RodAlzmann or [u/Uberkikz11](https://www.reddit.com/u/Uberkikz11/)), simply said: ‚ÄúMerry Christmas. Shhh.‚Äù But it included this screen shot:\n\n\\[\\*\\*Image Deleted Due to the Mods - check the link below where someone transcribed it - I'll try to add later\\*\\*\\]\n\nNow, this tweet to Rod, sent late at night and likely after a strong Mead or three, was very promptly deleted. But your intrepid cub reporter saw this here tweet that night with his own two eyes‚Äîseeing as I am a degenerate GME addict and devoted follower of Mr. Rod Alzmann (Hi Rod!). And I took screenshots, of course, like any responsible records custodian might. And so did the dude who wrote a somewhat-overlooked WSB post on this, which included the most pertinent text of the message if you are having trouble reading it here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kk0omp/christmas\\_miracle\\_gamergate\\_2020\\_gme\\_shorts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kk0omp/christmas_miracle_gamergate_2020_gme_shorts/)\n\nNow, what are we to make of this? At the time, I thought it was very interesting. But I did not give it too much attention seeing as how the internet is overcrowded with anonymous weirdos claiming to know more than they do about all sorts of subjects (and now I feel your judging eyes‚Ä¶). Also, there was some very good commentary in that WSB post from some sharp folks about the screenshot author‚Äôs questionable use of the shorthand PE/IB‚Äîgiven that private equity and investment banks wouldn‚Äôt apparently be involved in a behind-the-scenes transaction with the short funds like what was being discussed there (don‚Äôt ask me, I just string together silly words here). But maybe you poke around his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne) a bit and see for yourself.\n\nStill, plausibility assessments based on preferred nomenclature aside, it seemed to me that some version of that conversation **had** to be taking place behind the scenes in a situation like this‚Äîgiven the batshit insane short interest, the funds supposedly involved, and the rapid rise in SP coinciding with RC‚Äôs share accumulation, December 21st amended 13D filing, and new status as a GME Insider and Board member (just love saying all that in a row, don‚Äôt you?).\n\nSo the Viking‚Äôs screenshot tweet, and the very likely possibility that shorts are in so deep that they‚Äôre attempting to negotiate peace with large shareholders behind the scenes, stuck in my tiny little baby brain as a pretty plausible set of scenarios. And from the look of it, it seems like some funds were at least willing to discuss offering these shorts a Golden Bridge away from Certain Fucking Destruction on the open market. And if the words on the screenshot are at all aligned with reality, these short funds have no good options. \n\nYet it seems like they are still playing hardball to negotiate the carat on this generous bridge offer they‚Äôre getting. Why? Maybe they‚Äôve been getting high on their own supply for so long and they don‚Äôt know how to see this situation for what it is. Who knows? Maybe there is no Ryan Cohen and we‚Äôre all living in a simulation. But if the recent low-rent anti-GME articles and market manipulation efforts we‚Äôre seeing are any indication, these overleveraged short fuckers seem to think they‚Äôre going to be able to spin out of this hold and drive the SP back down to even *smaller* peanuts than it‚Äôs at now by sheer force of will (and some deployment of well-honed tricks of the trade *amirite*?) to emerge unscathed. Or even victorious? I dunno‚Äîit‚Äôs their delusional fantasy sequence.\n\nBut do you know what this scenario reminds me of? And this is just coming to me so please bear with me as I‚Äôm not showing this to my editor before we print (I haven‚Äôt seen this movie in ages ‚Äì don‚Äôt know what made me think of this!). Fuck it, I‚Äôm just gonna start riffing here. The shorts trying to thread this needle, against all odds and logic and common sense, reminds me of that hilarious scene in Dumb and Dumber where haplessly delusional Jim Carrey thinks he has a chance with Mary Samsonite Swanson. But the scene is funny because he really doesn‚Äôt. Have any chance. At all.\n\nNow, I know this is a 1990s movie originally released on VHS that we haven‚Äôt seen it or even seen it referenced in ages. But now that you‚Äôre thinking of it again after all this time, doesn‚Äôt it remind you of this too? I know, I get it: You‚Äôd have to have fucking peanuts for brains for it not to.\n\n(https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1350877969816956934?s=20)\n\n**On the Subject of the Continued Internet Bumbling of Mr. Justin Dopierala**\n\nNow that screenshot came to mind this past week when something kind of weird happened while we were all enjoying our quick rocket ship ride. And yes, we are briefly going to talk again about Seeking Alpha‚Äôs second finest pro-GME author (always been more of a Dmitriy man myself) and recurring CPT Hubbard character, Justin Dopierala (and no, Angela, I do not want to have like 10,000 of his babies).\n\nLast Thursday, after we were all virtually high-fiving one another and counting our future Lambos, Mr. Justin Dopierala, head of Domo Capital and longstanding uber-bull GME shareholder and author at Seeking Alpha (last seen arguing pithily with our own Rod Alzmann about the conservative nature of Rod‚Äôs holiday earnings projections. Hi again Rod!), made it known that he sold all of Domo Capital‚Äôs 500,000 shares for around $42.50‚Äîat the very top of the run up last Thursday morning.\n\nNow, Domo Capital‚Äôs business decisions are none of my goddamn business. And there are plenty of market opportunities right now. Shit, I hear there is even a new Cathie Wood Gourd ETF coming online soon that people are really excited about and that I‚Äôm sure Justin‚Äôs clients would find intriguing. But Domo‚Äôs decision to sell seemed curious given a few things: (1) on Wednesday, when the rocket is mid-flight, he got a twitter follow from Gabe Plotkin, head of Melvin Capital, which he promptly tweeted about with a ‚Äúget a load of this fuckin‚Äô guy‚Äù vibe (oh the sweet, intoxicating arrogance of tendie victory, I too love it so); (2) he had also tweeted that day comparing GME‚Äôs rise to Apron‚Äôs short squeeze that lasted 4 days‚Äîwhere he also stressed to his followers that Apron had a *much lower* SI than GME; and (3) he then promptly **deleted** all of these tweets and almost everything else GME-related on Thursday after apparently introducing 500,000 shares of liquidity into the height of a stressed market up and through the Thursday reversal and down into his own personal tendie town.\n\nNow, after seeing all this, I mouthed off a bit to Justin on the electric twitter machine because that‚Äôs kind of my thing. And if you are familiar with my prior ramblings, you know that he and I go way back. In response, Justin talked a bit of shit about your intrepid cub reporter here in a comment on Dimitry Kozin‚Äôs October 21, 2020 article about a possible sony revenue share deal or something, the comment section of which has become the preferred SA water cooler over there. (And I can‚Äôt link that because Thems The Rulez). And Justin hurt my little feelings a bit with his very sharp denial. And by all means have at it over there to check out his comment about why he sold if you give a shit. That is if Justin hasn‚Äôt deleted it yet. Free country and all.\n\nBut to summarize, on the subject of treacherous coordination with Melvin Capital, Justin said he would not could not in a boat and he would not could not with a goat. And I for one believe him. And do you know why? Because even though Justin seems like a very smart guy in some ways, he‚Äôs also a well-known internet bumbler who blurts out things to his internet friends that a person with better self-control would keep to themselves. And so I do not think he is capable of pulling that off or keeping a secret like that. Also: he said he didn‚Äôt so I am more than willing to give someone the benefit of any doubt in that area and you should too. I think we keep Hanlon‚Äôs razor firmly in mind here about never attributing to malice that which is explained by stupidity. That is unless, of course, you‚Äôre Andrew Left and you‚Äôre actually trying to convince people that you didn‚Äôt realize there was a US presidential inauguration planned for the same time you announced your Super Important TeeVee Yammerfest ‚Äò21 about GME not being a good candidate for an imminent short squeeze no way no how not if my name isn‚Äôt Andrew Left short seller expert extraordinaire and Hong Kong‚Äôs Most Misunderstood Ethically-Minded Businessman. You can ascribe the fuck out of malice to that one.\n\nNo, even though I really have no idea, I think the most likely thing that happened there was that Gabe Plotkin, Master of the Universe, Head of Melvin Capital, and Acolyte of Perennial Most Ethical Business Man MVP candidate, Steven Cohen‚Äîgot into Justin‚Äôs head when Plotkin followed him on twitter during the 57% (at one point 94%) day last Wednesday and then Justin got a bit chippy about it.\n\nAnd this is the real reason I‚Äôm bringing this up.\n\nBecause I honestly care very little about the Nervous Investing Habits of the Wisconsin hedge fund voted most likely to prompt a Mr. Roboto reference. No: I think that Gabe Plotkin sent a message with that follow. Without even ever having to say it directly. And I think that after GME‚Äôs huge run and getting a little overexcited while working the twitter machine, Justin maybe had a chance to relax with a warm glass of milk that night and reflect on that message. Which I believe was: ***I‚Äôm watching you, motherfucker***. *And the only reason I‚Äôm paying any attention to some shitstain Wisconsin pseudo-fund on a day like today when I am getting my ass fucking torched is because I want you to know that if this GME shit blows up on me, I‚Äôm going to fuck your ass up.* *I will remember the name Domo Capital forevermore.* *And when you least expect me, I‚Äôll be there. Now: your move, motherfucker.*\n\nAnd once I realized what might have happened there, that made me feel kinda bad for Justin if he felt that way. Definitely a puss move because fuck you Plotkin I drink your fucking milkshake, right?  But bad because that‚Äôs a mean message for a business colleague to send, Gabriel. Shame on you if that's how you roll like a big New York bully and scaring our poor Justin like that. And if you just wanted to follow him to shoot the shit or swap listicles and Star Wars Prequel memes with a respected contemporary‚Äîeven in the very midst of getting fucking annihilated while short GME‚Äîwell Justin has a totally different account for that and he‚Äôs not allowed to access it during work hours.\n\n**On The Likelihood That The Most Heavily Shorted Stock in History Is Not Being Subject to Continued Market Manipulation When A Steve Cohen Acolyte Is Losing His Fucking Shirt**\n\nHave you heard about Steve Fucking Cohen? The guy who looks like he‚Äôs tip top of the list of the premier Hollywood casting agency‚Äôs rolodex for Saddest Dipshit Still At the Strip Club After Everyone Else Has Already Gone Home? I‚Äôm sorry, that‚Äôs mean and my mother told me to always be kind to the truly hideous looking because they‚Äôre probably still beautiful on the inside (spoiler alert: he‚Äôs not!).\n\nGet a load of this guy:\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-02/why-sac-capitals-steven-cohen-isnt-in-jail](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-02/why-sac-capitals-steven-cohen-isnt-in-jail)\n\n[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-09-02/controversial-hedge-fund-billionaire-steven-cohen-takes-on-hollywood](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-09-02/controversial-hedge-fund-billionaire-steven-cohen-takes-on-hollywood)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/steven-a-cohen-among-the-million-dollar-donors-to-trump-inauguration-2017-04-19](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/steven-a-cohen-among-the-million-dollar-donors-to-trump-inauguration-2017-04-19)\n\n[https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/steve-cohen-trump](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/steve-cohen-trump)\n\n[https://nypost.com/2015/06/17/billionaire-steve-cohen-bros-out-with-guy-fieri/](https://nypost.com/2015/06/17/billionaire-steve-cohen-bros-out-with-guy-fieri/)\n\nAre you back? I‚Äôve missed you. That was scary, wasn‚Äôt it? But allow me to **TL/DR** all that for you who decided to avoid all that unpleasantness: the dude just has all this bad luck and keeps finding himself into these really awkward situations where someone could potentially question his commitment to ethical business and life practices as well as adherence to the laws of the United States and it‚Äôs just not fair and nothing‚Äôs fair and Nice Guy Steve Cohen Is The Victim Here So Just Stop Right There Mister I See What You‚Äôre Doing. He's also bros with Guy Fieri. Cool.\n\nBut why am I talking about a guy who would so clearly pass Billy Madison‚Äôs Final Question about Business Ethics without even breaking a sweat?\n\nBecause Steve Cohen once had a young Ace Protegee that he loved very much. With the name of an Archangel, so tender and pure. And one day this young man decided he wanted to Prove Himself and Leave Steve‚Äôs Nest. And thus was born Melvin Capital, seeded financially by Steve Cohen but named after famed Crooner Melvin H. Torm√©, which Gabe‚Äôs esteemed mentor Steve would play in his office, over and over, all those years ago.\n\nNow let‚Äôs fast forward a bit because I‚Äôm boring myself with all that fucking Cohen reading (the *bad* Cohen‚Äîdon‚Äôt you dare get anyone confused here). As I was saying: Gabe Plotkin, head of Melvin Capital, has by all accounts gotten himself into a bit of a pickle here being so deeply short GME. Lots of people have analyzed and overanalyzed it, and I‚Äôm not going to do it again here; that dead horse is well and truly beaten. But to bottom line it: we‚Äôre all just staring down what is essentially an unprecedented math problem that will, at some point, resolve itself. And if it revolves itself in favor of the Good Guys, then the Bad Guys will lose a Fuck-ton of Money. That‚Äôs your money block quote, WSJ, so fuck off and stop calling me.\n\nNow: picture yourself as a Steve Cohen acolyte that just bought a [$44M Miami Compound](https://therealdeal.com/miami/2020/12/07/melvin-capital-founder-revealed-as-buyer-of-44m-miami-beach-property-sources/) and who cannot stop talking about how [co-owning the Charlotte Hornets](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/charlotte-hornets/article232128902.html) is worth it just for the courtsides alone bro once basketball is a thing again and so what if Michael Jordan keeps calling him Gary it‚Äôs close enough. Are you feeling the most financially secure that you have ever felt in your young rich life right about now? Or might you be a wee bit worried that you‚Äôve pursued an investment thesis so reckless, so irrationally and intentionally destructive of equity, that even Melvin H. Torm√© himself must be rolling in his fucking grave that you would ever dare put at risk your ability to continue being Michael Jordan‚Äôs Gary?\n\nAnd so here is when I again link my good buddy Jim Cramer‚Äôs [Great Unveiling of the Tactics Deployed by Short Sellers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l09n23/it_all_makes_sense_about_cramer_now_if_youre/) hoping to change the narrative and construct a ‚Äúnew truth‚Äù to suppress the SP in the face of, oh, let‚Äôs just say: a very promising turnaround story in a high-growth industry by an e-Commerce Canadian Genius who does not fuck around and who knows what he‚Äôs fucking doing and aims to sell more and better video games experiences to crackhead video gamers and there‚Äôs a million things he wants to do but just you wait, just you wait.\n\nIs this plot that hard to follow?\n\nAnd I‚Äôll also say this: I know fuck-all about monitoring order flows or how funds continue to create synthetic shares to short shit into oblivion. But I‚Äôm just stepping back and thinking of the broader narrative and tactics on this. Spit-balling here again‚Äîbear with me. Now, if you were massively short a security while paying out your ass in borrowing fees for the privilege of entering the most crowded short trade in the market and you‚Äôre now opposite a massive business turnaround story, Ryan Cohen, numerous institutions, funds, retail whales, Norwegian HNW Freemason Consortiums, and the energy behind the Finest Rocket Children Ever to Grace Planet Fucking Earth‚Äîand you‚Äôre taking it in the ass week after week here‚ÄîDo you then play this straight? Do you set aside all of these illegal and deceptive short tactics Jim Cramer candidly outlines in that video even though they‚Äôre impossible to enforce and are in fact *not* enforced? That Jim basically says you‚Äôd be professionally negligent if you were short and didn‚Äôt do this shit because fuck it *whosgonnastopyou*? And now you fucked up and that steamroller is barreling down upon you and there are all these things you *could theoretically* do try to get yourself out of this jam if you were That Kind of Person? Do you set this all aside and, at least in Jim‚Äôs view, tie one hand behind your precious ethical back? On the most heavily shorted stock off all time where you are bleeding Real Life Big-Boy Money? Just buying and selling you know, just a job, honest living, nothing much to it, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, can't get too carried away with it.\n\n*Or is it something a little bit fucking different than that?*\n\nI don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm not in the industry myself. And I would never accuse anyone of doing anything so clearly contrary to the values upon which their professional career as Master of the Universe was built. So Gabe: chill. Don‚Äôt follow me or something on twitter man, since for all I know that‚Äôs Plotkinese for I Hope You Don‚Äôt Mind Sleeping With This Severed Horse Head in Your Bed Motherfucker. It‚Äôs just money, dude. You seem pretty well taken care of. But man would I be sweating if I were short right now staring down the barrel of your new neighbor Ryan Cohen‚Äôs whims and patience and polite Canadian manners and ambiguous emojis that we all lose our shit for. I mean, fuck man: are you ok? Don‚Äôt forget to exercise and eat well during all this. Maybe switch to green tea or something. And remember: you‚Äôll always‚Äîalways‚Äîbe Michael Jordan‚Äôs Gary.\n\nBut here is where we return to our good friend Andrew Left from Citron Research.\n\nDo you remember the excitement you felt this past weekend? I‚Äôve never seen WSB so jacked. People were coming out hot on Tuesday‚Äîan uptick day! The new phone book‚Äôs here! The new phone book's here! What luck to be free of Gary‚Äôs tomfoolery for one fine day. And then GME spiked right away‚Äîreaching a high of over $45 that morning.\n\nBut then something happened. We all know what it was. But here is where any SEC lookie-loos need to close those Pornhub links and pay closer attention. Because in the moments before the Citron tweet that morning about Andy‚Äôs upcoming BuzzFeed Listicle call on Why GME is Scary Investment GRRRR, total short shares available **dropped from 1.2M to 0**. And a **$300K put bet** was placed on a weekly with a strike price well over 10% out of the money at the very moment that GME‚Äôs price was accelerating rapidly. (H/t [u/FatAspirations](https://www.reddit.com/u/FatAspirations/)). That‚Äôs some WSB-level shit right there.\n\nAnd yet they pull it off! GME immediately shoots down nearly 30% intraday, and eventually climbing abck up above 10%, making us all feel a little weird and like ungrateful millennial brats for feeling so shitty about a 10% day. But we all know what fucking happened, now don‚Äôt we?\n\nSo what can we say about ol‚Äô Andy? Now, many of you know Andy as the dumbshit who shorted TSLA until he was ground into little bits of dumb dumb dust and made to look ever so foolish over and over again until he finally cried drunk uncle and flipped to being long TSLA and now he‚Äôs cool to you or whatever. Or you might know him as the guy who puts out really shoddy research that often, by pure happenstance, drives a new narrative to control the orderflow and SP on a WSB-beloved security like PLTR? You know the guy I‚Äôm talking about. Once in hot pursuit by Hong Kong fuzz, an International Man of Obviousness with a face that says: why yes, I *will* have another vodka tonic *thankyouverymuch*. That‚Äôs him.\n\nWell, just like future call-back candidate for the role of Frightened Inmate #2, Mr. Steve Cohen, Andy is also but a Caveman‚Äîfrightened and confused by your modern concepts of ‚Äúethics‚Äù and ‚Äúrules.‚Äù No! No!‚ÄîHe‚Äôs a straight shooter! Devoted to rooting out obvious frauds, like Lukin Coffee and TSLA (Do not fuck with Elon or my Hot Mom‚Äôs ETF, Andy). And like the aspirations of Antoine Bugle Boy when he entered the blue jeans market, Andy saw an overcrowded short trade here based on an overly simplistic and obsolete short thesis about GME and said: ‚ÄúMe Too!‚Äù And as this thing is ripping to the stratosphere, Andy starts ringing his dumb dumb twitter bell and saying hear ye, hear ye‚ÄîInauguration Day and time it shall be for all my Big Brain thoughts about GME!\n\nNothing weird about that. No sir.\n\nSo Andy Citron or whatever the fuck his name is will be putting out some dumbshit video or something today in what seems to be a pretty clear attempt to scare my poor Rocket Children and get those pesky computers to high frequency this shit to drive the SP down to more acceptable loss levels (cause let‚Äôs be honest: they‚Äôre still taking a fucking bath here) for Mel Torm√©‚Äôs namesake hedgefund and all the other cretins that are dug into short position here. And they‚Äôre gonna try to scare ya‚Äô with the color red! And they know that no one here likes the color red.\n\nBut do see what‚Äôs going on here and who we‚Äôre dealing with. This really ain‚Äôt rocket science, Rocket Children. The dude actually tried to claim he forgot about the Inauguration. In 2021. He has not been in a coma, to the best of my knowledge. But you do look a little bleary eyed, Andy. Must have been all that staying up super late working on those last few bullet points to fill out the powerpoint on that GME listicle of yours, eh sport?\n\n**Conclusion: On the Subject of Patience and The Arc of The Universe Bending Toward Ryan Fucking Cohen**\n\n*In my youth there was a period of time where I went out on boats that would drop crates into the waters of the Arctic. Bundled inside them were raw pieces of meat. In the coming days the boats would head back out to the frigid seas, hook the floats bobbing upon the waters, and pull the crates up. Packed inside would be many crabs. They were so delicious & made a good price at market. The difference between the crate that was empty and the create full of bounty was a mystery even the great physicist Erwin Schr√∂dinger pondered at much length.*\n\n*But the hearty fishermen of my youth already knew the answer long ago. Why did the trap fill up? Time. In time, all traps fill. In time, all things pondered shall be revealed.*\n\n**--The Fucking Viking, That‚Äôs Who**\n\nNow look, you all know I have a soft spot for Ryan Cohen. Hell, we all do. He‚Äôs a good dude. And the man has played this flawlessly so far. He really has. The fact that we are all sitting here with Ryan Cohen having successfully negotiated three seats on the Board‚Äîa bloodless coup as my man Rod Alzmann says‚Äîhere in January? It‚Äôs amazing. His vision for GME is dialed-the-fuck in and extremely exciting. This misunderstood business is on the threshold of an exciting turnaround with Ryan Cohen at the helm. And though I was very much looking forward to the potential repercussions of a vote being called at the annual meeting and what that might mean for the short-term share price, this result is infinitely better. Whatever their motivations, that Board and George Sherman saw the writing on the wall here and accepted the Golden Bridge that Ryan offered them. And Ryan Cohen has done everything he‚Äôs set out to do here. And he‚Äôs clearly been having fun while doing it. Read up on the guy at some point if you haven‚Äôt‚Äìthere‚Äôs lots of good DD out there on him, obviously. And while you‚Äôre reading and thinking about Ryan Cohen, think also about guys like Steve Cohen (*no* *fucking relation*) and Gabe Plotkin and Andy Left and how lucky we are that we get to roll with RC against that motley crew of fuckwads.\n\nAnd do you know what? I‚Äôm guessing that RC, and maybe even the funds being discussed in that screenshot, have been very patient with Mr. Plotkin *et al* in recent weeks. You don‚Äôt go around bankrupting hedge funds willy nilly, you know--bad form and all that old chap. People tend to remember that. And guys like Steve Cohen and Gabe Plotkin seem like they play for keeps. So now you try to build them a Golden Bridge to cross‚Äîmaybe not their preferred route of travel, but could be worse and all that, right guys? But for whatever reason it seems like the natural instinct here on the short side is fight over flight. And these short FUD tactics are getting increasingly ridiculous to help slow down the inevitable march toward the detonator right next to that bridge. So relax everyone! And let‚Äôs not fool ourselves: All those Masters of the Universes are well aware of the math problem they‚Äôre all facing here and they must have a vague grasp of the odds that this goes off in one direction over the other. And what that could mean for the size of their money pits and how many sports teams they can buy this year. Shit, I assume Steve Cohen is counseling his young acolyte about how many sads he himself felt deep down in his man heart on that fateful day in 2008 when he lost $250M on a short when Volkswagon squeezed to infinity‚Äîa sadness that he will continue to draw on when his agent finally finds him a role that calls for it.\n\nBut my point is: the longs here can afford to be patient and let this play out. When this thing moves, the Viking‚Äôs Schr√∂dinger crabs will only be in one pot. And I‚Äôm guessing that pot is the one being held by the guy who is actually in total control here: Ryan Goddamn Cohen.\n\nSo enjoy the show today. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôre feeling relaxed after gorging yourself on lucky space peanuts all week.(https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/10022/lucky-peanuts/)\n\nAnd though these silly wabbits with their cumbersome FUD efforts can get a bit tiresome, I‚Äôm still very much enjoying this GME show at this point and almost do not want it to end‚Äîwhat with all these Sorkin-esque twists and turns and my Cohen Tweet Decorder Ring getting all this sweet action.\n\nBut just remember who Ryan Cohen is, what he cares about, and what, so far, he has told us he intends to do here. And then you might realize, as I have, that Ryan Cohen has had the Gray‚Äôs Sports Almanac here all along. This story has already been written. He‚Äôs already won. And Melvin Capital‚Äôs Schr√∂dinger-ass crabs are dead as fuck. The only question now is: what causes that Golden Bridge to blow? I, for one, am content to wait on RC while counting my good fortune that I can continue to accumulate until whatever happens here happens. So pass the rocket peanuts.\n\nIt‚Äôs just money after all. Right Gabe?\n\n**TL/DR**: *Psst*: a Mysterious Viking once told me about behind-the-scenes Golden Bridge negotiations that are likely taking place that give shorts no chance but the shorts seem to think they‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a chance but there really is no chance; Gabe Plotkin, Steve Cohen and Andy Left are misunderstood Straight Shooters who probably answer typical interview questions about their own perceived weaknesses by saying ‚ÄúSometimes I just care *too much* about doing the right thing‚Äù; and Ryan Cohen is the Goddamn Man so we can all relax and not worry so much about all this dumb short FUD bullshit, ok? OK. **üöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\n\n\n\\*\\*If you construe any of the above as investment advice without doing your own DD or at least Googling Ryan Cohen then you are a fucking idiot and may God have mercy on your soul.

For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.\n\nFirst of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.\n\nMaybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust.\n\nIn the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.\n\nThis is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.\n\nCan't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves\n\n\nIf you monkeys like to read some formal definition of this behavior, read this\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest\n\nIf you don't understand it, read again, this explains why you don't sell and you need to stick together.\n\n-End", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Np man, you're welcome to save my comment if you ever want to visit it again. üê¢üê¢", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I believe the word you were looking for was annals... but then again, this is WSB.

Those only happen in the short term in response to very unexpected inputs.\n\nA lot of the reasoning behind MOASS is that shares short > shares float. But that's not the right comparison. In reality, there are like 60m shares short, 50m shares float as \"True\" longs, and then 60m \"borrowed longs\", so it's 110m shares long, 60m shares short.  So in reality, you have 110m people to provide shares to 60m shorts to cover. As borrowed longs sell, in theory it could cause a share recall, but really, it just gets shifted around within brokers and between brokers and dealers and everyone else. They try REALLY hard to not force a short to cover with a buy-in.  It pisses people off. As those borrowed longs sell to shorts, you basically reduce the short leverage on the stock. If they sell to a new long, then it's basically a new true long, and some other long becomes a borrowed long. \n\nIn terms of how it goes, as price goes up, and shares become more scarce raising borrow fees, you'll see covering, and maybe others taking a loss and entering short at a higher price. Hedge funds and other institutional traders will constantly look at this stuff and hedge as they go. Just like some value funds trimmed GME when it 8xed, you'll see short sellers also trim if their underwater short position has become too large. That means that while the short squeeze can happen and cause bid, it wont create the broken market context necessary for a MOASS \n\nMy calculation is to replicate the VW situation you'd either need inflows of about 40 billion dollars in one day that limit-price-up the stock repeatedly and prevent execution to the point where everyone's risk management is going nuts (and then exiting sucks for you as a bagholder, who's going to buy those shares you bid at $150 the next day?), or you would need a new insider to surprise with an entry of a huge amount of call options or something and be locked up. Alternatively, short interest around 700 or 600% might start to risk it. All are highly unlikely/hard to do without being noticed. And many of these have a significant risk of the SEC stepping in, freezing all trading, and then GME doing the sane thing and issuing a ton of new shares, guaranteeing their survival and creating a growth window, and not burning the shorts. Remember - their objective, by law in fiduciary duty, and that includes RC now as a board member, is long term shareholder value, not fucking the shorts. Fucking the shorts can be fun for them, but it's a breach of their duty if it doesn't happen to also be in the direct line of maximizing long-term shareholder value.\n\nTLDR, MOASS is a broken market scenario, and there are a ton of interlocking systems that prevent that happening and institutions who's primary job is to prevent broken markets, and we are no where near it anyway.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Disclaimer: I'm a retard who doesn't know what he's talking about. This is not investment advice.\n\nInteresting perspective that I hadn't considered, thanks! I, for one, enjoy the conversation and throwing ideas around.\n\nFirst off, I think that I agree GME does not currently justify it's price based off of existing business. Yes, cashflow is decent, cash on hand is decent, debt is low but I think the numbers line up with the $15 - $20 estimate people have been throwing around. Saying that you plan to move to ecommerce is great but you should not get an ecommerce valuation/growth multiple until you actually publish and implement a plan. There has been bits and pieces of a plan but it needs more.\n\nHowever, the unprecedented short situation changes this conversation completely (I'll use Yahoo info but I think it's old). Supposedly 27% of shares are held by insiders, 122% held by institutions (168% of float) and approximately 46% held by retail investors (68% of float). Sure, 195% of issued shares exist in some form and can be sold but who is selling? Insiders for the most part aren't selling. Many of the institutions aren't selling (smallcap fund, total market fund, russell 2000 fund, etc who have static/passive investment allocations). The retail investors are probably a mix but a decent number will probably be buy and hold just to see what happens. I think we can safely say at this point WSB autists alone make up a noticeable amount of the retail investors and most plan to üíéü§ö.\n\nShort sellers are underwater on the investment and the cost to borrow is steadily increasing. From various information posted, quantity shorted has either held steady since the 31 Dec 2020 report or has actually increased! Shorts are dying and for every dollar GME goes up it gets worse. They can hedge with options but as long as the short position is open, they either have to pay through the nose to maintain it or it needs to be closed. But how do you close 70+M shorts if people are only willing to sell 10 or 20 million shares? You say they can trim the position but, again, it doesn't look like that has happened yet and the price has already steadily increase. If a significate portion try to trim then the price will spike further and it can snowball into the MOASS.\n\nI agree with you that the sane thing to do in the event of a major short squeeze is the company issue additional shares. However, in my opinion the issue price should be at a significantly higher valuation than the current trading price. Remember the Porsche/VW situation. VW was a bit over 200 euro before the squeeze. To resolve the squeeze, I think that Porsche released shares at over 900 euro. As you say the board should be interested in \"long term shareholder value\" which to me means getting top dollar for the new shares. They can issue the shares at a high valuation and resolve the short crisis then use the funds to accelerate the company transition. Then either buyback stock at reasonable price levels in the future or issue a dividend with the leftovers.\n\nPulling numbers out of my ass, the BoD could value Gamestop at $30B which puts additional shares at something like $425. Issue 1M shares per day at $425 (or $420, or $420.69) until they feel the situation is resolved.
