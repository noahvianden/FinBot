However that overlooks the fact that developing software and mega-data models is the investment phase, and selling them becomes the profit phase.  \n\nThey have had one public ER which showed very promising revenue potential.  Those big revenues were wiped out by internal compensation.  That can be interpreted in different ones.  The most simplistic is: \"see, they don't make a profit\".  Optimistic is \"this compensation expense is temporary, and the lack of profit is just a head fake\".

They don't really \"lose\" money.  Not the way that say, Snowflake does, or Disney Plus does.  Snowflake's customers cost them more than they charge.  By a MILLION DOLLARS per day.

Palantir takes what would otherwise be profit, and strips it for the owners and employees.  That's both good and bad news.  It's bad, because their unique structure doesn't offer the usual shareholder pressure with respect to those dollars.  We have to trust that the honchos will eventually decide to \"let\" shareholders participate at better levels.  I don't like having to hope that someone will just voluntarily do the right thing.

{"title": "WSE:CDR CD Projekt Red Analysis. Is it undervalued after the 37% drop due to Cyberpunk problems on consoles?", "selftext": "**Background**\n\nCD PROJEKT S.A. (WSE: CDR) is a Polish video game developer, publisher and distributor based in Warsaw. CD Projekt Red, best known for The Witcher series and the recent release of Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThe CD PROJEKT Group currently conducts operating activities in two key segments: CD PROJEKT RED and GOG.com (originally as Good Old Games).\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nCD PROJEKT Capital Group is headed by CD PROJEKT S.A. A holding company which has five subsidiaries.\n\nThe subsidiaries are:\n\n\\- GOG sp. z o.o (Similar to Steam, it is a distributor of games).\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Inc (Where all the game development happens)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT Co. Ltd (Only for selling games in China)\n\n\\- Spokko sp. z o.o. (The mobile arm of CD projekt red)\n\n\\- CD PROJEKT RED STORE sp. z o.o. (A new store of merchandise launched by the company)\n\n**GOG -** Who have just released a 2.0 version called GOG Galaxy which subsequently entered its beta testing phase. The goal of the application is to enable players to integrate all their game shelves into a single library, to communicate with friends and to track their progress regardless of their preferred gaming platforms. Its functionality will span PC and console platforms, extending beyond the GOG.com user base. It's main selling points are that is uses the cloud, is DRM free and has a ton of old games such as Diablo, Destroy all humans etc on it's platform that Steam doesn't.\n\nSteam is the single biggest distributor of digital games for PC, it's been dominating the market for years and has way more games than GOG does due to this. Especially as a lot of publishers do not want to host their games DRM free which GOG requires. It's very difficult to predict the future of GOG because Steam is a private company so we don't have access to it's numbers.\n\nHowever the big benefit of GOG is that CD Projekt Red can sell and promote it's games directly through their own platform. The benefit being a much bigger margin on each game sold as 100% of the profit goes to CD Projekt red if a game is sold on GOG, whereas on Steam they take a 20% cut for the first $50m revenue of Cyberpunk. **One third** of all digital PC preorders for Cyberpunk 2077 sales were on GOG which is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red considering Steams dominance.\n\nThis is probably the reason why CD Projekt Red has such a huge operating margin from 30% to 50% in recent years. They are involved in the entire process of making and selling their games.\n\n***GWENT: The Witcher Card Game*** is the first multiplayer game developed by the CD PROJEKT Group. It has been a hugely successful and highly rated game (which is impressive considering it's their first mobile multiplayer game). The reason why this game is important for the future is because multiplayer is the key to the cash machine which is microtransactions which the card game has.\n\n**Cyberpunk** was released recently and had been in development for many years. It's sold very well but less than analysts expectations and there has been serious problems on console versions which led to sony removing cyberpunk 2077 from it's PS store for the time being. This caused the companies stock to plummet 37% recently.\n\nI'll get into the numbers at the bottom for my reverse DCF that I did.\n\n**Cyberpunk Online** multiplayer will definitely come at some point within the next couple of years. The reason being is that after GTA Onlines unbelievable success and constant revenue generation for Take Two then it makes sense to try and replicate this with Cyberpunk. This multiplayer will feature microtransactions and in my opinion is the way Cd Projekt red can really make the big $$ in the future. Microtransactions for cosmetic items like in game skins or packs (like fifa) are easy to implement and have huge operating margins as they take 0 CAPEX and virtually no time to implement due to being some simple code and designs. Here's a quote taken from their 2019 Annual Report for *Key Sources Of Revenue*:\n\n>■ sales carried out through optional microtransactions in GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (incl. kegs and meteorite dust) via GOG, proprietors of console platforms (PlayStation, Xbox) and App Store (Apple)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere are some huge risks with cd projekt red, here are the main ones:\n\n\\- Neither IP, The Wither or Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by CD Projekt since the two series are based on a series of novels and a tabletop RPG respectively. So they would need permission from these license holders (the creators I think) to be able to do other spin offs for them. While it is likely the permission will be given due to the huge successes it's not a certainty.\n\n\\- CD Projekt Red relies on a couple of block busters to make 80% of their revenue and earnings. The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the only revenue generates the company has (apart from GOG). If CD Projekt red messes up either of these huge IP's in the future (or like they just have with the console versions of Cyberpunk) then you can expect a huge and sudden stock price drop and potential damage to the company.\n\n\\- Because of the few but huge releases, CD Projekt Red has very volatile earnings and revenue making it very hard to predict, similar to Take Two Interactive. You can see in the following picture how sales drop a lot after release.\n\n**Co-Founders and Board History**\n\nCD PROJEKT has a very long tenure of the management board, all at least 10 years and 3/5 of them 20+ years. Insiders have a significant stake in CD Projekt red's stock, including the joint CEO's. This is great news for shareholders as the insiders have a big incentive to make the company work as they have big stakes in the company.\n\nCompany shareholding structure is made up of the following people:\n\n\\- **Marcin Iwinski** (Joint CEO & Co-Founder) is **13%**\n\n\\- **Michal Kicinski** (Ex Joint CEO & Co-Founder) is **11%**\n\n\\- **Piotr Nielubowicz** (VP, CFO) is **6%**\n\n\\- **Adam Kicinski** (President & Joint CEO) is **3%**\n\nIncentives for management:\n\n>Management goals are based 80% on net earnings and 20% on SP over the WIG index.\n\nThese are poor goals in my opinion. Net earnings can be enhanced by poor acquisitions and stock price is meaningless and should be ignored in incentives as it can produce short term motivations.\n\nManagement hit the majority of their goals for year 2019.Their goals going forward:\n\n>Goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 8,300 PLN or 1,660 PLN a year.  \n>  \n>Optimistic goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 10,000 PLN or 2,000 PLN a year.\n\nThese goals seem too high in my opinion. Especially after their cyberpunk flop on consoles but it's still possible.\n\n**Competitors**\n\nCD PROJEKT is well known for its biggest sales on The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 hype. However, there’s a lot of gaming industries that compete with one another.\n\nThus comparing its competitors such as Take-Two Interactive, Electronic Arts (EA), Activision Blizzard has more diversified games and games produced more frequently compared to CD PROJEKT RED.\n\nCD Projekt Red's risk in terms of competitors is releasing a big game that clashes with another big game such as GTA 6. However all gaming companies have a good tailwind right now due to COVID restrictions and microtransactions are lifting all gaming companies margins. A rising tide lifts all boats.\n\n**Industry**\n\n>**-** CAGR 2019-2024 Video games and e-sports growth expected to be 7% (source: PWC Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2020–2024).  \n>  \n>\\- In 2019 the strongest strong growth was observed in the mobile and console segments. The former grew by 9.7%, reaching 68.2 billion USD, while the latter grew by 7.3%, reaching 45.3billion USD. The PC market reached a volume of 35.3 billion USD, having increased by 2.8%.The largest share of the global videogame market is currently held by mobile devices (46%), 80% of which are smartphone releases. Gaming consoles come in second at 30%, followed by the PC 24%. Mobile devices are projected to retain their top position, with their corresponding market volume increasing by 11.2% annually (on average) over the next three years. According to estimates, the volume of the global mobile game market will reach 93.6 billion USD by 2022 (it currently stands at 68.2 billion USD).\n\nYou can see from the above as to why CD projekt red is branching out to smartphones and China.\n\n**Reverse DCF**\n\nHere's the original post and reverse DCF because r/stocks does not allow images: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr\\_cd\\_projekt\\_red\\_analysis\\_is\\_it\\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr_cd_projekt_red_analysis_is_it_undervalued/)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's been extremely difficult to project CD Projekt Red and even after doing research I am still very unsure on a bunch of variables. In my opinion the markets assumptions of CD Projekt Red's growth and margins as shown above in the reverse DCF is perfectly acceptable to me. Therefore I would not buy their shares unless they dipped to around 210 zloty\\~ as I don't think they are undervalued yet. given the risks.\n\nPlease comment if you see anything wrong with my valuation. This was a very difficult one for me.\n\nThanks", "id": "kofurl", "created_utc": 1609524599.0, "score": 223, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "It’s such an event driven company right?

Companies/holdings like Activision Blizzard and Tencent Holdings are hitting it out the park every year because of microtransactions on their games. Rockstar has also been cruising on microtransactions from GTA Online, the revenue from people buying shark cards is insane.\n\nPeople joke about GTA V being released on three different generations of consoles now, but obviously the massive revenue behind a good entertaining open world multiplayer is the reason behind that. They just keep updating GTA Online with DLC's where you need to have money to get the \"cool stuff\" so people keep buying sharkcards and it's working too. This is also the reason why they can afford to wait so long for GTA VI and they keep trying to get people that stopped playing it back to the game (with the free 1 million dollars if you log in during the summer). This is also the reason why Rockstar absolutely wanted an online mode for a mainly single player focused game like Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nIf CDPR plays its cards right with the Cyberpunk Online mode and keeps updating it like Rockstar does for GTA, then that's 100% a cashcow for the following years. People get addicted to online modes, compared to singleplayer games that are more like a movie. Sure, you might do multiple playthroughs but I guarantee you that overall people put more time in multiplayer games as the content is infinite there. The only risks that I can think off with multiplayer/online mode are:\n\n1. CDPR screws it up again, it is another glitchy mess or it is not fun to play. This seems very unlikely to me as I believe they have learned their lesson this time and there's no pressure for the multiplayer to be released (or atleast not as much pressure as for the launch).\n2. They stop updating it or the mode goes stale which causes everybody stops playing it after a while. This also seems super unlikely to me as the DLC for the Witcher 3 was amazing so they seem like masters in that department.\n3. CDPR is too mild with the microtransactions. Given CDPR's reputation of 'good' developer I genuinely think that this is the most likely risk, but even if they are mild on the microtransactions it can still bring in a lot of money if it's popular enough.\n\nSo yes, CDPR is currently in the doghouse with the shitty console versions. I personally own it on the PS4 and the performance/bugs/glitches have lessened each update (so they are getting their shit together). I think their current agenda in choronological order is: fix the game, make next-gen versions/make free DLC and ultimately get multiplayer/online mode. They said that the multiplayer mode will be released sometime in 2022, which is a very large scope. I honestly believe this will be a similar story to No Man's Sky: overhyped game fails but keeps updating the game to make it a genuinely good game.\n\nI will 100% be buying in during the year because I think most people don't see this huge opportunity and the stock might dip further. Also remember that often internet noise doesn't match with the sales numbers, we have yet to see financial reports of CP2077 sales (EDIT: the 4th of January there will be a year results publication).

So there's a chance here to buy CDPR stocks that are undervalued compared to the sector if it dips below 240 zloty. Once the game announces any good news, stock price should rise again and if you bought the stock at an undervaluation you are guaranteed for profits. \n\nI put the bottom as 200 zloty just because I think it might even drop significantly further below 240 with upcoming sales report so it might be a good idea to wait until the stock dips even further instead of buying instantly when it dips below 240.

What if, instead of issuing shares of X, Elon starts a cryptocurrency that is backed by ownership stake in X.\n\nWhat would be the point?  Well:\n\n\\- Bitcoin and other crypto is a great idea, but one thing they lack is a relationship to something fundamentally useful and valuable other than the digital coins themselves.  Having a coin that is backed by ownership in the most valuable company in the world would solve that.  Bitcoin currently has a market cap similar to Tesla's.  If Elon issued digital coins for ownership of X, then right away this new cryptocurrency would have a market cap on par with Bitcoin.  The combination of these previous points would be enough to seriously challenge Bitcoin, if not take it over entirely.\n\n\\- Many growth stocks are \"over valued\" in the sense that many analysts argue they are disconnected from their fundamentals.  Yet the stock values keep rising.  It seems to me that there are more and more retail investors these days, and it seems that noone wants to hold fiat currency for fear that it is quickly losing its value.  Instead people are putting all their money into investments, many of them stocks, and the stocks themselves are trading at valuations that are increasingly a function of supply/demand scarcity that has nothing to do with company fundamentals.  I.e. holding shares of \"meme\" stocks is becoming similar to holding coins of crypto currency.  The stock itself is becoming like a digital store of value.  All that is missing is the ability to pay your bills and buy your groceries with fractional shares of your favourite Meme stocks.\n\n\\- I am wondering if issuing partial ownership of a company via crypto coin ownership could circumvent regulation from organizations like the SEC.  Basically, what Bitcoin did for deregulating and decentralizing power over fiat currency, I wonder if we could do the same by creating a crypto currency that gives you ownership in X.\n\nThe End.\n\nSilly?

Here's the criteria I think would be important:\n\n* Not just obvious fraud - there's people who compare TSLA to Enron, but that seems ridiculous at this point. Enron was engage in electricity trading, and their fraud was manipulation of subsidiaries, rolling up liabilities, self dealing, etc. And it was all on the books in plain sight, just not appreciated. If discovering fraud caused the bubble to pop it would have to be a company that was actually making something, was buying parts and supplies and selling products.\n* Was in business, and also trading publicly, for a long time - there's lots of stocks that saw their valuation spike at their IPO and never got back up to that level, or never hit their ambitious targets. Tesla has been around for over a decade, with a long history on the stock market and an established business model\n* Not a \"market\" bubble - there's lots of examples of times when the entire market was overvalued, or a segment of the market was, and everything came crashing down. Or when a recession caused a \"correction\" in the markets. But there's lots of people claiming that Tesla by itself is a bubble (which is actually a somewhat unusual usage of the term). Not the auto industry, like it was with the internet bubble. And there's also calls that the entire market is overvalued, but that wouldn't be nearly enough to explain TSLA's recent returns\n* Actually crashed at some point - it's easy to find people calling nearly any outperforming stock \"over valued\" in the short term, and there's always some people predicting a market crash right around the corner. But I'm looking for a verifiable pop, where an overpriced stock came crashing down, and preferably stayed down.\n* A stock, not a commodity. Speculation in commodities is a different kind of beast and different short term supply/demand imbalances can cause wild swings in the price.\n* Not related to a merger or spin off - these deals can create short term chances for arbitrage, or can swing the price a lot if the deal is a big surprise or gets called off, etc.\n\nI can't remember any examples that meet all these criteria. I can remember lots of examples from sector/market bubbles that went up together and crashed together, but nothing for an individual stock that actually crashed.

Not a car, solar, and battery manufacturer.  \n\nThe importance with the As A Service model is higher margins and better capital efficiency than sales.  This allows profits to define expansion, not sales (number of cars produced).  It internalizes cost reductions and removes the dependency on others to raise capital for investment/sales.  It would greatly change the capital investment issues we currently see with sustainability adaptation. \n\nOthers can build batteries, but tesla has potential to be transportation and energy as service with robo taxi and all-in-one grid based storage and power production. \n\n20M autos a year will lead to lots of profits for tesla, which it can use to finance its own robo taxi and power service infrastructure.  Much more investment potential than many utilities have annually.  This puts growth in teslas hands and aligns with accelerating the path to sustainability, and provides an avenue to put the lots of profits towards future returns instead of dividends.  \n\nRight now green energy is limited by utilities willingness to build it out.  Not necessarily economics as its regulated.  Buildout is restricted by contractional agreements to power providers, upholding power plants that become more and more expensive bs renewables.  \n\nThe combined utilities and energy market is possibly the biggest out there.  Tesla can install micro grids in a weeks and take all that market share with something that has better performance and very soonly will be much cheaper.  When that happens watch them switch from focus on selling the product to focus on selling a service.  Big money!\n\nEVs are limited by consumers replacement cycles and ability to finance autos.  Step 1 is to make EVs cheaper and increase supply to accelerate this adaptation, but the real goal is robo taxis which will undercut per mile cost so much that it will be too expensive to own cars as they are owned today.  The allows ppl to immediately cut cost by riding in EVs without any capital or credit ratings.  When this happens the stock is going to rocket as 1M+ robo taxis could come online easily within a year with a simple OTM software update.  \n\nTransportation and Power As A Service and electric air transportation are my guesses for Master Plan 3, 2030 and beyond.  We a already see transportation as a service in master plan 2, but I think 3 could include Air in the robo taxi model and expand it to Power as a Service, which they are piloting now with solar leases.  \n\nThe big change will be a move off sale/leases and onto subscriptions, which are easier for the customer and internalizes cost savings to within tesla.\n\nSorry for all the words.

The car must be comfortable to drive without FSD otherwise it is premature, especially given the uncertainty of FSD regulation. 2) So much performance for what? if it does 0-60 under 2 sec, it is meant to be driven, intentionally. More specifically, it is meant to be driven like a race car or maybe F1 car, where we haven't seen round steering wheels for a while.\n\nSuch power, however, cannot be handled easily by the common mortal be it in the racetrack or on the public roads. What does Tesla do? They solve the problem by giving you active steering assistance, just like they already do with traction control and active suspension. Not only the new model S is incredibly powerful, but it will be a paradigm change in sports-driving, just like traction control and active suspension completely changed the game over the last decade. It's about making high power and speed more manageable to the average Joe.\n\nFor everyday life, the same system will make sure you never have to cross your arms to park, make a 90 degrees or even U turn. You twist the yoke the direction you want to go, the car figures out how much to twist the wheels. Simple. That's why you don't need a round steering wheel. Also think of all the driving games you play on PC or console. No one had any problems beating a driving game using WASD or a D-pad or, for sure, an analogue stick. Why should reality be any different? That's what driving a model S will feel like: driving in a video game.\n\nAnd don't forget how much effort was put in breaking lap records in Nürburgring and Laguna Seca during the plaid development. They didn't bother to do this on any other model. The target was the Taycan, Porsche has power and a long history of having the perfect balance and driving feel. Maybe the Model S could eventually be just as good just with suspension and weight balance tuning. But how do you beat that with a proper smack down, the Elon way? Next generation steering system. This is leveraging completely on their neural network and camera system, will be a huge moat that will remain out of reach from other car-makers for years, particularly your typical racing exotics and the last nail in the coffin for lidar.\n\nElon said he's going to talk about it.

Cry fire and everyone runs.\" -- Thornton O'glove\n\nI have a good chunk of my portfolio riding on Tesla and I want to decide what to do next (sell/hold/buy?). To this end, I combed through analyst reports to see how these guys think. The more I read, the less convinced I am of their guess-work. It seems the more extreme optimistic views are presented as absolutes without a discussion of the alternative possibilities.\n\nI distilled my understanding of the possibilities and reduced them to the following \"fair-value\" estimates for a share of Tesla today:\n\n|Super-bull|$772|\n|:-|:-|\n|Bull|$686|\n|Cautious|$457|\n|Bear|$273|\n|Bubble-burst|$110|\n\nI am being cautiously optimistic that Tesla will do incredibly well, without submitting entirely to fan-fiction. Even a bubble-burst scenario assumes Tesla will dominate the electric vehicle market, but without amazing profit margins.\n\nThis makes me suspicious about the current price of Tesla (\\~$700). I want to know whether you think I am making a mistake and if so then where.\n\nMy method is simple:\n\nThe \"fair-value\" of a stock can be reduced to four numbers (each of which depends on many other parameters we won't be discussing here). I compared the values on which analysts differ the most, and considered various possibilities.\n\nIn the rest of this text, I explain the numbers and answer some questions I anticipate.\n\n# Fair-value formula\n\nWe will project the price in January 2025 and discount it back to January 2021. Remember, even if you *knew* TSLA will sell for $1200 in 2025, you would not want to pay $1200 for it today. If you want a 10% yearly return on your investments then you want to pay no more than $1200/1.1\\^4 = $820.\n\nLet's say TRP is your Tesla Risk Premium: the amount of yearly compensation you would like to have for your investment in Tesla. This could be 10, 15, 20%, for example. Then:\n\n    TSLA fair value today = (price in four years)/(1+TRP)^4.\n\nThe price in 2025 can be broken down via the following tautology:\n\n    Price in 2025 = net profit margin (M) * revenue per share (R) * price to earnings ratio (PE) = M*R*PE\n\nTherefore there are four values that we need to guess: M, R, PE, TRP. Then we get:\n\n    Fair value = M*R*PE/(1+TRP)^4.\n\n## Revenue per share (R)\n\nElon Musk predicts Tesla can manufacture 4 million cars in 2025. Let's take that as gospel. We will be very generous and assume that the average revenue from each car is $50k. That gives $200B in revenue. With about 1B shares, we get $200 revenue per share.\n\nNote: This is one of the most optimistic predictions I found online. Remember, Tesla must reduce the price of its cars to sell 4M of them. But I will take the optimistic 50k per car revenue to account for the possible revenue from selling self-driving software to others.\n\n## Net profit margin (M)\n\nAnalysts are busting their brains trying to figure out this number. The worst estimates take M=8% and the most optimistic ones take 16%. I will entertain three possibilities: 8, 12, 16%.\n\nNote: Toyota is one of the most profitable car companies with an 8% profit margin.\n\nNote: If you believe there will be no competition in the EV market, and if you believe battery technology will make revolutionary leaps then you are leaning towards a 16% net profit margin.\n\n## Price to earnings ratio (PE)\n\nNow we need to speculate about how others will speculate in the future: What will the 2025 market participants think about the growth prospects of Tesla?\n\nWould you have predicted that the 2021 market participants would think a PE ratio of 1300 is reasonable?\n\nAnyway, we have to make a guess. Car companies traditionally have a PE of around 10. Tech companies have a PE of around 50.\n\nI will entertain three possibilities: PE = 10, 25, or 50.\n\n## Tesla's risk premium (TRP)\n\nHow much would you like to earn per year for your investment in Tesla?\n\nGary Black takes TRP = 9%.\n\nThere is a standard formula for this ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityriskpremium.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equityriskpremium.asp)) which gives 14%.\n\nYou may want more return for your money, maybe 20%.\n\nRemember, TRP is how risky you view Tesla given the market conditions. But even if you think Tesla is not very risky, the smaller TRP you take, the less money you are willing to earn.\n\nWe could entertain TRP = 10, 15, 20%. But I think this doesn't make sense. If you are pumping up all the other numbers, then the slightest thing that goes wrong will bring down the price from your estimates. To justify a price at a fragile position, you want a large risk premium.  On the other hand, if you are predicting the demise of Tesla, you will not simultaneously demand a 20% annualized profit.\n\nSo, I take TRP=20% for the super-bull scenario below. Then TRP=15% for the intermediate cases and 10% for the more conservative scenarios.\n\n## Evaluate the formula\n\nInstead of all tuples (M, PE, TRP) and R=$200, I will present only the tuples that make sense together.\n\n|Scenario      |(M,PE,TRP)|Fair value today|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Super-Bull    |16%,50,20%|$772      |\n|Bull          |12%,50,15%|$686      |\n|Cautious      |8%,50,15%  |$457      |\n|Bear          |8%,25,10%  |$273      |\n|Bubble-bursts|8%,10,10%  |$110      |\n\nI imagine there are difficulties ahead. So I can't assume that every single thing will work as well as possible. This suggests that a fair value for me would be less than $686 per share of Tesla. Perhaps even $457. It seems Tesla is overpriced at $700.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n# But ...\n\n## But Tesla will have an army of robo-taxis, where is that in your calculation?\n\nCurrently, this is pure fiction because of legislative difficulties (especially with a Democratic president). Also, I am suspicious that people will give out their precious cars to strangers who might eat catchup-dripping burgers, or vomit after heavy drinking. There is also mounting competition from Amazon and Google. This might become an important factor after 2025. But today, this story is beyond speculation.\n\n## But Elon Musk is amazing!\n\nI agree. On the other hand, 1 billionth of Tesla (with Tesla=1/3 Elon) has some finite potential. Is that potential worth 400$ or 700$? Remember, we are putting in money that might take us years to recover if we over-estimate.\n\n## But you are just bean-counting, have some imagination!\n\nI left the story part to the analysts and took their numbers. There is no shortage of fan-fiction on Wall St. In the end, we need to decide if Tesla is a sell at 700 or not. This answer is binary. A story about cost-reduction in batteries over four years must be distilled into a single factor in making this binary decision. We need numbers!\n\n## But Tesla has amazing self-driving software.\n\nNow, this is a good point. Tesla might make a lot of money by using or selling its superior self-driving capabilities. On the other hand, we imagined that Tesla is also aiming to produce 4 million cars in 2025. Selling that many cars are possible if the average price is dramatically decreased.

While the B-pillar camera is pretty close to a driver's head usually, the key difference is human's ability to move. On the rare cases where you encounter these occuluded intersections, you will notice human drivers to lean forward over the wheel to get a better view. Even a small shift forward massively improves visibility because geometry.

I don't think this will be a difference maker that prevents them getting to 99.9% reliability in FSD.

Maybe it will generate a positive return, but there will be plenty other plays that are likely to be more profitable. Couple of points:\n\n* EV charging takes less power from the grid than you think. I ran the numbers for Germany and its not all that much. Not sure how translatable that would be to US. Average driving distance in Germany is about 35km per car per day. Thats about 5kWh. We have about 45 million cars. If the entire fleet would be electric, it would require 225 GWh. The yearly power consumption in Germany was 558 TWh in 2020, so 558000 GWh per year or 1528 GWh per day. Additional 225 GWh will not cause a big problem in the grid. This does not include trucks, which might actually use 2x as much as passanger cars. But even then, its about a 50% increase in grid usage. And that assumes a 100% electrification.\n* Power generation will be democratized within 10 years. Power plants will be significantly reduced and replaced by personal solar and power walls. Not completely obviously, but given the current development in solar and battery, it makes financial sense for a family to go this route when building or buying a new house. Given all that, it means we have a REDUCTION in grid demand because the power generation is less centralized.\n* Look at the growth potential of batteries instead. Battery capacity production must ~100x in the next 10 years. Thats some growth to be chacing! Even if the cost per kWH reduces 10x (which is pretty unlikely), thats still an investment improvement of 10x. Thats why battery raw materials are a much better play than power grid infrastructure.\n* Look at medicine companies. We are at the basement of a genomics revolution. I have no idea which company will win that, but the writing is on the wall. I will give that blow out potential, but it can also crumble to dust as it has before multiple times. Its a risky play but with lots of potential. Looking at ARKG the last couple weeks more intensly tells me they dont know whats going on either. One day they are hyping CRISPR Therapoitics, then they are buying Teledoc like no tomorrow. Maybe they know more than I can see, but it looks a bit erratic to me. So.. risky one, but with huge potential.\n* Look at graphene. I think its still too early to invest by a couple of years, tech is not ready yet.

{"title": "Fulfilling my Ryan Gosling Big Short fantasy by throwing my life savings into DoorDash puts", "selftext": "DoorDash is currently sitting at $142 per share, down 22% from $182 when retail investors were able to buy at IPO so that confirms that this isn't gonna do something retarded and pull a STONKS ONLY GO UP move. People can see that its worth dogshit. Only \\~10% of its 286M outstanding shares are available to trade due to its lockup period, giving it a float of 20M shares.\n\nHere's where things get interesting. If you take a look at page 91 of their S-1 filing ([Go to page 91 to confirm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm#rom752207_9) ), existing shareholders PRE-IPO purchased 284M shares at an average of $8.73. Company employees who purchased shares at that price are salivating at a current 1,628% profit. Early lockup period expires 90 days after IPO, meaning that 90% of outstanding shares (284M shares once again) that currently can't be traded and were purchased at $8.73 will be released into the market available to trade in the beginning of March. Regardless of what you think about valuation and possible future growth of DoorDash (which is already ridiculously overpriced and they had the worst IPO in history), any rational employee will dump their holdings immediately for that 10 bagger profit.\n\nNow considering present conditions, the price action is ridiculous. Looking at the level 2 data, there is almost no retail volume, and any trades made throughout the day are by MMs trying to keep this stock liquid. Volume from the past 2 days has already dropped by 50%. Literally NO ONE wants to buy this POS. The price is pinned at $140, with retail dips that are immediately bought up by manipulation. If you look at the 1 minute chart yesterday, it traded at literally $140 throughout the day and suddenly spiked to 146 in a manner of 3 minutes before slowly settling down to $142. This thing is manipulated as fuck, and as soon as MMs are exhausted it will crash regardless of the aforementioned S-1 filing.\n\nFundamentally, DoorDash is also doorTrash. While it does command 50% of the food delivery market, it made a measly $1.9B revenue through September 2020 with $149M in losses ([DoorDash releases S-1 for IPO, reports $149M in losses through September (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/13/doordash-releases-s-1-for-ipo.html)) during COVID lockdowns across the nation, when it is literally the best possible conditions for food delivery. As vaccinations and anti-maskers start going out again, revenue will only decrease. There is also no brand loyalty, and no advantage over its competitors such as UberEats, Postmates, Grubhub, Waitr, Seamless, Munchery, Instacart, the pizza delivery guy fucking your wife, etc.\n\nI have 175 contracts of 5/21 $80 puts. I'm betting $87k I can look back at this post in 5 months and pretend I'm reenacting The Big Short as Ryan Gosling. More than likely, I'll probably have to start driving for DoorDash and moonlight sucking weens behind the restaurants I just made a delivery from.\n\nLooking for any serious counterarguments on why this play might be retarded. Also would really like a Bubble Boy flair.\n\nEdit: Since some of ya'll reminded me of how irrational the market is, I might roll out my puts to Jan 22 leaps depending on what happens next week.
