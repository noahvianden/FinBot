{"title": "GME bulls: *Brace yourselves* for this inevitable (but necessary) temporary setback, and be ready to take full advantage!", "selftext": "Disclosure: I’m very long GME since 15 (unfortunately mostly vertical debit spreads but I added a lot later at 50). \n\nI want everyone here to be ready for the hitch in the road that inevitably will occur. The board at GME *is*, without a doubt, going to dilute their shares. I’m Certain of it. I’d say the odds are it happens by the end of this week In fact. And I want to remind everyone that this is something we should expect and *desire* as investors in this company. Remember, We are in this company for the long haul. If the board doesn’t approve a secondary offering, even I-as a bull-am going to think the company is making a huge mistake because this is the opportunity right here to eliminate debts and create a new slate. Making a secondary offering for even 5% of their shares is going to give them enough cash on hand to turn Gamestop into a brand new company. \n\nSo be prepared because this is the outline of what’s going to ensue when it happens: \n\nShorts, who are getting fucked inside and out, are going to see this as “their opportunity” to finally get out of this shitshow. Citron and others have already made clear they think a dilution will kill the short squeeze entirely. *don’t fall for it*. Remember, after this offering, You are no longer investing in Gamestop, but Gamestop 2.0; one not laden with millions in debt. And One strapped with enough cash to forge its own destiny. The stock is going to drop undoubtedly, but right after is where new bulls (and old) will come in to buy the dip and realize this changes the company fundamentally *for the better for years to come*. \n\nRemember, we are not out of our minds. Gamestop is only now trading at reasonable levels! It now has an enterprise value over sales of a humble 1.17. Their market cap is literally just beginning to approach their revenue so don’t tell us it’s overvalued. If Cohen can get everyone on board and take this company towards year over year revenue growth, we could be talking $1000-3000 levels a year out from now. All that has to change is the perception, and then we are talking huge EV/sales multiples. \n\nSide-note: Remember also that share prices are irrelevant. $3000 May seem crazy high, but GME doesn’t have many shares outstanding. $3000 a share isn’t a crazy number to obtain. Mercado Libre, for example, is $2000 a share because they don’t have many shares outstanding. Don’t be misled by share prices alone either or compare to other companies like Apple with a lot more shares outstanding. \n\nThis right here is the Battle of Thermopylae *Part Deux*. We are Sparta. And the shorts are Persia. Persia wins hands down almost anywhere with their vast array of resources and soldiers. But we’ve picked a *perfect* home terf for the battle just like Sparta did: A stock with 140% short interest, Extremely small float, and a new vision. The bulls will win this out just as Sparta. This is fucking Gamestop. \n\nSo just remember, this amazing journey doesn’t even begin until GME takes care of the elephant in the room by eliminating their debts through a secondary offering. And at last, our journey with Gamestop 2.0 shall finally begin!  ✌️🚀 \n\nTLDR: a secondary offering is a necessary milestone GME bulls should look forward to.", "id": "l5ycjl", "created_utc": 1611729412.0, "score": 1337, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 344, "comments": [{"body": "So, a few things to clarify here. TLDR - there is no set date for the stock offering, and the offering will turn GME even more bullish\n\nA new stock offering was already discussed in the last earnings call, it's already on the table, and I think (I have to check) that the S-3 is already submitted. This already caused a dip at that time (go figure). Main point here is that the shelf offering is restricted to USD 100 M. \n\nFirst, by current values this will be peanuts, even if they were to do the offering NOW.  It's a mere half a million shares.\n\nSecond point, doing this would have them wipe out 20% of the total debt they have. Even more if they negotiate. This is extremely bullish in my opinion. Most times, yes, a dilution makes the stock drop a bit. But look at TSLA and their recent offerings. The stock didn't take a hit. It jumped up even.\n\nAnd third, I highly doubt they will do this so soon. So far management has kept totally mum about what is happening, and rightly so. Next earnings call is early March and I believe they will keep their mouths shut until then. Smart. And plenty of time for the stock to rise which will mean even less shares.\n\nOf course, I do expect news on that day, very possibly a bigger offering that allows them to completely wipe out debt. And maybe (hopefully!) news of some interesting game streaming / game distribution platform. I'm extremely bullish\n\nDisclaimer: My opinion only. Not financial advice.

Whichever number it is, given that the total number of shares outstanding are slightly less than 70M, this clearly leaves the board a lot of room in terms of the available shares that they are immediately able to offer up to the public. Also, I doubt they would dilute the existing shares that much by offering anywhere near the levels they are ultimately allowed to offer by the original mandate anyways so really I wouldn’t see it going anywhere past 100M shares outstanding. \n\nThe other consideration is that while yes, yesterday was a huge run up in terms of share price, this accelerated increase and trading volume has been going on for around two weeks now, meaning that the board may have already been poised to make plans like share dilution for at least a few days if not a week or so now and really every increase in share price is just an added bonus/may mean less of a dilution if their original capital raising goal continues to be met. \n\nEither way I got scared and sold my last shares at $75 and am regretting that very much but looking forward to a possible dilution to get back in on the fun.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "According to the shelf offering they can add up to $100million worth of shares, not 100 million shares.

Following the trends is a fundamental part of investing.

In the late nineties those who sold their tech stocks fearing a bubble had to watch markets continue to climb higher as their portfolios underperformed – in some cases for years. Of course, eventually they were proven right while those who had been making a killing in tech stocks watched their portfolios drop 80-90% (and even more if they were leveraged).\n\nThe only thing that will ever matter are fundamentals, but that doesn't mean over periods of months and years that markets can't become significantly decoupled from economic realities. It also doesn't mean that there isn't money to be made during periods of market irrationally. In every bubble there are winners and losers, but it's often those who chase a bubble because of FOMO that get in too late and lose big.\n\nYou should see this as a challenge. As an investor you need to learn how to look at markets and call it on its BS. If you don't have the mental and emotional strength to buy stocks when everyone is panicking or sell / short them when markets are exuberant you probably don't have what it takes to outperform the market and you should probably just invest in an index fund. Again, the real winners of the $GME trade won't be those jumping in today, but the weirdos who brought $GME months ago when everyone thought they were mad. You need to try to be that guy.\n\nSomething else to remember is that it's okay to be wrong every now and then. It's far better to underperform the market and live to tell the tale than to outperform for a year or two only to lose everything. If you make 100% returns for 3 years in a row, then on the 4th year you lose 90%, you'll be down over that period. This is why I warn people about owning stocks like GME and TSLA which could drop more than 80% if they return to trading on their fundamentals. Basically no amount of upside is worth the risk of owning a stock like that IMO.\n\nAnyone who manages risk effectively and is trying to maximise for long-term returns should expect to significantly underperform during exuberant markets. Buffett is a good example of someone who always appears to be losing his touch during excessive bull markets.\n\nAt the end of the day you need to decide what you want to do. Getting rich slow is boring but with discipline is almost guaranteed. Getting rich quick is exciting, but can't be done without significant risk and most of the time it doesn't work.\n\nTo be clear though, I don't think markets are behaving that irrationally.

Financial reporters, many of the analysts, IMO got lazy on tesla because they were so forthright with delivery targets, profitability targets etc.\n\nNow they're going to actually have to work a bit harder, dig a bit more and do their actual f\\*ing jobs to try and get an idea of what future quarters are going to be.\n\nThere's clearly some legit sandbagging happening too.  Earlier I saw posts where peep's noted that there is current capacity now at all vehicle factories to make over a million vehicles.  That's hugely bullish with the other giga's coming online.\n\nAlso and this was mentioned on the call I think by Zack, there are serious issues in the global supply chain right now.  Container ships are sitting off US coasts because Long Beach, Oakland and prob. Seattle as well are overwhelmed with container volume.  Semiconductor manufacturers are all saying they can't make chips fast enough to fill demand, Zack mentioned this too.  So if you're procurement people are telling you they can't get some of the parts, then you're for sure going to want to sandbag forecasts while this all gets worked out.  And it will, it won't take too long but the timing of this is as good as it can be with Q1 being the slowest of the 4 quarters.\n\nThe EPS miss was a one time thing, shit happens.  The free cash flow, pre-payment of debt and cash on hand is mega bullish.  Tesla is just going from an unprofitable (though yeah large revenue/employee wise) startup with an unproven business model in multiple verticals to well on the way to becoming a 3 legged behemoth.  Cannot underestimate the importance of a solid cash position for a business.  $$ is a businesses oxygen, and there have been many times since I've been an investor when we were on the oxygen machine, big time.\n\nI'm still as stoked as ever, bought that AH dip and will be buying more shares and options.\n\nOnward!", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "People are responding to earnings like they would any other earnings report without covid. \n\nVery soon reality will set in as we see everyone else’s earnings reports.

There actually will be decent competition on many fronts.

This does depend entirely upon FSD being fully functional, but also entirely omits storage, solar, and autobidder.\n\nFor the record I don't think the 2x or 5x value of the cars as FSD profit is a good metric.

So that's like roughly a 5x increase in utility. But let's — even if you say like, okay, let's just assume that the car becomes twice as useful as — not 5x as useful, but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of the company, which is almost entirely gross margin.\n\n>So it would mean, it would be like if you made $50 billion worth of cars, it will be like having $50 billion of incremental profit basically from that because it's just software. And the pace you get 20 PE on that, it's like $1 trillion and the company is still in high growth mode. So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company where it is using just the cars and nothing else, the cars with FSD. And I suspect at least some number of investors are taking that approach.\n\nThe 25-100T is a ballpark figure based on Elon's previous 20 million units per year in or before 2030. \n\n>20m units * 30k ASP @ 0% net margin + $30k robo profit * 20 p/e = 12T\n\nI had previously used p/e of 30, but after listening to his comments in the call I've revised the floor.\n\nCeiling might be something like this though\n\n>20m units * 40k ASP @ 20% net margin + $200k robo profit * 30 p/e = 125T\n\nAgain, this is an insane way to value the company.

But I'm interested in how they ended this year. First, Is their Cash value. Has it changed? They've had a consistent amount of cash and cash equivalent the past 3 years and not only that they're paying a lot of dividends. If we see a huge dip in the cash without a huge dip in the company's income it might indicate acquisitions the company made and they would mention that too if they did. \n\nHuge decrease in cash usually indicates that the company is trying to expand. I expect this to happen because there's no reason to let that much cash sit for long periods of time. It's usual for company to accumulate cash for 3-5 years before they expand instead of borrowing money from the bank (think berkshire hathaway). The company is waiting for the right time to spend that cash. If I have to guess, this huge expenditure will occur in the next two years. Decrease in cash might scare off some investors but it could potentially indicate a buy signal.\n\nNext is earnings, I don't expect strong earnings from 2020. A 20% decrease in earnings from 2019 is acceptable. However, a horrible earning might result in the company touching their cash reserves which could delay whatever their plans are in the future but I really don't think that will happen because all they have to do is stop paying dividends to keep their cash reserves intact. \n\nIf 2020 Q4 earnings are horrible then we might expect a delay in the company's plan. However, if their earnings hasn't changed or not below 20% their usual then we could expect a strong 2 year bull run from the company. \n\nThe two strong buy signals that could indicate a bull run in the next 2 years is the end to covid 19 and a healthy cash reserve for the company.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Lol I meant after next week, but this is a fantastic write up.

{"title": "Friday 1/29/21 GME Expiry Date Means Nothing. Don't buy into the hype - shorts aren't just afraid of this Friday. Come down the rabbit hole with me.", "selftext": "*Note: I am mostly summarizing the aggregate of explanations currently floating around about the 1/29/21 option expiry date. I don't claim any knowledge. This is not investment advice. Do your own research, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and if something feels wrong it probably is.* \n\n**TL;DR: This isn't about options (yet), it's about shares, and Institutional Investors are playing a dangerous game by convincing us (some of y'all have bought in without realizing it) that a magical short squeeze has some 3-day time limit, that Friday is somehow the end game, and are hoping that when investors don't see a $5,000 short squeeze by next week they will fold and take their gains at a \"reasonable\" double-digit stock price. Don't believe them. They can survive through mid-late February before the true short squeeze smashes upward. And I'll be ready. I like this stock and believe in it's long term potential, and I think it's undervalued.**\n\n\n\n**THESIS:** If institutional investors can (1) convince retail investors to sell stock at low prices and (2) convince their lenders to wait, then the 0.01% get richer.\n\n\n\n**JUSTIFICATION:** There is so much public sentiment (passion, enthusiasm, excitement, anger, whatever) surrounding short (~1 day) price movements*, and Friday's expiring options (these are also end of month contracts), that it seems like big clever money may be trying to artificially create a sort of bear trap for shareholders. \n\nWhatever happens in the next week or so (crest to $700? crash to $60?) almost means nothing in the long term, but could fool investors into giving these guys CHEAP ways out of their 140% float short interest positions. Remember, these are people who have been dumping tons of money for a long time, shorting the stock when it was *in the single digits*. They've been hoping for a GameStop bankruptcy, and manufacturing one as best they can. \n\n\n\n**IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME:** Remember the VW infinite squeeze, where we saw **weeks** of crazy price movement before the actual peak. And that is a mild case, as most of the shares were held by an entity with legal, competitive, and strategic reasons and obligations forcing them to hold shares and **artificially reducing the float, or available shares for trading**. This reduced supply caused the short squeeze. \n\nHowever, this time around we've got a huge short interest, much much larger by comparison than that from VW's 2008 peak, to the tune of **140% of shares available for trading (float)**. They've massively overreached, and are going to pay the price for that. **But they haven't yet.**\n\n\n\n**SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE:** This time, however, if the big dogs can shake shareholders hard enough, weak links break and paper hands fold and a fantastic long term play starts to seem out of reach. The market manipulation wins. \n\n\n\n**DARE TO BELIEVE:** Unfortunately for the shorts, GME has [real long term prospects](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) to revolutionize the gaming industry for consumers, and now has the attention and potential equity momentum (if they play it smart, which I think the new leadership will) to make this a reality. \n\nFrom that link above:\n>In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company. \n\nI believe. \n\nHowever, if the shorts can fight, sneak, manipulate, and otherwise adjust the share price down this week then they start to see light at the end of the tunnel. They make 2-3 week plans for doing the same thing. For them, prices don't have to bottom back out, they just have to convince enough people to sell that they buy thrmselves a few weeks before a short squeeze really takes them all under. \n\n*Some of this price movement is shorts covering, but much is actual legitimate investment between retail investors and other institutional investors who have seen the light. Remember, TSLA didn't get to where it is because one company made some bad short positions. But if GME shorts can convince everyone that a 3-day squeeze is all they get until GME crashes to some \"normal\" level, then they win. \n\nEveryone getting hyped about Friday is playing into their hands. Yeah maybe some will need to take gains after a Friday pop, but a smart long-term hold position on GME is what they're really afraid of. And I want to be a shareholder in GME's future, as many wanted to be with TSLA. And sure, maybe if everyone else thinks that way too, there may be an incidental short squeeze that wrecks the uber wealthy in mid-late February along the way. \n\n**Again, I am not claiming to be knowledgeable or insightful, just commenting my best guesses. Nobody knows the future. This is not investing advice.** \n\n🚀", "id": "l5ws97", "created_utc": 1611723385.0, "score": 2302, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 413, "comments": [{"body": "Listen man i'm a retard and all but i remember reading somewhere in-between some rocket emotes that they might get margin called this week and next week i get to retire at twenty, idk though i just like the stock 🚀🚀", "score": 714, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 243, "replies": [{"body": "More like:\n\n*even if 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Friday, and less 🚀 next week, maybe 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 by early March*\n\nBut again, **TL;DR the TL;DR:** Holding GME shares long, diamond hand style, while they [use this action, attention, and momentum to slingshot themselves into the frontline of the gaming revolution](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), is the **only** thing these rich fat cats fear right now.

{"title": "DDDD - How r/wallstreetbets Created a Financial Weapon of Mass Destruction", "selftext": "Inspired by the recent events in r/wallstreetbets causing $GME, $BB, and $BBRY, among other historically highly shorted stocks to surge just to spite some rich people in wall street, I've decided to come out of retirement from r/wallstreetbets and publish a new edition of DDDD (Data-Driven DD) covering the exact mechanics that made this possible. I’ll also introduce those of you that are unfamiliar how r/wallstreetbet’s favorite gambling device, stock options, actually work and how they can be used by this subreddit as a weapon of mass destruction against hedge funds like Melvin - all dumbed down to a fifth grade reading level so that the average person in this subreddit will mostly understand what I’m talking about.\n\n*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*\n\n### Shorting\n\n**How It Works**\n\nMost traditional (i.e. boomer) investors usually try to make money by going long - i.e. “buy low and sell high”; this is when you buy a stock thinking it will go up in the future (bullish). Shorting is the opposite of this, you “sell high and buy low”, thinking the stock will go down in the future (bearish). This is usually done through the broker, where the prospective short seller would “borrow” the shares from them, and they would need to pay back these shares in some future date by “covering their shorts” - or buying back the exact same quantity of shares they owe the broker.\n\nFor example, imagine that there were only 10 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in the world. Because nobody wants to deal with taking physical possession of these cards and risk losing their Pokemon card in their laundry or something, everyone pays a Pokemon card dealer a small fee to store it for them. Through their dealer, you can buy and sell these Pokemon cards as well. A 🌈🐻 realizes that maybe Pokemon cards are dumb and borrows 2 Surprised Pikachu cards (who has a prearranged agreement with some institutional Pokemon card hoarder to loan them out for interest) and sell them for $420 each, thinking that they're actually work $100 at most, and plans to buy the Pokemon cards back at that price to repay his Pokemon card loan (i.e. covering their shorts) - this is a short sale. Since no one actually wants to physically hold these Pokemon cards, these cards physically stay with the dealer who could then lend out these exact same Pokemon card if the buyer also has an agreement to allow them to do so. This means that you can actually have people owing more than the total number of Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards in existence (i.e. short interest > 100%).\n\nReplace “Surprised Pikachu Pokemon card” with stocks and “Pokemon card dealer” with “broker” and you have a short sale of shares. Interestingly enough, this also applies 80% to how banks work as well.\n\n**Short Squeezes**\n\nSo when does a short seller need to cover their shorts? Well, either when a) The short seller wants to, either to take profit or to stop a loss, b) Their broker forces them to through a margin call, or c) The broker forces them to as the broker has recalled their loan, usually for a hard to borrow stock - they get “bought in”. Today, we’ll focus on C) because this is how short squeezes happen.\n\nSo, what does a broker recalling their loan mean? Well, to go back to the Pokemon card example, imagine that the dealer only has 6 Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards that he’s legally allowed to loan out. Some more 🌈🐻 short sells all the 6 remaining Pokemon cards until the dealer has no more available on hand. So what happens when someone wants to buy a Surprised Pikachu Pokemon Card and doesn’t want the dealer to lend out their cards? He’ll have to force one of those 🌈🐻 to buy back the card that they owe them so the dealer can give it to the prospective buyer. But who can the 🌈🐻 buy back the card from? The dealer. But the dealer doesn’t have any cards to sell, so they need to force another 🌈🐻 to cover so that the former 🌈🐻 can cover their shorts. This vicious cycle repeats and leads towards a sudden surge in demand for Surprised Pikachu Pokemon cards and a spike in prices for it - a short squeeze.\n\n**The Institutional Factor**\n\nOne thing alluded above was that shares can only be borrowed from \\*some\\* share holders, but not all. So who exactly can and does a broker typically borrow these shares from? These are usually margin accounts of either institutional and sometimes (although much less frequently) retail investors. Usually, when an entity signs a margin agreement, which allows them to borrow either cash or shares from the broker, they give permission to the broker to also lend out their shares in the process, and thereby also give up their voting rights - in case you’ve ever wondered who actually the share \\*actually\\* belonged to in shareholders meetings. Since almost every institution except Warren Buffet uses margin to a certain extent, and not that many retail investors do, especially given that retirement accounts are forbidden to use margin, and it’s much easier to “find” one big source of TSLA shares from one big institution with a margin account rather than find thousands of smaller margin retail accounts who hold TSLA shares, so most of the time, these shares are being borrowed from an institution (i.e. pension fund, hedge fund). This means that shares that are almost disproportionately held by retail investors are much harder to short because they’re harder to borrow from the broker, and retail-heavy stocks like HTZ, GME, NIO, and NKLA, which virtually no institutions actually hold, will demand high interest rates when shorting and the sellers can much more easily be forced to cover during a short squeeze.\n\n### Stock Options\n\n**What are Stock Options**\n\nA stock option is a contract between the writer and whoever holds it that gives the option holder the right to buy (call option) or sell (put option) 100 shares of the underlying stock on or before the expiry date at a specified strike price. So for example, buying a GME 1/29 $1000c gives whoever the holder of this contract is the option to buy from the writer of this contract 100 shares of GME at $1000 / share on or before 1/29. Obviously if GME is lower than $1000 before that date, the holder would be an idiot to exercise this option to buy GME shares for more than their current market value, so they expire worthless.\n\nThis effectively provides the option holder an immense amount of leverage, and provides the opportunity for them to 10x or even 100x their original investment if the underlying asset moves the right way - for example because a subreddit declares war on a hedge fund and pumps up a stock to make them go bankrupt, while limiting their losses to the cost of the option. The option writer will in return receive a premium for the option, potentially risking an infinite amount of money, but with a high likelihood of making a small profit. These writers would either be\n\n1. Theta gang - who are looking to generate a tidy income source from those option premiums and pray that the stock doesn’t move in the wrong direction too much\n2. A market maker - who writes the contract when they see an arbitrage opportunity between the market value of an option and the theoretical value of it, and hedging their contract they wrote by buying / shorting the underlying assets so they effectively don’t actually take a position in the market.\n\nWe’ll go over how 2) works and how this mechanism can be used as a financial nuclear bomb, but first you need to learn some greek. \n\n**The Greeks**\n\nThe greeks in finance is a set of factors that can affect the price of a stock option / group of options\n\nDelta - Change of the option price as the stock price changes\n\nGamma - Change in Delta as the stock price changes\n\nVega - Change in the option price as volatility of the stock changes\n\nTheta - The decay in the option price as the expiration date gets nearer\n\nRho - Change of the option price as the interest rate changes; Most people ignore this\n\nLooking at the greeks of the gambling tickets you buy is very useful to analyzing the ways you can make or lose money on them. Think TSLA will go up a modest amount? Buy a high-Delta call. Think GME is going to 🚀🚀🚀 1000% more? Look for a high Gamma call so your Delta gains accelerate as GME 🚀🌕. Do you feel like a vampire and want to have a steady income source from degenerate r/wallstreetbet gamblers on a stock you think will go flat (relative to historical volatility) over the next few months? Join theta gang and sell a high-Theta and high-Vega option!\n\n**Market Makers**\n\nThe Black-Scholes model is a fancy mathematical model that describes a “perfect price” (a lot of caveats here) for a stock option. This is done by showing how every option written can theoretically be perfectly hedged by a series of purchases or short sells on the underlying stock. This means that theoretically, if there is a large gap between the theoretical price from Black Scholes and the actual price for an option, there is an “arbitrage” opportunity - this is where market makers come in.\n\nMarket makers are companies that provide liquidity to a market by offering to be counterparty to trades. This is especially useful in stock options, where a single ticker can have thousands of options, and there might be someone who wants to buy a GME 1/29 $1000c but no one is actually actively selling it. However, this option might be listed anyways and Citadel will sell you the call if anyone tries to buy it and then immediately hedge it. In fact, when you buy an option chances are you’re not actually buying it from its previous owner selling an option they already own, but from a market maker like Citadel (who is responsible for over 99% of all options volume in 3000 stocks).\n\nSo what happens when someone buys an option from a market maker? Since the market maker typically can’t (and probably don’t want to) take a position, meaning taking a directional bet if a stock goes up or down, they’ll immediately hedge the option they just conjured out of thin air by buying or shorting the equivalent number of shares such that the Delta of those shares is the same as the Delta of the option they wrote to remain Delta-neutral, so if the stock goes up or down their position value doesn’t change - this is called **Delta hedging**. Furthermore, as the stock price moves up (calls) or down (puts), they’ll need to buy or sell even more of those shares to remain Delta neutral since the Delta will change due to the option’s Gamma - this is called **Gamma hedging**.\n\n### Putting It All Together - How options can be used as weapons of mass destruction against short sellers\n\nNow we have the tools to understand how these two financial concepts put together can make billion-dollar hedge funds go bankrupt. Through Delta and Gamma hedging of market makers, buyers can have the effect of buying shares dozens of times the value they actually spent buying their option; a XYZ 4/20 690c can cost only $100 in premiums but causes the market maker to buy $2000 in the underlying stock to hedge against it. If you get enough retail investors to do this, they'll have the impact of billion-dollar whales on the market despite their small stimulus-check-funded portfolios.\n\nNow, you do this on a stock that is heavily shorted, and with very little institutions actually holding real shares of these - making it harder for brokers to find shares to borrow, and you have yourself a weapon of mass financial destruction capable of making billions of Melvin’s money disappear in a single day and potentially have GME 🚀🚀🚀 to a trillion dollar market cap.\n\n**How** r/wallstreetbets **Controls the Stock Market**\n\nThe one thing that’s interesting about all of this is r/wallstreebet’s unique position in being able to facilitate this weapon of mass financial destruction because\n\n1. Most rich people or institutions too risk adverse to buy large amounts of out of the money options (unless you're Chamath or Elon)\n2. This can only really happen on stocks that very few institutions (i.e. rich people) actually own, meaning it needs to be held / bought on mass by retail investors\n3. In any other scenario where 1 and 2 happen to be true, this would be classified as market manipulation and be immediately shut down by the SEC\n\n**My Positions**\n\nr/wallstreetbets veterans may recognize me as the 🌈🐻 who wrote those long-ass 2000 word essays about how the [stock market is in a bubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) and loaded up on VIX calls last time you heard from me. Although I still stand by my thesis and stocks like GME, TSLA, and NKLA is just proof that we've reached the euphoria phase of it, I learned my lesson that I'm idiot trying to short it (for exactly the reasons described above) and got the fuck out of my position when VIX shot up back in Sept.

{"title": "GME - Blackrock increasing positions into GME may be part of an overall strategy by the Shorts - GME", "selftext": "Just saw this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5lor7/blackrock\\_inc\\_just\\_increased\\_their\\_stake\\_in\\_gme/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5lor7/blackrock_inc_just_increased_their_stake_in_gme/)\n\n[Blackrock increases positions in GME](https://sec.report/Document/0000834237-21-001340/)\n\nHere's some observations for us autists on this. This is not as *bullish* as it seems. Why?\n\nWhen Passive funds get into a stock - there's evidence that they *usually* allow a significant portion of their position to be borrowed against (see below). By doing this, they extract returns from capital appreciation & interest from the Shorts. **For GME longs, this is bad in the sense that there is an increased amount of shares available to short.** \n\nIn my opinion, a big passive fund like Blackrock could care less about returns on 1 singular stock, so this brings up the question. **Why did Blackrock increase their positions?** \n\nProbably will get an answer like 'market cap increase led to increased size of tracked index, so we got in'. But this is some cookie cutter shit. What if they're working with the Shorts to increase borrowed supply? Funny how this happened in tandem with Melvin's capital infusion. \n\nIf someone less retarded than me were able to connect the dots, this looks like *fraud-ey* to me. Someone with more vested into GME should definitely look into this. This type of activity looks like the beginning of a wider onslaught by the Shorts ahead of this Friday's options expiry\n\nFor less autistic retards - index funds allowing their shares to borrowed, is in a weird way how they 'sell' their voting rights. **This actually happened to GME in the recent board meeting & it looks like the Shorts were trying to prevent Ryan Cohen & Co. from taking too many of the Board seats**:\n\n[See here for full post](https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2021/01/19/the-index-fund-dilemma-an-empirical-study-of-the-lending-voting-tradeoff/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+cls-blue-sky-blog+%28CLS+Blue+Sky+Blog%29)\n\n>We examine funds’ incentives through an empirical study of the lending-voting tradeoff after the Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2019 guidance on funds’ fiduciary duties. The guidance departed from prior practice by encouraging funds to take into account “opportunity costs” of share lending when making their voting decisions. In the past, SEC staff guidance required that funds recall shares they loaned when material items were on the ballot to ensure that voting would occur. ...  \n>  \n>More share lending means less voting – regardless of whether the shares are borrowed in the end. Because shares can be borrowed at-will from the lending agent or broker, and then voted by the ultimate holder as of the record date, shares put on loan do not carry voting instructions. Hence, shares made available for loan but not borrowed are not voted – making share lending a significant contributor to non-voting. By one estimate, in 2010 alone, 60 billion shares went unvoted, with 15 billion shares on loan.  \n>  \n>**With no fiduciary constraint on share lending, corporate elections can have surprising results. Most notably, in June of 2020, a proxy fight at GameStop surprised the investor and corporate community when activists with only 7.3 percent of shares won board seats despite opposition from large institutional investors that collectively owned around 40 percent of shares. This was possible because nearly 40 percent of GameStop shares (nearly all the shares held by institutions) were on loan, most of which were presumably borrowed by short sellers and other investors with goals contrary to the funds and similar long-term investors.**\n\nGodspeed retards **🚀**  **🚀 🚀** **GME 🚀** **🚀 🚀**", "id": "l5z6op", "created_utc": 1611732799.0, "score": 235, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "At the bottom of your post you're supposed to tell me what to do and then I do it.", "score": 402, "replies": [{"body": "Moar hedge funds are going to be serving up delicious tendies for us to eat, so come with a big appetite & invite moar retards to this tendie dinner party", "score": 159, "replies": [{"body": "So 💎🙌 got it", "score": 59, "replies": []}, {"body": "I come for breakfast tomorrow", "score": 20, "replies": []}, {"body": "Me like tendies", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "me like this stonk", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "10k share price MINIMUM", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "ELI5?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You take your allowance and go to the store to buy a Hot Wheels.

Maybe one of the Scumbag-Asshole-Cohert Trading Firms was doing just that?\n\n[On October 23, 2014, roughly a month after Melvin Capital is started by Gabe Plotkin, Donald Foss sells 430,967 shares of CACC trading at $125.54 for $54million.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000120919114064903/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) \nGamestop was trading at $34.  \n\n[On December 31 2014 Donald Foss reports using 320,000 shares valued at $44.8 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555015000021/fosssc13g20141231.htm)\n\nIn the 3rd quarter of 2015, Melvin Capital buys puts on GME. I don't have the value of puts in 2015, but in 2018 those puts were amounted to $17,395,000.   \n[On December 31 2015 Donald Foss reports using 570,000 shares valued at $114Million as collateral for a loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000088555016000086/fosssc13g20151231.htm)\n\n**In the 3rd Quarter of 2015, Gamestock shares crash 67% from $41 to $28** Most likely because of poor fundamentals.\n\nIn 2016 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC. 2015/2016 was a year of hot water for CACC. Game Stop barely moves trading the whole year from $28 - $25  \n\n[On December 31 2017 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $71.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420418008911/tv486077_sc13ga.htm)\nGamestop is now trading at $18\n\n[On December 31 2018 Donald Foss reports using 220,000 shares valued at $82.5 Million as collateral for a loan.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/885550/000114420419007123/tv513133_sc13ga.htm) \nGamestop is now trading at $12\n\nIn 2019 Donald Foss does not touch his shares of CACC.\n\n**In June 2019, u/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE opens $55,000 worth of 18 month Call options on GME**\n**In August 2019, Dr Michael Burry reports a significant purchase of GME**\n\n[On February 28, 2020, Donald Foss purchases 3,515,200 shares, a 5.3% ownership stake, of Gamestop for $14 Million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/901185/000110465920030651/tv538831_sc13g.htm) **Pure speculation, but Donald Foss most likely purchases this stake as he is a BIG FAN OF THE STOCK, out of every other stock on the market, this is the only one he has significantly invested into in the past 5 years.**\n[In 2020 Melvin Capital has puts amounted to $55,080,000.](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link). \nGamestop is trading at $4.\n\n[From March 2020 until July 2020 - Donald Foss begins liquidating 250,000 shares of his CACC to the tune of $95,207,250, in the most unprecedented manner from his holdings, all while CACC stock price is fluctuating all over the place due to Rona + Fed Kangaroo Markets. These payments were coming out every couple days in quantities of 6000 - 10000 shares.](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0000901185&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40) \n\n**Where is this fucking money going??? It would have been enough to buy another 24million shares *to try to* increase his total holding to 38 Million shares, or over 51% of the 69.75Million float**  \n\nIn August 2020, Gamestop hits $5. Data available to me and my will to keep typing is gone.  *Did Foss continue to liquidate CACC into August/Sept?*\n\nEveryone on the fucking planet knows where Gamestop is now.\n\nTODAY CACC MOVED *closely* IN LINE WITH GME ATTACKS.  CACC STOCK HAS NEVER BEEN DECLARED IN A  13F BY MELVIN CAPITAL.  CACC STOCK IS BEING USED AS A LOAN OR SOMETHING BY FOSS THOUGH.  MELVIN USED ALL HIS OTHER DECLARED STOCKS IN THE ATTACKS WITH HEAVY SELL VOLUMES PRECEDING PRICE BOMBS.\n\nWhy does this look like a hostile takeover play that took 5 fucking years and they fucked up?? Why wouldnt the guy that invested $14M thats now worth $750M talk to the media AT ALL? What the fuck does he want Gamestop for at 75 yrs old?! And it took 5 fucking years to execute?!\n\nTL;DR Did Deepfuckingvalue prevent a 5year vulture capitalism play? WTF?

The miners will benefit from the squeeze, but buying miners alone does nothing to actually beat the manipulating banks at their own game in silver.\n\nSo here’s how you do it:\n\nBuy SLV directly.  If you want options buy in the money or near the money to force true hedging (buying) by the market maker.  This is a very old and slower moving market than equities so unless you are buying leaps, SLV shares are the way to go anyways.  Alternatively, buy silver physically or even force delivery through purchasing futures if you are rich and can store it.  Physical silver purchases carry a premium over spot price though so you end up causing more physical silver to be purchased by simply buying SLV.\n\nBy purchasing SLV, more shares will be created and SLV will have to purchase massive amounts of physical silver to hold in their vaults because the etf has to remain backed by physical silver.\n\nSilver is a much larger market than GME, but the paper traded gold market is 100x the physical market.  If we force more physical purchase and delivery of silver, the paper traders will be required to buy it in real life and deliver it. Creating a positive feedback loop just like a short squeeze.\n\nLastly, the fundamental case is that government stimulus combined with fed money and reopening economy will cause inflation, and that government debt loads mean dollar debasement. Lest someone say we are manipulating the market (as big banks have literally been doing for decades). We like the stock!\n\nLet’s get GME to the moon and then park all of the winnings in SLV. Could take a couple of months to fully moon as delivery of silver takes time but it really could go to $1000 from $25.  If GME took down a single hedge fund, this would take down JPM.\n\nPlease share, it’s hard to break through right now\n\nPower and tendies to people!\n\nTLDR: don’t sell GME till over $1000 and then move it all to SLV and hold for 3+ months", "id": "l6fgbn", "created_utc": 1611784529.0, "score": 3483, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 442, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 391, "replies": [{"body": "What a great summary! \nYou covered the most important things.

It is was first spurted my drive to protect myself from the mess the bankers, political puppets, Federal Reserve, and politicians were creating.  A crisis historically weeds out bad players, players that make mistakes.  They should be left to go bust and let those who were disciplined take over.  But the suits got their bailouts at the expense of the US taxpayer.  Then the Federal Reserve big wigs spent years getting praised, like Bernanke being posed as a hero on the cover of the Atlantic.  That was so disgusting.  That continued with Yellen who after the completion of her term gets fees to make speeches from the likes of Citadel.  The only way you get paid such egregious fees from suits is because you did them a favor at some point and that’s their way of paying you back, quid pro quo.  All the while the money supply has been shooting up, and in particular, this year it has gone parabolic.  But government and the financial puffer tv networks come up with all sorts of apologist excuses, that the new money is parked and frozen as reserves at banks, that there is no inflation, and the suits even went as far as to manipulate the price of paper gold and silver for years.  The same apologists spent so much effort saying there was no manipulation when cascades of sell orders would get poured into the thinnest part of the trading day and night on the futures market.  Eventually the suits were charged with manipulation, but the fines are outrageously low.  As they say, a wrist slap.  \n\nLet’s forget the silver and gold paper manipulation for a second.  I want to focus on inflation and the overwhelming efforts of the government and suits to understate it in every way possible.  I think the one of the only few places you see no inflation and even deflation is for things like flat screen TVs.  Unfortunately, we can’t eat TVs or live in TVs.  It is in the government’s best interest to understate inflation as much as possible, it minimizes their fixed payment obligations, so they only make small upward adjustments to them every year (cost of living adjustments), instead of an appropriate adjustment measured by true inflation.  There are many numerical computational tricks the BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates inflation) use to understate inflation.  These are arbitrary examples, but I hope you get the point.  If the price of steak goes up, the BLS assumes you will substitute steak consumption by some cheaper meat or who knows what else.  They also make assumptions about many products whose price increases.  They make “hedonic adjustments” to say that the price increase gets offset in real terms because the product has actually gone up in quality.  That’s true for things like TVs and PCs, but not for most things.  Let’s also focus on some tricks implemented by Corporate American suits to help explain how they facilitate the rigging of inflation numbers.  I’ll focus on the grocery market, but it happens everywhere in the economy.  The term that I began to see coined at least 5-6 years ago was “shrinkflation”.  What this means is let’s say in a bag of potato chips, they’ll use less chips in the bag so it actually weights less but the price is the same.  Our government and others mentioned above will tell you there is no inflation.  To them the price stayed the same.  They are doing this with everything including toilet paper.  You get less sheets now in toilet paper than you used to.  The frozen pizza is smaller and comes with less cheese.  They do this little by little every year hoping none of you notice or complain.  The other infamous trick is “new and improved formula”.  This almost certainly assures you are getting worse lower quality ingredients than you used to.  \n\nI have to admit that for the last several years my spirits have been crushed.  I slowly stopped adding incremental positions.  At this point I’ve been laughed at for years by friends and family.\n\nI began following wallstreetbets last year around the time Palantir got popular.  I saw you all mobilize into GME but I didn’t take action.  Slowly I began to understand your cause.  We share the same bitterness for those that burned us in 2008 by selling us out to the suits.  But your generation has been burned the worst and I sympathize with your resentment.  A glimmer of hope arose when I began to see chatter of a silver squeeze.  Gold is also manipulated but it’s far less undervalued than silver.  \n\nI hope that this effort continues to gain momentum, but I do understand your current battle with GME so I’m not even going to tell anyone to bail on that battle to join the silver one.  It’s been over a decade war for me, so I don’t mind waiting a little longer.  But I think we’ve all reached a point where so many realize how bad the suits have screwed us all and we are tired of it.  \n\n \n\n“To achieve victory we must mass our forces at the hub of all power & movement.

For example, the ratio of ounces sold per day was running about two times earlier in the week and closer to four times the average demand by the end of the week. Once markets closed on Friday, we saw demand hit as much as six times a typical business day and more than 12 times a normal weekend day. Combined with the extremely high demand levels, we are also seeing a surge in new customers. On Saturday alone, we added as many new customers as we usually add in a week. \n\nAny Precious Metal dealer will take a long position in the futures market to protect against spot price exposure when the markets open. We do this because it is our goal not to take a speculative position on metal. The weekends are unique as we are not able to real-time hedge our position. We took an aggressive position this weekend, but clearly could not have predicted the volumes that were seen. We have partnerships around to world that allowed us to cover these long positions, but only to a point. Once we exceeded our comfort levels, we had little choice but to stop the sale of Silver on our website. This was a difficult decision to make and unprecedented in our history. \n\nAs we evaluate the markets, it is difficult to know where Silver's price and demand will go in the coming day and weeks. APMEX is highly capitalized and has more than $150 million in inventory to support demand. We have made strategic decisions to procure additional metal, locking up any metal we can find in the market place. We suspect premiums will rise and rise quickly, as we are seeing significant increases in our costs, when we can even locate the metal. It is also highly likely that we will need an additional day or two to fill orders based on current order counts. The one guarantee we can make to our customers is that you will only be sold metal that is on-site, or we have procured the metal with a firm commitment date from our partners. In markets like this, we feel this is the best approach a retailer can take, as no one can predict product availability.\n\nWe want to thank our customers for their patience and understanding during these turbulent times.

While many of these contracts have buyers who are speculators -- and are planning to trade out of the contracts, NOT taking delivery of physical silver -- the volume of contracts (which can increase if more people participate in the silver market, directly or through an ETF like SLV) could put the physical supply into a \"squeeze\" if physical delivery demands increase.  \nA short-squeeze in silver can't be \"resolved\" easily because the supplies of silver can't be increased easily -- mining is a slow process, taking many years to increase production.  \nOver 70% of silver demand comes from the industrial sector -- there is substantial growing demand in that area from solar power, and likely battery demand (search \"silver carbon anode\"), along with existing long-term (more stable) demands.

I worked for a precious metals depository. We had hundreds of retails clients storing everything from 1,000 oz silver bars to gold eagles, maple leafs, and krugerrands. It's been a long time, but IIRC, it was less than 1% of the value to store it each year, and the amount went down with larger size bars. I've seen other depositories offer a flat rate of $9.99/month, but I'm not sure what size deposits they will take. Armored cars, like Garda, do the transport. It's not super expensive to store. Although, a 1,000-oz silver bar is not polished at all, and just looks like a hunk of grey metal. You could probably leave them in pile in your garage, and no one would know what they are. \n\nJust so you know, a 1,000-oz silver bar is about 12x5x3 inches, and weighs about 65 lbs. A gold bar is even heavier!
