You're only better off selling the asset before and repurchasing it after the crash if its value ends up falling below either $400 - 0.15X($100) = $385 (long term)  or $400 - 0.22X($100) = $372 (short term). If it doesn't slide to that level, you can miss out on the potential upside of there being no crash or you can end up paying more in taxes than you earn by improving your cost basis.\n\nIf your asset value has depreciated, then you simply risk having to realize capital losses in exchange for the protection.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Your calculation is a bit off: Taxes will have to be paid eventually also if you don't sell.

They are an Electric Vehicle company who are fairly new which means they only have room to grow. With Biden being pro green energy, and we know the toxins gas vehicles give off affects the earth etc. the focus on electric vehicles will increase throughout his term due to that fact; not only that gas vehicles will eventually be a thing of the past anyway. Another reason why I foresee this company growing is because Tesla can not be the only Electric vehicle company running the show. The same way we have different gas powered vehicles, of all shapes and styles. There has to be that same variety in electric vehicles, so there is bond to be other competitors; XPENG being one of them. We can catch these new competitors now so when they do take off and become real competing force we would have already been invested now. They are sitting at 51.66$ per share, it not unrealistic for them to reach 80$ a share.

Robinhood (or any broker) makes money on margin by charging interest on anything you borrow. \n\nMany brokers will allow you to borrow margin at a rate of 1:2 to hold overnight. This means that if you have $10k, you can borrow a total of $10k margin. Just like any mob boss, Robinhood expects you to pay back the loan (go figure). If your account value drops below the margin maintenance requirement, they are at risk of losing their initial loan and will either issue a margin call or forcefully sell some of your assets to make back the loan. Most brokers will give you a couple of days to resolve a margin call before forcefully selling anything (assuming the value doesn't continue to drop).\n\nWhile the standard margin overnight borrow rate is 1:2, many brokers also allow you to borrow even higher ratios for day trading. TD Ameritrade offers day trade buying power at a 1:4 ratio. All of this additional margin must be sold at the end of each day (or you will again enter a margin call). \n\nStocks that are more volatile will have an additional margin concentration requirement. If a stock has a concentration requirement of 50% and you are using margin, you cannot invest more than 50% of your total portfolio into that stock without inflicting a margin call. \n\nMargin maintenance is recalculated at the start of each trading day. As long as your account value is above the new maintenance level when it is recalculated, then you will exit the calll... Although if you enter the call again that same day it might count as a continuation of the previous days call??\n\nOver the past few years I've entered margin calls only a handful of times. To avoid calls I make it a habit to only borrow a maximum of 75% of my margin balance and keep 50% of my portfolio in long term growth stocks (ones that don't have concentration requirements). This means that if I have a 1:2 ratio and $10k in my account, I will generally swingtrade 75% or $7.5k margin. This gives me a bit of a buffer incase my stocks decide to walk off a cliff that day.

Bled down to below $200 a share (preslplit) by early 2019.   Averaged down.    Then during the eventual run up I tried to time the market a couple times by trying to sell high and buy low.   One time i broke even.  The other time I lost 5 shares (pre split).   That is 25 shares more I would own today and I will let you figure out what that cost me.     In the end I realized trying to time the market was just like buying a lottery ticket.   For every time I am right I could be wrong.   Options are an area I looked into but for every story on here of someone making lots of money with them there are lose that lost lost.  So I have never really sued them.  Although I have been investigating ways of safely(ish) using them now that I have the position I have.\n\nIn the end I learned what kind of investor I am.    I decided that I have to fully believe in the long term prospects of the company to invest in or I will constantly second guess myself.  So I won't sell any now until I hit specific price targets or something fundamental changes in the company.   So on the COVID fall earlier this year I just held and deployed cash to buy more shares on the fall.    For me that turned out to be the correct path as I am sitting on a fairly massive gain and now a significant amount of shares.\n\nSo what I learned.   i need to have 100% conviction in the company I invest in to not deviate from my plan.   Sure I could have made more money but I also could have lost more.    Trying to time the market may work but it may not.    You cannot really lose just by holding if you think long term the company will be at X.   You just need to hold long enough.  So what I realized instead of trying buy a lotter ticket every share I had was a muck less risky lottery ticket that I just needed to give time to pay out.   And once you get to a sizeable gain sleeping at night is pretty easy even if you look and the stock and your position is down 50k for the day.    I know the next day it could pop 50k in a day.   When you have so much distance between you and your initial investment in gains it is easy to feel very comfortable because the stock price would have to hit something like $70 a share before my the actual money I invested would start to disappear.

PS5 sales topped 3.4 million units in the first 4 weeks. Sony has had to increase production by 50%!\n\n* TSM are trying to build new fabs asap to increase production of CPU's - Today they reported a 23% increase in profits.\n\n* PC shipments climb 13% in 2020, marking highest increase in a decade.\n \n* The gaming PC market is set to grow 25% by 2024\n\n* Intel's competitive advantage (their own fabs) is so useless that they are trying to buy space at the already full TSM fab. \n\n* Intel are 2-3 years behind AMD. \n\n* r/intel = 205,452 users, r/amd = 765,440 (hmmmmmm)\n\n* Lisa Su always delivers the promised numbers every quarter \n\nOh yeah, and mad lad **CRAMER** [just told everyone to load up during this buying opportunity.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/13/intel-shakeup-creates-buying-opportunity-in-amd-jim-cramer-says.html)\n\nRight now the boomers who don't understand the PC market are shorting AMD and buying up Intel just because it's the only name the recognise from the dinosaur age.

(Do you guys just hate making money or what?) WSB, in all its retarded wisdom, will not stop to see this thesis play through to its completion. Now, the whole world is watching this Infinity War play through, and you're at the wrong end of the $ROPE. You guys keep on gluing yourselves into a corner, and the bulls are about to go Muhammad Ali on your ass.** ***Even Jim fucking Cramer said it.***\n\n[\\\\\"\\[that is just\\] game over for the shorts ... when you have people shooting at it like this...\\\\\" -Jim Cramer\\*](https://preview.redd.it/8qyvkju65db61.jpg?width=592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2c076acbe36c2cf14497dc753e52de9b3da4bf4)\n\nLikewise, to my fellow GameStop/GME GANG BULLS: The longer we wait, the bigger our reward. **Let me explain.**\n\nLet's assume shorts haven't even covered yet (and many analysts say they haven't), then the bigger our initial investment capital to be multiplied to theoretical infinity, and that's not even counting our call options (juicy gamma squeeze, anyone?). Now, let's do some math.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n• Assume C(n) is 'zero point', prior to squeeze; where 'C' is initial capital, and 'n' is all the compounded multiplier *prior* to the deadly short squeeze. Basically, it's just your total capital multiplied by organic % growth. It's some king shit. Let's say that C(e) is ending capital. Remember the 'compound interest is king' worship on subs like r/investing? Well, my fellow retards, this is compound interest on fucking steroids so scientifically advanced it hasn't even been birthed yet.\n\n• Assume days-to-cover is about 6 as per avg. daily volume and number of shares shorted needing to be unwound, under a 100% of float shorted scenario (which, in our case, is actually 250%-300%+. Who knows how that shit plays out. (I like to play conservative: positive surprise is better than negative.)) (edit: some folks say that the average volume in the past few days has risen by 'x' amount. Might be true, but it could also die down to an averaged baseline since the volume spike was more organic buying imo. Also, consider that the *current* short % of float is **260.91%\\*\\*\\*\\*** as of writing (Yahoo! Finance, Dec. 20, 2020 data). That's good for Longs, *absolutely fucking terrifying* for shorts given current circumstances. Take from that as you will.)\n\n•Assume 50% increase in share price (SP) per day during short squeeze panic. (Even that's probably conservative, but, who knows. I'm not a fortune teller.)\n\nThen;\n\n**MOASS (conservative) Price Target (PT) = (SP)(1.5)\\^6**\n\n**and C(e) = C(n) x ((SP)(1.5)\\^6)/SP)**\n\nThink about that for a sec.\n\nNow, let's assume shorts will start to cover for their **goddamn souls** by **SP=$50**. Then;\n\n**Price Target (PT) = ($50)(1.5)\\^6**\n\n**Price Target (PT) = $569.53.\\*\\***\n\nLet's stagger this down to steps by change-per-day so it's easier to visualize, following above assumptions:\n\n>Day 0 (D0): $50 (+0%, zero point)  \n>  \n>Day 1 (D1): $75 (+50% from D0) = 1.5-bagger  \n>  \n>Day 2: $112.50 (+50% from D1) = 2-bagger  \n>  \n>Day 3: $168.50 (+50% from D2) = 3-bagger  \n>  \n>Day 4: $253.125 (+50% from D3) = 5-bagger  \n>  \n>Day 5: $379.6875 (+50% from D4) = 7-bagger  \n>  \n>Day 6: $569.53125 (+50% from D5) = 11-bagger\n\n**Literally an 11-bagger in a matter of 6 days by conservative day-over-day 'squeeze' growth estimates.** (edit: I'm adding a variation factor, or randomness factor as I want to call it, of +-$200 on the 11-bagger mark, just to cover our bases. I've read more on other people's MOASS PTs, and the 11-bagger seems to be on the upper end (I will not retract the PT though, and I am confident in the mathematical power of exponential compounding, esp. in this historical short squeeze data on GME). I enjoy the fact, however, that by consensus, we all agree on the whopping potential multiples this short squeeze can generate.**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***) (edit: There's been comments about the massive sell-walls at $420.69, hence, it could curtail any share price growth beyond that point. If it even reaches that point, that would be fucking hilarious. Even funnier at $694.20.)\n\n**$TSLA performance 1-yr to date is an 8-bagger.** (Shoutout to our TSLA brothers, we love you and shit. GME gang will join you in tendie-land soon.)\n\nThe legendary **VW Short Squeeze** was a little under 5-bagger over the course of several days, and even then,\n\n**I will quote DOMO Capital\\*\\*\\* on a recent example:**\n\n>it took [$APRN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24APRN&src=cashtag_click) 3-4 days to squeeze.  \n>  \n>Day 1: Up as high a 86%, closed up 68%  \n>  \n>Day 2: Up as high as 96% closed up 71%  \n>  \n>Day 3: Up as high as 198% closed up 148%  \n>  \n>Day 4: Up as high as 77% closed down 12%  \n>  \n>$2.25 to $28.84 at peak  \n>  \n>That was without >100% SI\n\n**You read that right. That was without >100% SI. And in this example, $APRN was a 13-bagger (+1281.77%) over the course of 3-4 days.** **Meanwhile, our hypothetical GME scenario above yielded an 11-bagger (+1100%) after 6 days, on (imo) conservative day-over-day short squeeze spikes of 50%.** I know that +1000%+ looks almost impossible on paper. Sure, maybe as an isolated, singular event. But stretch that over to multiple days with compounding interest overwhelmingly in your favor, and you can get there in no time (if you're still confused about that, re-read the visualized step-by-step change-per-day above). That's why you can have small initial capital amounts grow into millions of dollars after many years of passive investing, but, that's for r/investing to talk about.\n\n[+7&#37; YoY index investing growth until age 65? We don't do that here. 1000&#37;+ or bust bitch](https://preview.redd.it/hkz8itzf3db61.jpg?width=1046&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74375f3871fc0664f10d154d404a03eae1f6a339)\n\nGME right now is like a lottery ticket, where the statistical impossibility of winning it big has been replaced by the function probability of time, where time decay is in your favor; inversely proportional to shorts. They have to cover eventually, and the water boils hot by the second. \n\nWhat catalysts can be 'surpriseful' enough to lead shorts to cover to their deaths, you might ask? Who knows. What I do know, however, and something which has NOW BEEN PROVEN to be validated by (at the very least) recent price action alone, is that sweet sugar daddy Ryan Cohen and our CHWY daddies Alan Attal and Jim Grube *know what they're doing.* Who knows what kind of walls they'll be breaking in these coming days, weeks, or months. And each and any of them can become the flashy red nuclear button to send this bitch running. (edit: Jim Cramer had a segment on Mad Money today about the ripe-ness of GME to fucking SQUEEZE INTO MOASS.\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* You read that right: GME + MOASS potential + CRAMER. He also seems to love WSB, and probably jacks off to our gains. Hi Cramer! See link below: thanks to u/CPTHubbard for sharing the link.)\n\nThen again, I might be retarded as fuck, take these assumptions with a grain of salt. Long live WSB, and long live GME gang.\n\n**Bonus:** \"but u/fieryskyes, how do I know when the tip has topped?\"\n\n*My* answer: Who knows. Feel free to set yourself a limit sell, or not. Just remember that MM's and many other advanced traders can see your limit sells (e.g. $420.69) via Level II data. If (and that's an if) and when the MOASS starts to happen, you will know. WSB will be going apeshit about it. With regards to my own *personal* strategy, I'll be watching the price spike *actively* over the span of the days it squeezes. No limit sell, no stop loss.. I'd rather see the price peak to the highest peak, knowing it has maxed out, and then catch it as it freefalls, than SELLING too early without having even seen the peak yet. Seeing the glorious green dildo peak is ejaculatory enough for me, and I'll be ready to unwind shortly \\[pun intended\\] as it falls. *But then again,* that's just my personal preference on the play. There could be better plays, in which I'd be open to exploring.\n\n**TL;DR: Under the assumptions written above, GME MOASS Price Target is potentially an 11-bagger on conservative estimates over a 6-day period, and the short squeeze (reportedly) hasn't even begun yet. GME right now is like a lottery ticket, where the statistical impossibility of winning it big has been replaced by the function probability of time, where time decay is in your favor; inversely proportional to shorts.

{"title": "WSB Declares Independence", "selftext": "**IN CONGRESS, JANUARY 14, 2021**\n\nWhen, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one group of traders to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, a decent respect to the opinions of Mad Money and other boomers requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. \n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all autists are created *superior*, that they are endowed by Ryan Cohen and u/deepfuckingvalue with certain unalienable rights, that among these are gamma squeezes, yolos, and the pursuit of Tendies. That to secure these rights, subs are instituted amongst autists, deriving their reetard strength from the consent of Papas Musk, Karp, Cohen, and Cathy. That whenever Wall Street institutions and other boomers become destructive to these ends, it is the RIGHT of the reetards to alter or destroy them, and to institute new management of the market. \n\nThe history of the present market makers and whales is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute TYRANNY over WSB and the autistic everywhere. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. \n\n* Market elites have instituted day trading restrictions, harming our abilities to harness rapid moves of the market to our advantage \n* They have infiltrated our sub and kept among us in times of peace, lurkers and FUDders to spread discord \n* They have excited boomers against us, and have endeavored to bring upon reetards the merciless SEC savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all autistic savants, from god-king Musk, to the imprisoned Prince Shkreli\n* They have declared our sacred meme stocks \"casinos\" \n* They have deliberately lowered price targets when they lose the market advantage to harm retail\n* They have limited our abilities to lose our own money, by passing through edict accredited investor limits, putting pressure on Robinhood to halt options approval, and putting a false focus on rIsK mAnAgEmEnT departments\n* They have demonized retail traders for the volatility of the market, ignoring the true culprit of monetary debasement and failure to impose stress tests on the market and its participants\n* They have imposed taxes on us without our consent\n\nIn every stage of these ruthless and evil actions, we have petitioned Cramer and the hotties on MSNBC for redress in the most humble of terms. Our repeated petitions have only been met with repeated restrictions and condescension. \n\nNor have we been wanting in attentions to our Boomer \"brethren.\" We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their \"smart\" and \"learned\" government, brokers, and accountants to manipulate the market in favor of the connected and the whales. They did not listen. We warned them of paradigm shifts in AMD, Tesla, and Gamestop. THEY HAVE BEEN DEAF TO THE *SCREECHING REEEEES* OF AUTISTIC REASON. We must therefore hold them as we hold the whales and market makers, Enemies in trading, in after hours, friends. \n\nWall street can keep their price targets, their analysts, their rules, and their high frequency trading. They can keep their DCFs, their balance sheets, and their provincial focus on rEvEnUe and p/e ratios. Where WSB is going, we have no use for these archaic and backwards millstones, hung around the neck of wage-slave boomers like heavy stones. \n\nWe, therefore, THE UNITED REETARDS AND AUTISTS OF WALL STREET BETS, in general congress, assembled, appealing to the mother of all short squeezes, do, in the name of and by the authority granted by our green dildos, solemnly publish and declare, that these members are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT TRADERS, that we are absolved from all power and control from the big banks, Wall Street analysts, and boomer talking heads.

{"title": "GME - Short interest, dip (nope), Maths, Buying, FOMO 🚀🌙🙏🏼 - We are better at being irrational than Melvin is at being solvent.", "selftext": "Rocket 🚀 \nMoon 🌙 \nSqueeze 🙏🏼\n\n\nWe are so dumb, we’re right about this.  If you’ve read anything on this sub, you know we can be irrational.  \n\n\nIf you know anything about investing, you know the markets can be irrational longer than investors can remain solvent.  \n\n\nWell guys, we’re the most irrational I’ve ever seen.  And we’re friggin good at it.  \n*Ain’t no way anyone can out solvent our irrationality*\n\n\nBut if you don’t believe me, here’s some actually talking points:  \n\n\nGME is Not dipping.  The math just isn’t there.  This is not a normal rally/hype.  It was a momentum thing.  It’s now becoming a squeeze within the next week.  \n\n\nThis doubling in under 48hrs has made all shorts unprofitable.  It doesn’t matter where they entered.  \n\n\nShort seller’s peak profit happens if a stock goes to $0.  No one expects GME to be at $0 even in the next few years.  But assuming it could a month from now, let’s do the maths. \n\n\nMost shorts got in around $15 or less.  That means the most they can make is $15, **IF** GME goes to $0 (it won’t). \n\n\nNow any time you borrow anything, you have to pay interest on it, this includes shares.  The current interest rate is 45% (or higher).  The interest is on the price of the current shares, not the price they bought in at.  \n\n\nThis means on a share price of $40, they are paying nearly $0.06 a day to short it.  Doesn’t sound too expensive right? Until you realize that in less than 28 days (if they allow it compound), they will have paid more in interest than they could ever gain, even if GME went to $0 in February. \n\n\nKeep in mind, once a short seller realizes it is literally impossible to make money, they just need to time their exit.  Since this is a stampede of short sellers, the best time to exit is right away.  They literally can’t wait 3 weeks, or else they might as well quite a few more dollars a share (from the interest they’re going to accrue).  \n\n\nKeep in mind, this is all voluntary covering.  There are also tons of accounts out there that will now have to cover due to margin calls and such.  \n\n\nKeep in mind that 71 million shares are shorted.  That’s more than are technically available.  \n\n\nKeep in mind that 20% of shares are locked up by Cohen &amp; such, who cannot sell for a few more months.  So that leaves even less shares for the shorts.  \n\n\nOnce most of the shorts cover (within 3 weeks), the price won’t drop overnight.  They have to buy more shares than available and anyone left holding shorts will still be buying.  And by that time, a new base &amp; support level should have been established.  \n\n\n*****\nThinking of FOMOing? You should be fine with shares.  Still could see upside of 50%+ \n*****\nI recommend buying shares, cause IV is crazy high and if MM somehow finds a way to eff with people, they will.  Sometimes they are smarter than me (but hey, that’s their job, I’m just an idiot). \n*****\n\n\nPositions: \n\n104 shares @ $20.15\nSold $22 call (much regret, didn’t know squeeze would happen so soon, I’m an idiot)\nBought $38c 1/15exp \nHope to add shares tomorrow morning &amp; maybe a call for next Friday.
