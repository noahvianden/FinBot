Even people close to retirement shouldn't get fazed by a correction. \n\nFollow the economic (business) cycle, listen to what the experts are saying about it, and don't let a short term dip in the market cause you long term problems by panicking and selling at the bottom.

I think it this is a suitable topic to add my newbie question to:  \n\n\nA:  For a stock that you have a lot of confidence in, and are prepared to invest long term in.  Do you periodically sell and re-buy these stocks, to reap the rewards of the growth, or would you hold until they have reach their maximum potential?  I can see the forma a good strategy for a young fast growing stock, but for an established long term stock like Microsoft, their growth potential is on going and for the long-long term has undetermined growth potential.  What are your strategies in these cases?  \n\n\nB: I ask my first question, because if the 'BIG CRASH' happens, and you have long term growth with the latter strategy, with  I don't know say 15-20% in the green and you haven't sold. It could all disappear turn in to 15-20% in the red.

You may not ever be able to buy it at a cheaper price. It is certainly weird to speculate that the stock(that you believe in) will go down soon, and for that reason you are selling it. Just hold and maybe buy more when you think its low.\n\nB: if you invested for the long term(lets say for example tesla in 2010), you wouldn’t get scared of some ‘crash’ because tesla for the long term is great. Ofcourse when you invested all your money in it(this is money you don’t need for day to day things ofcourse) it is hard to buy the dip. 2 options: one, just wait and let you wealth increase back up again, or two, have some backup money to use when you ever get in this kind of situation.\n\nYou got to believe in long term profit, or else it is all for nothing\n\nEdit: sell your investment when you are happy with the profit, no man ever got poor by selling at a profit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "thanks for the quick response.   \n\n\n I see what you are getting at.

I try to find stocks that have a price to book ratio that is below their median p/b ratio as well as compared to their industry peers. Tech companies have P/ZM. Ratios that are like 30-50 whereas energy stocks are around a 1-4 ratio. Container and oil tank companies seem to have a P/B ratio of 1.0. \n\nMetrics and fundamentals aren’t popular these days but they are relevant. Lot of people have a favorite but I think you need to cross check each one with another to give it a reality check. Old timers like PE ratios under 20 to show something is undervalued. PE ratios cash be misleading since they don’t take into account future upside of a growth stock or a disrupter. P/B ratio on the other hand is useful in determine if a stock is historically undervalued or overvalued compared to previous P/B ratios it was trading at. For example lets look at Occidental. In September it’s book value was $22 a share but it’s stock price was around $10. Giving it a P/B of .5. In 2019 it traded most of the year around it’s book value which is common for an energy stock paying dividends. So with this historical information and verifying the book value looking at their quarterly financials we can theorize that the stock has the potential to get into the $20s. Now given the world happening around it with oil prices we want to make sure they were trending in the right direction as well which they started to do.  \n\nNow if you check the price of OXY today its in the low $20s so our theory panned out. Energy stocks are pretty easy to evaluate compared to other companies where a lot of the value is brand and IP.  The idea with OXY was it should at least get back to half of what it was worth given how much it was oversold. As for a long term holding of it given the current political environment it’s sex appeal will be limited going forward but the world still needs oil and if oil prices go higher OXY’s financials might improve and we can check in on the P/B ratio again and see what’s going on. \n\nI did the same kind of analysis for coal stocks such as ARLP and ARCH. Actually ARCH I tested the theory out and bought like 10 shares just to keep track of it and did well on it so I bought more. Then it ebbed and flowed with the COVID news cycle (up on vaccine news, down on lockdown news, etc.) \n\nPEG ratio serves as good reality check to your hypothesis in looking at a stock. If it’s over 1 you might want to start with a smaller position see how it goes. \n\nFor stocks that are still off their pre-COVID highs a long play could be profitable if they’re fundamental business prospects haven’t changed such as the case with a lot of the tech companies. \n\nNow that’s not to say fundamentals are all knowing. No fundamental would have given you TSLA or PLUG or any of those. Sometimes you just gotta take a risk and gamble on the people running a company that can disrupt. I drove a Tesla starting last year so I bought Tesla stock, it was literally that stupid simple for me. This is actually my wife’s method of investing, she buys everyday things she uses and never sells them. Pretty sure we have similar returns so your mileage will vary. I sold my Tesla stock end of July because I said to myself if you can’t walk away with a 500% profit in a year you shouldn’t be investing lol. \n\nFundamentals are good at companies with revenue and enough data to identify a trend with (year over year growth, etc). \n\nHope I didn’t ramble on and that answered your question!", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "KO or O", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ah yes.

So far I have found 3X to be the \"sweet spot\" between leverage and risk for wiping it all out. More than 3X would imply day trading, as risk of wipeout would be huge. I have a timeline on this from two weeks to 6 months usually. This assumes you can stomach losing the position at worst case. The leveraged product takes 0.01% of  the position as a fee every day. This would be about 0,1% in 10 days, or 1% in 100 days (excluding compounding effects and loss of potential gains). 2X does IMO have too weak ratio between extended potential gains and the risk of losing double the money if there is a significant downwards correction in price, and regular shares would be more preferable. Guess I have a preference for \"all or nothing\" kind of bets (in my side investments where I'm OK to lose it all) rather than medium risk medium reward style scenarios.\n\nAs for the risk of wiping out the position at 3X- I cannot remember Tesla has dipped 33% or more in one day ever, but from memory I also recall that Tesla dipped about 22% one of the days in the big sell off last year (dipping from about 550 til 380 presplit in a couple off days.\n\nIt might also have happened one of the days (intraday) within the spike to 900 presplit (right before the 'rona, 2020) when it tanked to 300 presplit levels in short time. So that might have triggered a \"wipeout\", depending on stock price levels at start of day and end of day.\n\nSo, my feeling is: I can assume about 30% risk of losing it all within next 6 months. I will adjust size of position accordingly.\n\nThe amazing thing about this product is how well it fits with projected growth of Tesla, and the compounding effect it offers with the daily 3x multiplier (reset daily).\n\nIMO, this is an underrated product for investors who are solid in the green, can stocmach a potential loss, and have a bull perspective the next 6 months (or trying to time the marked based on research).\n\nSo far I have made a few thousand usd on this as a side project to spice things up.

{"title": "$BB long boi", "selftext": "\n\nPosition:194 shares at $19.28\n\n\nDisclaimer: I started trading this January and my views are purely informational and I do not condone anyone making financial/trading decisions based on this post. Don’t be a retard and do your DD before you trade. This is a bullish take on BB and may have some holes in it.\n\n\n\nSo I have been watching BB for a while now and feel the company is undervalued. Forgive me as I have not made a DD post before, I failed English in high school, and I am typing this up on my phone.\n\n\nBB originally caught my attention because it struck me that it survived being primarily a phone company and shifted its business to its cyber security and other software. I Put it on my watch list to swing it a little bit and recently sold 140 shares at $11.\n\n\nSeeing the price go up and the volume I decided I would jump back in since the trend analysis looked pretty good. Bought in at 19.28 and it almost immediately crashed, I suspect likely due to the pullback the whole market had this morning with stimulus talks being delayed and people taking profits.\n\n\nCanada Halts trading today due to the volatility followed by BB making a statement in response basically saying idk why investors are buying up the stock we haven’t made any announcements \nTrading resumes and the price rises back up beyond open in AH, closing at nearly 20 dollars.\n\nTHEN as you have already probably seen, BB announces partnership with Baidu - coincidence? Probably not, investors probably coaxed that information out of them and they likely didn’t want to get caught in some insider trading schenangians. \n\nSpeculation for tomorrow: BB Will open strong and meet or exceed the 40% growth of today since it just got that huge news. Baidu is Chinese google, and they partnered with BB since they need a operating system platform to mass produce their maps software in autonomous/ev vehicles with their partner GAC. Now this is a lot of China talk but BB is headquartered in CANADA which is much friendlier in regards to trade than the U.S.\n\n\nA little bit of information about GAC, they are a Chinese automotive giant that has came to the United States National Automobile Dealers association expos begging for investors, however has not had much success since the last 4 years have not been good for U.S. and China Trade.\n\n\nThe LONG game: Once our new administration warms up to China after those in charge of trade take their cuts, (and they will because history repeats itself, but right now the bear case would be that Biden is not looking to change tariffs on China, playing tough until he gets some leverage is what I think is really going on) GAC will have lots of opportunity to start putting their vehicles on our roads. \nGAC is the highest rated car brand in China so it may have a chance in the United States if it plays its cards right, which means we could have Blackberry powered Autonomous EVs on our streets in the next 5 years. That in conjunction with Amazon partnership in their future autonomous ev ventures means this company is making a major comeback and is aligned with the right companies to potentially be a major player.\n\nThis company has a lot of value in our up and coming future of Electric and Autonomous vehicles.\n\nI am too new to this to speculate on where this stock should be valued at, but here are some resources where I got my information so you can decide for yourself:\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackberry-stocks-idUSKBN29U28L\n\n\nhttps://www.autodeal.com.ph/articles/car-features/10-things-you-need-know-about-gac-motor\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/blackberry-expands-partnership-baidu-power-020000067.html\n\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-beijing-global-trade-22f525e41676d4e6abf96f3ca9255d15\n\n\nEdit: Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nEdit2: Looks like I was a little overzealous for today’s speculation  overlooking the fact that other people want this thing to tank back down to buy in with less risk, RBC downgraded their rating today and there have been millions of dollars worth of buy orders in the sub 18$ range.

Now for those of you in the bread line or living at your wife's mothers house playing [r/DnD](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/) with her boyfriend, board changes are big news. These board members have the power to make multiple grown men cry, fire CEOs like it's nothing and change a companies strategy sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.\n\nWith Papa Cohen coming onboard and his squad of Chewy troopers, it's likely that we are going to soon see a pimped out GameStop that will make you name your first born \"GME\". Now I'll let you do your own digging and reading but here's just some of the GME DD on it's future potential [(link to DD on some of GME's possible pivots](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/), [One DD to rule them all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The squeeze has NOT been squoze:\n\nThere is still time for you to convince your wife's girlfriend to lend you money to buy GME. The squeeze has not been squoze and likely wont until we see the type of eruption that accompanied [r/belledelphineXmas](https://www.reddit.com/r/belledelphineXmas/) leaks (yes that sub is NSFW).\n\nSide note on the Squeeze, GME is still massively over shorted at estimates from 130-300% and counting. The important thing to know is that these greedy bastards took multiple short positions on a single stock (naked) and essentially bet that GME was going to go down.\n\n[https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today) (249.67% Shorted)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But what happened on Thursday/Friday?**\n\nGamma squeeze. Short and simple. Now you can read some other DD about what a gamma squeeze so I wont dive into it too much.\n\nIt was not the squeeze. Market makers needed to rush to fill calls that were In The Money. This prompted these market makers to buy up stock in the off chance that they needed to actually sell them to degens who were actually betting that GME would blow it's sweet load at 60 and now at 150 lolz. This pared with the low stock volume on the market makes for high volitility on a per stock basis. Here's some [DD links talking about what a Gamma squeeze what we witnessed was that.](https://nope-its-lily.medium.com/gamestop-power-to-the-market-players-part-2-6ef00eff1d26)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ok MallCop2020, but when will it Squeeze?** *(when it does squeeze it may squeeze multiple times)*\n\nThanks to fellow autist [u/tsukune\\_surprise](https://www.reddit.com/u/tsukune_surprise/) *(and no, CNBC I don't even know this person - they could be a robot or even a fucking dog with a cybor implant IDK!)* BUT I love their DD for the MOASS [(Mother of All Short Squeeze)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4bnfr/moatadd_for_the_moass_there_will_be_more_than_one/). Short answer is that it could be this week, could be next but it's hard to say when the big banks are using dirty tricks like naked call ladders, actual bail outs lolz. (*Fresh DD from another internet stranger on* [*GME EndGame Part 3)*](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l528pz/gme_endgame_part_3_a_new_opponent_enters_the_ring/)\n\n>EVERY SINGLE indicator shows massive upward momentum on GME.  \n>  \n>GME momentum is going to create a massive upward feedback loop. The combination of options gamma squeeze, available float, and short interest makes it impossible for shorters to escape.  \n>  \n>Normally, shorters deep underwater could hedge their losses by buying call options.  \n>  \n>But buying call options decreases the float and the only tightens the squeeze. It’s like fighting against quicksand for the shorters.  \n>  \n>This GME squeeze is going to be historic because of the compounding effect of options and short interest.  \n>  \n>This could be bigger than the VW/Porsche infinity squeeze. But it’s completely different from VW – so don’t draw too many comparisons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Okay, I've asked my wife's girlfriend nicely and now have $1k...**\n\nBuy fucking shares. No legit, support your random internet brethren *(who don't know each other)* and buy shares of GameStop. Every share you buy bleeds money from Citron and Melvin.\n\nHere's an explanation from [u/robert1032010](https://www.reddit.com/u/robert1032010/) a Hedge Fund Manager on the current short position within GME: [(A hedge fund managers perspective on GME)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/)\n\n>The short positions of this issue appears (although I can't be certain) to exceed 100% with all available shares already lent out from marginal accounts and probably a lot of naked shorting going on as well. Although I don't yet have the current data on todays short position, I can say for certain the stock remains very heavily shorter, perhaps more so now than at any previous time. Today, I called my broker asking about the availability of shares to short and the borrow costs. We have one of the larger accounts at our brokers firm and I was able to speak directly to the \"hard to borrow\" desk. No borrowable shares are available at any broker, anywhere, at this time, even for high borrow costs or even from other brokers. This extreme short against a small common float, made more extreme no-doubt by naked shorting, could end very poorly for those short this issue. As they are forced to close out their positions, the stock will continue to rise and continue to exacerbate the positive effects the rising price has on the above 4 issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, this is not financial advice; do your own DD. I'm holding $20k at $100/share and yes, I still fucking believe that the tendieman will come and rain tendies.\n\n**Oblig:**\n\n💎🙌 = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "id": "l5gv9p", "created_utc": 1611676746.0, "score": 1547, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 189, "comments": [{"body": "Holding at $156.97.

I've got quite the story to tell you all. Now, this isn't my story, but the story of a little company called Microvision (MVIS).\n\n**Skip to the competition section for the smooth brain logic on why we will 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**\n\n**DISCLAIMER: AM AS RETARDED AS YOU ALL. I used every last brain cell I have to write this DD so we can all enjoy tendies once we moon** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 **POSITIONS AT BOTTOM**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A LOT of this DD has been done by people that are way smarter than I over at** [r/MVIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/)\\*\\*. Those saints have an unreal DD that I will link\\*\\* [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/geaykw/dd_for_new_investors_crash_course_in_mvis/) **and a 'Best of MVIS' thread** [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/hrihan/the_best_of_rmvis_meta_thread/)**. Most of us here don't know how to read so I will take that DD and make this as simple as possible. Here are some facts...**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FACT - Microvision is best in class (LiDAR, MEMS, etc.)\n\nThis is another FACT. Microvision's LiDAR is the **BEST IN CLASS. See the image below for a comparison between the competition. This ALONE MEANS THEY ARE MASSIVELY UNDERVALUED.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Clearly, they are BEST IN CLASS](https://preview.redd.it/14zt6mmxgpd61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=c60f7170a195aafced5a0f60255a2dfc832e5b85)\n\nFrom the chart above, clearly, they have the best LiDAR! **NOT ONLY ARE THE SPECS BETTER BUT THEIR A-SAMPLE IS GOING TO BE SHOWN OFF AROUND APRIL.** More than that, **THEY WILL BE READY FOR PRODUCTION GOING INTO THE FALL OF THIS YEAR!!** Which also makes them **FIRST TO MARKET** with a product like their LiDAR.\n\n**TL:DR - MVIS IS BEST IN CLASS LIDAR** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FACT - Microvisions MEMS display hardware is used by Microsoft in the Hololens 2 and [IVAS](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k9ge4v/defense_bill_clears_house_with_vetoproof_majority/) ([BAD.ASS.](https://old.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k45io6/ivas_photo_80deg_horz_fov_waveguides_in_action/))\n\nThis isn't opinion, it is a simple fact. Those at Microvision and Microsoft will not actually acknowledge this fact, rumor is because they've been under an NDA for the last year or so. Every time either company is asked, they seem to deflect and name every other company like MVIS but not actually MVIS. WELL, [u/s2upid](https://www.reddit.com/u/s2upid/) over from [r/MVIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/) decided to take matters into his own hands. This many dropped $3,000 last spring just so he could DESTROY the device and find those pesky MVIS chips inside. [Looks like he found what he was looking for.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/gm1i2f/hololens_2_teardown_the_hunt_for_mvis/) This begs the question, why is this partnership so secretive? Well, the major rumor floating around right now is a **buyout from Microsoft.** Them being so secretive makes sense as MVIS has the best in class MEMS (and LiDAR), and it would make sense they don't want to get into a bidding war.\n\nPS. Microsoft also has a US government contract to supply the military with modified Hololens 2s called IVIS which are purposely modified and geared toward military use and operations.\n\n**US Gov contracts = $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$**\n\n**TL:DR - POTENTIAL MSFT BUYOUT**🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FACT - Microvisions isn't only LiDAR and MEMS\n\nThe fact here is that MVIS has **FIVE** potential verticals they can sell!\n\n* Display only devices\n* Interactive devices\n* NED devices\n* Consumer LiDAR\n* Auto LiDAR\n\nI'm not sure how many of you can even read this many words in a year. Who the hell knows the potential of these verticals. Or what hardware is in each one. Or the cross-vertical applications of the hardware. My brain is short-circuiting even trying to think of words to think about this thought.\n\n**TL:DR -** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Okay, this is getting long so let me wrap up with the most important point...\n\n# MVIS Competition\n\nSo far the two main competitors for Microvisions LiDAR are looking like **Luminar (LAZR)** and **Velodyne (VLDR). Let's look at some simple numbers.**\n\n**Luminar (LAZR)**\n\n* **Stock Price - $37.45**\n* **Market Cap - 12.13B**\n* **Float - 177.19M**\n* **Shares outstanding - 218.82M**\n\n**Velodyne (VLDR)**\n\n* **Stock Price - $23.53**\n* **Market Cap - 3.97B**\n* **Float - 55.52M**\n* **Shares Outstanding - 168.71M**\n\n**Wow!** Look at those market caps! Now let's see how Microvision compares...\n\n**Microvision (MVIS)**\n\n* **Stock Price - $7.25**\n* **Market Cap - 1.097B**\n* **Float - 145.69M**\n* **Shares outstanding - 151.31M**\n\n# WAIT A SECOND! I THOUGHT YOU SAID MICROVISION WAS BEST IN CLASS?!!?!?!?!?!?!??! WHY DO THEY HAVE NO MARKET CAP?!?!?!?!?\n\nWell fellow autists, this is where the undervaluation comes into play. **LAZR**, who just started talking about LiDAR and aren't anywhere close to where **MVIS** is, is valued at **12x the valuation of MVIS**. **Yet, MVIS has the best in class LiDAR, first to market, and FOUR OTHER VERTICALS BESIDES LiDAR. Same with VLDR, trading at 4x MVIS with only the LiDAR vertical.**\n\n**This is where the play becomes really juicy.** Let's play with some valuation numbers. If Microvision is even **CLOSE** to delivering on their LiDAR promises, shouldn't they be valued at **AT LEAST VLDR?** Well, let's play and see how that works out...\n\n**Let's work with $7 as each billion in valuation for MVIS,** VLDR is 4B which is 4x MVIS. **So $7 per billion \\* 4 = $28 stock price**. Keep in mind, this isn't even them being best in class, this is just average for **ONE VERTICAL.**\n\n**So let's work it with a LAZR valuation, which is 12x MVIS currently. So $7 per billion \\* 12 = $84 stock price! AND THAT IS STILL ONLY ONE VERTICAL!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI wonder how many of you even made it this far. Probably no one so just remember **MVIS actual valuation should be 4-12x what it currently is! So many tendies.** I'll link in a few more DDs if anyone is interested in reading a bit more in-depth.

Bought calls on everything tech, FB, AMD, SE, NVDA, PTON, FSLY, etc, etc. Started to find that \"money was so easy to make\" and even took out bank loans.\n\n**August 2020** \\- Indices rally all day everyday, stonks only go up, earnings always beat and stonks rally, made $175k in only 3/4 months.\n\n**September 2020** \\- Crashed hard for 3 days, and due to poor risk management with absolutely ZERO take profit / stop losses, watched ALL my tech calls bleed into oblivion. Profit got wiped out and I was literally back at breakeven. Wasted 4/5 months of my time, had no job, and was in debt. Went into semi-depression.\n\n**October 2020** \\- Figured I had to find get my money back, all I needed was just ONE good play to go all-in, and I would recover. Or at least that's what I told myself. Found this guy NoProblemChanging who seemed to be really accurate at predicting the markets - literally followed the advice of a stranger on WSB and went all in on puts due to his bearish views and certainty that the market was going to crash.\n\n**November 2020** \\- As we all know, everyone was expecting elections to be a shitshow but vaccine news rallied the markets with multiple gap ups and stuff. **By now I was already down $100k and was depressed. Imagine having made easy money ($175k in 4 months) in the greatest bull market of all time, only to lose it all in 3 days and even going negative, while seeing every stonk around me go up everyday while my puts bled all day. Not going to lie, at this moment I felt like $ROPEing although logically I know $100k is money that can still be earned back.**\n\nI was so desperate at this moment that I HAD to find something that I could ALL IN and GUARANTEED to make money. Then, I found $GME. I found u/DeepFuckingValue and that's when I climbed into the rabbit hole, knowing it was a fundamentally undervalued company. Bought around $15\\~. Huge credit to GMEShortSqueeze and u/Uberkikz11 as well.\n\n**December 2020** \\- By this time, I was pretty much already all in $GME but I hedged with CCs / sold some of my calls WAY TOO EARLY. **To put it into perspective, if I didn't touch my positions at all until today, I would have been around $3m, but as of now I'm only around $1.4m. Regardless, I am grateful!**\n\n**January 2021** \\- I've joined the 2 comma club officially! Finally hit my milestone.\n\n**TLDR; made easy money on the rally after COVID in 4 months, lost it all in 3 days due to poor risk management and even went negative, briefly experienced depression and felt like $ROPEing, found a good company $GME, went all in with conviction, emerged stronger than ever.  💎🙌  🚀 🚀 🚀  🚀 🚀 🚀  If I can do it, so can you.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c6s7m64beud61.jpg?width=1550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f7cff97e8b2c14e334c2ff2c9e5ee6da0ecac82\n\nEdit: positions 8000 shares and 100++ calls at the beginning.

Sometimes, we realize this because we have sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or feelings of intense attraction toward people of the same gender as us. However, none of those things — sex dreams, sexual thoughts, or even feelings of intense attraction — necessarily “prove” your orientation. There are a few different forms of attraction. When it comes to orientation, we usually refer to romantic attraction (who you have strong romantic feelings for and desire a romantic relationship with) and sexual attraction (who you want to engage in sexual activity with). Sometimes we’re romantically and sexually attracted to the same groups of people. Sometimes we’re not.
