I assume you know what options are and how they work already.\n\nImagine that you sell a 140 call and buy a 145 call. The 145 call is cheaper than the 140 call, so you come out ahead. If the stock goes above $145 and the 140 call is exercised against you, you can buy the shares for $145 each; max loss in that case is $5 per share, offset by the premium you received at the beginning.\n\nLet's talk this out with current numbers. 2/19 145c is going for $2.75 and 2/19 140c is going for $1.87. If you write and buy one contract (for 100 shares), you put up $500 as collateral and receive $88 premium. Max gain is $88, or 17.6%. Max loss: $500 - $88 = $412, or 82.4%.\n\nPros:\n\n* 17.6% potential profit in 44 days.\n\n* Max loss is capped at 82.4%.\n\n* You profit when the stock drops or stays about the same. If you know that it will drop or stay about the same, you know that you will profit.\n\nCons:\n\n* Very risky. 2/19 140c has a delta of .277, which is a rough estimate of the chance of it expiring in the money. In other words, there's *about* a 27.7% chance of getting assigned on the 140c.\n\n* Max loss happens when the stock's value is over $145 and you're assigned on the 140c. That 145c's delta is about 0.198. There's *about* a 19.8% chance that you realize your max loss on the spread. Since that's higher than the potential gain, the gains aren't worth the risk unless you have some kind of evidence that the market hasn't priced in that the stock will drop.\n\nInteresting stuff. I *love* spreads. Even though this particular example doesn't show good profits compared to the risks, there are many that do. You can do spreads with calls or with puts. You can sell them (like we talked through) or buy them and be in the reverse of the situation.

In other words, calls with lower strikes and puts with higher strikes have higher deltas. Delta also becomes more polarized as expiry draws nearer; an ITM call with one month to expiry has a lower delta than a call with one year to expiry.

I don't mean to talk down to you, but I don't know where you're coming from, so I'll keep things really simple.\n\nSPY is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500. It is stable. It's currently trading for $374.55. The last time there was a difference of at least $40 between the min and the max of the price in a month was May of last year, so let's assume that that's a safe strike above/below the current value.\n\nA 335 put expiring on 2/19 is $2.81. A 334 put expiring on the same date is $2.72, so we make $0.09 per share.\n\nA 415 call for 2/19 is $0.20. A 420 call is $0.14, so we make $0.06 per share.\n\nSo, you sell 5x 335p, buy 5x 334p, sell 1x 415c, and buy 1x 420c. You receive $60 for putting up $500 collateral. If we were right and SPY stays in that range, you made 12% over 6 weeks. That's not bad. As long as the pattern from the past several months holds, we make bank.\n\n*Question: why are we buying and selling 5 puts?* Answer: The difference in strikes between the two calls is $5, so that's how much collateral we need to put up per share. We can use the same collateral on the puts, and the difference in the strikes is $1, so we can buy five times as many puts without putting up any more money.\n\nOne caveat: the volume is pretty low. That is, there aren't a ton of folks buying/selling options so far out of the money. It might be a little difficult to find someone to buy 5x 335p and sell 5x 334p.\n\nHowever, if we set up an iron condor on SPY expiring next Wednesday and set strike prices fairly close to the stock's current value, we could make some money. I just tested it out. I don't want to write it all out, but a 372/373/377/378 gives us $0.97 per share when we put up $1.00 collateral per share. The sum of the 373/377 deltas is about 0.80. That means that there's about a 20% chance of nearly doubling our money in a week, and our max loss is 3%. This is a bit unrealistic; Robinhood is probably reporting the prices higher/lower than you might be able to actually buy/sell for, but I bet you could get a 20% chance of getting a 90% return with a max loss of 10%.

No one could've predicted that Amazon would have grown into a true technological giant and software firm that even makes their own flavor of Linux. I mean people knew Amazon was definitely here to stay around that time, that should've been the real indicator that \"now is the time to definitely hop on board\".

Of course today that $1000 turns into nearly $20,000. You don't pick one company with the hope of making it big on that one.

Tesla was not some hidden gem that no one heard of and then one day they blew up. If you saw the company and saw the success it was having in hindsight it was a no brainer to put SOME money in the company. $1000 put into Tesla which was just cash laying around would have been 20 or so shares worth $14,000 today.

Maybe Biden can authorize printing some money for existing projects?  I think people are vastly overrating what the federal government can force to happen.

The federal government can't keep printing money to subsidize this stuff.  In NY they give relatively tiny subsidies to nuclear to avoid a massive rise in general energy costs, but the left is still up in arms about subsidizing nuclear.  I envision them having the same attitude about battery stored power once it's not new and shiny.  Then it must be economic, meaning the grid has to pay them enough for the battery storage plant to run, which means raising utility rates to pay for it.

Where is the actual analysis you're supposed to be doing?\n\nCathie Wood was the only analyst that actually took Tesla somewhat at face value. They outperformed everyone else miles. Is nobody else interested in just taking Elon's forecasts and running the numbers on that? Why do they keep insisting on pulling random numbers out of their ass and being wrong over and over again?\n\nDid nobody watch Tesla battery day? They said 3 TWh by 2030. If Elon said 500,000 cars by 2020 in 2014, why not just run with it?\n\nThe Tesla Megapack is selling for $200/kWh, or $300/kWh with power electronics + service. With 10 years and 1 cycle/day that's $0.082/kWh, solar is $0.024/kWh. That's a $0.65/kWh cost with 12 hour solar, 12 hour solar + batteries. Nuclear is $0.08, average cost of electricity in the US is $0.12/kWh. I think it's fair to say there's unlimited demand at $300/kWh for grid battery storage. So just take,\n\n**$300/kWh \\* 3 TWh/year = $900 billion/year**\n\nTesla also said they wanted to get the cost down to $55/kWh on battery day. With $100 in power equipment, installation for Megapack, you have \n\n**($55 + $100) / $300 = 52% gross margin.**\n\nIn 2020 Q3 Tesla's gross margin is 23.5%, their overall profit margin was 4.3%. So 19% going into operating + other. In 2030 with 52% gross margin it should be 33% profit margin and $900 billion yearly revenue.\n\nThe average PE ratio for the S&P500 was 37.6 so,\n\n 0.33 \\* ($900 billion) \\* 37.6 = $11.17 trillion (US dollars)\n\n\\-> 2030 price target: $11,780.\n\nTake present value of that with 10% interest (because of the risk), gets you a **present value of $4350 for the stock today.**\n\nIf Tesla had 16,700 cars sold in 2014 and could hit their forecast of 500,000 within a 0.5% error margin, then why not just believe their 2030 forecast and run with it?", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Simply being able to produce batteries is going to be huge.

PE depends on your growth and durability of the market. Besides that a 10% cost of equity is really low for Tesla I think. It's only 2% above market and basically assumes 98% perfect execution each year for 10 years straight. I am on average using 22% for my discount.\n\nNot saying Tesla isn't going to be worth much more but the math is a bit iffy. If they sell their batteries at 52% gross margin then I'd be amazed but I just don't think that will happen.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think those a good points and points out the hardest assumptions of that analysis.\n\nThe 37.6 PE made sense because that's the average for big companies today and if you assume that in 2030 Tesla will have similar growth plans for 2040. In reality assuming Tesla meets their forecast it would make Tesla the most profitable company in the world at 3x the second most profitable company, which ironically is Saudi Aramco selling oil today. Tesla would already run the world, and probably Mars as well.\n\nTaking a look at some public massive companies and ignoring corona you have, Walmart going between 12-21, Royal Dutch Shell historically trading mostly 10-15 P/E. Volkswagen mostly 3-6 P/E, Apple 10-20 P/E. Going with fair P/E of 15 for a massive company you get a $1,740 price target.\n\nThe cost of equity I can't really say too much on, I'm more in engineering than finance, but it sounds like that's where they get you. You do your full analysis and as the final step you get \"Okay, what do you want the price target to be?\" and the excel spreadsheet calculates the cost of equity. Roughly 10% has been the average market rate over the past 80 years. The entire purpose of this was just to take Tesla at face value. We assume they're gonna meet their forecast. There is no risk because we assume that they will just do it, as a basis.\n\nFor the battery margin, I actually think it's possible to get it that high. In the really long term I don't think it's really sustainable to keep it that high, since it's still just a battery and kids in high school learn how to make those in chemistry class. However in the short term there will be insane inertia in the supply and demand curve of energy. Right now in the US enough energy can be produced profitably at $0.12/kWh to meet demand. \n\nIf someone is operating a 40 year old nuclear plant with an average cost of $0.093/kWh and Tesla comes around and says, \"Hey, do you want to buy energy from our solar panels and batteries at a cost of $0.065/kWh?\" \n\nThey'll say \"Great! I'll take 2GW worth of capacity.\" for 12 hours of night that's 24GWh of batteries and 4-5GW of solar (around 2.5 mile square of solar panels). 24GWh is a bit less than Tesla's entire battery production today, but even at 3TWh it would only be enough to replace 125 nuclear reactors every year. There's currently 440 nuclear reactors operating in the world. To supply the entire world from batteries for 12 hours you would need 205 TWh of battery capacity. In 2030 Tesla will be able to supply 3TWh of that for $0.065/kWh, the rest of the world is still paying $0.141/kWh for electricity on average. What happens with the difference between $0.065/kWh and $0.141/kWh? That's your margin.\n\nThe 52% margins will stay until that 205 TWh demand of battery capacity is met. The average today is 160 g of Lithium per kWh of battery capacity. To do 205TWh you need 33 million metric tons of lithium metal.\n\nPredictions are that by 2025 there will be [1.5 million tons](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/lithium-supply-is-set-to-triple-by-2025-will-it-be-enough) of Li2CO3 equivalent lithium production, which is 18.8% lithium by mass. So 300,000 tons lithium per year mined and 33 million tons of lithium metal needed to meet demand?

On Wednesday he increased his price target on shares to $810, the highest mark on Wall Street, from $540. Hitting $810 would make Tesla stock, by one measure, worth just under $1 trillion dollars.\n\nThat value puts Tesla in some elite company, there are only four U.S.-listed companies with market capitalizations north of $1 trillion.\n\nThe reason Jonas took his target price up Wednesday looks to be fourfold. First, Tesla posted better-than-expected delivery volumes for the fourth quarter. More deliveries now and in the future is bullish for any auto maker.\n\nTesla also recently raised another $5 billion in capital to support growth. Faster growth can help company valuation multiples.\n\nThird, Tesla was added to the S&P 500 Index in December. “In the days leading up to and following” Tesla’s addition, wrote Jonas in a Wednesday research report, “we have been fielding an increased number of calls from a range of investors who are conducting financial and valuation analysis....for the first time.” The S&P 500 addition has more people checking out Tesla stock which means more potential buyers. That can also boost a company’s valuation multiples compared with its own, pre-indexation, history.\n\nFinally, Jonas increased his value for Tesla’s nascent mobility business, which includes things such as robotaxi services and self driving software sales. “The higher population of vehicle\\[s\\] in the Tesla \\[installed base\\] as a direct knock-on impact on our Tesla Network Services valuation,” added the analyst.\n\nTesla stock is up about 4.8% to almost $771 a share in midday trading. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up about 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively.\n\nJonas didn’t mention the outcome of the Georgia senate runoff election. But a higher potential for a blue wave election outcome, giving democrats control of both houses of Congress, is seen my many on the Street as more good news for green technologies such as battery powered cars.\n\nAt $810 a share, Tesla stock would be worth an aggregate of about $990 billion, just 1% shy of $1 trillion, based on 1.2 billion fully diluted shares outstanding.\n\nTesla used 1.1 billion shares when calculating third-quarter figures, but that’s an average count over the entire quarter. And as Tesla stock keeps rising, and Elon Musk’s stock options keep vesting. FactSet estimates the fully diluted shares at this point in time are more than 1.2 billion.\n\nTesla has, roughly, 950 million shares issued and outstanding. The difference between the two numbers is that the larger includes all of management’s stock-based compensation, as well as convertible debt, warrants, and restricted stock units.\n\nWhich number is the right one to use can be debated. But in-the-money stock options—ones that allow holders to acquire stock for less than the market price—will be converted into shares some day. This isn’t necessarily a negative for the stock price, though. Tesla investors, as a group, know about Musk’s compensation package, so that information is, theoretically, already reflected in the current stock price. The biggest impact in which share count to use is on how Wall Street, and the media, quote Tesla market capitalization.\n\nFor the other trillion-dollar companies, the impact of diluted share counts is less significant that it is for Tesla. The difference for Tesla, between basic and diluted shares outstanding, is about 25% of the current shares outstanding. The average for the trillion-dollar four horsemen— Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL)—is about 2% on average.\n\nThat’s a bit of fun with numbers, but investors really care about the individual share price and what the forward outlook is. “Despite the extraordinary run in the share price, we continue to believe Tesla can outperform \\[versus the auto\\] sector in 2021,” adds Jonas in his report.\n\nThat’s what bulls want to hear.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Bought 10 ARKG calls w/ 12/21 expiration; cathie is bullish on Genomics being > EV sector this year.

I said it wouldn’t break $700 before end of the year but it broke 700 on dec 31. Fuck me i guess. Anyways I lost $7000 in Tesla calls when it did like shit after the inclusion. Luckily it was only profits that I had made from buying shares earlier in the year so I didn’t actually “lose” money. Also I never bought puts. I was all talk. I would never actually buy puts on any stock because I normally lose. Anyways you all were right...whatever 🤡\n\nEdit* I can only respond every 10 minutes (no doubt to trolling lol). Ok here’s the full scoop. I started this year with $4k. I threw it at multiple stocks when Covid hit. Tesla and Amazon were the only ones that succeeded. $4k to $12k in shares. Enter options (thanks WSB) I lost and made money on Tesla calls. Ultimately I made $19k on calls and shares in Tesla. Not bad with only $4k. Then the ugly side of options gambling reared it’s stupid face and I lost $9k (cue the the hate). Got back $2k and then threw it all into crypto and now I’m back to almost $15k. Now here’s some advice for poor people (me) or people who don’t know shit about investing (me). I would be worth $67k right now if I had patiences. I held 2 $435 calls exp Jan 15. I sold in panic. Go on, look how much those are worth now. I held various other calls now with $17k. But due to lack of patience, being emotional and getting sand in my vagina I lost money. $67k to a poor person is like steak to a hungry dog. So here’s some lessons\n1) don’t spend what you don’t wanna lose\n2) patience is a virtue. You need to be calm as a Hindu cow\n3) delete your damn trading apps. The money will still be there but you won’t be able to log in (thanks face recognition for making me forget my passwords)\n4) Nobody knows what’s really gonna happen. The whole market is a lie\n5) only rich people can afford to play this game. You’re just try to surf that whale’s waves\n6) invest in booming tech\n\nI actually do believe Tesla is going places. I think space x would be amazing if it went public. Regardless of politics I suspect democrats will boom Tesla. I could be wrong. No I’m not getting political.
