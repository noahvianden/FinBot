But the problem with what you put forward, is that all the profit margins lie in the software side of it. If VW partners up with lets say Mobileye, mobileye will demand the premium for their product, VW won't be able to. They'll sell cars with the same margins they're doing right now, and Mobileye will skyrocket because of their insane cash flow.\n\n>When valuations get ahead of a company they don’t just wait around at that price for the company to catch up.\n\nThat depends on the likelihood of them reaching their targets, and the likelihood of any meaningful competition. But I agree it's normal for hyper-growth companies to be very volatile.\n\n>Hoping for the stock to stay flat for a year is a pretty wide eyed dream.

{"title": "I invested half my net worth buying Volkswagen stocks, here's why", "selftext": "The EV market is booming and so are the stocks of new players (Tesla, Nio, etc.). After its last run, Tesla is now worth 9 times Volkswagen (VW). You could argue that there is a bubble and Tesla stocks will go down hard eventually, which is true, at least to some degree. But will it lose 90% of its value and remain at that valuation? I highly doubt that. \n\nFor those who don't know, VW owns major brands like Škoda, Seat, Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, among others, so it offers cars in every price segment. \nln the last couple of years, VW has invested a lot of money into EV, creating a modular platform for all their brands (MEB) and the core brand released both their ID.3 and ID.4 this year, which were promptly sold out.\n\nNow I want to compare Tesla's and VW's chances in a new car market dominated by EV:\n\nAdvantages Tesla:\n- Hype, image, design\n- They were the first movers, which was an advantage because they could focus on their strengths and force competition to follow their lead\n- current market share in EV\n- autonomous driving (although 'real' autonomy is still far away and others could catch up/cooperate; https://on.ft.com/38aIV0v)\n\nAdvantages VW:\n- experience building cars, quality of production\n- existing factories with staff (ramping up production numbers is comparatively easy)\n- existing retail network\n- different brands offer the opportunity to target their customers more specifically, improving margins\n\nBasically, Tesla's biggest problem is production, they can't increase production numbers as fast as the EV market does, so they will lose market share, giving other players a chance to compete. Even though VW was late to the party they are now in a position to overtake them in production and sales in 2021 or 2022 (e.g. Norway, where 52% of cars sold in 2020 were EV. In that segment Audi - owned by VW - surpassed Tesla in sales. Or Germany, where the ID.3 sold extremely well considering that delivery only just started in September).\nNA is a market VW has historically not been very successful in, that might still be the case in the future, but I am optimistic about the rest of the world.\n\nThere are other reasons why I think VW will be successful:\n- the company has remained highly profitable throughout hard times like the emission scandal and Corona, while at the same time investing huge amounts of money into the switch from combustion to EV\n- if I am not mistaken, they also invested into Fuel cell technology, diversifying risk\n- VW is market leader in China and Europe, people know and like their vehicles and will continue to buy them\n\nThe biggest issue VW has is probably software. Like most German companies, they seem to be unable to deliver competitive products in that aspect, but they'll sort it out eventually. \nLastly, I want to say that I don't expect VW to rise as much as Tesla did (obviously), yet I expect huge jumps in the future, decreasing the gap in market cap of both companies. Patience is key. \nI would love to hear if you agree with my analysis or not. Please point out aspects I might have forgotten to take into consideration.\n\nEdit March 19th 2021:\nI am quite happy with how things have gone so far. I did sell about half of my shares a week ago in order to buy some shares of growth companies on the low. \nThere are currently some rumours regarding plans to put parts of Porsche on the market. Everybody owning VW shares would receive Porsche shares if that were to happen, further increasing the value of the company. I see a bright future for the company, although I am not following the day to day developments very closely anymore. \nRegarding Software: As sb pointed out in the comments, VW has founded a new branch called Volkswagen Software Org. The VW CEO wants it to become the second largest software company in Europe after SAP with over 10000 employees. They plan to finish their operating system by 2024 and sell their autonomous cars by 2025. \nTo sum it up, Tesla is still ahead in Software, but it is unclear if they will be able to increase production enough in order to dominate the market when other manufacturers catch up in that regard.

People outside of tech don't realize it's not that easy lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "For all of your VW advantages I'd actually disagree entirely. Let me explain.\n\n1. Experience building cars.\n\nThey have experience building ICE cars. Not EVs. Could they have fewer problems with panel gaps than Tesla? I'd assume so. But that's not what makes an EV. There is a reason Tesla has, by a significant margin, the most efficient electric drivetrains (evidence is found in range which Tesla dominates) of any auto manufacturer and that's because they specialize in it. Not dabble. And even if that wasn't the case wouldn't every OEM have that same advantage? If so, how is it an advantage specific to VW?\n\n2.  Existing factories.\n\nThose factories are designed, from the bottom up, to build the wrong type of car. Say goodbye to all the machinery and skilled workers to make engines. Say adiós to all of the same for traditional drivetrains. Also consider that they will have to rework factories to build electric motors and electric drivetrains. A traditional ICE factory can't make electric cars without SIGNIFICANT expenses and downtime. Something Tesla will never have to deal with as all of their factories are designed from the foundation up to build EVs.\n\n3. Existing distribution networks. Aka dealerships.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, please, but does VW own the majority of their worldwide dealerships? I don't think they do. While this might on first glance seem like a benefit there is a major downside. In many countries OTA updates are considered a service and thus must be done in a certified dealership or repair center. Since Tesla owns all of their distribution network they can push out OTA updates asap to everyone on the same day. Many OEMs are required, by law, to have this update be installed in the physical dealership which inherently slows down the speed of innovation.\n\n4. Brand differentiation\n\nI mostly take issue with the part where you mention the margin. Tesla already has a, sans regulatory credit, margin of above 23% which is near industry leading. As production ramps in Shanghai continue those margins should only inceaae and with FSD enabled taxi's they could easily exceed 50% margin within 2 years. While this is speculative the current margins are already nothing to scoff at and if their stated goals work out then it could completely redefine what industry margin standards look like.\n\n\n\nI am long Tesla, if that wasn't already clear lol, but I genuinely hope for EV success across the board as that is fundamentally a good thing for competition, innovation, and the planet.

Tesla has even a 1-2 year head start on Level 5 FSD then their current valuation will look like peanuts in 2030. If they are tied with just one other company with FSD rollout and EV produc then I think they can still justify a 3x increase from here. If it comes down to multiple companies competing with equivalent FSD capabilities and production levels at the same time then I think Tesla can probably still double.

A true Level 5 FSD would mean driverless taxi's in NYC running more or less 24/7 with less upkeep than traditional cars and a cheaper energy source. Not hard whatsoever to imagine a Tesla with FSD bringing in $100k per car per year in NYC. Even in smaller cities with less taxi's it's still probably going to be $30-40k revenue on a car that cost Tesla ~$20k to make. I can't imagine Tesla charging anything less than $100k per semi for companies like Walmart or $30k a year if a subscription either. Their drivers get paid about $85k a year so even a FSD fee of $30k is big savings for Walmart for a truck that can, again, drive essentially 24//7. \n\nWhy would the margins be anything less than exceptional for FSD?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The more competition there is, the lower the margins, economics 101.\nThere will be a point in time when a lot of new companies will enter the market.

I'll try to address the points you are making.\n\n1. Experience building cars/existing factories\n\nMost of my arguments here are applicable for all traditional OEMs entering the EV market, I just think VW is furthest ahead.\nI'll give you the drivetrain, but that's a traditional engineering problem, the one thing Germans really excell at. I don't expect that advantage to last. \nI am talking about the experience of having production numbers of tens of millions of cars every year, including logistics (coordination of just in time delivery), close cooperation with suppliers, having production plants in the countries you are selling your cars in, knowing their local regulations and culture and train your staff to have your mentality/work ethic.\nRegarding staff, if assembling an EV was more complicated, you'd have a point, but it just simplifies the process and you only need to train a few people to mount it.\nI think you overestimate the problems that are caused by switching production in a plant and underestimating the time and cost involved in creating new factories. Just look at the planned production site next to Berlin, it won't build cars until 2023. Keep in mind Tesla would need to increase their production at least tenfold in the next couple of years and it's not guaranteed to be smooth. VW on the other hand switched the production to EV in at least two factories fast and without any real impact on total car deliveries.\n\n2. Car dealerships\n\nI don't have any knowledge in this field to dispute your claims\n\n3. Brand differentiation/margins\n\nI think you're overly optimistic. Tesla could offer those margins, as there was little competition on the market. Unless they manage to become an Apple equivalent in the car market, I don't see them maintaining that margin once competition enters the market. And I doubt that will happen, as there are brands that are more premium than Tesla. So they either become a premium car maker and stay with low market shares and high margins or they will build huge numbers of cars and reduce the margins.\nTesla's FSD has less of an advantage over the competition and the introduction of that kind of tech is further away than you think (see the ft article I linked).\nIf they manage to to introduce it 1-2 years before everybody else, that would mean big gains for that period, but other manufacturers will follow and pricing will again be a main differentiator.\n\nAgain, I am not saying that VW will surpass Tesla, I am just stating that stock valuations are very often heavily influenced by a US-American perspective on things. \nApparently, VW sell shitty cars over there and just aren't on the radar of many investors. Once the sales numbers for 2021 are published that will probably be different and I wanted to make you guys aware of that. \nOf course I also have an interest that people reading this at least take a look at the stock and assess it themselves. The more people know about a stock, the higher the probability of it rising.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I feel like you really just brushed drivetrains aside. Those are obviously extremely critical to the overall performance and value of a car. It's a pretty significant advantage for Tesla imo.\n\nAlso Berlin will be building cars by Q3 this year per Tesla. Idk where you get your 2023 info from but that's way off.\n\nI guess what doesn't sell me on your argument is that as someone who has followed Tesla for about a decade is that it's literally the same exact argument people said against Tesla in 2012,13,14,15,16,17,18,19... the competition is always 2 years away. It's just not convincing to me anymore. Now I know that OEMs are actually making EVs now so I suppose it's true in a literal sense but I don't find their cars compelling. Shorter range, nothing even remotely close to FSD, and significantly smaller charging network. It's just not compelling. Not that VW can't succeed or that your investment won't pay off but I just simply don't see anyone beating Tesla unless they beat themselves.\n\nIn regards to FSD I really do think you're greatly oversimplifying the scale of the difficulty involved. In terms of capability there isn't even a close 2nd place and no one has 5% of the data to train their software that Tesla does. That's an enormous advantage that can't just be explained away by two or three years of VW working hard. \n\nAnyways. I think VW will make it as they seem to at least understand how the market is shifting. The same can't be said for many OEMs and I think a few will either go bankrupt or be a tiny shadow of their former selves. I'm sure I'll get downvoted again for thinking FSD is undervalued lol. I just fundamentally can't understand the bear logic here. It's like trying to convince me that 1+1=0. The TaaS market is a multi-trillion market on it's own. It just seems plain as day to me. We didn't even go into any of Tesla's other businesses btw. I can't understand why they're so easily dismissed by so many as nothing. \n\nBest of luck with your VW investment!

Selling ICEs gives them huge cash flows, especially now with reduced investments into R&D in that area, why would you see that as a disadvantage?\n\nWait, what, low build quality?

Some companies will fall in value and never pick back, PLUG is one of them. \n\n\nI am not saying this because I have FOMO.

But one thing they probably won't tell you is that they were saying the same thing for months/years before that.  A broken (analog) clock is right twice a day.  There are plenty of people out there right now saying, \"There's going to be a crash!\"  but nobody is saying that it's going to be next week, or even next month.  They don't know when.  If they try to peg it to a specific time, more than likely they'll be wrong and people won't take them seriously anymore.  \n\nIt's possible the markets may go in an upward trend for the next year.  Or 2.  There may be little pullbacks, or big ones.  But with the insane amount of money floating around and the government printing billions more every month, it looks like things will continue their upward ascent.  The gov't has also pledged to keep rates low for an extended period.

A lot of people here like to invest in trendy tech stocks and tech stocks have done well this year thanks to stimulus and lockdowns.\n\nI suspect there could be more to it than that though. I think the outperformance could also be partly due to social media and places like Reddit inflating the inflows into some of these names.

You mean small caps, or stocks that are about to rally?\n\nIt's important not to take too much advice from others when you're investing so I wouldn't actively look for trade ideas here personally. One, because you don't know what incentives people have, but secondly because if you don't fully understand why you're getting into a trade you also won't know when to get out. This is why I don't like to recommend stocks I'm not planning to hold for at least a year here. I know previously people have brought things I've recommended before and held for too long because they didn't understand the trade.\n\nIn my opinion the best way to find opportunities is just to consume a lot of financial news. I always have CNBC on in the background just to get a feel for what's happening in the markets and the economy, but it also means I'm constantly hearing about stocks I might not have heard about otherwise. I also look at the Yahoo Finance top losers and top gainers pages daily and will take a quick look at any stocks I haven't heard of. At this point my head is full of random companies and tickers. 99% of stuff I dislike, but every now and then I'll find a company I really like and I'll invest.\n\nThere can be some high quality posts on here from time to time. As long as you're talking to people here to help come to your own conclusions it's probably fine, but blindly following stock picks and the advice popular here has historically not been so great. HMNY is my favourite example of this. The stock was hyped hard here in late 2017 and at one point was going up double digits almost every day purely on speculation that it could be a game changer for the movie industry. Not long after it crashed when the business failed because their business model was completely unsustainable. This was one of the most dramatic and short-lived examples I can think of, but there have been a bunch others like BYND which is down 50% from when it was being hyped daily here. BYND a good company, but it got caught up in far too much speculation.

In the case of Tesla, I think there's a number of reasons to indicate it is not being driven up as a bubble. \n\nIf we look at who has been buying: Tesla was recently added to the SP500 index, so SP500 index funds and active benchmarks have been buying as they are mandated to. These are your funds like VOO, SPY, VFINX and any active benchmarks that try to beat the SP500 index. They have bought hundreds of billions of dollars of Tesla, reducing the float by a significant amount. I've seen some estimates that put the float reduction at around 40%!\n\nThe point here is that these funds will not be selling. So the price has gone up: yes. But the people buying are large institutions who are buying because they track the SP500 index. They have no choice - they *have* to buy Tesla stock as part of their mandate.

At a 10% asset inflation? 100%? or 500%? What if a stock has been under the radar for a long period of time and the market suddenly catches on. That's naturally going to force the price up, but doesn't necessarily mean it's a bubble. Sometimes the market is just slow to value things correctly.

Increased traction than the early days of when rumors of Project Titan was initially floated.\n\nLot of current Apple and non-Apple investors think Apple is a \"one trick pony\" with the iPhone.  I've said this many times, but companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc have a huge cash war chest to enter new markets pretty much anytime they desire to do so.  To me this helps justify their current market cap.\n\nPersonally, I think Apple Silicon is going to be the \"trojan horse\" that allows them to enter new markets.  When I saw NIO's announcement on their partnership with Nvidia and details around the new system for autonomous driving, my first reaction was a question as to what sort of power consumption will be required to run their system.  As a long time personal Nvidia user, controlling power consumption hasn't been Nvidia's biggest strength.  Think what autonomous systems powered by Apple Silicon and software can do in this segment.\n\nNot sure if the report on the Hyundai/Apple partnership is true, but I'm glad Apple is not building their own car.  Most likely they will provide the infotainment and autonomous driving solutions to other car manufacturers to incorporate into their cars.  \"Powered by Apple\" or \"Apple Inside\" sort of speak.\n\nA great margin by car manufacturers would be around 20%, but Apple is already achieving 40% margin on the iPhones.  I think just providing the infotainment/autonomous driving system will allow Apple to keep margins closer to 40%.\n\nI could see people saying \"I drive an Apple car\" instead of \"I drive a Hyundai\" which will increase Apple's branding.\n\nAlso, I can't help to think if Apple would incorporate AR into the solution somehow.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well the rumors are more specific now so of course more people are paying attention.\n\nAs for a big war chest that doesn't necessarily help.

Tesla doesn't have enough batteries for their cars so they are investing and building in their own battery factory. Meanwhile Nio has to set aside a high number (20%? 35%?) of expensive DEPRECIATING battery packs instead of these packs going into cars. \n\nOh, did they say it takes 5 minute for a swap? Sure if no one is ahead of you. It seems it's very common there are 3-4 cars in front of you and you need to wait 25 minutes until you are done. Might as well just go for supercharging then. \n\nOne more thing. You are allowed 6 swaps per year? What happened when it's August and you did the 6th swap, only to realize the current battery pack is degraded and only has 80% battery capacity on your new car? You have to wait until next year to swap and pray for a better battery. \n\nNio will do ok in the future.

What’s even scarier is when the volume is so massive that the stock gets locked out/frozen (someone remind me the term) and nobody can buy or sell for a short period of time, usually a few minutes. I wasn’t involved, but one notable event was when a particular stock (this sub apparently won’t let me mention the name) in mid 2020 briefly skyrocketed from $2 to over $50 in one day. Then there was a tremendous sell off and it would occasionally freeze, numbers would recalculate, and when the trading would open back up a few minutes later the stock price would have dropped from, for example, maybe $50 per share to $40. Those aren’t the actual figures and I just watched from the sidelines bc it was interesting, but of course you don’t want to be in that position when that type of selloff occurs.

That’s what creates the charts that look like “steps” upwards; if you’ll notice, most charts with these “steps”, there’s an abrupt drop in the stock price that forms the right-side of the step, before the stock price hits its new support value and starts to build for the next step. There’s also sometimes a big spike on the left edge of the step. The biggest drop is usually when the stock price hits a lot of peoples’ limit-sell price, especially if it’s a sort of “round” number (I.e. $3.00, $3.25, $3.50, etc), or just when a lot of people decide to take profits all at the same time. So this quick sell-off knocks the stock back down to its new support level (hopefully—it can also kill a surge if too many people sell off on a lower cap stock, or if it’s a quick pump-and-dump). If you don’t know that this happens, it can really look like the stock is shooting back down (sometimes it is), and you will scramble to sell quickly. This can be super frustrating if you bought on the way up, and you end up either breaking even, gaining just a tiny bit, or worst case, losing a bit. And you’ll probably use up a day trade in the process (if you’re <$25k to day trade).\n\nMost stocks do this if it’s going to climb for a little while. Pump and dumps are totally different, and you’ll see they just spike and fall literally in a few hours or less. Also not all stocks do this beautiful step pattern upwards, but the solid ones do, over time.\n\nGo look at $ZOM’s chart. You’ll see that it looks like it’s trying to form these steps, and there’s a big sell-off/dip (-14.4%) around 10:40am on January 5th that knocked the stock down a bit.

{"title": "Why We Are at the Major Late-Stage Bubble, Possibly the Biggest in History", "selftext": "Before I begin, I came across this article written by Jeremey Grantham, who is a British investor and co-founder and chief investment strategist of GMO, also regarded as a highly knowledgeable investor particularly due to his prediction of various historic stock market bubbles.\n\nIn his article titled \"Waiting for the Last Dance\", he outlines multiple points why he thinks we are in a major late-stage bubble. I will summarize below the key points discussed, but will also leave a link to the article in case you want to read the full version.\n\n[https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/)\n\n\\- The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble, and he believes this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000.\n\n\\- The single most dependable feature of the late stages of the great bubbles of history has been really crazy investor behaviour, especially on the part of individuals. For the first 10 years of this bull market, we lacked such wild speculation. But now we have it. (he provides examples such as Hertz, K\\*d\\*k, Nikola, and especially, Tesla)\n\n\\- The \"Buffett indicator,\" total stock market capitalization to GDP, broke through its all-time-high 2000 record. In 2020, there were 480 IPOs (including an incredible 248 SPACs) – more new listings than the 406 IPOs in 2000. There are 150 non-micro-cap companies (market cap of over $250 million) that have more than tripled in the year, which is over 3 times as many as any year in the previous decade. The volume of small retail purchases, of less than 10 contracts, of call options on U.S. equities has increased 8-fold compared to 2019, and 2019 was already well above long-run average.\n\n\\- This time, more than in any previous bubble, investors are relying on accommodative monetary conditions and zero real rates extrapolated indefinitely ... Now once again the high prices this time will hold because…interest rates will be kept around nil forever, in the ultimate statement of moral hazard – the asymmetrical market risk we have come to know and depend on. The mantra of late 2020 was that engineered low rates can prevent a decline in asset prices. Forever! But of course, it was a fallacy in 2000 and it is a fallacy now. In the end, moral hazard did not stop the Tech bubble decline, with the NASDAQ falling 82%. Yes, 82%!\n\n\\-Nothing in investing perfectly repeats. Certainly not investment bubbles. Each form of irrational exuberance is different; we are just looking for what you might call spiritual similarities. Even now, I know that this market can soar upwards for a few more weeks or even months – it feels like we could be anywhere between July 1999 and February 2000. Which is to say it is entitled to break any day, having checked all the boxes, but could keep roaring upwards for a few months longer.\n\n\\- My best guess as to the longest this bubble might survive is the late spring or early summer, coinciding with the broad rollout of the COVID vaccine. At that moment, the most pressing issue facing the world economy will have been solved. Market participants will breathe a sigh of relief, look around, and immediately realize that the economy is still in poor shape, stimulus will shortly be cut back with the end of the COVID crisis, and valuations are absurd. “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” But remember that timing the bursting of bubbles has a long history of disappointment.\n\n\\- Even with hindsight, it is seldom easy to point to the pin that burst the bubble. The main reason for this lack of clarity is that the great bull markets did not break when they were presented with a major unexpected negative. The great bull markets typically turn down when the market conditions are very favorable, just subtly less favorable than they were yesterday. And that is why they are always missed.\n\n\\-The combination of timing uncertainty and rapidly accelerating regret on the part of clients means that the career and business risk of fighting the bubble is too great for large commercial enterprises. So, don't wait for the Goldmans and Morgan Stanleys to become bearish: it can never happen. For them it is a horribly non-commercial bet. Perhaps it is for anyone. Profitable and risk-reducing for the clients, yes, but commercially impractical for advisors. Their best policy is clear and simple: always be extremely bullish. It is good for business and intellectually undemanding. It is appealing to most investors who much prefer optimism to realistic appraisal, as witnessed so vividly with COVID. And when it all ends, you will as a persistent bull have overwhelming company. This is why you have always had bullish advice in a bubble and always will.\n\nIf you are interested to see more of his arguments, I strongly advise you to go and read the full article. I am currently 100% on equities, and very bullish for stocks as all of you probably are. But I think it's also important to have a balanced perspective, especially when everyone around you is extremely bullish. Ultimately, we are investing for the long run for our retirement. Everyone is a fucking genius in a bull market, and I think a lot of people in the sub, whether a newcomer or an experienced investor, should listen to bearish predictions and advices and not become a victim of confirmation bias.", "id": "ktu07v", "created_utc": 1610209892.0, "score": 202, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 280, "comments": [{"body": "What happens after vaccine rollout when people want to start doing their social & recreational activities again?

History may not rhyme, but even an echo of that powerful economic boom would be most welcome.\"\n\nThe idea is simple. \n\nAfter the Spanish flu, the Roaring 20s began. And it felt the same. And it was based at least in part in actual innovation. \n\nToday's innovation is coming in the form of new energy solutions spurred on globally by new policy initatives and in the form of huge stimulus. It's coming in the form of biotech innovation started by an arms race between pharma companies to make vaccines, and will supercharge the entire sector for a long time to come. And it's in the burgeoning field of AI in its many forms displacing jobs, for better or for worse, but certainly boosting productivity if we can direct and dispatch the surplus labor we have in a productive way (this would be good for general social cohesion and stability, too, having stable jobs for the many...). These are sectors endlessly hyped a decade ago (look at trajectory of TAN and biotech ETFs to get a sense) but their time has finally come.\n\nAlso:\n\nMore productivity is deflationary. Less consumption is deflationary. Fed has said it is boosting its benchmark rate of 2 percent inflation. It won't tighten its easy money policy until it sees more than that. \n\nBUT we haven't seen meaningful inflation in a decade or two. We don't know why, actually. In part probably due to much higher productivity writ large, and lower money velocity.\n\nSo if we don't see inflation, rates will be kept low, stimulus will continue, businesses will be able to continue to borrow, meaningful and tangible innovation will continue apace, and maybe, someday, we will see inflation. That may be years from now. \n\nAre you bullish yet? I am. \n\nYes, we know what came after the Roaring 20s. But that's a story for another day. My point is that we're in a secular bull market driven by the above. I'll chnage my mind when the facts change.\n\nIf you can, check out videos from ARK's Cathie Woods on Youtube.

It hasn't thus far because of the cost to produce hydrogen. ***But with the Biden administration and EU planning to invest heavily invest in solar and wind, the input cost to hydrogen electrolysis should decline enough to make hydrogen as cheap as natural gas*** \\[2\\]\\[6\\]. This is why hydrogen is such a huge growth play now. The economics are only now just about to tip it into be the most economical form of electricity \\[3\\]\\[2\\].\n\nThe advantage of green hydrogen is that is completely green but as a couple of huge market advantage:\n\n1. More power density than Lithium battery. What this means is that you can have vehicles going 600 miles unlike lithium battery; or a small fuel cell footprint vs a large solar footprint for commercial buildings. Picture the size of a truck (fuel cell) vs a parking lot (solar) to power a big box retailer.\n2. Quick charge. Fueling a fuel cell would take minutes rather than hours with Lithium batteries.\n\nNote: blue hydrogen is made from natural gas. grey hydrogen is made from fossil fuel. green hydrogen is made from wind/solar/hydrodam/nuclear\n\nThe EU already moving to a green hydrogen economy \\[3\\]. Bloom recently hired a GE to expand into the EU for 2021 \\[1\\]\n\nSo comparatively, we have a company with technology comparable to PLUG.\n\nBE made 800M in annual sales for 2020 (natural gas fuel cells). They plan to address the hydrogen market by 2022. Like PLUG, they plan to have 1GW of capacity 2025.\n\nLastly, their board is comprise of government insiders and the former CEO of GE \\[4\\]. So they are well position to gain more regulation in favor of hydrogen and knowledge on how to expand internationally.\n\nYou are buying BE for when hydrogen will be the main fuel source starting in 2025 onward. It will overtake Lithium Ion by 2035. Buying into hydrogen now is like buying into TSLA when it introduce its first lithium ion battery.

Using electrolysis to produce hydrogen and then running it through a fuel cell gives an overall efficieny of 30-40%. This is much worse that EV vehicles and adds multiple unnecessary steps in powering the car in my opinion.\n\nThe second issue is infrastructure. One of the biggest obstacles in the adoption of EVs was the chicken and the egg conundrum in that you need EVs to for EV infrastructure demand (charging network), but you need infrastructure to make EVs viable. In order for FC cars to be viable you need a distribution network of hydrogen. This is much more difficult to do since we already had a network for distributing electricity (the electricity grid) whereas we don't have  the high pressure transportation and storage infrastructure for hydrogen. People also very easily had the ability to charge at home since they already had electricity access, something they don't have with hydrogen.\n\nThis brings me to my last issue which is high pressure Hydrogen storage. One misleading fact I heat quoted a lot is that hydrogen is much more energy dense than batteries and other fuels. While it's true that hydrogen is very energy dense by WEIGHT it has very poor VOLUMETRIC energy density. This means that in order for the hydrogen to not take up a huge amount of space it needs to be compressed to very high pressures which adds a lot of cost and complications to the distribution and storage.\n\nOverall this doesn't mean that all fuel cell electric vehicles are doomed, but you should be aware of the obstacles they face, which in my opinion are far greater than EVs. Since electric vehicles have already made their push and gained some market share I'm not so sure that there is room for both fossil fuel free vehicle types in the future.", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "This is incredibly meticulous and concise.

Many of the smaller companies that live out of the ICE ecosystem, for instance gas hauling trucks, or small part supplier are either not incorporated or not listed hence, got missed in the big global 86T market capitalization that is reported for 2020. \n\nAlso the global GDP for 2019 was about 140 T$, not 84 T$ so I think your reference was to the global market cap. Anyhow, if you consider that if we would had any single enterprise on Earth to be traded , there would be some kind of multiplier applied to the GDP. if we assume a 10X multiplier in this hypothetical global market of all human en devours, we have that the ICE market cap of 153T  would account for about 10% of the whole index that sounds almost reasonable.\n\nTesla, with its highly vertical integration and control of the BEV ecosystem, from battery to superchargers is really after a whole ecosystem, not a single element.\n\nOn another note, the Market Cap of traditional ICE OEMs is highly diluted because their reliance on Auto component suppliers.

Every orifice we have has been smokefucked relentlessly by Melvin and his circle jerk penises hiding in suits. It hurts, but the bleeding will stop. Now suck it the fuck up. It's time to pack some gauze and toilet paper. Put your helmets and retard safety gear on because Ryan Cohen has us swaddled in his arms.\n\nFor all you raisin brains working your double fast food shifts and lacking the time to watch Ryan Cohen's twitter like the fat kid eyeing the last 5 donuts in your Krispy Kreme box, I have your back.\n\nAs we all know, a great leader doesn't show face 24/7, but they do come around when you are bent over backwards getting pillaged into oblivion by Melvin's STD riddled uvula puncher in a dark alley behind a Waffle House. This time is no different. Our savior Ryan Cohen just told all you dimwit-fell-off-the-shortbus-smooth-brains to strap in for a \"fun ride.\" I went ahead and took a break from half chub jerking off to my friend's TESLA gains to reverse image search this high quality piece of treasure.\n\nMassive Membrane Ryan Cohen took some time out of his day to search roller coaster memes and found this one. We have been instructed to \"keep arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times\". This isn't just some numbing gel to soothe the pain of our torn open and prolapsed assholes. ICR conference is next week and I know some of you weak handed semen squirters hopped on the ride and chickened out at a fucking loss, right before it started. You left your dignity in the same bathroom that you threw your shit-stained underwear. We are gonna go on the ride of a lifetime with enough action that you'll finally have something relatable to tell your wife's boyfriend. It's one that will make your chump pump inflate so explosively that you'll feel a sharp tug on your butthole.\n\nYesterday was everyone but us (and PLTR, sorry guys). Today was Tesla swinging their nuts like vibranium reinforced wrecking balls, knocking every sell wall out like Mike Tyson KO'ing your crippled grandma over the last bit of Chicken Tikka Masala... and everybody else but us again. However, our time to shine is almost upon us. Our balls drop next week and you might even get your first erection. When this rocket starts blasting, you'll go from your first pube to filming your first consensual orgy in record time. (Thanks Melvin for making me point out the sex acts you've forced on us).\n\nFor all you cowards that sold out of GME today and made some money. I am still proud. Either hop back in with more than you had before or go make tendies elsewhere and be prosperous. For you other sperm suckers that sold out of GME today at $17.08 because you have weaker hands than a sleeping quadriplegic, I hope you like giving throat jobs at truck stops for pocket change. Lemme do you a favor, if you sold out of GME at a loss and weren't up EOD, don't hop back in or your toilet paper hands will dissolve as soon as this girl starts getting wet and you'll just lose money all over again.\n\nI know Melvin has done some damage and our assholes move like a blown sub and at this point, probably can't even hold in a fart. It's okay, sometimes making tendies causes grease fires and 3rd degree burns. If you want Melvin out of your guts, you better pull your head out of your own poopchute and throw up a \"Do Not Enter\" sign to prevent future mishaps.\n\nAt this point, I'm more excited to see Melvin capitulate into a ball of wrinkly old man writhing in despair and loss, than I am to see green dildos on my screen. Regardless LOAD UP THE FUCKING ROCKETS AND LIGHT SOME CANDLES BECAUSE IT SMELLS LIKE BITCH IN HERE. IF MELVIN WANTS TO STICK HIS ONE DROP WONDER PLUNGER INTO GME'S CHILI RING, P-UMP IT AND SQUEEZE THAT SHIT CLEAN OFF!!\n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💦💦💦💦💦💦👨‍🚀👨‍🚀👨‍🚀👨‍🚀👨‍🚀🎢🎢🎢🎢🎢🎢🎢🎢🎢🎢🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nAlso, for the last 10 times I tried to post this, it got blocked by some anti-evil bot and I've had to go back through and censor the more vulgar parts of my post. It doesn't matter because you idiots can't read anyways. Puts on reddit.\n\nEdit 1)  First off, I have tried to post this since noon. I found that the automod was blocking the word \"quickcl0t\" of all the words in this post, which, surprisingly, took me forever to narrow down. It was initially supposed to be \"pack some gauze and quickcl0t\" but toilet paper had to suffice. I suppose it was triggering some sort of call to vi0lence bullshit so it took me forever to find out what was wrong and get this thing approved. Secondly, [/u/zjz](https://www.reddit.com/u/zjz/) and his VisualMod bot smacked me with using the banned ticker \"p-ump\" so that's why that shit looks stupid.

Enter the VIE structure: a Chinese company establishes a wholly-owned subsidiary (often in the Cayman Islands), which then is the company that is listed on a foreign exchange, allowing foreigners to invest. Foreign investors are not buying a stake in the Chinese company; instead, they are buying a contractual promise that the Chinese company will share its earnings and profits with the Cayman subsidiary, which then will be passed on to the investor.

{"title": "I'm calling bullshit. Why I'm shorting TWTR", "selftext": "TLDR: bad fundamentals, bubble burst insurance, political landscape\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are 3 reasons why I'm going to buy put leaps on twitter this coming Monday. I usually stay away from puts as I'm a bull myself, but the uncertainty we're facing now requires some kind of hedge and I believe this is one of the better hedges out there. You guys do your own DD as always.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nTwitter doesn't actually turn up any profit. They have a negative cash flow and this is despite being public for over 7 years now. Their stock price has hovered between 14$ and 60$ over these past 7 years and its valuation right now has reached the point it was in 2015. 85% of twitter's money comes from ads. This is due to take a hit due to Apple's upcoming privacy changes which makes it harder to do targeted ads. At the same time, as the pandemic is beginning (eventually) to wind down, online commerce should go down a bit, maybe not to pre pandemic levels, but still, and that will further affect ad revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bubble insurance**\n\nWhether we are in a bubble or not doesn't matter. However, due to skyrocketing valuations of tech companies, you'd have to be extremely retarded not to at least hedge your positions. I'm sure most of you read the arguments for and against the bubble on other threads by now, so I'm not going to debate those here. What I'm going to assume is that there is a CHANCE that we're in a bubble and that it may burst at any time during the next 2 years. Could be tomorrow, could be in 2 years, could be in 5 years, could be fucking never idk. \n\nBut if you want to hedge, Twitter is one of the good companies you want to buy put leaps on. It's an online tech company that's already losing money in an environment that's supposed to make them TONS. if that doesn't reek of failure, idk what does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Political headwinds**\n\nI don't want to get political here, but we do have to at least mention the current situation. Twitter's decision to give a big fuck you to half of america is not how business works. If you're a conservative, forget about 'fairness'. If you're a liberal, forget about 'revenge'. If you want to make money, all you need to look into is just how monumentally they're fucked up from a business perspective. Twitter's user base has been hovering around 320 million mark since 2015 until today, while their userbase grew from 30 million to 300 million from 2010 to 2015. Clearly they've stagnated for a long while now. One of the reasons why social media has risen to be so influential over the past decade has been the freedom it allows users to express themselves. Big tech didn't pick sides in the beginning so their platforms attracted people from all over the place. \n\nNow, I don't know what portion of twitter's userbase is conservative, but it's surely not inconsequential. Booting off the platform this portion of the userbase will only make the company's value go down even more over the long term. There are also non conservatives who value freedom of speech who will also bleed out from the platform. Less users = less ads = less money = lower stock value.\n\nI haven't even mentioned the big tech antitrust and monopoly issues they're facing. And this is something the DEMOCRATS have suggested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: All the signs point to twitter's demise. The company has very few positive things looking forward to, and most of these positive things are market wide, such as the new stimulus package. Any one sign written above in itself is not a good enough reason to short the stock. But all of them combined, well... do with this what you will.", "id": "ktsipd", "created_utc": 1610204998.0, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "So while I agree with your points of them censoring is bad business. \n\nI also know people are vain, stupid, lazy with short term memories.

{"title": "AAPL Earnings DD and iPhone 12 Sales Estimates", "selftext": "TLDR: My spidey senses say Apple will beat earnings bigly on strong iPhone sales and higher av. selling price. AAPL calls for Jan 29 - March on any strikes above 130 will print\n\nPositions: AAPL 132c 2/5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bbm5039np2q71.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f72f7a9a132c930a5e4c15d1e0b62120833e8b21\n\nOver the last two weeks a few reports and FinNews articles have come out expecting strong iPhone sales for Q4 earnings. A strong quarter is expected with the first 5G iPhones and pent up consumer discretionary spending. Anyone could have predicted that but I believe that analyst estimates are low and more importantly is not priced in at $129-133.\n\nA few articles from shills and morons below\n\n[Bezinga: IPHONE 12 SALES ARE 21% BETTER THAN THE IPHONE 11](https://www.gizchina.com/2020/12/29/iphone-12-sales-are-21-better-than-the-iphone-11/)\n\n[Bloomberg: Supply Chain Sends Bullish Signal on 5g After Tepid Start](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-05/iphone-supply-chain-sends-bullish-signal-on-5g-after-tepid-start)\n\nI did my own due diligence in November and December to figure out how many iPhones they were actually selling. Apple's suppliers posted Q4 [record earnings](https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/08/tsmc-sees-record-breaking-earnings-from-iphone-12-demand) signaling higher production levels than past cycles and analysts report Apple produced 79 million 5g units in Q4 and another 210 million units for FY2021.\n\nAnalysts expect a [38% increase](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/22/apples-iphone-12-shipments-set-for-38-annual-growth-in-q1-2021) in units shipped for Q1 2021 and a similar increase for Q4 sales. Additionally the average price of each iPhone sold is expected to be higher than past years (typically around $750.) The model lineup this year is more expensive on average and analysts speculate flagship models iPhone 12, 12 Pro and Max make up the majority of increased sales.\n\nAdditionally sales in Chinese markets are expected to rise Apple market share past the 20% threshold they've been stuck at.\n\nUsing availability data from the Apple website, I found that base iPhone 12 models in any color were sold out (unavailable for in-store pickup) in 80% of Apple stores by the end of December after holiday sales. This isn't an exact count but does suggest that inventories of iPhone 12 models are low even for the commonly purchased base storage models.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p7q5pohtp2q71.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=927b11be38e74768546a25a863b40433dcea5895\n\nAnalyst estimates are almost surely correct and may be on the low side if inventories are as low as they look. Additionally the stock has priced in expected lower sales numbers due to a delayed launch date and production holdups. AAPL is still trading below ATH from September when reports came out regarding delayed launches. I believe that Q4 sales will beat significantly  and  since the launch was delayed, demand in Q1 will be greater and guidance for the quarter will be increased during the earnings call.\n\n**Positions**\n\n\\\\We've been sitting at $128-132 for the last two weeks but I have a target price of $142 for post earnings through early March. AAPL is $2.22 trillion behemoth so significant price changes are difficult but the IV on options is low enough (42%) to be worthwhile.\n\nI have already committed the remainder of my options account to this play. I picked up $132c 2/5 on Wednesdays dip but any calls $130+ exp after earnings are a very viable and potentially lucrative play.\n\nIf you buy puts fuck you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g52442yxp2q71.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd225c90c6908ca53df8de1c0515155b1ee934a\n\nOn top of that I just have that little feeling about this play. Felt that way about longing TVIX in February 2018 which was a 10 bagger and Palantir at $9. I'm not so good with words but I like my numbers and they check out.

{"title": "The Pot/Weed/Cannabis DD that WSB has been missing. Real roadmap to 🚀🚀", "selftext": "Sup retards? Here's my opinions, make your own decisions. \n\nSo I'll start with the TL;DR: Pot stocks are gonna 🚀💥🚀💥🚀💥 over the next 2 years and 2022/23 calls are future printers (or as early as 90 days) that even Elon himself will raise an eyebrow at. Decriminalization is just a layer of icing on a beautiful cake of banking reform. Also, Biden speaks on the same day Aphria presents at JP Morgan conference, big potential. Grab your helmet and HOLD the fuck on. 🚀💸🚀💸🚀\n\nOkay retards, let's talk about weed. First off, some have mentioned this, but nowhere near enough. Since the Democrats took the senate, the next HUGE catalyst for the marijuana industry is the banking bill, this may cause bigger spikes in stocks than even legalization, as that will get priced in over time as momentum builds towards full legalization. Will stocks go up the day it is passed, absolutely. But will they be Powell level printers? Probably not. More like those busted Bitch McConnell ones. Basically like Pfizer's lackluster performance after saving the world. It was already priced in. So I believe pot stocks will do the same over a period of time. Meaning, again in my opinion, the biggest catalyst for Marijuana is the soonest change we can expect from our new government. I really expect this to be as soon as February and as late as July of this year, for the banking bill. Calls out to 2023 are extremely cheap imagining the upside coming, but calls in July might as well be BOGO. Do your own research as far as what timeline you guess the Senate will take. I'll tell you it was said that It will be addressed in the first session. 🤑🤑🤑🤑\n\nAlso, imagine basically any major company being forced to grow with no reasonable access to capital and no access to common tax write offs that every other company gets to use. Can they find debt currently? Sure. But basically at rates that a \"subprime\" lender would get, and then some. Access to reasonable and competitive capital is gonna be a game changer and allow them to invest and expand into things that are working in preparation of national legalization. Also, depending on how it all shakes out it may allow companies like Canopy (CGC) to purchase Acreage (A deal already made.) Or even better, companies like Marlboro to purchase Cronos (again, already a deal). Both deals are contingent on federal legalization though. \n\n Any kind of renewed commitment to the M.O.R.E act or marijuana decriminalization from Biden would make stocks go on 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Also, I expect Aphria's presentation to go well. Why? Well, other than being retarded, we have all been locked down for months. You really think stoners stuck at home are smoking less? No, 🐻🌈, they are not. They are smoking hella weed and playing hella video games. Weed stocks and GME Gang are about to do some Ricky Bobby slingshot shit when Biden locks everyone down thanks to Covid 2.0. 🚀🚀🚀🚀 Though, I have no positions in GME just to be clear. I pray for the MOASS to be bestowed upon you by Lord Cohen, but theres just no way marijuana stocks aren't %1,000+ gains just waiting on Senate approval for fucking blastoff. 🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nSo, within the next 2 years, we can pretty confidently say we will have made huge strides for the marijuana industry under a vice president who was the senate sponsor for the MORE act, and a president who wants to make himself appear to fight social injustice. Those conversations are going to be hard to have without bringing up marijuana.  Also, a slow path to legalization would be decimation for the chances of small companies to compete considering the infrastructure and experience more established companies will have. Not many companies will be in a position to supply a meaningful amount to a national demand. \n\nIn summary for Marijuana moons: Marijuana jumps again on news of senate vote for MORE act, could jump also if  Papa \"Don't touch me there\" Biden renews any marijuana commitments, MOONS when MORE passes senate, jumps on news of full legalization talks, and finally baby moons again for legalization and starts a nice slow climb into the industry it is expected to be. There's going to be a lot of scaling and growth for quite a while after legalization to meet supply. Companies with experience doing this already are going to be in a much better position than newer companies just frantically trying to meet demand. \n\nWhich companies?? For me I personally like Canopy and Cronos. Why? Because I'm betting on Corona (Canopy) to do well with a cannabis product in a party/bar scene and Marlboro (Cronos) to do well targeting daily users. Marijuana may have been legalized in multiple states, but there's still barely any places for consumers to enjoy THC in a social setting regardless of what state you're in. There's massive business to be made here, once it is an option. Alcohol wouldn't be where they are today without bars. Regardless, just pick one, do what you can and I think there will be a pretty green number there very soon. 🤷 \n\nGood luck out there retards.", "id": "ku2fx9", "created_utc": 1610235924.0, "score": 122, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "That’s a lot of words GE 1/29 11c", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Pot stocks go 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "If pot goes tits up it is TOP?

That's a huge premium, considering the fastest growing cannabis companies in the industry are trading between 12 to 39 times sales. Even though its price-to-book (P/B) value stands at just 1.7, keep in mind that more than half of Cronos' $1.9 billion total assets consist of cash and equivalents. .\n\nIt would be great if the company is putting that cash to use to make a profit.
