If you paid $2.28 ($228) for the call and the stock goes so high the option is worth $5.50 ($550) you can just sell the call and take your profit that way.

The market wants a surprise, something they haven't considered, if they've already considered it, baked it in and it's as good or less good (even if it's still GREAT) the stock usually goes down. That's what I've found. So again...don't play the earnings game because earnings only make stocks go up when it's UNEXPECTED good news not good news that everyone already knows about and expects...in that case you sell the day BEFORE earnings when people have fomo and are thinking like you (generally speaking)...that earnings will be good and will make the stock go up. Good news is only good when it's unexpected.\n\nA good example is netflix this week. Normally it does well, but it usually doesn't EXCEED expectations or come out with anything not expected, usually it's maybe slightly UNDER projections...even though it may have an amazing quarter...if the projections are even slightly missed it'll go down, if the projections are dead on...it still will probably go down...because it's expected and people sell off. BUT this past week it TOTALLY beat expectations, it had WAY more subs than anyone realized before hand and because of that it went up. That's a perfect example of how earnings make a stock go up because of a surprise. Apple would have to do BETTER than what everyone is thinking right now and if everyone is thinking they did REALLY good...well that's almost impossible to beat and most likely would be baked in before earnings especially if the stock went up leading up to earnings.

I think using gene editing as a therapy is very promising and innovative, but in my opinion, there is a still a relatively long way to go for the field to mature and get to where it's safe as a treatment. And for the same reason, I am bullish on auxiliary companies that are aiding and enabling the research of gene editing. I have TWST, NVTA, and PACB in my portfolio and looking to add a few more when I more time to research on other companies in ARKG portfolio. \n\nTWST is a gene synthesis company, and in my opinion has the best technology in the industry. They are the equivalent of ILMN in gene synthesis so I think there's still room to grow. Thanks to ILMN, gene sequencing has matured enough in the last 10-15 years and I think the current bottleneck for gene editing research is high throughput gene synthesis with high fidelity, which TWST is trying to solve and doing a good job at it. \n\nNVTA is a gene testing company. Their technology will one day allow us to look at our genome and identify any markers that can potentially lead to genetic diseases. PACB is a gene sequencing company. From what I understand, they are competing with ILMN to be the next up and coming gene sequencing company. They claim their technology is capable of reading the full sequence of a gene in one go, whereas current technology is capable of reading multiple sequences of a chopped up gene and stich these reads up using software. PACB technology, if they succeed at getting into the industry, will be performing gene sequencing at a higher speed and higher rate.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "NIO -- Investor.

The important thing to remember here is that **the larger the TAM, the more room for growth and competition and the more interest there is to invest in a space.**  This is very important for GME and we will come back to why later.\n\n2) What's the CAGR?  (Compound Annual Growth Rate).  Basically, is the market expanding or shrinking, and how fast.  Again, google this if not familiar.\n\n3) Experience of the management team- have they actually been there before and demonstrated an ability to scale and exit a company in this space?\n\n4) Unit economics- do the numbers make sense as this company grows?  Is it actually going to be profitable?  Every firm looks at these different.  We look at CAC/LTV ratios and doubling time with tech companies.  The TLDR of this is \"how much money does it cost me to get a new customer, how long will they be my customer before they leave, how much money will they spend while they are my customer, and how fast can I double the money I spent on advertising to get that new customer \".\n\nThere are a lot more things that obviously go into determining whether something is a good investment or not, but if there are red flags in any of these core areas a tech company is almost always uninvestable.\n\n**Now onto why after recent developments I think GME is shaping up to be one of the most attractive investment opportunities that investors have seen in these markets in years, but why many of you will miss out on the majority of the gains long term.**\n\n1 and 2) Market size and CAGR.  As a gamer myself in spare time and a tech investor this is a market that hasn't even scratched the surface of how large it will get.  Gaming is a market worth hundreds of billions, with an explosive CAGR as more young people grow up with gaming being a socially accepted activity and in many people's lives the center of their social experience.   Most of you are familiar with this already, so nothing more to be said here.  \n\nNow the question in the past was, is Gamestop capable of growing their share of this market?  Until Ryan Cohen, the answer was no (and this is why the share price went down to where it was).  Again, you all know this.  But this leads to the second point of why it is now an attractive option\n\n2) Ryan Cohen.  Not from an \"excited about a memeing CEO\" perspective, but from the most important thing to institutional investors- does he have a proven track record scaling and exiting profitable e-commerce businesses?  Yes he does.  \n\nAgain, you all know all this and it is how the stock price got to here today.  Everyone is sitting waiting and watching to see if there is a short squeeze (myself included), and there is a lot of hype and excitement.\n\n**But this is leading everyone to miss the forest for the trees because of the 4th point:**\n\nGME's Unit Economics have the potential to be best in industry, yet shares are priced at an extreme discount to revenues currently.\n\nI'd encourage everyone to check out this article talking about how companies with strong growth are normally priced by tech investors by one of the A16z partner.  [https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/](https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/)  The article is titled \"why entry multiples don't matter\" and helps entrepreneurs understand how valuations of companies can make sense for tech investors.\n\nThe short of it is for all the WSBers who can't read: if you have more growth, you get a higher multiple because you will have the potential to produce far more dividends faster, especially in high margin tech companies.\n\nSo what is fascinating about GME?\n\n**If I was presented a new company that had just driven it's e-commerce revenues 300%!!!!! YoY, operating in a several hundred billion TAM, backed by investors and management who had grown a company in the same vertical to hundreds of millions in annual subscription revenue, and with a strong balance sheet and distribution footprint and a widely recognized brand, 20x topline revenue in the early stages would be considered a steal to invest at.** \n\nInstead, GME is priced at a $2.8B market cap, less than half of annual revenues.\n\nThis is an unheard of valuation for a growth company to be trading at a discount.\n\nSo why is GME underpriced, and why did so many people (myself included) not see or continue to not see this opportunity until now?  If it's such a good opportunity, why are shares so cheap?\n\n**Most investors are looking at the legacy Gamestop business that has existed for the past decade instead of treating GME like a new startup (CHEWY for Gaming).**\n\nIf Ryan Cohen can transform GME into a subscription-based membership model where in exchange for your monthly fee you have a one stop shop to all things gaming discounted, you have a company that could easily be valued at a 10-30x multiple on top-line revenues.  However, because most investors outside of this subreddit still view it as a traditional brick and mortar play vs. a subscription focused tech company with omnichannel growth strategies, they think a bubble is forming and are shorting it instead of buying in.\n\n**So why am I not all in yet but why am I excited?**\n\nThe most important thing yet to be understood is what does the customer value proposition look like under the new direction Ryan Cohen takes GME.  Most large investors will be waiting to see how over the next year the balance sheet is strengthened for growth, what new revenue models can be implemented, and to see if there has been a true pivot from brick and mortar.\n\nThis is a company that if management can execute on correctly, most large institutional investors will be clamoring to get a significant stake in and grow it because the gaming market is here to stay and grow.  Bear arguments that digital game sales will hurt GME miss the entire point of the pivot.  Ryan understands this and wants to instead bring the whole gaming experience in house- everything you buy you want to buy from GME because you're part of their membership program (again think Costco).  Those programs are insanely profitable and if the unit economics show that to investors as the company pivots the valuation will soar immediately as people realize it's Amazon Prime, not Blockbuster.  However, it is yet to be seen if they can execute on this vision, which is why I am not all in yet.\n\nThere is still long term risk which is why this stock is still low.  Not a lot but there is some.\n\nMaybe the company doesn't grow?  Maybe they reject Ryan's vision?\n\nBut here's the bottom line.\n\nIf a shift to digital first does occur, and GME becomes a subscription first omnichannel gaming company, the market cap will conservatively be 10x topline revenues.\n\nLet's say that stays flat next year at $5B.  \n\nThis market cap (matching industry standards) **should for an appropriate valuation for a growth stock be $50B.** \n\nI know this sounds insane.  But if Ryan can complete the transformation he is hoping for this is a very conservative valuation.\n\nA $50B market cap would be $800 a share right now.  Again, this assumes Zero topline revenue growth.  If revenue begins to grow again 10x will be unrealistic and the multiples will get far higher.\n\nThis is why the short squeeze is distracting many.  **In 5 years if you diamond hands this company, the fair value of shares can range from $800-$2400 and not be in any sort of bubble or unjustified by fundamentals speculation.**\n\nTLDR; this company if Ryan does what we believe he will may be one of the most undervalued companies this subreddit has ever discovered.  Even if you take profits in a short squeeze, don't forget to keep shares for a long position because opportunities like this rarely come around.  I imagine the short squeeze will allow them to issue more shares to  strengthen the balance sheet, and the company has a fantastic launch pad to start from with the size of it's existing customer base, brand awareness, and revenue. If it becomes clear that GME will be executing on Ryan's vision even at a $10B market cap this will be a steal and I will open a full position then.  I am waiting to expand my position to see what happens with the pivot, as this all goes out the window if GME rejects his strategy.\n\nAs always, do your own DD but I have learned a lot about options from this sub and hopefully this helps a few people understand why selling shares may end up being the biggest regret of their life.  **GME's business model has the potential to look just like Amazon's with a focus on the gaming industry and these shares are only at this price because the market is still looking at the old company and not the new startup that GME could become.\n\nEdit*- I wrote this prior to the squeeze that happened.  You all know the explosion the price saw.  My diligence was written for those investing under $40.  I‚Äôve gotten a lot of DMs.  My thesis has not changed that this was a discount at the time I wrote but I am not opening a significant position until I understand what Ryan Cohen‚Äôs vision for a turnaround is.  I am also not holding at the moment and had taken profits last week when I couldn‚Äôt justify the market cap for the current company under any circumstances and it began feeling like a pump and dump. I will be looking to reopen my original position between $20-$30 and then look to see what the vision for the turnaround looks like before adding more.  This is in no way financial advice and do your own diligence.  I stand by my long term vision for this company IF and only if I like Ryan Cohen‚Äôs turnaround plan and pivot to a business model with attractive margins and potential for strong growth.", "id": "l0yzb5", "created_utc": 1611107664.0, "score": 4180, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 763, "comments": [{"body": "The year is 2030.

Shift away from dying physical sales to being an enthusiast hardware store and e-commerce brand with exceptional customer service.  \n\nThe customer service part is huge.  Somebody mentioned \"why go to Gamestop when I can just go to big box like BestBuy for gaming were there are other things to browse?\". \n\nIMO there are tons of people who think the exact opposite.  If I was shopping for a specific \"enthusiast\" type of item and I had a choice between a huge big box store wading through 90% BS that I don't care about, with associates who don't know squat and meh customer service vs an intimate enthusiast store with great customer service I'm going to the intimate store every time.  \n\nAgain it's one of the reasons PC people like Microcenters so much.  If you have a Microcenter you don't go to Best Buy.  Well Microcenters are limited, only 25 of them exist.  Imagine if Gamestop's became mini-Microcenters with even better customer service?     \n\n2.  Tie a bunch of exclusives and perks under a membership model that encompasses both the physical shopping experience and e-commerce.  \n\n     Imagine hardware/software packages and upgrade plans.  Buy a Gamestop upgrade subscription plan and with your Gamestop motherboard (just a simple partner deal) Gamestop will allow you to trade out your CPU/GPU every x-number of months/years for a discount.  Maybe even the store associate will install it for free for members?  Who knows.  Lots of options there.  \n\nBuy an item online for quick store pickup?  Maybe members can have their parts tested on the spot so if there is an issue it can be addressed immediately with the great customer service.  Gamers know all the BS with buying PC gaming parts online.  With all the different components it's very common to get at least one defective part that sidelines your whole experience.  You then have to deal with shipping back/etc.  Imagine being able to get it handled same day in person at an intimate store with great customer service?  \n\n\nAgain I think the customer service aspect is HUGE.  You get people hooked with amazing customer service that is linked together for both hardware and e-commerce and you can pull people away from Big Box storms and other online gaming stores with ease IMO.  \n\nAnd honestly you don't even have to pull many of them away do you?  The market is so damn huge.  You don't have to beat the likes of Steam, Microsoft, Sony, etc app stores.  Gamestop's membership plan could allow for cross platform deals.  I mean Gamestop already sells giftcards for streaming services like Steam, etc.  If you're a Gamestop member maybe you get a discount when you buy your digital giftcard for your Steam purchase?  \n\nImagine a e-commerce site with digital gift cards for all the big digital game stores that members get at a discount.  Could you buy the game straight through Steam for $30?  Sure.  Or with your Gamestop Gold Powerpass that same game is $25 via digital giftcard. \n\nAnd on the same website you have you GPU and CPU upgrades that you can go pickup from your local Gamestop same day or next day because you live in a smaller city that doesn't have a Microcenter.  And you like going to Gamestop's now because they have great customer service and if something in your build isn't right you can get it addressed right there.  \n\n\nOf course I'm just a retard but again, you kill it with customer service with an entire eco-system of both hardware and software and then Gamestop will in fact have something that doesn't really exist right now.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Gamestop will be getting a cut of every digital game sold on next-gen XBoxes if those XBoxes were sold at Gamestop.

Obviously that still implies a $20B valuation and that they're still significantly undervalued, but not to the tune of $50B. \n\nAlso hard to believe that a company with zero topline revenue growth would get a 10x revenue multiple, but if you've seen comps in the market I'm all ears. \n\nThere's also significant execution risk in transitioning over to the digital model.

You're building \"castles to the sky\" without really understanding the fundementals of the situation.\n\nI would suggest that you try hard to learn as much as you can in the space before betting on something like this at this stage of the investment. If you were putting money into Overstock.com at $3 a share last year after it got crushed, I could see it. Or maybe Tesla when it was relatively reasonably priced vs the risk because of their debt issues before the pandemic. (If you went far back enough, you could have bought Netflix at an 80% discount after the Quickster debacle; which you could have pitched as a quasi VC-type of investment because at that time a VC actually decided to do a debt offering and buy shares of Netflix as a public company as well.)\n\nBut you are chasing a stock like GameStop because you have some belief that this Ryan guy (who, let's be clear, got kind of lucky because of the pandemic...kind of like how lucky Mark Cuban did when he sold before the internet bubble crashed) can repeat his success in an entirely different business; regardless of how he's pitching it. \n\nA lot of the gains on GME so far have been driven by retards on this sub following the pied piper thinking that there is some magic fairy dust that promises them $100 per share or more in the future. The odds of GME falling back under $20 are far higher than the odds of it increasing to $100 per share. Especially under a Biden / Yellen administration.\n\nMy advice to you is to spend a lot more time learning and reading up on VC. It is very different than stock investing; as I'm sure you are aware. I commend you on your attempt above to really push on yourself to write an analysis and think through everything. Doing so will help you in the future improve your analysis. And over time you might get access to deals and grow your money that way. Rather than gambling on GME shares (Personally I think you'll make more money speculating on Basketball cards this year than GME. Maybe buying rookies of Jerami Grant or Jokic or whatever hot player there is and flipping them. It's the same gamble as doing this play on GME.

If more tourists visit the US that will increase demand for the dollar. If the US increases partnerships again with other countries, that will increase demand for the dollar.

Listen, english isn‚Äôt my first or my second language, i tried my best, suck it up if it ain‚Äôt good enough.\n\n**Citron Research** is a shady as fuck stock commentary website operated by Mr. **Andrew Left**. Now a bit on this autist. In short, Andrew‚Äôs a üåàüêª, in long he‚Äôs a self proclaimed ‚Äú*activist short seller*‚Äù. He was married to Ms. Andrea Left, *her username checked out*. His internet newsletter has been running for 17 years now, and apparently has 50 cases in the company‚Äôs favor since 2001, do the math and you find out that he can fuckin time travel. Now, there‚Äôs a lot of stock commentary websites, newsletters, tv shows and podcasts. Why has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy?  \n\nWhy has Citron Research become such a beacon to attract controversy? Well, dear autists, the self proclaimed ‚Äú*activist*‚Äù we‚Äôre talking about here, who sees himself as a messiah against corporate fraud and market manipulation is reported by NYTimes as follows : ‚ÄúHe can make a killing in a bear market while everyone else on Wall Street suffers.‚Äù His methods of investment are rather questionable and has come under much of the financial world‚Äôs scrutiny.\n\nNow, fellow autists, this part is very important. **This is his strategy**. Reported by NYTimes once again ‚ÄúAfter he places a bet against the price of a stock, he then publishes research designed to torpedo the company‚Äôs value, often by airing accusations of fraud or abuse. This is entirely legal, as long as what he publishes is not itself fraudulent. Left takes short positions in companies across a whole range of industries.‚Äù Keep in mind we are talking about a man that shorted Tesla stock in 2018 and got mad when it didn‚Äôt go his way. So mad that he sued Tesla and Papa Elon for stock manipulation. [Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/06/short-seller-andrew-left-files-class-action-lawsuit-against-tesla-and-elon-musk.html). \n\nSERIOUSLY, THIS DUDE FUCKING SHORTED TESLA AT **$177**, ITS AT **$4,325** TODAY (Pre-Split price). If this wasn‚Äôt enough wait to hear the companies in his ‚Äú*ambitious track record*‚Äù. \n\nSince all of you lack basic correlation skills to connect the dots, let me do it for you fucking losers. What is he doing with GME. Are we not seeing the same pattern here? He is publicly short on GME and is tweeting it. He is known for this kind of manipulation. When he noticed the price had crossed the $43 wall he made it public that he is short GME. He could‚Äôve scheduled the meeting immediately, but no. He scheduled it a day later, now this is perfect for the üåàüêª because, he is literally buying time. Buying time when alot of GME holders are in with their life savings on r/wsb. **24 HOURS IS ENOUGH TIME TO SOW THE SEEDS OF DOUBT AND CAUSE PARANOIA TO PEOPLE WITH THEIR LIFE ON LINE.

Here‚Äôs a notable event on this aucstivist. In 2016, this üåàüêª was banned from the Hong Kong stock market for 5 years over a 2012 report on the firm China Evergrande Group as a result of releasing a report containing ‚Äúfalse and/or misleading claims‚Äù about the above-mentioned company. Forced to pay a little over $720,000 as fines on the profits and legal expenses. He‚Äôs on his last string in HK, after his warning, he could end up in jail for violating once again. [Source](https://www.scmp.com/business/article/2038381/hong-kong-bans-short-seller-andrew-left-market-five-years).\n\n**SCANDAL 2**. This guy is what he swore to destroy at this point wait till you read this. Jumia Technologies ($JMIA : NYSE) is an online e-commerce platform founded out of Nigeria in 2012. They gained a fair amount of traction and went public in Apr 2019. It was received very well and rose from around $25 at opening to $41 within a matter of a few weeks. Everything was well until Shitron Research adopted a short position and saw nothing of its potentials. The report came in accusing Jumia of fraud, torpedo‚Äôing the company downwards. It dropped till approx. $2.80. BUT GUESS WHAT, SURPRISE! SHITRON AND ANDICKREW üåàüêª said they‚Äôre LONG ON THE STOCK. AND THERE‚ÄôS **NO WAY** THEY‚ÄôRE SHORTING AGAIN. This man capitalized on the drop of an e-commerce startup out of Nigeria and is now currently benefitting from the uprise. $JMIA sits at $45.56 as of now. [Source](https://www.theafricareport.com/45712/jumia-short-seller-andrew-left-changes-his-mind-now-buying-the-shares/)\n\nNow these are just 2 scandals that I pointed out because no one on r/wsb seems to be aware of this.

Gamma is useful because it's a shorthand to figure out buying behavior and selling behavior to hedge in price terms.\n\n2 - Gamma is the same anywhere, it's just usually irrelevant to price movements. Usually its just needed to hedge your positions. But accumulated gamma at a position causes synchronized hedging that causes predictable market movements.\n\n3 - Ramp is the presence of gamma making movement along a price range faster due to sychronized hedging. Gamma squeeze is when that happens.\n\n4 - It can actually. Also, when price starts moving fast, it attracts a momentum bid or ask that goes with it.\n\n5 - Dealer is an option dealer AKA market maker. Citadel, those kinds of firms.\n\n6 - Any time an option is created by a dealer, they will typically hedge. The side of the trade will determine the type of hedging. I believe the original contract has to be created by a dealer, but can be resold. \n\n7 - Gamma isn't really positive or negative. Gamma just means the change in delta on your option, and thus the change in price on your opinion. If dealers are short gamma, they buy on price rises, and sell on price declines. If they are long gamma, they do the opposite, and reduce price movements.\n\n8 - On wsb and so forth. Investopedia or whatever too. Some books. Zerohedge sometimes\n\n9 - We don't know, but we can guess when the levels are so elevated. The vast majority of options are going to be hedged, but gamma usually is more neutral because you get the covered calls sold to dealers against the hedging puts purchased from dealers. When there's a lot of speculation though, it's speculative long puts and speculative long calls in the hands of investors, with dealers getting really short on gamma.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Really cool that you're taking this much time to spread this info.

Perhaps we will hit these various ramps downward, and see previous prices in the 20s (although I doubt this), but to say that GME is worth $20 price is completely disregarding their current balance sheet and direction. On fundamentals alone the stock is undervalued by three or four fold, not even counting future thinking in regards to the new direction of the company. It's the exact same mistake that big investors made in shorting Tesla, they didn't consider the future value of having someone like Elon Musk (although these days I do think Tesla is completely over-evaluated even with future thinking). I see the same in Cohen, and once he begins rolling out his direction for GME, the stock will inevitably adjust to not just expected evaluations but future evaluations. Bears have to ignore ALL of the action going on behind the company's management adjustments and board adjustments to maintain their thesis of GME being a $5 to $20 stock.

You guys have hard pivoted from a very clear value thesis, to a very vague growth thesis, with a ton of very bad industry conditions, and no plan to fundamentally get around them. There's a plan to get more profitability, but there's not a plan to get GME to survive a post-disk world, which got delayed, but is still coming. Without that solution, in action, working, I do believe this stock is not worth this kind of value. It could be worth this value with perfect execution on the value thesis, but not more, and you should get paid for the risk. I'd happily own it in the $15 range, and I'd probably buy it in the low $20s in these current trading conditions.

This was never my thesis. I began investing at around $13 and $17 when Cohen showed signs of getting more involved. My personal value thesis has never changed, as I never invested before it was clear that Cohen was getting more involved. So I attribute a lot of future value to GME. Whether that should or should not be representative of a $40 stock price, who's to say. The fundamentals of the the current growth trajectory of the company do say so, and considering the console cycle, which is not just one year, but more in the 4+ year range, this is plenty of time to pivot from GME's original B&M business strategies. More than plenty, seeing how rapid Cohen was able to develop his business Chewy. So, I am not currently invested thinking that GME's current value is at $40 or higher, but rather that being invested, in general, is being invested at the beginning of a company that is bound to turn things around. \n\n>Without that solution, in action, working, I do believe this stock is not worth this kind of value\n\nWell absolutely. But I am certainly not investing for current value, but future value. This is why the stock is at $40, not because of investors seeing current value. If they do, they're retarded.\n\n>and need institutional support to hold this price level\n\nCohen is very likely to get this, and quickly, should he present any half-decent plan to turn GME into a business that does not depend on B&M exclusively, or on console cycles. Burry and Microsoft are invested and involved, respectively, which is a good sign if nothing else. As someone mentioned in a different post, Cohen went and visited 100+ venture capitalists in his mission to fund Chewy. I am sure they are sorely regretting their decision to pass him by, but they know him well now. Institutional support will flood GME, literally flood off the charts, once Cohen and crew can lay out their plan. It's the last piece of the puzzle before this thing can/will take off\n\nalso, for transparency's sake, 920 shares and 5x 4/16 25c", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "If I was not so deep in GME I would be playing BBBY also.
