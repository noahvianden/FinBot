If the stock is actually trading at 80 when you execute your option, congratulations you just made $5 per share. \n\nThe reason that derivatives are so popular is that usually the right to buy shares in the future is linked to the likelihood that the share will hit that price or something higher (for a call option) . Generally this makes the cost to buy that contract relatively low compared to buying actual shares. Therefore your money in can get a lot more money out, hence why they are so popular. \n\nOf course they are much riskier to match the potential reward. If the stock starts at 73 and you buy that 75c from earlier for say $1 premium per share. If the stock jumps up and hits 80 before the contract times out you've just turned every $1 into $5.

{"title": "PSA: This is a good time to be skeptical of EV startups", "selftext": "At the height of the dot-com boom in '99, investors were so caught up in the rise of a new industry that they threw money at anything with a website, regardless of the fundamentals. With the incredible rise of TSLA, I think we are at risk for a similar phenomenon with EV startups. It seems like everyone and their dog has an EV company right now. If you have a website and a flashy design concept, there is a lot of money to be made with investor cash.\n\n**I am not saying don't invest in these startups, but there are a few things to keep in mind:**\n\n* It's incredibly difficult and capital-intensive to start a car company. History is littered with failures in this industry (See Fisker, Faraday Future, Delorean, etc.).\n* Elon Musk is a savvy businessman, shrewd technologist, and a master of publicity. He is the exception among startup CEOs, not the rule. He built Tesla with a diligent plan; and even then barely made it at times (See original roadster launch issues, Model 3 production issues). He is Tesla's greatest asset and we shouldn't assume that his success can be easily replicated.\n* Traditional car companies have been slow to start, but they now realize EVs are the future and are starting to come out with their own models. While EV technology may be new to them, they have a huge advantage in terms of manufacturing infrastructure and expertise that will make it even harder for EV startups to gain foothold in the market.\n\nThe bottom line here is that investors should have realistic expectations about the chance of a new company's success. Investors who missed out on TSLA will be driven by FOMO to throw money at anything with four wheels and a battery. This can attract scammers (See Theranos) who want some of that easy capital. It's smart to be vigilant when there is so much hype around a particular industry.\n\n**TLDR** \\- Invest in whatever makes sense for you, but be cautious and don't let FOMO take control.", "id": "kvirkw", "created_utc": 1610420326.0, "score": 451, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 245, "comments": [{"body": "I just started a EV company.

Let‚Äôs take a look at where Plug Power is going. Mr. Marsh communicates often about Plug‚Äôs future but most people don‚Äôt even understand what he is saying because he can‚Äôt make announcements on specific deals until they are official. An example is on slide #72 of the 2020 Plug Symposium. Mr. Marsh stated they were working with several auto OEM‚Äôs in Europe and deals were expected to be announced soon. The OEM‚Äôs are Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, CNH Industrials, Renault and PSA. The 6th is not shown. We heard about Renault today. I expect to hear about others soon. The slide also shows they are working with Plastic Omnium, Schaeffler and several other 2 tier car suppliers. Mr. Marsh also mentions they want to be the EU leader in Fuel Cell Bus, Trains, Maritime and Aviation. He pointed out that by 2030 there will be 500,000 LCVs (the Renault deal will get some of these), 50,000 trucks and buses, 1,000 fuel cell trains and 3,700 hydrogen refueling stations.\n\nWe are still waiting to hear about the Liquid Hydrogen and Gaseous Hydrogen solutions via onsite electrolyzers Plug is offering to existing customers. Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot, etc.\n\nI expect to hear details on the partners Plug is working with in Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, New Zealand and Australia and India. These partners were also mentioned in the 2020 symposium.\n\nMr. Marsh also mentioned there would be new partnerships for Multi MW systems in various countries.\n\nWe will still hear more about the Walmart logistics expansion that began in August 2020 and will significantly expand in 2021.\n\nWe are also waiting for the new on the 4th pedestal customer and sometime after that, we should hear about the 5th and 6th pedestal customer Plug is working to finalize.\n\nOf course there is also the contra act for data center backup power systems that will also include onsite electrolyzers to produce hydrogen and produce fuel for on road trucks.\n\nLastly, we will hear progress on the regional aviation fuel cell project.\n\nThere will be good news this month on the reason behind finalizing Amazon‚Äôs warrants.\n\nThere are several more things in the works but I need to stop and enjoy a glass of Dewars 12 year old scotch and contemplate increasing my $500 year end share price.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "You had me at Chrispy Critter\n\nEdit: If PLUG is $500 at the end of this year I will poop my pants", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Lmfao seems like a real nice guy, maybe he‚Äôs a connoisseur of fried grasshoppers.\n\nYeah you and me both, really considering taking a larger position in them tomorrow.

How has the growth been?\n\nAt this valuation imo we really need that shit to pop off in the coming years", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla energy is a bit slow to get going. Solar is a really low margin business and prices are pushed way down by fierce competition. Tesla had a lot of installed solar from SolarCity but ramped that down in favor of working on their products with solar roof. The fact that you get a functional roof along with solar power is a really compelling offer for people who are considering roofing costs and would allow Tesla to charge higher margins.\n\nI think they're still in the middle of early ramp, product validation and installer training. We haven't seen any real noticeable growth yet, their solar numbers are varying widely at  27 MW last quarter, 57 MW this quarter, 54 MW in Q4 2019. Solar roof could be growing and normal solar declining which would be really good for margin.\n\nFor storage it's also tricky because their energy storage business directly competes with their automotive segment. I mean in October 2020 Tesla INCREASED the price from $6,500 to $7,000 for their Powerwall 2. They really don't want to sell that many of them currently. For 13.5 kWh it's also charging $520/kWh which is kinda crazy high considering they make the cells for around $100 and that price is excluding installation.\n\nThis [article](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/05/tesla-megapack-powerpack-powerwall-battery-storage-prices/#:~:text=The%20Tesla%20Megapack%20now%20comes,Musk's%20comments%20to%20me%20today) says Megapack is around $200/kWh so Tesla could be pushing that side heavily currently, maybe trying to win favor with the industry. It's also much easier to secure contracts for say 1 GWh storage to be built in 1 year with grid installations.\n\nRight now they have 760 MWh storage deployed and 145k cars sold in Q3. Taking just 75kWh per car as a rough average (Model 3 LR), that's 10,875 MWh going into cars. If you compare that to 2018 Q3 they had 239 MWh storage deployed (+118% vs Q3 2017), and 80k cars. That's 6,000 MWh in cars and 239 MWh in storage, total 6,239 MWh in Q3 2018 vs 11,635 MWh in Q3 2020. \n\nIt's a bit below their \"50% growth\" target with 86% over 2 years, but solving battery production is pretty much their main focus nowadays. Semi, Model S plaid, $25k car, energy deployment, and probably Cybertruck are all locked behind fixing their battery production.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": ">For storage it's also tricky because their energy storage business directly competes with their automotive segment.\n\nhow does it compete with their energy business?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "They both need battery cells.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "thats not how you define competing", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Wikipedia uses this description:\n> Competition arises whenever two or more parties strive for a common goal which cannot be shared: where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a zero-sum game).\n\nSounds like the situation between Tesla automotive and Tesla storage.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "what the fuck are you talking about man? tesla energy is not going to take money from tesla automotive. competition in business refers two separate companies that are both trying to take market share from each other. tesla energy and tesla automotive are both segments of the same company. ultimately they will generate profits for tesla . yes both segments need batteries but that doesn't mean they are competing with each other.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Calm down mate, he was just trying to explain why the original comment was using the word \"competition\".

Otherwise, we add complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road. So, while we do some sort of high-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the batteries to make cars that that we've already got already on our plate.\n\nThis is why the Semi is maybe coming in 2021 instead of 2019 like it was supposed to. \n\nIt should be pretty obvious that making big batteries is limited by number of batteries but from this article,\n\n[https://electrek.co/2020/08/14/tesla-increasing-powerwall-production-elon-musk-delivery-delays-2021/](https://electrek.co/2020/08/14/tesla-increasing-powerwall-production-elon-musk-delivery-delays-2021/)\n\nLong delays, prices just got increased, production is trying to ramp. I'm going to say they're supply constrained. For what is just a big battery in a shell, it's probably batteries being the limiting factor.\n\nSo every kWh Tesla deploys in storage is one kWh in cars on the road and losing them automotive revenue; every kWh in car is one less kWh deployed in storage and losing them energy revenue. It's zero-sum and direct competition in terms of battery supply. From the earlier calculation energy storage is taking around 7% of Tesla's total batteries. \n\nThe point was that Tesla energy is still growing, only the increased production is mostly going into cars. At $520/kWh for a Powerwall with cells costing $100/kWh it's kinda ridiculous. You can buy an entire Model 3 LR for $46.5k, that has 75 kWh for $620/kWh. Once battery is no longer a bottleneck and isn't competing with their automotive segment their energy segment revenue will explode.\n\nSay their car production rate stays fixed and battery production doubles. Tesla puts all spare battery capacity going into storage, then we would see 2 \\* 11,635 MWh total battery production with 10,875 MWh going into cars, and 12,395 MWh going into storage (+1,600% from current).", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah makes sense gotcha", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Strong, scroll down to the \"Energy storage deployed\" chart.\n\n [https://hypercharts.co/tsla](https://hypercharts.co/tsla)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Perfect, ty for the link", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "there should be a decent bump this quarter from the moss landing install. my guess is that as battery production ramps up, there will be a lot of batteries that work, but not well enough to go into cars, so they will be available for storage. \n\nstorage has two main segments, small and large.\n\nsmall, the powerwall, is an overpriced boutique product sold to californians to whom money is no object, or to californians who qualify for an 80% state rebate.\n\nlarge, sold to utilities either because it's cheaper than coal [/gas], or because they can charge it off to ratepayers. storage is at about the model x stage, so hopefully in a few years we'll see more of a model 3 or model y equivalent, as battery prices and battery scarcity fall.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Small clarification: Batteries don't displace coal.

It will act similar to a synthetic position, than once you buy your LEAPS you can start selling OTM calls against your LEAPS, as long as you sell calls above your breakeven on your LEAPS youll never lose if you get assigned.

{"title": "GameStop: Melvin Capital Put Positions", "selftext": "**TLDR: Melvin are fuk when their 51000 FD puts expire on Friday**\n\nIn November u/ronoron, wrote an excellent DD detailing Melvin Capital Put positions on GameStop which you can read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3gn91/people_pumping_gme_melvin_capital_management/). He found that Melvin Capital held a short position of GameStop of 54,000 15 Put Contracts exp Jul 16 2021 equaling their disclosed short exposure of 5,400,000 shares on the [Q3 13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110000090571820001111/0000905718-20-001111-index.htm) form.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short Interest vs. Share Price](https://preview.redd.it/qpoz2i4agra61.jpg?width=3038&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=544c69e831f419afc6cdf5f87853d57b2ac58225)\n\nSince that DD, GameStop has risen to a high of $23.35, Ryan Cohen increased his stake to 12.9% along with obtaining board seats for himself and Chewy CFO and COO. The Q4 13F form for Melvin Capital will be released on February 16 so their concise short exposure isn't public yet.\n\n[Melvin 13F Ending 9\\/30\\/20](https://preview.redd.it/di6hfhz0gra61.png?width=2576&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfb9dd25d1f1a6c9b53fc2f5584fbbcb4ea7d9dc)\n\nThrough the OI on the options chain we can get a decent enough picture of the institutional short positions and which positions Melvin Capital and other Institutions are likely holding. As of EOD Jan 11, the open interest on Melvin Capitals Jul 15p is down 88% to 620. We will see in their new 13F if they fully closed their position however after some further investigation, I believe they rolled their position to Jan 15.\n\nOn the 15 Jan 21 chain, there is significant open interest for the 24 put. Currently 51025 contracts are open which is a similar quantity to Melvins July puts. Melvin Capital is the only institution with such a large put position publicly disclosed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kw0u0igljta61.png?width=1947&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6aa82e353606c84433e230fcc51842de185e823\n\nSecondly, the lower strike puts (Under $10) have significant OI. There is a specific block of puts, strike 5-10, totaling 57155 in open interest. These strikes have disproportionate OI to comparable strikes and other expiration dates. To hedge their long put position of 15 Jan 24 puts, they would open up put debit spreads to cap their max loss and cheapen their positions.\n\nImportantly, their 24 Put FD's are decently fuk. Accounting for the average expected move, their position has an 81% chance of closing ITM. Overall those puts have been destroyed by GME's increase in value and theta decay depending on how long they have held these. If you remember Ryan Cohen just announced his board seat than Melvins position is looking seriously precarious. They cannot easily scape their position right now since they have gone all in on one strike which is significantly illiquid. Trying to sell would crater the bid/ask. They will most likely close out through a block trade with the MM that wrote the options. This way Melvin avoids the liquidity issue on the open market.\n\nAccounting for all of this, todays price action makes a good amount of sense. After the board announcement, the stock rose in PM over 21% briefly before getting crushed. Simultaneously, shares available to borrow on IBKR dried up from 45,000 to just 100 shares. Fidelity experienced similar action. As some commentators have mentioned, yes this is not a full picture of shares available to borrow and institutions have multiple avenues outside retail accessible desks to short. While not an exact view it is still a decent picture of short activity. If someone can see all the shares available through other desks, please comment.\n\nSomeone is going all in trying to keep the price down and it stands to reason it is Melvin, the only institution with FD puts and an underwater position. They have the capital to keep the price down for this week until their position expires and by no means face solvency issue.\n\nShort interest update will be updated tomorrow and I bet it is up bigly. All this selling pressure isn't coming from profit takers especially with such low borrowing availability.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tpuciifxlta61.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f0a371de79cffb21de32edce9d3249b87323a5\n\nThe most important factor here is delta hedging from whichever Market Makers wrote the puts for Melvin.  They are supposed to be delta neutral to avoid conflicts with customer interest. This means they will hedge their short options positions with Delta\\*Contracts number of shares. For the week ending 15 January, the total hedging is disproportionately short at -8124390 shares. Those are all shares MM as an aggregate sold to neutralize their positions. MM's can't sell 8 million shares so they buy further OTM put positions to help neutralize their greeks. Significant OI lower on the chain supports this. Their position of short shares and long puts will be unwound when their short 24 puts are closed out. The significant overall negative delta hedging will cause upward pressure end of week depending on how many shares were sold. In most weeks the overall hedging is fairly even or positive delta (thanks to WSB buying so many calls) but the market is very heavy in puts this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ofix6wdl6y181.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=b57c6b018a1e140e6106d5a5f3be2a3e92df59d6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9m3dysl6y181.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=5081f892b41ba92f5fe6db9f65855d0ad0009f4b\n\nAll of this evidence points towards massive upside for next week. Melvins short selling pressure should be off and a significant degree of institutional buying should be expected as those positions are unwound. Melvin will presumably start unwinding any short stock positions after their puts are closed which will increase upward pressure. Shorts are more fuk than you would believe and if Melvins puts are worthless by Friday the top is blowing off.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nI'm not here to pump and dump any specific dates and strikes.

They have a phenominal new CEO with some Lisa Su level turn around potential.  He is doing everything right.  Cutting garbage unprofitable brands, doing the hype videos and apple/tesla style car releases.  They're focused more on high quality, high margin hype cars than \"lets just produce a bunch of shit\". \n\n They're aiming for a GLOBAL profit margin of 8%.  Sure, they plan on taking a revenue hit, but so far the profits have been growing exponentially and the revenue hasn't been hit very hard.  \n\nRemember, Ford consistently hits 140-150 BILLION in revenue a year.  Currently, they have a 1-2% or abour 3-4 billion in profit a year.  Even if they take a massive hit in revenue, like 25 billion, thats still a minimum of 10 billion dollars profit, and thats only if they don't exceed that.  \n\nThey did something similar after the 2008 crash, and their stock price went 1.80$ a share to nearly 20$ a share.  Remember, just prior to this, they also took a hit from the dotcom bubble crash, when they hit 90$ a share.  As well, in the following 3 years of the 2008 crash, they paid off nearly 70 billion dollars in debt.  Going from 150 Billion, to nearly 80 billion in debt in a very short time. \n\nPersonally, I could easily see this stock hitting a minimum or 15$ by 2022 and 20-30$ by 2023. Getting some WSB momentum behind it could easily raise that number quite a bit.  If it picks up some steam, and their CEO keeps doing everything right, then we could easily see 20$ by 2022.  \n\nAlso, no its not a boomer stock anymore.  They got rid of the dividend for now, which means bigger profits and stock gains, they're producing tons of EV cars, apple style hype car releases, and Lisa Su level CEO comeback story.  \n\nEdit:  JPMorgan just gave it an 11$ PT üöÄüöÄüöÄ  The analyst pump has begun.

KTOS makes rockets, and there's one with our name on it. üöÄ\n\n**Quick Wikipedia Introduction:**\n\n&amp;gt;**Kratos Defense &amp;amp; Security Solutions, Inc**, (NASDAQ: [KTOS](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ktos)), headquartered in San Diego, California,specializes in directed-energy weapons, unmanned systems, satellite communications, cyber security/warfare, microwave electronics, missile defense, training and combat systems.¬†  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Customers include the U.S. federal government, foreign governments, commercial enterprises and state and local government agencies. Kratos is organized into six major divisions:¬†  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Defense and Rocket Support Services¬†  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Microwaves Electronics  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Modular Systems  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Public Safety and Security  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Technology and Training  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Unmanned Systems.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Some of Kratos' newest products are part of a Pentagon effort to partner with innovators and incubate technology-focused businesses in Silicon Valley  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;Kratos has primarily an engineering and technically oriented work force of approximatively 2,700 with a substantial number of the Company's employees holding national security clearances. Virtually all of Kratos' work is performed on a military base, in a secure facility or at a critical infrastructure location. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kratos_Defense_%26_Security_Solutions)\n\n**Why You‚Äôre Really Here**\n\n**October 8th, 2020**, ARK Investment Management LLC filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of **558,726 shares** worth $8,733,000.\n\n**November 30th, 2020**, ARK Investment Management LLC filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of **1,106,685 shares** worth about $21,337,000 USD‚Äîrepresenting a 98% increase in shares and a 144% increase in value in under two months. GUH üöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\nARK recently doubled their stake in KTOS, and they're are not alone in their confidence.¬†\n\nSmart money loves KTOS, as illustrated by their 89.86% institutional ownership:¬†\n\n* Blackrock has a 6.83% stake in the company at 8.3 million shares\n* Vanguard has a 6.55% stake at 8 million shares\n* Fidelity has a 5.36% stake at 6.6 millions shares.¬†[Source](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=KTOS&amp;amp;subView=institutional)\n\nI'm no genius, and neither are you. But I have made myself good money riding the coattails of those with billions at stake and teams of researchers behind them.\n\nThat said, institutional ownership comes as no surprise as far as defense companies go. Instituions love to own them. They‚Äôre safe investments. The military's got deep pockets and smart money knows never to bet against America.¬†\n\nHowever, Kratos is not just any old Defense and Aerospace company. There is a reason that ARKQ [added 153,098 shares to their fund just last week.](https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-ktos)\n\n**Like GRWG, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions has spent the last ten years gobbling up their competition.** Six acquisitions and one merger later, the frequency of their contracts reflect their place as a leader in military tech development:\n\n* December 8th, 2020: [Kratos Receives $37.7 Million Skyborg Program Contract Award from USAF Advanced Aircraft Office](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-receives-377-million-skyborg-program-contract-award-usaf)\n* December 10th, 2020: [Naval Air Systems Command Exercises Option for an Additional $38.7 Million for Full Rate Production (Lot 2) of the BQM-177A Subsonic Aerial Target System](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/naval-air-systems-command-exercises-option-additional-387)\n* December 21st, 2020: [Kratos Receives $17.8 Million Contract Modification Related to XQ-58A Valkyrie from USAF Research Laboratory](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-receives-178-million-contract-modification-related-xq-58a)\n* December 28th, 2020: [Naval Air Systems Command Exercises Option for an Additional $3.6 Million to Kratos for Contractor Logistics Support &amp;amp; Engineering Services for the BQM-177A Subsonic Aerial Target System](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/naval-air-systems-command-exercises-option-additional-36-million)\n* December 29, 2020: [Kratos Awarded Contract Modification Valued at $22 Million to Provide Satellite Command and Control System Sustainment](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-awarded-contract-modification-valued-22-million-provide)\n* December 30, 2020: [Kratos C5IS Business Receives $10.5 Million in National Security Related Program Orders](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-c5isr-business-receives-105-million-national-security)\n* Januray 4, 2020: [Kratos Receives $11 Million Development Contract for Next Generation Satellite Program](https://ir.kratosdefense.com/news-releases/news-release-details/kratos-receives-11-million-development-contract-next-generation)\n\nKratos‚Äô acquisitions have allowed it to develop proprietary technologies that are sold as products. Not only that, but as many of the above contracts show, they are also being paid üöÄ buku bucks üöÄ to maintain and service the products and tech that they sell.\n\nBut ok yeah, sure, they produce: disposable missiles made for aerial target practice, small sUAS swarming drones, satellites, radios, and augmented reality simulation training systems and microwave electronics‚Äîbut that is not what grabbed my attention and surely not what grabbed the attention of Cathie Ark.¬†\n\nReady for the kicker? Say it with me now:\n\n**Ground Vehicle Automation**\n\n&amp;gt;The Kratos Multi-Platform Appliqu√© Kit (M-PAK) is the next generation of Ground Vehicle automation. The system can be used to quickly and easily convert your existing fleet of standard human-driven vehicles into optionally-manned systems that can be driven in manned or unmanned modes. M-PAK is a scalable system that can be used as a stand-alone vehicle mobility kit or sensors can be added to offer various levels of autonomy‚Ä¶ M-PAK allows for a semi-permanent installation in a vehicle, which releases the user from committing to one vehicle platform or a particular vehicle.\n\nThese two developments are why Cathie bought up KTOS for ARKQ. These vehicle conversion kits also represent Kratos‚Äô foray into the commercial space. Their ground vehicle automation kits, originally used to safely lead military convoys, are now used to man impact-absorbing trailers behind slow-moving highway construction vehicles. Up until recently, the job of driving the impact truck was filled by some poor employee. Now, with Kratos‚Äô product, this job can be completely automated, with the GPS-guided computer safely trailing whatever work vehicle it is instructed to.¬†[Source](https://www.kratosdefense.com/systems-and-platforms/unmanned-systems/ground/autonomous-truck-mounted-attenuator)\n\nBasically, you can turn any truck into a completely independently acting, simple, autonomous vehicle with the installation of this semipermanent kit.\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n**Sea Surface Vehicle Automation**¬†\n\n&amp;gt;Kratos \\[has also\\]developed a number of vehicle control systems that are easily installed and quickly convert most human-driven seaborne vessels to unmanned systems.  \n&amp;gt;  \n&amp;gt;The Kratos C2 is currently in use and supporting mission operations for the U.S. Navy and Army utilizing the High-Speed Maneuvering Surface Target (HSMST), which was developed in response to a requirement for a 40+ knot target to represent littoral threats encountered by the fleet and which would retain 35 kt capability in advanced sea states. [Source](https://www.kratosdefense.com/products/uav/land-and-sea/sea-surface-vehicle-automation)\n\nSo they‚Äôre making boat drones too.¬†\n\nMilitarily, these unmanned sea surface vehicles can be used against seaborne targets and mine hunting. Commercially, the tech being developed by Kratos may have applications in cargo shipping, seaweed farming, and data collection.\n\n**Most Importantly**\n\nIn terms of the fundamentals, **tomorrow, January 13, there will be a virtual conference during which time they will be exhibiting some more of their new tech.** I believe that they will play into the recent EV/AI hype and focus on these automation kits and their potential foray into the commercial space. With some good media coverage, I think this could be a very positive catalyst for the stock. I tried calling investor relations to ask some questions, but they dubbed my calls. **Big dick energy. Bullish.**¬†üöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n&amp;gt;President &amp;amp; CEO, Eric DeMarco, and its Executive VP &amp;amp; CFO, Deanna Lund, will present at the 23rd Annual Needham Virtual Conference on January 13th at 11:30am Eastern.

But there is a whole other dimension to the automobile industry other than cars that HAS NOT been electrified yet, and that this company has a first-mover advantage on (just like NIO and TSLA did): **The medium-heavy duty vehicles.**\n\nToday, I present you with an opportunity to be early to this party featuring the sleeping giant that is:\n\n#LION ELECTRIC ($NGA)\n\nIt is currently trading under the SPAC ticker $NGA with a merger completion set for the end of Q1. \n\n**That‚Äôs right, by buying 1 share of $NGA right now, you are effectively buying 1 share of Lion Electric.** \n\nLet me preface this post by saying that [Lion Electric](https://thelionelectric.com/en) has been working on their vehicles, battery technology, and charging grids since 2010 and ALREADY HAS VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. So no, they are not some shambolic ponzi scheme of an EV company (looking at you NKLA). In fact, it literally has the [largest fleet of electified school buses](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/largest-zero-emission-school-bus-fleet-in-north-america-bolstered-by-10-bus-delivery-from-lion-electric-301194935.html#:~:text=The%20Lion%20Electric%20Co.&amp;amp;amp;text=With%20these%20new%20buses%2C%20Twin,school%20buses%20in%20its%20fleet.) on the road in North America as we speak. \n\n#[Here is the link to their investor presentation where they are already forecasting a positive EBITDA by the end of 2021. Highly recommend skimming over it, but I will highlight the main points later on in the post for yall anyways.](https://pages.thelionelectric.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Investor-Presentation_20203011.pdf)\n\n\n\n#*So why haven't I FUCKING heard about this \"Lion Electric\" company?*\n\nSimple answer: it's a Canadian company located in Quebec. No company outside of 'Murica or China can be of interest right? ***RIGHT????*** Well, the EV credits and subsidies in Quebec are fucking great, but other than that you are right for once, idiot. The good thing is that it ain't gonna be Canadian-based much longer. Lion is going to reveal its new U.S. manufacturing facility any day now, rumored to be in [Michigan](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-lion-electric-co-to-deliver-michigans-first-11-electric-school-buses-as-part-of-the-volkswagen-mitigation-settlement-300917333.html) where it delivered the state's first ever 100% electric school buses. Lion Electric, in fact, are already [registered as a business](https://michigan-company.com/co/the-lion-electric-co-usa-inc) in Michigan. Oh, and it just so happens that the rumored factory location is right in between two Amazon factories, and is not a mere coincidence (see more below on why this is pertinent). Anyhow, their future clearly lies in the United States, and they are uplisting as LEV on the NYSE when the [merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210104005149/en/Northern-Genesis-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Filing-by-The-Lion-Electric-Company-of-a-Preliminary-Registration-Statement-on-SEC-Form-F-4-in-Connection-With-Their-Proposed-Business-Combination) with NGA closes in March, as per the CEO. Seriously, look at how many job listings are posted across America by Lion Electric by clicking [here](https://emploislion.com/en/jobs).\n\n\n\n#*So, why the actual FUCK should I care?* \n\n\n**Because fucking Jeff Bezos and Joe Biden care, idiot.** \n\n\nNews silently broke last week that **AMAZON** has come to an agreement to purchase up to 500 of Lions class-6 and class-8 delivery trucks per year from 2021-2025 (or up to 2500 over 5 years). Emphasis on 'silently' because this company, unlike many, lets their results do the talking rather than a PR team of slimy fuckers. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that Amazon has the option to purchase at least **2500 trucks per year (conservative number), or 1.1b worth** for the five years following 2025, with a possibility of acquiring up to [15.8% of the company](https://stnonline.com/news/school-bus-production-to-benefit-from-amazon-agreement-lion-electric/). \n\n**Yup. Amazon are in bed with Lion Electric, and you should be too.** \n\nAnd, before anyone asks, the Tesla semi-truck serves entirely different purposes. No point in comparing apples to oranges. Tesla's truck is specialized for a single purpose: long distance delivery from warehouse to retail. **The Lion-8 and Lion-6 delivery trucks are much more versatile, will be used by Amazon to deliver between Amazon's facilities, and most importantly they are ready for MASS SCALE PRODUCTION**. So no, idiot, they are not competing against the Tesla semi and will fill different voids in the market. [See here how diversified their truck lineup really is.](https://imgur.com/nJiXzp8)\n\n#*And what about Joe Biden?* \n\n**Sleepy Joe and his Clean Energy Plan have vowed to [electrify 500,000 school buses](https://thenextweb.com/shift/2020/11/14/what-bidens-environmental-plans-mean-for-electric-vehicles-syndication/) over the next 4 years**\n\nNO COMPANY is better positioned to take a huge piece of that pie than Lion Electric. If that seems like a stretch to you, consider this: the CEO of Lion, Marc Bedard, will be speaking at a virtual event on the future of E-mobility this Wednesday (Jan 13), [where the Co-chair of Biden's Infrastructure Committee will be in attendance](https://my.demio.com/ref/vFksZ11nZGvHsaxG). Allow me to show you what the Lion Electric buses look like, and what their clients think of them, highlighted by [this fine gentleman](https://youtu.be/StpnGrItO4E?t=46) from California labelling them as the **Rolls Royce and Tesla of school buses**. \n\nI‚Äôm sure many of you will be aware of the merger completed today with Proterra, another electric bus manufacturer. Awesome right? [A real shame that, in their investors presentation, they did not compare their revenue projections to Lion's past the year 2021, as they would've admitted to being second best.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820630/000121390021001584/ea133141ex99-2_arclight.htm?fbclid=IwAR0X17En3iZX-fZhuNAneJG2lDvOX_pT-OcKlXVbKWmnAMFtuNbUsrqA4M0) \n\n\n**Proterra are also exclusively a bus play, while Lion expects nearly 90% of its revenue by 2024 to be from trucks. In fact, Lion's revenue from their trucks ALONE in 2024 is projected to trump Proterra's entire revenue in 2025.**\n\nAnyhow, none of these companies have anywhere near the capacity to electrify 25% of the American school bus fleet by themselves in 4 years. So I assure you that Lion will be providing buses to Biden over the next 4 years, as will Proterra probably, since there are only 3 players that are READY in the industry to be in on this.\n\n\n\n#*Why should I be buy RIGHT FUCKING NOW?*\n\n**Because tomorrow may very well be the last chance to get in $NGA under 30$.**\n\nJim Cramer is inviting Marc (the CEO) onto **Mad Money** [TOMORROW](https://i.redd.it/ucl54g5avaa61.jpg) after it was initially scheduled last week, but the events in Washington forced a postponement. A blessing in disguise for everyone really, and a final chance to get in before this it takes off. NGA is still trading at a measly 1B valuation, with Amazon ALONE forecasted to purchase more than 1b worth of trucks per year come 2025. Marc is going to pump the tits out of Lion on Mad Money, and Cramer is going to eat all of it up, as this company is the real deal. \n\n**How do I know $NGA will get its tits pumped?** The CEO of Lion featured on a [local news podcast](https://www.fm93.com/audio/361623/marc-bedard-pdg-de-lion-amazon-dispose-a-acheter-des-camions-du-producteur-quebecois?fbclid=IwAR1N4Kr0eX-nLjr2-VThUCUVcGIwRlL0ZpC7Abpic7fQY7In4BbJqz7Y7jE) last week and boasted about the Amazon deal as well as their advantage over competition in electrifying buses and trucks, **comparing Lion to Tesla in the process**. Unfortunately, he said all of this in French, which I'm sure none of you idiots understand. But once he regurgitates it all in English to Jim Cramer, the significant deal with Amazon and its similarities to Tesla in its infancy are sending this üöÄüåöüöÄ. \n\n**Oh yeah, and, by the way, the last time Cramer hosted a CEO from an up and coming EV merger acquisition (CIIC), that stock went from 21$-37$ in the two following trading sessions.**\n\n\n\n#*But why should I pick Lion Electric over all the other EV stocks that get FUCKING spammed here?*\n\n\n\n**Because Lion Electric offers much more than just prototypes, ideas, and false hopes**\n\n\n\n¬∑ There are currently 7 different [trucks and buses](https://imgur.com/L1cu6oS) **available for purchase**\n\n\n¬∑ They already have **300+ vehicles on the road** today with over \n  6mil miles between them \n\n\n¬∑ Multi-year deal agreement for **Amazon** to purchase up to \n  2500 vehicles (Lion6 and Lion8) 2021-2025, with even bigger \n  and more lucrative opportunities afterwards\n\n\n¬∑ **CN (huge Canadian transporter)** recently Purchased 50 \n  trucks - with a chance to increase size of order later\n\n\n¬∑ **Government-backed**: [Canada's prime minister Justin \n  Trudeau supports the company](https://imgur.com/xoJ9Kze), \n  while nationalized companies like Hydro Quebec and SAQ have \n  purchase agreements in place that provide a strong foundation \n  for Lion's business\n\n\n¬∑ **Produce their own batteries:** on top of already having suppliers for their batteries, Lion is \n  building a facility to and immunize themselves against potential shortages as they upscale \n  production, set to be completed in 2022\n\n\n¬∑ **V2G technology** ready for the batteries, and implemented \n  into their school buses\n\n\n¬∑ Deals with **BMW, ChargePoint, Nuvve, and Romeo Power**\n\n\n¬∑ **[8 NEW vehicles](https://imgur.com/dFFTczt)** to be produced between 2021-2022 \n  including: Ambulance, bucket truck, Class 5 and Class 7 trucks\n\n¬∑ [USA expansion](https://imgur.com/wFbrle5) completed by \n  2022, will give them a **\"Made in America\"** image\n\n\n¬∑ NKLA *obviously* had to [scrap their deal on the table with Republic Services](https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/23/tech/nikola-garbage-truck- \n  canceled/index.html) to \n  provide them with up to **5000 garbage disposal trucks** just a \n  few weeks ago. Who could possibly fill the void and has a ZERO EMISSION\n  refuse truck ready for purchase? Lion Electric, that's \n  who.
