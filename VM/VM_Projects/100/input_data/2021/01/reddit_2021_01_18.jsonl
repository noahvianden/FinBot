And I certainly don't want to turn this into a pissing match, because I'm no expert on \"the future,' nor am I an expert on EV technology.\n\nWhat I do know is a couple of things. One is that most people, given the option, would probably prefer to not spend any more time at a convenience store than necessary, and maybe none at all if that were an option. And second, unlike gasoline which requires underground storage tanks at the point that it is dispense, electricity has no such limitation and can be dispensed anywhere.\n\nThose two facts open up a world of possibilities. Charging stations can be placed anywhere and certainly don't need to have a convenience store or similar type of business associated with the point of dispensation.

That alone will cause a significant drop in the amount of revenue for these places.  A high range vehicle combined with recharging stations at places like hotels, restaurants and other \"destination\" type places will decrease the need for them even more.\n\nI'm not predicting the total demise of convenience stores. On long trips, people will still want a place convenient to the highway exit ramp to stop, take a potty break and grab a quick snack; and if they can get a partial or full charge in the process, then that's good, too.

The first thing to point out would be that nowadays nobody uses evolutionary algorithms because they kinda suck. Secondly the optimization method of a neural network has nothing to do with the actual neural network.\n\nHow you actually train neural networks is with gradient decent. You have a loss function and for each training example you backpropagate the error by calculating the partial derivative of each parameter in the neural net. You then know get a n dimensional gradient for how all n parameters should be adjusted to reduce the error.\n\nWith stochastic gradient descent you tweak each parameter according to their partial derivative in order to decrease the loss until you hit a local minimum and the loss stops descending.\n\nI guess the point is actually that this has nothing to do with the live performance of the neural networks.

This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound.

I'm going to assume that he just bought $17,500 worth of gourd. So with that said, he bought approximately 3150 kgs of gourd which when converted to lbs is 6944. Im going to round that up to 7000 to make my life easier. Assuming that the average size of the gourds are 6-7 inches in diameter based on him saying that some are bigger I'm just going to average out the weight of each gourd to be 2.5lbs. Dividing that by the total weight of gourds that he bought would net you around 2800 individual gourds. Now with that in mind, you can fit around ten gourds in a GE spacemaker microwave box (source: another sketchy gourd website). That would be TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BOXES OF GOURDS.

BB has potential to moon, but I think a lot of you will still manage to lose money, because you are picking wrong strategies.\n\n**The problem**\n\nI know this sub is obsessed with short term OTM calls. However by buying these you are doing no justice to yourself and this community.\n\nLet me explain. Have you ever wondered who sells you these calls? I'll tell you. Big guys and by big guys I'm talking billion dollar financial institutions that we call **market makers**. Market maker does not care which stock, what strike, how many 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 we put here - all they care about is to **make money by selling you calls.**\n\nMarket makers are very good at managing risk. Whenever they sell calls, they make sure they have the underlying stock. That way, they essentially sell **covered calls** instead of **naked calls**.\n\nWhen you look at the option table, you will notice a column called **Open Interest**. It basically tells you have many option contracts are out there in the wild. Think about this as a number of retards holding these in their Robinhood account, hoping to get rich quickly.\n\nMarket makers love when there is a big hype around certain stock, especially certain strike and date. They sell these calls to you retards, and all they have to do as the expiration date nears is make sure **the stock stays below the most popular strike**, aka **strike with the most open interest**.\n\nWhy would they do that? Because they **make free money** by selling you these worthless gambling short term tickets.\n\nHow would they do this? By shorting the stock. Remember they are so big that they can afford to short the stock and suppress the price of the stock **in the short term** just in time for **your short term calls to expire worthless**.\n\nI know some of you geniuses will tell me that market makers can't manipulate the stock in the short term; sure keep telling yourself that while you ride in your 2010 Toyota Corolla.\n\n**You are easy targets**\n\nOver 11,000 of you idiots, bought $12 February calls. Don't believe me? Check it yourself: [https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1350903153433128967/photo/1)\n\nAll market makers have to do now, is make sure BB does not moon past $12 by February 19 and they are set.

Imagine you bought a slightly out of the money option on a stock, and it never moves. Your option is worth less and less as time passes, because there is less and less time for it to hit your strike price.\n\nAnd the way theta decay works is that for a long dated option, it loses value rather slowly. If your option expires in 2 years, it changes very little if a week passes. If your option expires in 2 weeks, it's a huge fucking deal if a week passed. So the former option barely drops in price, and the latter option drops like a rock. That's how theta decay accelerates as you near expiry.\n\nSo the whole point of LEAPs is to buy options so far out it decays very slowly, so you're basically just holding 100 stocks at a cheap price for, say, half a year or so.

{"title": "GameStop Monday Notes - The Rocket is fueling up 🚀🚀🚀🥜", "selftext": "# It has been a wild ride so far - and it gets crazier by the day...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0rczw3dcp3c61.jpg?width=260&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75a07e89ddbff71469b8e33ea7c26393d3216a35\n\nHoly \\*\\*\\*\\* everyone! After my post on Friday explaining why that day's dip wasn't problematic a lot of things have happened. Once again, **thank to everyone for holding the line**!!! And also thanks to **everyone who keeps buying into the cause**. Stay put (aka don't press the f\\*cking sell button)... Keep in mind, that not only are we likely to make big dollars but we are also protecting 45,000 people who work at a company that was important in many people's childhoods - and soon will be relevant for future generations again. Without further ado, here are the updates regarding GameStop:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 📅 A Summary of GameStop's moon mission\n\n***GENERAL INFORMATION***:\n\n* At this point we have many different investors that are in it for the long term (sorted by investment size): **Fidelity** (including their Intrinsic Opportunities Fund), Daddy Cohen's **RC Ventures**, **Blackrock**, **Susquehanna**, the OG u/DeepFuckingValue, and of course us *fellow retards* \\- among others\n* GameStop is still a Fortune 500 company which operates as the **WORLD'S LARGEST MULTICHANNEL VIDEO GAME RETAILER**\n* The firm has huge potential for expansion (including in ecommerce) as the **video game market is valued at $160 billion dollars** with an estimated **Compound Annual Growth Rate of 12.9%** (according to *Grand View Research).*\n\n***SHORT INFORMATION (Ortex Estimates; exact Updates not for another week)***:\n\n* *Estimated short interest*: \\~72 Million (decreased after spike but still up from 2020 EOY)\n* *Estimated short float*: still at \\~**101%+** (other estimates as high as 180%)\n* GameStop is still on the **SEC threshold list for 28th consecutive days**\n* Cost to borrow increased by an estimated 14.2%\n* Around 80% to 85% of shorts were likely shorted with a stock price under $20  ❗ ❗\n\n***NEWS***:\n\n* Jim Cramer acknowledged that the short busting seems to be working\n* Fidelity, IBKR and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated/limit margin on $GME (heavily limiting short sellers)\n* Outgoing board members sold a total of nearly $20 Million dollars in stock on Friday sending the stock tumbling bc of the news. Having that said,  💎 **✋ s** saved the stock from a potential panic selloff\n* **Ryan Cohen Tweeted yesterday (1/17): Peanut Emoji & GIF saying \"So you're telling me there's a chance\".** The actual meaning remains unclear but many interpreted this as his confirmation that there is a chance for an infinity squeeze 🥜🥜🥜\n* Multiple sources have confirmed that PC-Building Stations are coming in near future (mini microcenter-style)\n* Uptick rule (SEC 210) is in effect until at least EOD Tuesday\n* **$GS2C (Frankfurt) is up nearly 17% at the time** of writing this DD (on a NYSE holiday)\n* Webull and Etoro disabled shorting $GME\n\n***OTHER FACTORS***:\n\n* There are talks about **potential margin calls** (which would strongly affect shorts)\n* Additional stimulus potential will increase the WSB meme buy\n* u/TitusSupremus DD post ended up on Reddit's popular page (with 300+ awards and 11k+ upvotes) making it inevitable for Reddit users outside of this sub to miss out on this. (This play has literally reached the Front Page of the \"Front Page of the Internet\")\n\n**News about GameStop seem to be never-ending. This renders technical analysis nearly irrelevant as well. Despite some major publications releasing a bearish outlook on the firm, the bullish signs are overwhelming**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 🔮 Outlook over the coming days:\n\n* Expect yet another highly **volatile day/week on the market**. Be careful with options at the moment; shares are likely the way to go and will also help the cause more...\n* There is no doubt that the **potential for another squeeze exists** (maybe even a legendary MOASS)!!!\n* Even if the squeeze does not happen (for whatever reasons) this stock is an **absolute value buy**, as many people before me have explained here. Another reason to go with shares rather than options!\n\n**As long as idiots don't 📄✋ there is a fairly low potential for downside and HIGH POTENTIAL FOR LARGE UPSIDE on the LONG POSITION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 🐻 Media Outlets, Melvin & other short sellers\n\nI feel like I am a broken record, but GameStop is here to stay. I know WallStreetBets will never change your mind but if you were honest you would go back an analyze past short squeezes.\n\nLet's take the example of KBIO's 10,000% squeeze:\n\n* KBIO was entirely defunct and insolvent unlike **GME which actually has an amazing opportunity in a fast-growing space**. The childhood memories of most American's and brand recognition alone play a huge factor. Plus, their subsidiaries are solid as well!\n* **Fundamentals don't matter in these situations**... it's a result of a variety of different factors that cause a short squeeze, and now you have an unprecedented influence: bullish individuals who will never give up - aka us!\n* Most squeezes undergo a similar sequence of events:\n\n1. Shares are **massively over-shorted** (over 100% is banned by some governments for a reason)\n2. **Big news regarding the overhaul** of the firm (happened with RC ventures buying in and overhauling board control)\n3. Forced **borrow recall** and/or margin removal (this already started)\n4. An actual squeeze happens as **panic breaks out** among short sellers - it's just a matter of time before someone starts folding (BTW, doubling down on shorts in this case is a horrible bet and has barely ever gone well after a squeeze)\n\n* News Outlets and analysts tend to focus on patterns or traditional methods of pricing stocks. There is no way to say that this will be a good stock to short and therefore short selling downside far outweighs the upside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EASY TO SHORT does not mean EASY TO COVER. Now it's time to realize that SHORTING THIS STOCK WAS A HORRIBLE IDEA and in fact STILL IS A HORRIBLE IDEA. For institutional and retail short sellers alike: you may see the same consequences as $KBIO short sellers did - many of which went bankrupt. LONG POSITIONS are the way to go.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: For everyone who is new to this, please be aware that options have low impact on share prices and that volatility (among many other things) plays a huge factor in your trades. Be careful with your trades and always do your own due diligence. This is for educational purposes only.\n\nPS: 🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nPPS: Now would be the perfect time for an announcement by GME for future plans. Even a small announcement relating to a technology-shift will slingshot-launch our moon mission. Maybe a potential for that happening as GameStop canceled appearance at ICR?? This is a big maybe, hence just a note as PPS...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions: 190 shares (for the long run), 5 1/22 $38c (very risky and make up full reinvestment of my calls that printed last week) - will buy more shares tomorrow morning\n\n# CAN'T STOP, WON'T STOP, GAMESTOP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Over the weekend we have seen more bullish signs than anticipated. Even if we don't see a squeeze, we for sure have a value stock on our hands. $GME goes to the moon no matter what...\n\nEdit: GME Mexico is up 24.4% as of 12:15 ET 🚀🚀🚀\n\nEdit 2: Cramer just tweeted saying we are already on the moon. Keep in mind he was wrong about $GME before - and we showed him!!! And guess what... we will fucking do the same thing again\n\nEdit 3: For the people who are tracking non-us GME: Mexico is up 40% and Frankfurt (aka Germany) is up 15.9% as of 1:15 ET 🥜🥜🥜\n\nEdit 4: As of 4.45 PM, iBorrowDesk has reported a borrowing cost of 54.1% (a nearly 80% increase)", "id": "kzxdlq", "created_utc": 1610985604.0, "score": 1026, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 494, "comments": [{"body": "Idk how long I can keep edging like this, I’m ready to bust!", "score": 435, "replies": [{"body": "The extra day we spent having to build up our cum will only make Tuesday all that more glorious", "score": 145, "replies": [{"body": "No 🥜 Monday is giving me 🌈🐻 balls 😫", "score": 69, "replies": [{"body": "No 🥜 monday. \n\nI love it.

[https://www.cboe.com/insights/post/57/](https://www.cboe.com/insights/post/57/) As those election hedges expire, they provide a \"Vanna\" flow, which is volatility decay in options pricing which in turn has market makers (the people selling you options) buying back stonks as they dynamically rehedge [https://spotgamma.com/options-vanna/](https://spotgamma.com/options-vanna/) (im gonna be honest I barely understand this concept). I'm sure a lot of you noticed how much the market spiked up Nov 4th even though the election wasn't close to resolved = that was an artifact of these election hedges expiring which in turn causes market makers to buy delta uppies in indices as they unwind from their hedges.\n\nThis last week was the first week where the last of the election vanna from these flows was cut in half, and what did we see? A mildly red week. Next week vanna flows will be gone, and there will be a two week window where the market will be without these flows since we're entering a 5 week opex cycle. No big deal right?

Instead, shorts could be unwound slowly over a substantial time period, during which time the stock would steadily rise. Even a substantial rise sometime in the next few days may not be a sign of a short squeeze and could be followed by further increases in price.\n\nThe VW squeeze that is commonly referenced was a special case with Porsche acquiring 74% of VW and per German regulations, a German state permanently held 20%. [1] As an alternative example, consider TSLA, which cost short sellers $38 billion in 2020, despite the stock not having a dramatic short squeeze spike. [2]\n\nIt's totally reasonable to sell once the stock exceeds some target price, but I think that should be based on your opinion of the long term value of the stock.
