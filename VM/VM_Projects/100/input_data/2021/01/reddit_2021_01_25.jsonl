Even if they are getting a great deal from the local utility, it's such a small expense in the grand scheme of things.\n\n**Engineering Talent**\n\nIt's not like they'd have to take engineers from Model Y, Cybertruck, or Solar Tiles to install fairly standard solar panels. I don't see this as a likely reason.\n\n**Quarterly Results**\n\nI suspect this might have the highest impact. Although completing the install would not big hit compared to revenue, Tesla has been fighting to be profitable for some time. Perhaps it was decided that the benefits of having a renewably powered factory were outweighed by increasing the chances of posting consecutive profitable quarters.\n\n**Looking Forward**\n\nTesla will likely post its 6th consecutive quarterly profit tomorrow, culminating in its first profitable fiscal year. I'm hoping this will eliminate any barriers to finally completing the solar roof and also transitioning to a 100% sustainably powered factory. It will be a beautiful day when we can say that the packs and components coming out of Giga Nevada are not created with any fossil fuels, onsite or off. It will probably have an immaterial effect on demand, but it is an important accomplishment that reflects Tesla's values and helps combat FUD, the latter of which will become increasingly important with this new administration and its programs.\n\nWould love some input on potential barriers, how soon you think they'll finish the roof, when they'll complete the transition, and the benefits.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Barrier is that it is not the most efficient use of their capital right now.

He has blocked Tesla workers‚Äô attempts to unionize at his U.S. factories, and in the 2018 Congressional elections, he donated far more generously to Republican candidates than Democrats, including tens of thousands of dollars in a failed attempt to keep Republican control of the House of Representatives.\n\nHe clashed with California‚Äôs Democratic leaders last May, by keeping Tesla‚Äôs Fremont factory running, in violation of the state‚Äôs lockdown orders. Asked last September whether he intended voting for Trump or Biden, he again ummed and ahed.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm, to be totally frank, I‚Äôm not, I mean, I think‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just see how the debates go‚Ä¶‚Äù he told the New York Times‚Äô Kara Swisher. He said he was ‚Äúsocially very liberal, and then economically right of center, maybe, or center.‚Äù\n\nBut with Biden now in the White House, Musk says he is all in, and over the moon about the sea change in Washington.\n\n**‚ÄúI think this is great. I feel very optimistic about the future of sustainable energy with the new administration,‚Äù he told Fortune. ‚ÄúNot that we should get complacent or anything, but the wind is at our back for solving the climate crisis with the new administration.‚Äù**\n\nThat finally signals an irreconcilable split from Trump, after years of the two men circling each other‚Äôs orbit.\n\nRight after Trump was elected in 2016, Musk flew to meet the President-elect at Trump Tower in New York. He was hardly the only tech titan seeking Trump‚Äôs attention. The Trump Tower gathering was a who‚Äôs who of major tech figures, including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Alphabet then-CEO Larry Page, and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.\n\nBut Musk appeared to have closer support from Trump than others. He pitched Trump on at least one key initiative‚Äîthe SpaceX mission to Mars, which ‚ÄúTrump jumped at,‚Äù according to ‚ÄúFire and Fury,‚Äù Michael Wolff‚Äôs book on Trump‚Äôs early White House days. And he agreed to sit on Trump‚Äôs economic advisory board and on his manufacturing jobs initiative council, remaining in place even after then-Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quit when Trump signed an executive order blocking visas from Muslim-majority countries.\n\nMusk quit those boards only months later, when Trump announced he was pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which 180 countries signed in 2015.\n\nMusk says now that that move was for him the final straw. As the head of the world‚Äôs leading electric-car company, he could no longer align himself so openly with a President who eschewed global climate policy. Within hours of being sworn in as President, Biden signed an executive order last Wednesday rejoining the Paris Agreement.\n\nBut why did Musk align himself with Trump in the first place?\n\n‚ÄúI said‚Ä¶ it is very important that we address the climate crisis and everything,‚Äù Musk tells Fortune. ‚ÄúI took him pretty much at his word, that he would really mean it.‚Äù\n\nNow, he says he is waiting to get involved again as Biden begins to put in place detailed environmental policies, which are sure to be starkly different from Trump‚Äôs, including an accelerated shift to electric vehicles and renewables.\n\nMusk says he has ‚Äúnot wanted to‚Äù reach out yet to Biden. ‚ÄúThey have had a lot to do,‚Äù he laughs. But he says aides are already in informal contact with the White House. ‚ÄúMy team, being very pro-environment, they know a lot of people that Biden is bringing in.‚Äù\n\nOnce those White House officials are ready, Musk says, ‚Äúwe will do our best to be helpful to the new administration with respect to climate.‚Äù", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "paywalled any chance you can paste here?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "edited", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "thank you!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Where you find this?

Here's a guide: https://www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012  \n  \nThe highlights are:  \n> An option is a contract giving the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (in the case of a call) or sell (in the case of a put) the underlying asset at a specific price on or before a certain date.  \n> A stock option contract typically represents 100 shares of the underlying stock, but options may be written on any sort of underlying asset from bonds to currencies to commodities.  \n  \nIf you buy a Call (which most people here are doing) you are buying the right but not obligation to purchase 100 shares at a certain price (the Strike Price) on or before a certain date, and for that right you give the seller some money (the Premium) to make it worth their while.  If you sell a Call you have the reverse: the obligation to sell 100 shares at the Strike price if the buyer chooses to exercise the Call.  \nCall are bullish for the buyer (they expect the price to rise) and bearish or neutral for the seller (they expect the price to stay below the Strike Price so the contract expires worthless, OR they are setting a price at which they will be happy to exit their position (because they get the premium plus the sale of the shares).  \nPuts are the reverse.  Buying a Put gives you the right to *sell* 100 shares to the seller, and selling a put gives you the obligation to buy 100 shares.  Puts are bearish for the buyer and bullish for the seller (or the seller wants to get in at a lower price).  Again, the seller receives the Premium for their trouble.  \n  \nOptions are risky because unlike shares, they expire.  You can sink $20k into an option and if it doesn't hit the Strike Price it will expire worthless and you've lost your money.

{"title": "Follow the King; Join the $GILD", "selftext": "Hello my buddies! It is our favorite time of the week-Tendie Time-and today we will be examining the next big thang, Gilead Sciences, or $GILD. Most of you are surely familiar with the Remdesivir producer, but it's recent foray into cancer therapeutics and drugs telegraphs a likely big move being an acquisition by Roche the leader in all cancer drugs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, of course we take everything some random user shouts on here with a grain of salt. So, I made sure to bring a mountain of DD done by some true autist. I will provide links and breakdown each in case you're just a lazy fuck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to 5 parts of Roche merger with GILD theory:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.griproom.com/gilead-and-roche-merger-theory](https://www.griproom.com/gilead-and-roche-merger-theory)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part One: It looks like Gilead is about to Merge with Roche\\*\\*\n\nThis starts with some background on the playout of the market as Covid-19 began unraveling. How the idea to repurpose Remdesivir could lead to benefits and this dude flipped 50k to 1.5 mm. Unfortunately some shit got leaked and sent the stock spiraling, but in the end Remdesivir was shown to shorten hospital stays by 5 days which is pretty huge\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the autistic shit in this part is an evaluation of revenue to market caps of peers in the biotech industry.\n\nJohnson n Johnson:\n\nMarket cap: 406\n\nRevenue: 82\n\nR to MC: 20%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoche\n\nMC: 300\n\nR: 61.5\n\nR2MC: 23%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNovartis\n\n207\n\n48.5\n\n23\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMerck\n\n201\n\n47\n\n23.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPfizer\n\n210\n\n52\n\n24.7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbbott\n\n193\n\n32\n\n16.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmgen\n\n133\n\n23\n\n17.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbbVie\n\n184\n\n33\n\n18\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAstraZeneca\n\n133.7\n\n24.4\n\n20.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEli Lilly\n\n163\n\n22.3\n\n13.7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Gilead Sciences\\*\\*\n\nMarket Cap: 74\n\nRevenue: 22.5\n\nR to MC: 30.4%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does this mean? That GILD is the most undervalued of all its peers. If they do as good as last year, the R2MC goes to 31.3. Sales of tecartus, yescarta and trodelvy are supposed to go up though and the higher it goes the more ripe it is to get boughtout just like GME is a steal at 60 and goin to 420.69 for a blaze out before 1000, but I digress. Once this gets to 40% a buyout at 100% premium is solid. GILD also has Kite, Forty Seven, Arcus, and Immunomedics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome facts are shown about how current CEO worked 30 years at Roche type of shit. How Roche is world leader in cancer treatment and worked with all these companies that Gilead proceeded to buyout. This is important because Gilead could buy these companies for cheaper because they smaller than Roche and therefore Roche acquires them cheaper. Just good ol fashioned business practices or some shit I guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe cool thing is that 80% of the stock is owned by institutions so is has that infinity squeeze vibe type of feel to it. This is also super relevant because the pandemic is causing a backup of cancer diagnoses and so cancer drugs are going to be booming for awhile. If GILD were priced like its peers itd be at 90+ points. A merger could be expected to be priced around 120$.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 2: Gilead is the Next Celgene\\*\\*\n\nThis is the craziest part about all this shit. These people are getting caught manipulating GILD using the same stocktwits and yahoo finance accounts they used to shit on Celgene in fall of 2018 before its buyout by Bristol-Myers. The deal took years to pull off and GILD checks all the same boxes like 52 week lows and losers on stocktwits calling their management dumb and the stock just never following the broad index or responding to good news.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis parts definitely worth a check cause he found all the lame comments of people trying to manipulate the price. They use this trick called the anchoring effect. For example sale 50$ (reg price 95). \"Ill buy that stock at 50\". Just shit these astroturfers try to do to fuck with us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese two companies are basically the same story so the same players that were involved with Celgene could be in charge of merger here with Roche n $GILD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 3: Signs that Gilead and Roche are Reading our Merger Articles\\*\\*\n\nHere, the guy figures out that executives are going through from $GILD and Roche reading his stuff. His buddy helps him sifon through the data to establish statistical anomalies like lil Foster City Cali having a ton of views like top 5 and its one of smallest cities in cali. There's also ties to a bunch of other cities and executive headquarter location type of stuff. Even in fuckin Canada.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 4: Gilead is Insanely Undervalued\\*\\*\n\nGilead just plummeted last six months of 2020 and never responded to good news anymore. Roche is chugging away. As their marketvalues keep growing apart it makes it even more plausible. Again, 80% owned by fuckin institutions that just gotta sit and hold that shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Part 5: Market Cap Spread Between Gilead and Roche Continues to Widen\\*\\*\n\nRoche's current market growth makes it able to sell shares and dilute in order to buyout GILD. Up until Dec 31 2020 GILD kept sinking and sinking. Since GILD is 80% owned by institutions a buyout needs to be very lucrative. All was well until Remdesivir brought the hype train and it spiked the shares to the 80s. This shit couldn't be accepted though so MM fuckers made sure to short it back down the rest of the year to fucking 7 year lows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reason they waited till the new year is likely tax related, so this explains why we are seeing current growth these first few weeks into the new year as well as an analyst upgrade by MS to 83. This shit is massively undervalued and its ripe for a short squeeze because 80% owned by institutions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck these fuckers who try to steal the game. Let's make some money, gentlemen and gentlewomen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nGILD is being manipulated as fuck and is probably getting boughtout by Roche up to 100 or possible infinity squeeze because 80% institution owned.

Think of the analysts who covered AMZN early on and could only see an on-line book seller. How about the people covering NFLX who could only think about how many DVDs were being broken by USPS.

After Covid, of course, but imagine this please: GameStop becomes the destination for comics, graphic novels, collectible card games, table top games, and, naturally, video games.\n\nMalls are dying. Imagine a space the size of those pop-up Halloween stores that had an area of connected XBoxs and PS5s (so that a group of friends or strangers could run a Fortnite match. maybe even store vs store matches); a separate area of tables for D&D campaigns; an area to build gaming PCs; and an area for collectible card game matches (GameStops existing used game system could easily be adapted to handle the massive market for M:TG cards). Imagine a wall of comics, graphic novels and magna. Another wall of D&D books, modules, minatures and dice. GameStop locations already have TVs, so why not Livestream Critical Role and eSports events? Of course they could sell snacks and beverages.

I really think my perspective here is unique and captures something that WSB isn‚Äôt considering.\n\nI‚Äôve noticed that people here think a lot about things from a traditional business standpoint. That‚Äôs a mistake. Look up design thinking. Businesses that are successful are taking a long view‚Äîthinking about fulfilling customer needs, even if it sometimes comes at the expense of short-term profit or runs contrary to how businesses traditionally think. As an example, Chewy is known to basically hand out refunds without making you send a product back if you‚Äôre dissatisfied. Stupid move on a micro level, but on a macro level, they‚Äôre gaining loyalty and repeat customers.\n\nAs for GME, having an e-commerce experience that is specific to gaming has a lot of potential, the same way that having an e-commerce experience specific to pet care was so successful in the case of Chewy. Take Amazon or Best Buy. They sell a lot besides video games. It‚Äôs hard for them to invest a lot of time and money optimizing their information architecture, including their navigation, product listings, and product pages for video games, specifically. They use the same boilerplate page structure as they do for other products on their site, like refrigerators and TVs.\n\nIf you primarily sell games and consoles and accessories, you can make pages on your site and your site‚Äôs navigation super optimized for finding, reading about, and purchasing games. Being able to optimize a site in a way that makes it easier to navigate might not sound like a big deal, but works. You can also use personalization to more effectively surface and recommend games that a person might be interested in. Trust me, I do this shit for a living.\n\nAlso, think about the potential for return policies specific to games. Having a strong return policy could be super favorable for GME and offer something that other e-commerce sites that happen to sell games don‚Äôt.

Gaming demo units for rent, particularly for niche/high cost setups (VR, racing, flying). To get people to come back, make it so that the money spent renting the unit in-store can be used (to some degree) to offset the cost of purchase.

{"title": "January 25th, 2021 GME Battle Diary: 4:00AM - 4:00PM", "selftext": " \n\n**4:00 AM**\n\nLight skirmishes started early with retards from the 136th Armored Idiots surprising the enemy and taking substantial ground out of the gate. Caught off guard, the enemy was driven back on their heels. The boost in morale was immediate and would reverberate through the rest of the bloody day.\n\n**5:00 AM**\n\nThe enemy awoke to chaos and confusion, but managed a minor rally, driving the 136th back into the arms of the 103rd Sleepy Retards. They would go on to put up a valiant fight and suffer many casualties in the coming hours. The fighting was sporadic but intense at times.\n\n**6:00 AM - 9:30 AM**\n\nSkirmishes continued between the lines of the 90th Diamond Dildos and 103rd. Battle lines were drawn and troop positions massed in these key early hours. The skirmishing saw gains come and go and would telegraph the bloody day to come.\n\n**9:30 AM - 11:30 AM**\n\nIn an explosive maneuver, general [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) assembled and unleased the full might of the 159th Weaponized Autists. The fighting was sustained, intense, and bloody. The 159th gained ground at an alarming rate and it appeared as if total capitulation of the enemy was imminent. Troops that managed to penetrate deep into enemy territory reported seeing the enemy General Left stuff mouthfuls of crayons into his face and shit waxy rainbows.\n\n**11:30 AM - 1:00 PM**\n\nWe underestimated the resolve of the enemy. A flanking move by General Melvin took the 159th in the rear and scattered our troops. The fear caused a substantial complement of our soldiers to desert and run for the hills on the spot. I have not words for these cowards. At the same time, I saw good men - nay, great men - of the 159th, 150th, 140th, 130th, 120th, 110th, 100th, 90th, and 80th cut down en-masse. I will not speak further of this here other than to say that they will be avenged and see their names carved into the stones of Valhalla itself.\n\n**1:00 PM - 4:00 PM**\n\nI can only note here the deep pride I feel in my men and in my cause. I am not an emotional man, but what I saw with mine own eyes today would evoke emotion in the stoniest of hearts. After what appeared to be a stunning reversal and brief loss of ground, my men dug in their heels and fought like legends out of my childhood stories. Ground was given and taken over the next few hours, but at the end of the day, the enemy was driven back. My heart is filled with pride and hope for the future.\n\nThis day will not be forgotten.\n\n100 shares, 1/29 60c", "id": "l4xs9m", "created_utc": 1611609396.0, "score": 2369, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 125, "comments": [{"body": "TO VALHALLA AND BEYOND MY BROTHERS!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ", "score": 397, "replies": [{"body": "Happy cake day", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks man!
