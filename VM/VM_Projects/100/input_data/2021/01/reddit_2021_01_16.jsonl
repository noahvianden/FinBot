{"title": "Everyone is a genius in a bull market: The Dunning-Kruger Effect.", "selftext": "The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with a low ability of a given task are prone to overestimate their ability at that task. We are incapable of objective evaluation of our own competency levels. I'm writing about it as I've come to realise I suffer from it.\n\nDunning and Kruger's main finding from their 1999 study ‚ÄúUnskilled and Unaware of it‚Äù was that the worst performers consistently overestimate their ability relative to others.\n\nI've outlined two examples of this bias in action and how you can avoid some of these pitfalls:\n\n1. Investing\n\nAs the age old saying goes, \"Everyone is a genius in a bull market.\"\n\nWhen your portfolio is growing and the markets are ripping as they have in 2020, many fall victim to the Dunning-Kruger Effect. We tend to wrongly attribute this performance to our ability as talented investors.\n\n2. Politics\n\nAn obvious example people have been using recently is Donald Trump, whose confidence never wavers, despite his weak interest and understanding of policy matters.\n\nThe first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don't know you're a member of the Dunning-Kruger club. But we're all human, and it's important to recognise that we are all prone to this cognitive bias.\n\nHere are a few strategies to avoid it:\n\n1. Identify your circle of competence\n\nThe circle of competence is a sacred place. It's a set of topics or areas that align with a person's expertise. Be ruthless in identifying and protecting the boundaries, and it's usually smaller than you think.\n\nAs Charlie Munger said, \"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of being very intelligent.\"\n\nKnow your competencies, focus on them. Know your incompetencies, avoid or outsource them.\n\n2. Be a first principles thinker\n\nA first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition - it is foundational in that it cannot be deduced from other assumptions. In chemistry, it's like an element. It cannot be broken down further.\n\nGround yourself in foundational truths and build up from there. Challenge your reasoning, and most importantly, always ask why.\n\n\"It isn't what you don't know that gets you in trouble. It's what you know for sure that just isn't so.\"\n\nLink to original: https://mrsk.substack.com/p/everyone-is-a-genius-in-a-bull-market", "id": "kykf4c", "created_utc": 1610809434.0, "score": 1074, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "Oddly enough, after observing Donald Trump's success regarding constant self-praise, I jokingly began implementing it myself at work shortly after he became president.\n\nI'd constantly mention how I was \"Killin' It\" on a daily basis.

I undermined myself verbally around my coworkers regularly believing actions are larger than words and they'd see through it and see me as humble or something.\n\nAfter a while of this, I killed it on a project, and to my surprise it offended my coworkers.  They believed so little of me that when I had done something beyond them it hit their egos hard.  This was the farthest from any reasonable result I had expected.  (Full disclosure, this job was almost a 200k paying job with brilliant people and they still fell for it.  This may have amplified their distaste.)\n\nI was only going to be on that team for a short while, which is what made it easy for me to conduct the experiment to begin with, so around that time I was asked to transfer to another team that only hit their egos harder.  ... opps.

Researchers made a dataset with random numbers given for estimated competency and subjected it to similar analysis, and it created the same pattern.

{"title": "Unusual Options Activity 101: Whale Watching Tips", "selftext": "This is long, if you‚Äôre uninterested skip to the ten tips list or TLDR\n\nA while ago I started mixing unusual options activity into my ~~gambling~~investing.  At first I lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan, but now I actually have a pretty good feel for it.  I still fuck up alot, but more often I do not fuck up.  This is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales, or are at a basic level and want to do it better.\n\nI'm using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and I have a couple screenshots.\n\n**Tools**\nI use barchart in tandem with Unusual Whales. For barchart, you can honestly get by using their free version, you just can't sort as well.  They have a free month trial too.  I also pay the 20 bucks for Unusual Whales to confirm what I scan, and they have a good stocks volume standard deviation tool.  I have zero affiliation to either, just saying what I use.\n\nThere are way more technical ways to do this, but I like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer.\n\n**Basic Concept**\nLong story short, you're ideally chasing the options purchases of what are, presumably, deep-pocketed individuals or institutions.  UOA identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order.  For example, if the average daily option volume on an GME weekly is 4,000, and an option order enters for 4,000 or higher, it's flagged as unusual activity since it's a multiple of that daily average volume--sometimes it shows as multiple orders if \"they\" push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume.\n\nMM are sneks who like to move in silence, which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and the like.  However, they can't get away with that with options activity--it all shows.  That fact, young autist, is your slingshot against the institutional goliath.\n\n**Hunting the Whale**\nSo I've got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day.  I adjust the expiration date option so that the options I'm looking at don't expire past a couple weeks out (more on why later), then I'm ready to eye scan.\n\nI typically start by looking for **one of two things: 1) large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker  or 2) sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours, but belong to non-hot, non-meme stonks that do NOT have earnings imminent.**  To make sure I'm looking at something potentially weird, I choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out.\n\n**1) Clusters of orders‚ÄîABNB example**\nThe way I scope it is kind of a tiered process.  *First*, I'm looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan.  *Second*, I'm looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls AND puts, with some OTM activity and spreads preferred.  *Third*, I look to see if the number of seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders (or vice versa), and additionally I look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts (or vice versa).  \n\n**Why?  Because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge, or if it‚Äôs hedging against itself as it‚Äôs own positio**n. This is super important so try to follow along-- most UOA is just institutions hedging; Mr. MM has a nice, busy life and fancy yacht and can't just exit his positions back and forth all day like a WSBer.  He also has like a billion shares of his stonks, so if he dumps it when he's got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect.  So, *instead* of hedging by dumping his shit, he hedges by adding OTM options against his position--next level fucking diamond hands.  That would be the type of whale order from Mr. MM we don't want to follow.  *But*, if Mr. MM buys 4,000 FB call options in a few blocks, and you see like 1,000 in FB puts go through right alongside it, the odds are that someone is betting big on FB and using the puts as a hedge, since the puts represent a smaller volume in the call/put ratio.  Instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger stock position they hold, these types of option clusters indicate that the option order itself is the big, independent play, and it's hedging itself with lower volume order vs the higher volume (4,000 calls to 1,000 puts).\n\n**Then I do an easy confirmation**.  I check the tickers general trend the past week or so in a chart, do a news search on twitter of their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment, and google and YouTube to see if the crayola kids think it's a good nerd play.\n\n**Example**: Here's the screenshot on some ABNB UOA I noticed and played this week.  It went to 200% and change within a couple hours, but I had unfortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that.\n\n[ABNB UOA](https://i.imgur.com/mYDXYmN.jpg)\n\nSo, this a softball.  **First**, you can see that ABNB all of a sudden explodes with all these options showing up at 12:52‚Äìthat's our cluster.  **Second**, the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute timespan, with some put orders showing at the bottom of the cluster.  Some of the calls are deep OTM, as far as 200c.  **Third**, the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume.  *Awwwww shit, looks like we got more than a hedge‚Äîwe‚Äôre onto something.*\n\n**Confirmation time**: ABNB had been on a general uptrend, and I typically don't like to chase, but I combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the CEO speaking the following day, and that news had just broken of their DC booking cancellations.  I looked back into the morning, and saw a few more unusual blocks, and a few more rolled in just after the cluster pictured above.\n\nPassed the smell test.  Options bought, tendies gained.\n\n**Sparse Orders: SNAP example**\n\nThe same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders, not large clusters,  which **a) haven‚Äôt had much attention b) have been on a steep downtrend‚Äîthis makes the order unusual, and/or c) seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a day.**The same principles as above apply, but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration, you can assume assume it's probably not a hedge.  SNAP isn't the best example of the week because there wasn't a put order in this block.  But, there was positive TA sentiment when I searched, SNAP had been on an oversold downtrend, and I don't have screenshots left of the better ones I saw and went after.  **Plus, importantly, IT WAS TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY** (this is huge, EOD is prime time for AH news whales)\n\n[SNAP UOA](https://i.imgur.com/GGr5bra.jpg)\n\nA better example from this week though is SPCE, which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day, and one toward the end of the day which was DEEP, DEEP OTM expiring 1/15.  **That‚Äôs a flag for us‚Äîsporadic listing throughout the day, OTM toward the end of the day. ** BAM! EOD SPCE OTM calls sprinkle in, ARK invests to kick off AH, SPCE moons. \n\n**Sparse Orders Patterns: Connecting the dots on tech rebound with FB and SNAP**\n\nSeeing the SNAP orders above sharpened my eyes that day to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole, since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week.  I kept seeing FB options like this pop up\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/muVGtq2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T54peER.jpg)\n\nSometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector.  Because this and similar FB orders were deep OTM and one day out, I knew there was a risk they could a hedge, but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw SNAP posting sporadic OTM as well.  **So, I bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to ATM (important, more below), to give the whale some breathing room** in case was it was a hedge, even though the technicals agreed with the bounce.  The whales were right, and it was an easy little overnight profit.\n\n\n**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 1: Don‚Äôt get tricked by trends**\n\nAlthough we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve, often they are just trend-riding lemmings who follow what's already way, way up.  They buy the top, just like WSB tardies such as yourself specialize in.  So, when you see shit like this below, take a minute to think before you get excited:\n\n[NIO UOA LIKE THIS WAS NONSTOP](https://i.imgur.com/JCZBx2s.jpg)\n\nIt was the same for all the memes: PLUG, FCEL, MARA, and RIOT all week, dominating the orders.  If something is already too popular, just stay away from it.  You can ride something up, but when you see massive orders on shit that's already like 400% IV, just...don't.\n\n**How I‚Äôve Fucked Up 2: DO give the MM‚Äôs some breathing room**\n\n*Even if you‚Äôre confident in a move you see that is a few days out, extend your play a week or two further out minimum, and strike it closer to ATM.*  If you can't do either of those things because you can't afford the premium just skip that play and check back for something new later; I promise a better opportunity will arise.  You can recover from bagholding, but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect 0DTE.\n\nBreathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing.  Two months ago I followed a DDOG whale on a Thursday 1DTE that expired worthless the next day.  The following Monday (1 trade day later) DDOG made the announcement that rocketed them like 20%--if I'd given them a week's breathing room, it would've been a 15 bagger.  Fucking F.\n\n**So, to review:** look for order clusters or sporadic ticker orders that a) have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b) unpopular tickers that have deep OTM or close expirations c) always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d) try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye (this Monday's EV run or this Friday's tech bounce could be next week's airline dominance or cruiseline craze--connect the dots).  Initially look for options expiring soon, as they indicate the most riskiness--and therefore confidence--if the MM is not hedging.  Shop with a short term eye, buy with a long term choice. \n\n**10 Things That Will Help You Not GUH:**\n\n**1)** Monday and Friday morning/afternoon are the most accurate whale times, according to data from Unusual Whales\n\n**2)** If you don't have PDT always save some spending power for EOD shopping\n\n**3**) If you don't have PDT never, ever follow a whale with a weekly.  Sometimes the news the whale bets on is a 'sell the news' event, and you won‚Äôt recover from a drop especially if there is IV crush involved. \n\n**4)** Always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out\n\n**4b**) Always give the whale breathing room by going closer to ATM strikes than theirs\n\n**5)** Sign up for barchart monthly trial (then continue it) and unusual whales--they're each like 20 bucks and thats way less than you spend on an FD. \n\n**6**) You don't need to learn TA, but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chase--almost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly TA.  This way you know if it's a proper breakout happening if the whale hits, and you're not just guessing at when to take profits.  Remember, whales can buy wayyyyyyy OTM and sell for massive profit at any point--they *aren‚Äôt* bagholding a call until it's in the money like you are. You may be 10% up waiting for the next 80% GME day while your whale has sold at their target 5% profits on the play and is chillin. \n\n**7**) Leave at least 10% of your account spending power free each day.  I promise, the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day.  Then you won't be able to do shit about it and you'll hate yourself when it's a 10 bagger overnight.  Trust me.\n\n**8**) Make sure the ticker you're chasing isn't just ER anticipation/bets.  Always check earnings dates before buying.\n\n**9**) Remember whales are people, so they can be stupid, too.  Don't baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come.  They are gambling addicts just like you, except they have more money.\n\n**10**) Always take profits if you ask yourself if it's time to.  If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close the position.\n\n**Positions**:\nDumped a ton of stuff and loading up Tuesday because long weekends scare me, but saw some ineresting 2/5s I held including\n\nWKHSc\nPLTRc\nSPYc (1/19, 1/22)\nLMNDp\n\nAnd a couple tickers that I couldn‚Äôt post lol.  also have AAPL and JD leaps\n\n***\n\nTLDR\nUse a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements.  Look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via call/put ratio, and do a legitimate check for TA and catalysts to confirm their moves.  Never follow a whale into a weekly, but use weeklies are your best screener.\n\n***\n\n*I might do a pretty consistent DD post (a couple times a week) on what I‚Äôm seeing at the end of each day if there is interest, and if it‚Äôs not a day I don‚Äôt have a ton of real work.  If something quick catches my eye I usually throw it up on my twitter @yourboymilt (there‚Äôs no notification thing on here mods, just trying to be helpful‚Äî not selling anything) I‚Äôll also probably throw some more potential Monday positions on here over the weekend once I decide to do some more research.

{"title": "Palantir Technologies ($PLTR) has some MAJOR catalyst approaching. Don‚Äôt miss out like you did with $GME", "selftext": "Yesterday we ended the day on a 3% gain, albeit this was a 10%+ gain at some points but the market went red as a whole so this is understandable. Regardless, there‚Äôs a number of reasons to be loading up on SHARES before the üöÄ takes off.\n\n1. Institutional‚Äôs are loading up on PLTR prior to the major catalysts (ARK recently upped their stake by 497,100 shares and so did another number of firms).\n\n2. Demo Day: 26th of Jan we‚Äôll see PLTR do a demonstration day of their main product offerings. This will undoubtedly draw attention and traction to the stock as people better understand the recent standardisation of PLTR‚Äôs software. This standardisation is what has enabled them to target over 6,000 large institution/enterprise customers across all verticals. Ultimately this will show their commercial viability outside of what they‚Äôre known for (governmental contracts) and will result in a stock uptick due to their future viability.\n\n3. Earnings Day: Early February we shall see PLTR‚Äôs earnings report for Q420. This should also cover some of the forward-looking aspects of it‚Äôs recently acquired contracts alongside projections. If you are unaware of those contracts, see the link here: [LINK](https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx)\n\nAs Palantir will most likely pass $1bn in revenue, this is likely to be a big day.\n\n\n4. Lockup period: Employees and the like are able to liquidate some of their positions come mid February. This has obvious negative connotations to it but for the most part what most people don‚Äôt understand is that there will only be a minuscule amount of shares which will be CASHED in. Employees will not cash in all their shares as they will also notice and realise the growth potential of their stock options. They will maybe cash in a small amount if needed but the firm has just began properly marketing their product and concentrating on business development, employees and us alike know the growth potential of this stock.\n\nOnce a lower-than-anticipated amount of stock is liquidated, this will most likely have an inverse effect. People will realise that this dip won‚Äôt happen and there will be a scrambled influx to buy in. Most likely driving the stock up and pushing it to ATH (unless we have another Citi downgrade bcos IBs love a bit of MM).\n\n\nThat‚Äôs all.\n\nTLDR; Buy PLTR shares NOT calls for the time being or you will see beautiful üöÄüöÄüöÄ and realise you have missed out on the next $GME / $TSLA", "id": "kyhvog", "created_utc": 1610799011.0, "score": 454, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "Step 1.

LEAPs both make millionaires and destroy wealth.   The far OTM calls are often called LEAPs.  (Look it up).  The Jan‚Äô23 $50 Calls are about $7-9 a piece (amplified by 100).  One call = $700-900 to buy.\n\nThey are $50 strike in my example.  They are ‚ÄúOTM‚Äù out of the money, very far out of the money in fact because PPS is only $25 right now.\nLets say you pay $9.  By the expiration date in Jan 2023 you need the share price to be a MINIMUM of $59 just to break even- because the calls will be worth approximately their intrinsic value on expiration day.  \n\nFor every amount over $50 on the day of expiration the contract value will grow.\n\nIf the PPS is $75 on day of expiration the contract will be worth $25.  You paid $9.  You made almost 3x.   Meanwhile if you bought shares today for comparison you‚Äôd make about 3x (75 / 25 = 3x)...  around $75 PPS the share and calls perform similarly...\n\nNOW let‚Äôs say he is right (he‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs overzealous but only by a little...) and the share price is well into the $100‚Äôs; let‚Äôs say $150.\nIf he bought shares today that‚Äôs a 6x gain.... but if he bought the Jan‚Äô23 contracts they‚Äôll be worth approximately $100 per contract ($150-50 = $100 intrinsic value on day of expiration). He only paid $9 per contract.  So that‚Äôs an 11x on calls versus the ‚Äúmere‚Äù 6x.\n\nAnd this is all using the day of expiration and intrinsic value only as examples.  The calls can outperform the shares much faster due to inefficiencies, liquidity, and ‚ÄúGreeks‚Äù.\n\nWhen you see some of the market made millionaires they‚Äôre often because of LEAPs- far OTM calls on high conviction plays.\n\nI think PLTR will be $60-80 by EOY ‚Äò21 and $120-160 by EOY ‚Äò22 potentially with some wild fluctuations along the way.

AOC has criticized PLTR for it's contracts with ICE and the unfortunate consequences of the insights PLTR provided to ICE agents.

Their daddies, the very hedge funds that are betting against us Wallstreetbettors, obviously push those news, place them like paid for PR. Something a lot of people have to understand, is that that is all a very normal way of playing the game. **Fake news!** Don't believe anything someone with opposite interests than yours says. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, the net short position has increased by around 2% yesterday. They throw even more money after their bad money to recoup their losses.\nThe spike was caused by more and more retail and institutional investors realising this is actually going to happen and buying in.\n\nFor a lot of people (like Burry, Mashaal, cohen obviously and others) this is an opportunity. Institutions like blackrock or Senvest are buying in to take the money of the melvins of this world.\n\nLet's compare this to other famous short squeezes: [VW Squeeze](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nr8vkBriAuo/U0RSt0E3_1I/AAAAAAAAAs0/fDcm_9XTzI0/s1600/volkswagen.gif)\n\nWhere are we at? either in June or September! \n\nThe actual panic, the grappling, the desperation, the higher bidding, the margin calls, all that hasn't even started yet!\n\nI'm not suggesting that this will a couple months to play out, nowadays things move faster, but it will happen soonish.\n\n\nTLDR: $GME to 3200, Diamond hands and rockets. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ", "id": "kyjd5p", "created_utc": 1610805474.0, "score": 371, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "If anyone doubts that hedge funds do this shady shit just watch that Cramer video from like 2006 when he basically is explaining how he and other fund managers manipulate prices.", "score": 214, "replies": [{"body": "If you've watched Tesla for long enough you start to realize how blatantly fake all the news is and the analyst are fucking retarded.

{"title": "Smart money is selling at the fastest pace since 2007", "selftext": "Hey guys, here is a weekly summary of charts and data that I personally looked at and thought was important. Give it a read and let me know what you think! \n\nSmall speculative markets continue to explode higher while large cap markets rally less.\n\n### Summary\n\nHere‚Äôs how I approach markets based on 3 different strategies & time frames.\n\n1. **Short term trend followers should continue to ride the rally because no one knows exactly when it will end**. If you are a short term trend follower, you **must**¬†use stops.\n2. Medium term contrarian traders should go neither long nor short. Wait. Risk:reward doesn‚Äôt favor long positions right now, while shorting into a speculative rally can end in disaster.\n3. Long term investors¬†should be highly defensive right now. This speculative bull market may last another 6 months or even 9 months, but in 2 years time, long term investors will be glad they did not buy today.\n\nBottomline: trend is up, but beware of mounting risks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ura0cdrlepb61.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=966798cf031deec44bd7cfba01e3bdda648a17f4\n\nLet‚Äôs keep our mind open to different outcomes by looking at both bullish and bearish factors.\n\n### Who is buying?\n\nA day can‚Äôt go by without another multi-billion dollar IPO exploding higher. But while traders and investors are buying small & speculative stocks like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, **almost no** **corporate insiders** **are buying their own stocks anymore**. The corporate insider sell/buy ratio‚Äôs 50 day average is at the 2nd highest level ever. It was only exceeded by 2007:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fyas2rmoepb61.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e6546cabba2929e20918aea1b1fa5f5aa8fc11\n\nIn 2007, stocks rallied for another half year before an epic collapse began. This isn‚Äôt to say that ‚Äútoday is just like 2007‚Äù. The future is never just like the past. But even if we look at less extreme historical cases, the next 3-6 months saw mediocre returns for stocks:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/za7o2nkpepb61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=b842ef7978be9ad8281cc7df8311c96a4feed6f8\n\nBeware of risks like this, but also remember that the short term trend remains UP.\n\n### Momentum\n\nSmall caps and emerging markets continue to surge higher. Bloomberg publishes a ‚ÄúFear/Greed‚Äù indicator, which is really just a momentum indicator (price drives sentiment). This Fear/Greed indicator for emerging markets is at the highest level since 2007:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r06zkoqqepb61.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=82f40c3ad08326189483588620a348e0e84ed628\n\nThis may seem scary, but Bloomberg‚Äôs Fear/Greed calculation is based on NOMINAL numbers. So as the market goes up over the decades, this figure will naturally become more and more extreme. Hence, it‚Äôs better to divide Fear/Greed by the market‚Äôs value:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uee9em0sepb61.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=42c2d3d127e1d03a7716833a7dfd0b8276164c22\n\nHere, we can see that the adjusted Fear/Greed is high, but this wasn‚Äôt bearish in the past. When emerging markets‚Äô momentum was this strong, they usually rallied further over the next 3 months:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4m2s2hzsepb61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=8974bfb0c951f11cfb745f12bdacd8b2e4e6503f\n\nThis is a bullish reading for emerging markets.\n\n### Breadth\n\nBreadth is very strong across the world. The % of NASDAQ stocks at a 52 week high continues to increase:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vro2ifmwepb61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=b142fafde00fe789ee0ee37ef546f3e1f61f0e2e\n\nSuch strong breadth readings were bullish for the NASDAQ over the next 9-12 months:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1z8ebvyxepb61.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=a538095213db5125e08774cad39582a442765ebb\n\nWhile it‚Äôs important to focus on the trend, it‚Äôs also important to beware of mounting risks:\n\n### Speculative signs\n\nEverything small and risky is soaring right now. An index of the most shorted, most leveraged stocks saw its 14 week RSI explode higher. The last 2 times this happened led to sharp corrections in these risky stocks:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcq302bzepb61.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=c42849e15fed5eb2ad006aa453aa712bfeb63f7d\n\nIt‚Äôs easy to see why investors are plowing into risk. Central banks are flooding the market with an ocean of liquidity:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b79be6h0fpb61.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a9475570f09e5e1f638c0ec4cf26aeb9b6fd79f\n\n### The everything rally\n\nAs I noted on Tuesday, stocks are rallying around the world. The average country‚Äôs stock index is 18% above its 200 dma! This is the highest reading in over a decade:\n\n\\*I calculated this average using the following countries‚Äô indices: U.S., Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, HK, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, Brazil, China, India, South Korea, Mexico, Taiwan, Russia.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wv59py12fpb61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3f8362cd850293af03c1770842d6aff70da666a\n\nWhen so many stock markets around the world surged in the past, the S&P 500 (which accounts for half of global market cap) usually rallied a little more over the next 3 months, followed by a sharp pullback 6 months later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7586so5fpb61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ffd754bd546e95bc80f33a7b68522fb4a10715e\n\nHigh volatility is to be expected in the coming months. The overextended rally can overextend even further, but nothing lasts forever.\n\nLooking more closely within the U.S., micro-cap stocks (the smallest of stocks)¬†are now more than 40% above their 200 day moving average! The last time this happened was in February ‚Äì March 2000, near the peak of the dot-com bubble.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dwp03y07fpb61.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=5baf0689d43653b23922f6093e1214f76897ba67\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that this also happened during the first year of the 2003-2007 (September 2003) and 2009-2020 (September 2009) bull markets. In those 2 historical cases, the stock market rallied another 4-6 months before major corrections began. This is a bearish sign for spring & summer 2021.\n\n**Gamma Exposure**\n\nAnd finally, Gamma Exposure recently hit a record high. High values are bearish and low values are bullish. It‚Äôs better to look at Gamma Exposure as a ratio vs. the S&P 500‚Äôs value:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y3f5o4m8fpb61.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d67c8817d9016c5def54226d5ee1b6754a7fdcb\n\nThis is a bearish reading. When this happened in the past, the S&P fell -7.3%, -7.9%, and -31% over the next 2 months from where the S&P was as of that date:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jawwim8bfpb61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=478617a7cea452af01f6db2f4736216ee8ae46bd\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1. Long term investors¬†should be highly defensive right now. This speculative bull market may last another 6 months or even 9 months, but in 2 years time, long term investors will be glad they did not buy today.\n2. Medium term traders should go neither long nor short.\n3.

{"title": "Everyone is a genius in a bull market: The Dunning-Kruger Effect.", "selftext": "The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with a low ability of a given task are prone to overestimate their ability at that task. We are incapable of objective evaluation of our own competency levels. I'm writing about it as I've come to realise I suffer from it.\n\nDunning and Kruger's main finding from their 1999 study ‚ÄúUnskilled and Unaware of it‚Äù was that the worst performers consistently overestimate their ability relative to others.\n\nI've outlined two examples of this bias in action and how you can avoid some of these pitfalls:\n\n1. Investing\n\nAs the age old saying goes, \"Everyone is a genius in a bull market.\"\n\nWhen your portfolio is growing and the markets are ripping as they have in 2020, many fall victim to the Dunning-Kruger Effect. We tend to wrongly attribute this performance to our ability as talented investors.\n\n2. Politics\n\nAn obvious example people have been using recently is Donald Trump, whose confidence never wavers, despite his weak interest and understanding of policy matters.\n\nThe first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don't know you're a member of the Dunning-Kruger club. But we're all human, and it's important to recognise that we are all prone to this cognitive bias.\n\nHere are a few strategies to avoid it:\n\n1. Identify your circle of competence\n\nThe circle of competence is a sacred place. It's a set of topics or areas that align with a person's expertise. Be ruthless in identifying and protecting the boundaries, and it's usually smaller than you think.\n\nAs Charlie Munger said, \"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of being very intelligent.\"\n\nKnow your competencies, focus on them. Know your incompetencies, avoid or outsource them.\n\n2. Be a first principles thinker\n\nA first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition - it is foundational in that it cannot be deduced from other assumptions.

I know that this is also the common explanation (which is even more ironic) because it is not accurate to what the [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Unskilled-and-unaware-of-it%3A-how-difficulties-in-to-Kruger-Dunning/f2c80eef3585e0569e93ace0b9770cf76c8ebabc?p2df) reads.\n\nThe Dunning-Krueger Effect is better understood to be a simple failure of metacognition. In short-hand: \"You don't know that you don't know something and you can't realize that you don't know it.\" Overconfidence is a side-effect but not actually the effect itself; self-assessment typically is overdrawn but the parabolic effect isn't as \"outlandish\" as popular media makes it out to be; for instance people who are just starting with options might say, \"I understand the greeks\" but then turn around and ask something that requires you to understand the greeks *but* that shouldn't be mistaken for the idea that people simply fail to understand that they *don't* know everything about options, hence the question to begin with, etc.\n\n[You are more likely to suffer Illusory Depth](https://ritholtz.com/2019/08/the-illusion-of-explanatory-depth/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheBigPicture+%28The+Big+Picture%29) in this particular case of investing in a \"wild\" market. Also, I would not consider this a \"bull\" market in the traditional sense; the number of winners and losers last year (that is, companies that literally no longer exist, not just companies that lost value) is astronomical; what happened with bonds and liquidity functions of other assets and such is not equivalent to a normal and steady rise in valuation over time at all. That's why there are so many saying, \"The Second Coming\" is coming for a fall out and honestly they might be right with the dollar being forcibly devalued. How long can that truly last? We don't know. We've never done this before in history. Which is ironic because again to understand these effects (this is a close cousin of DK) you'll make up stories as to why things occurred. What this means is also you can create [Economic Narratives](https://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Economics-Stories-Economic-Events/dp/0691182299) which turn out to be exactly what drives a series of interesting effects.\n\nWe can actually prove this; let's take for instance the Gamestop situation. So first we have \"the initial buyers\", like DeepFuckingValue, now the question is simple: Did he know that Gamestop would rebrand and Ryan Cohen would take interest almost a year and a half before it happened? No. So then, that begs another question; did the short-squeeze itself warrant these prices? No. Now, of course, in the history of the world we will write that *he did* and that there was no difference between the events that occurred and his state simply because it all rolls into itself very nicely (hence Illusory Depth with Narrative) into a clean story.\n\nThe reality is that there are people who make bets like this all the time *and lose* but we don't remember them. Another good story is the Ambulance driver who made a million percent or something; in that same thread there was a guy whose calls expired *one week too early* and do you know what? I remember the Ambulance Driver. I don't remember the other guy.\n\nWe can say the same of Tesla; everyone has an explanation as to why Tesla soared *after the fact* but no one expected this to occur in a single year and anyone who gives an explanation of it is practically lying through their teeth since the story itself of clean energy is 40 years old. There are many, many examples where things went sideways, make no sense, will be explained after the fact, or are just flat out garbage that people will buy into because they see the ticker and know that it will rise regardless of it's actual viability.\n\nTL;DR: **The greatest threat to you in this market are the stories you tell yourself not the knowledge base you think you have.**", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "I will say this regarding DFV: He didn't expect to happen what just happened, not half a year ago.\nHe did tell us what he thought and how he came to yolo on GME.

Why is everybody suddenly so confident the squeeze will happen in the coming weeks? Any reason other than the big gap up this week? As you said, the institutional shorter have deep pockets that they will unlikely got margin called without stock price increase crazily in the first place. \n2. Now that everybody is aware of the possibility of a big squeeze, what would you do if you are the big money short sellers? I don't imagine they will simply sit and die.

While the short interest is still elevated, keep in mind that shorts may trade hands as the price goes up. For example, a short may have opened at $15 and covered at $30 due to price exceeding their tolerance, however that also means that new shorts with a basis of $30 may have a tolerance for $50, so it's possible for the squeeze potential to remain flat despite price rising higher.\n2. Yes. Alternatively, a possibility is to buy OTM call options while increasing short position. This both increases their potential reward (less call option cost) and lessens their risk in the case of a squeeze. Call options have a similar effect to covering as the squeeze happens, such that they can add back to their position at an effective higher short price by closing (selling) the calls. Their risk is that the price remains flat, thus losing call premium, but the thesis is pretty strongly in favor of breaking one way or another.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> Why is everybody suddenly so confident the squeeze will happen in the coming weeks?\n\nYeah, that was my reservation as well.

While I understand the structure of gamma, I get a little confused in using it in the grand scheme of things. \nFor e.g. what MMs will need to do when they are extremely short gamma (adding short calls and short puts). On the short call side, they will have to buy the stock to cover but on short put side, they will have to sell stock to cover. And your opinion is that MMs are selling more to cover the puts because puts are high in demand for whatever reasons (protection or speculative) which will cause the stock to push lower?

Sorry if this is not what you meant and if it is not worth your time explaining things eli5, I would really appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction for the stuff I should read to get more understanding on this.\nI am very interested in understanding of the gamma as I feel it could provide early signals (due to MMs activity) on where the market could go in the future and hence would like to build a solid foundation on it.\n\nGiven the implied volatility on this, why would you buy expensive puts? Wouldn't short calls be better? Or you don't want the margin to kick in on short plus limited earning potential?\n\nAssuming I am writing this on Thursday (one day before the expiration), the gamma would be the highest for ATM options. But given that a lot of people wouldn't have the capital to exercise that many calls would sell/roll their calls would result in MMs no longer needing the shares and will dump them promptly.

{"title": "$GME DD- Build-a-PC Kiosks Coming", "selftext": "TLDR: Gamestop is fielding PC build kiosks at a number of stores, BUY GME SHARES ROCKETS OUTBOUND üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n\nToday I went into Gamestop with the intent of browsing around and using a $25 gift card I got for Christmas like a year ago. I have not been inside a physical GME store since at least 2018 when I bought an Xbox. I immediately noticed that they have a much wider variety of merchandise, everything from games to PC hardware to toys and clothing. So on that note I was looking to buy a new PC gaming headset since I noticed they \"have\" a ton of them. I grabbed one and went to check out. The manager informed me that they don't actually have them in stock or available to order- in fact, most of the items in the store were just display boxes for promotional purposes. I thought this was weird, but she explained that:\n\n**1- They sell in-store items so fast that if they didn't display empty boxes the store would look entirely empty. She gave an example of 200 packs of pokemon cards that sold out completely within 24 hours**\n\n**2- They are reluctant to fill the store with generic items that don't move fast, because that store specifically, among \"3-4 others in the state\" are going to be totally redesigned to accommodate for what she described to me as \"PC building stations\".**  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n**3- They have been absolutely crushing it with sales and store interest due to COVID. She stated that people are buying things that she has never sold before, like niche Wii remotes and other items.\"**\n\nNow, we have speculated for some time that GME is going to pivot to PC parts and hardware. I noticed that they do stock some PC peripherals and a few components like graphics cards (older models, they had an NVIDIA 1660 in stock) and PSUs. \n\nHOWEVER, I haven't seen or heard anything regarding a full-on build station. The way she described it to me, is that customers will be able to totally spec out a PC gaming rig, and have it shipped directly to their house. She said there will likely be a dedicated store employee there to assist customers and provide advice. THIS IS FUCKING HUGE. Currently, you have to be pretty \"in-the-know\" to spec out a gaming PC properly, and the pricing makes it unrealistic for a lot of gamers. On top of that, I think there is a perception that you need a lot more technical skill to get into PC gaming. What GME is doing will allow the PC gaming market to bust wide open and become more accessible for a lot more people. And finally, some sort of agreement or deal with the big manufacturers (as hinted) would make this even more lucrative!\n\nShe also said that there is a huge push from upper management for store employees to get knowledgeable on PC gaming and hardware- she said management is pushing hard for the company to step into the future. Meanwhile during the 30 minutes I was in the store, probably 10-15 customers came through and bought at least minor items. Keep in mind this is in a strip mall in a Midwestern rust belt town- certainly does not fit the \"Next blockbuster!1!!!\" thesis.\n\nPersonally I believe this is a very bullish move from Gamestop- and bodes well for the future on top of the other well-established information out there. GME is and continues to be an excellent value play, not even accounting for the upcoming short squeeze. It sounds like the vision from Cohen and others at the top is already filtering down to the people charged with carrying it out. I plan to buy at least 50 more shares on Tuesday.\n\n\nPositions: 250 shares @22.30 cost avg, 2x 4/19/21 $30c, 2x 01/29/21 $50c\n\n(Somebody on mobile add the rockets pls)\n\nETA69: Somebody showed me how to do the rockets üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ LFG!!!\n\nETA420: DON'T GIVE ME GOLD, KEEP THAT MONEY AND FUCKING BUY GME SHARES\n\nETA from one of the commenters below, u/theodros1:\n\n\"Oh shiiitt. This is amazing. I called a bunch of my local gamestops and luckily got a very talkative sales guy. He says that Gamestop Stores will be either 1.0 or 1.5 stores. The 1.5 stores will be more \"PC oriented\" and will allow users to choose parts. He didn't confirm \"PC building stations\" but dropped an amazing tidbit. The changes started in OCTOBER.... what else happened in October? Ryan fucking Cohen. This is amazing news and hopefully we hear more about it soon in media/press release.\n\nedit: oh shit... I called this other Gamestop and he said the \"Cohen news hasn't materialized yet\"... I said him being \"CEO\" and he grunted, I think affirmatively\n\nedit 2: called another gamestop. Overheard them talking about \"reset\" of stores when I asked which store in area was 1.5\n\nedit 3: Found a 1.5 station, he confirmed OP's post.

{"title": "$FUBO DD - Connecting the dots, this thing is going to be a MONSTER.", "selftext": "Pretty sure most of you know $FUBO has been shorted like crazy since the news of their Victory acquisition. It shot up 33% with the news and has since lost most of those gains. I'm here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a MASSIVE opportunity for us.\n\nFirst, I'd like to address the issue of profitability. It was founded in 2015and being a young, growing company and isn't profitable yet. To put things into perspective, even Netflix which was founded in 1997 wasn't profitable until 2003. Fubo has more competition today than Netflix did back then, but it's still growing rapidly. \n\nQ3 Results: [https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/fubotv-announces-q3-2020-results-210500756.html)\n\n* Revenues were $61.2 million, a 47% increase year-over-year on a pro forma basis, or +71% excluding 2019 licensing revenue from the FaceBank AG business, sold in July 2020. This growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion, an increase in subscription Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and growth of advertising sales:  \n\n   * Subscription revenue increased 64% year-over-year to $53.4 million.\n   * Advertising revenue increased 153% year-over-year to $7.5 million.\n* Paid subscribers at quarter end totaled 455,000, an increase of 58% year-over-year.\n* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) per month was $67.70, up 14% year-over-year.\n* Total content hours streamed by fuboTV users (paid and free trial) in the quarter increased 83% year-over-year to 133.3 million hours.\n* Monthly active users (MAUs) watched 121 hours per month on average in the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year.\n\nQ4 Preliminary Results:\n\n[https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx](https://ir.fubo.tv/news/news-details/2021/fuboTV-Announces-Preliminary-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Revenue-and-Subscriber-Growth/default.aspx)\n\n* Q4 total revenue is expected to be between $94-$98 million, a 77% to 84% increase year-over-year.\\* Prior guidance was $80-$85 million.\n* Paid subscribers at year-end are expected to exceed 545,000, an increase of more than 72% year-over-year. Prior guidance was 500,000-510,000 subscribers.\n\nIt smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning. Also note that Fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus. This is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal. \n\n*FUBO* is estimated to announce *earnings* between Jan 25, 2021 and Feb 03, 2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMost of us know that Fubo was opportunistically  hit by short sellers (Kerrisdale/Rich Greendfield) as their lock up period expired. This made the stock tank considerably from it's high of $60. The short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream, and that its not profitable yet. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, it took Netflix a while to scale up and become profitable. At the rate Fubo is growing, they are going to be profitable sooner than later. This isn't even an argument to me, as they scale up a few things will happen:\n\n\\- Customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue.\n\n\\- Since they license their content, they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit (just like Netflix did)\n\n\\- More customers mean they can charge more for advertising. (More on this later)\n\nFubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of Vigtory. The bear thesis is weakening significantly. Almost nonexistent. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, on to the NBA:\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2021/12/31/fubotv-solid-positioning-for-sports-betting/?sh=5fadb7c69cb5)\n\n\"Over the past few years, Sky Media led investment rounds in FuboTV along with Fox for a 39% stake. This investment round was increased in late 2017/early 2018 with Sky Media holding Board positions. The former NBA commissioner was also part of the last $15 million round. Media has gone through some very big M&A shifts at the top-level with Comcast acquiring Sky and Disney acquiring 21st Century Fox. However, for FuboTV‚Äôs formative years, the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world ‚Äì Sky Media from the UK. The Comcast-owned Sky Media is still a backer for FuboTV along with Disney.\"\n\nDavid Stern, the late former NBA commissioner was involved in funding of Fubo. The current NBA commissioner Adam Silver worked extremely closely with his mentor. I've been a lifelong NBA fan and I had doubts in Adam Silver but I think he's done a fantastic job with the NBA.\n\nWhy am I bringing up the NBA?\n\n[https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/](https://www.casino.org/news/nba-considering-betting-broadcasts-could-help-draftkings/) (check the date of this and check the date of the Fubo Vigtory announcement)\n\nPeople are missing some key elements to the NBA announcement: this announcement was made literally the DAY after the Fubo Victory acquisition. People are missing the link between the NBA and Fubo, let alone the timing. Fact check me, they were announced a day apart and Fubo is the ONLY company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform. \n\nThe NBA wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues (which is why I think they threw in DraftKings)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, lets look into two key acquisitions: \n\n\\- Vigtory - Fubo acquired them and put their co-founder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech. \n\nBalto - This one is another thing bears are missing. They claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting, it wasn't this was for their fantasy sports platform which Fubo is also planning on integrating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward. It is trading at a discount thanks to shorts [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/fubo)\n\n34m shares short, 62.5% of float shorted. This thing is PRIMED for an epic squeeze AND it's valued at a discount right now. \n\nSince the Vigtory acquisition, new price targets came out ranging from $47 to $60. \n\nShort term, I'm confident this thing will pop soon. It was hammered down after the Vigtory announcement by shorts, followed by a low volume selloff Friday. It's trading at imo, a massive discount right now.\n\nLong term, this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streaming/sports betting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - get in long, one way or another. Commons, LEAPS, anything... this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings (expected late January to mid-February).
