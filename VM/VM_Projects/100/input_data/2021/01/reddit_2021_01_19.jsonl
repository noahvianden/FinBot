{"title": "The Full DD on $BB: An Elon Musk+Jeff Bezos sandwich for our Supreme Leader John Chen", "selftext": "So you bought $BB at $11 pre-market friday. Smart move my fellow degens 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 strap in, cause you're in for a ride to the moons of fucking pluto.\n\nTL;DR Blackberry/AWS IVY will be in every single vehicle produced after 2022. EV or ICE, self-driving or boomer driving, it doesn't fucking matter. It 🚀 will 🚀 be 🚀 in 🚀 every 🚀 single 🚀 one 🚀 Oh, and Blackberry QNX Neutrinos RTOS is fun too.\n\nBefore you start reading, I'd suggest grabbing a snack and a drink. Cause I'm about to drop a fucking novel.\n\nYou've probably heard Blackberry QNX a few times around other DDs but you're wondering wtf is it and who the hell is even using it. QNX is an Real Time Operating System (more on this later) meant for vehicles, and it's been around for a really long time. Currently there are at least 175m cars running around with QNX. As for what cars those are, I'll keep it short: Apple Car Play was developed on QNX.\n\nSo why haven't we heard more about Blackberry in recent years since there's so many QNX cars around? 2 reasons. 1: Dumbasses like you thought it was a phone company. 2: QNX is so ahead of the fucking game that boomer auto manufacturers like Ford and Mercedes were too stupid to use it effectively. For the last few years it's just been used to turn on your car's radio. *But things have changed now.*\n\n**Zombie cars and QNX**\n\nQNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. *What the fuck does that even mean nerd?* For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.\n\nBlackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.\n\nFast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot *program* but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?\n\n[SONY?](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/sony-reveals-more-details-on-its-secretive-vision-s-sedan/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGWdfOT_GLnUXiZBQr4m4lDr6V0nzG6pkRMU6WLRNhsLRKDJHY4MAwxHb-HWZr3pDmEfBYyleSgqSAIjoeXMqU6MfKVSgBbWY5t8brOzZ61dAfzBMOQezOwKfHLLecBdHNEqSjqSskM_c-uUKa-IndxUGWi_Ay9pQMD4kj0iDqvI) Blackberry QNX. [Baidu?](https://www.chinapev.com/baidu/baidu-and-blackberry-unite-to-integrate-qnx-system-in-apollo-platform/) QNX baby. [XPENG?](https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-08-26/washed-up-phone-maker-blackberry-provides-autonomous-vehicle-safety-system-to-xpeng-101597348.html) Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? [Li Auto](https://en.desaysv.com/index.php?id=4974) But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using [Nvidia](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform) DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both [Canoo](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/blackberry-to-power-autonomy-systems-in-canoos-next-generation-electric-vehicles) and [Hyundai](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/hyundai-autron-selects-blackberry-qnx-to-power-next-generation-adas-and-autonomous-driving-software-platform) makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. *But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.*\n\nYou might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nLinux is also an open source OS and this becomes a huge problem when we talk about zombie cars.\n\nThat's right. *Motherfucking zombie cars*. You know that scene in \"Fate of the Furious\" where Charlize Theron straight up just hacks all the cars in the city and starts slamming them into buildings? Yea, this is a legitimate fear of the U.S. government and Linux is not going to pass any safety regulations. And you better believe after SolarWind and FireEye hacks, Cybersecurity is the hottest topic right now when it comes to national security. You better believe the U.S. Government won't just allow open source OS flowing around millions of autonomous driving cars that can be hijacked at any time of day.\n\nYou know who does have MULTIPLE government certifications already though? Blackberry bb. I won't get it, but you can read [u/josh\\_moworld](https://www.reddit.com/u/josh_moworld/)'s post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/) to get a better idea Blackberry's history with the U.S. government and security.\n\nThe best part about it all is, Blackberry designed QNX to be 100% POSIX compliant. In dumbass terms it basically means any LINUX based program can be ported over easily. Come join the dark side, Elon.\n\nNow that you're pretty much caught up to speed on QNX, let's move over to IVY and why I believe IVY will be Blackberry's return to the throne 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n**Blackberry x AWS IVY**\n\nIVY is a co-development between Blackberry and Amazon and it is a 50/50 partnership. That's right; Jeff Bezos, the second richest man in the world and king of predatory business practices chose to partner with a company that has a $5.5b market cap. All hail, John Chen 👑👑👑\n\nSo what is IVY? Basically IVY cloud-based software that OEMs can install into their QNX vehicles (or any OS) and read sensor data from the vehicle's DCUs (domain controller units). These are basically sensors that give you data such as: times that you unlocked and locked your car, your car's wheel speed sensors, wiper arm sensors, tire pressure etc. In a Tesla, which is loaded with sensors, you will also see: sentry mode data, when an small object hits your car while parked, how hard you step on the accelerator, how hard you brake etc.\n\nIVY basically captures this data and in real time sends it to OEMs for them to analyze. Cars are going to be fitted with more and more sensors (regardless of if they have autonomous systems or not) and the data that IVY provides is very helpful. This allows OEMs to see their customer's car preferences or driving styles and can further develop their future vehicles to match customer's interests. Also, since the data is transferred in REAL TIME, things like horrible weather conditions, traffic updates, and icy roads can be communicated to all vehicles within the OEM network so that people can be notified ahead of time.\n\nBut you know which industry would *love* this? Insurance companies. OEMs can gather all the safety data that IVY delivers and actually PROVE to insurance companies that their cars are safer. You know how Tesla had to come up with their own auto insurance? That was because Insurance companies were charging crazy high rates for Tesla's that had auto pilot. They didn't know exactly how to rate the risk, or who would take the blame. With Blackberry IVY, OEMs and insurance companies can partner together and have reliable data to work off of.\n\nBest part of it all, IVY is extremely scalable and is a subscription based service. There isn't an exact price announced yet, but you know if Jeff Bezos is involved then there will definitely be a lot of profits flowing in from IVY.\n\nFor me, I'm long-term on $BB with some options to take advantage of the recent hype. I plan on holding shares until I see an actual competitor to QNX and IVY... which I've looked all over the internet and I can't find any. And honestly, Blackberry's security suite has so much to offer this isn't even the complete DD. I've just been typing for too long and figured it was a good time to stop.

Lol! Do you or justaneverydaylife (OP) have a clue about how the ODB (On Board Diagnostic) II port telemetrics device works with insurance companies currently? The one that monitors driving habits via bluetooth connected to your cell phone for lower rates? That industry you mentioned that’s a literal money printing machine isn’t in the habit of paying for information or technology they can just make themselves or simply buy out. The driving information from telemetrics devices is worth billions to insurance companies. That would be the reason all auto insurance companies that offer this discount have their own individual devices. How is BlackBerry going to convince ALL the auto insurance companies (you know there’s more than one, right?) to buy the data they aggregate from them versus striking a deal with the drivers of the automobiles aka owners of the data and cutting out multiple middle men? There’s legal leaps and bounds you’re taking with assuming that car owners will ‘opt in’ to forking over their data for free. What if the auto owners simply opt out? Do you have any kind of DD supporting these data gathering sensors using BlackBerry IP will be always on and unable to be opted out of? There’s a reason having a telemetric device in a car lowers, and never raises, insurance rates. Insurance companies are discounting auto premiums to get their devices into cars currently otherwise no one would get one.\n\nEdit: Wanted to put OP on blast too.\n\nEdit part deux: I feel the need to address the QNX part of OP’s post since I only addressed the AWS IVY part. To anyone reading this: go back up and name me one of those ‘auto manufacturers’ that is using QNX in a car they currently make in the capacity OP describes. You know, the capacity that will make the stock skyrocket. Tesla obviously doesn’t count as they use Linux as OP pointed out. Does Apple make a car yet? Do they even have a semi-solid launch date? I heard four years to release, then six, then who knows. How about Sony? Do they have a launch date? A vehicle prototype? Anything besides saying ‘We want to make Elon Musk level monies too so we’re going to make electric cars now. Is everyone cool with waiting six to ten years for us to catch up with where Tesla is currently?’ Notice how any current US auto manufacturer didn’t make that list? I sure did.

{"title": "GME - EndGame Part 2: Cohen, Market Cap, Potential Investors", "selftext": "Hello again folks. This is an extension of my [DD last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwb827/gme_endgame_dtc_infinity/) in which I shared some research on short positions, GME’s debt, and some speculation on institutional investing. Since that post, GME is up 75% and there’s been lots of good [bullish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyuu13/gme_margin_changes_and_their_implications/) / [bearish](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyoixl/gme_option_margin_and_other_factors_for_trading/) DD on the short term.\n\nIn this post, I’m going to cover 3 topics, focusing on the mid-to-long term prospects for GME: 1) Cohen, 2) GME’s market cap potential, and 3) potential investors that could continue to pile in.\n\n**TL:DR;** You need to think about GME differently. Not as a trader. Not as an investor. You need to think like a venture capitalist. This is an **unprecedented** opportunity, and the first time I’ve gone all-in - *I’m more bullish now than when the stock was trading sub $15.* If you’re in GME you need to get in ***with conviction*** otherwise you’re going to lose by selling when it drops.\n\n# Quick aside - my history and positions:\n\nI’ve been a passive investor for many years. This is literally the first time I’ve taken an interest in becoming an active investor. I opened an RH account in August to start speculating on GME. My [first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/isn2g0/cheap_gme_calls_for_a_potential_lottery_win/) called out some cheap lottery plays that took my speculating account from $5K - $20K in 3 weeks. I’ve since posted a few times on GME, [even trying to tell you to buy the post-earnings dip](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k9c95d/gme_earnings_thread/gf4g5vn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and added more to my active trading accounts. I’ve taken $10K -> $130K on RH and $230K -> $480K in IBKR since slowly adding to GME since September.\n\n**UPDATE**: I have deleted my positions in this post - will explain why in my next post. I'm still holding. \n\nAll that being said, thus far I’ve been thinking about GME as a *trade* \\- trying to get in at the lowest cost I could for the maximum upside on a near-term exit, but **I’ve switched completely** into thinking of GME is a **ridiculously asymmetric investment** with massive potential in the next 2-3 year timeframe - even at $35. Even at $45, $50, $60. That’s why I added roughly 2500 shares on Friday at around $36 despite adding very cautiously when GME was below $20. I’m also completely all-in on RH with options (mostly deep ITM, a few fds) - $0 buying power left.\n\nGrab a drink, sit down. Let me tell you why I’ve gotten more aggressive, and probably why you shouldn’t worry about what price you pay right now, as long as you’re willing to **believe and hold.**\n\n# About Cohen (and friends)\n\nFrom the [recent 8K about the board changes](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18396/html) (which you should **definitely read** if you’re putting serious money in):\n\n*As part of the Agreement, RC Ventures has agreed to* ***customary standstill provisions***\\*, which provide that from the date of the Agreement until the earlier of (a) the date that is 30 calendar days prior to the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company’s\\* ***2022*** *annual meeting of stockholders and (b) the date that is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting (such period, the “Standstill Period”), RC Ventures will* ***not, among other things: (i) acquire beneficial ownership in, or aggregate economic exposure to, directly or indirectly, more than 19.9%*** *of the Company’s outstanding common stock; (ii) make any proposal for consideration by stockholders at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Company; (iii) make any offer or proposal with respect to any extraordinary transactions; or (iv) seek, alone or in concert with others, the appointment, election or removal of any directors in opposition to any recommendation of the Board, in each case as further described in the Agreement. As part of the Agreement, the Company has permitted RC Ventures to acquire, whether in a single transaction or multiple transactions from time to time, additional shares of the Company’s common stock to the extent such acquisitions would result in RC Ventures having beneficial ownership of less than 20.0% of the outstanding shares, without triggering the restrictions that would otherwise be imposed under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”), and RC Ventures has agreed that upon acquiring beneficial ownership 20.0% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, the restrictions under Section 203 of the DGCL would apply to a potential business combination with RC Ventures as an “interested stockholder” (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL).*\n\nThis is critical: **This agreement was the result of a negotiation** between Cohen and the existing board.\n\n1. After his [activist letter calling out the board](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) and then [13D](https://fintel.io/doc/sec/1822844/000119380520001571/e620151_sc13da-gamestop.htm) buy after the earnings dip rocketed the stock up from 12 -> 20, it was clear to everyone that RC was the reason GME’s stock was heading up. The GME board was afraid of a hostile takeover / losing their jobs. This agreement allowed Cohen and 2 others on the board as long as he didn’t attempt a hostile takeover.\n2. Cohen wants it all. In the activist letter, he publicly said “no” to just one board seat. He then publicly bought more as soon as Sherman threatened a shelf offering to dilute him below 10%.\n\nIn addition to getting added to the board, Cohen brought along [2 execs who built Chewy with him](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html):\n\n* Alan Attal - the previous **COO and CMO of Chewy** (2011 - 2018)\n* Jim Grube - the previous **CFO of Chewy** (2015 - 2018)\n\nHe’s not fucking around folks. He wants to build another Chewy, and he’s bringing the people who helped him do it the first time to do it again.\n\nAs a result of the agreement, he’s limited to buying up to 20% of shares until 2022. **Why not 13%? Simple - Cohen wants the option to buy more.** He’s not happy with a single board seat; he’s not going to settle for simply getting added to the board; and **he’s not going to settle for 13% ownership.**\n\nAlso, remember that **Alan and Jim have 💲 to buy in** as well. I haven't seen their holdings yet. Their time is worth more than their money and they've already decided to put their time in.\n\n## Cohen is not an exec - he’s a founder with an all-in mentality\n\nGo read this [bloomberg Cohen interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/chewy-founder-cashes-out-bets-on-apple-wells-fargo) to understand his mindset.\n\n1. Cohen himself is an all-in person. Key quote:\n   1. *“When I find things I have a lot of* ***conviction*** *in, I go* ***all-in***\\*.”\\*\n   2. Cohen is a founder that has gone through the successful creation of a startup. **When you are startup founder, most of your NW is tied to equity in your company.** You are trained to have skin in the game. You’re not allowed to think you have a safety net. You give up years of your life and bet everything because you have to believe in what you’re doing. **Founders typically have 30-50% ownership of their company.**\n   3. *“Cohen uses the word “conviction” a lot. He says it’s something he learned from his father, who ran a glassware importing business in Montreal where Cohen grew up. “He taught me how to block the noise from the masses,” says Cohen. “To have a point of view and have conviction and not waver.”*\n2. He only sold Chewy rather taking it to IPO because of his Dad’s health. He cut his entrepreneurial career short and he’s itching to get back in.\n3. Cohen sold Chewy for $3.35B, with estimates stating he personally walked away with about $600M after taxes.\n4. Cohen has a lot of capital to buy more. After selling Chewy, he went all-in on Apple & WFC, which as of June was **up 40%**.\n   1. *“ Cohen says his portfolio, when including dividends and a few other stock holdings, has returned more than 40% over the past 3 years, beating the market.”*\n   2. Aapl **was his largest holding, and** **is up another 50% since June 5** when the Bloomberg article was published.\n   3. Cohen lives in FL - with no income or capital gains for individuals, unlike other founders who live in CA which taxes all cap gains as ordinary income.\n   4. I’m going to estimate *his net worth (minus his GME holdings) is around $800M-$1B.*\n5. Cohen’s 9,001,000 (it’s over 9000! 🐲🏐) shares have thus far been purchased at something like an average of $12/share, for a total investment of around $110M.\n\nSo Cohen has put in $110M out of his $1B into GME. **Does that sound like he’s all-in?** Absolutely fucking not. Cohen’s **going to buy up to the max he can this year** (20%), likely by selling some other holdings prior to [cap gains tax law changes](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/guide-potential-tax-law-changes-under-biden). He can **add more next year** after the standstill period is done.\n\n## What will lead to Cohen’s next purchase of GME\n\nThus far, every RC purchase has been *about sending a message*.\n\n1. Prior to Q3 earnings, his purchases were signaling an intent to the board that he was serious about wanting to get involved. He also rubbed it in their faces that the stock price was largely appreciating because of him. From the [activist letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf):\n   1. “We recognize that the Board may feel it is insulated from stockholder scrutiny after adding new directors this past spring and seeing a recent stock price uptick **(which only came on the heels of RC Ventures filing its 13D)”**  (what a *fucking burn*).\n2. If there was any doubt about RC’s impact on the stock price, it was put to rest after Q3’s earnings, where the current leadership’s hubris and threat of diluting RC led to a drop of almost 30%. RC then bought the dip, shoved it in their faces, and the market GME again rocketing GME to 20 in a massive post-earnings recovery. Message sent again - “The market wants me. Let me the fuck in.”\n3. Now that Cohen and the Chewy folks are on the board, he’s going to angle for CEO. He’s not looking to **advise** GME. He wants to go all-in, to run GME. *He’s holding the optionality of buying more based on the success of his attempt to take over GME through non-hostile means.*\n\n**If you see Cohen buy more GME, he’s sending another message.** This time it’s because it’s clear to him he’s going to be CEO and wants to max his skin in the game. **If you see Cohen buy, it’s “CEO talks going well” - you fucking buy.**\n\n# GME’s market cap potential\n\n1. Cohen sees a [$200BN+ total addressable market cap for gaming by 2023](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf). For contrast, Chewy was playing in the pet food/supplies market, which has a total addressable market (TAM) of [under $50BN annually](https://www.americanpetproducts.org/press_industrytrends.asp). **GME’s potential is at base 4x that of Chewy.** This **does not even account for the pc gaming hardware market**, which is another $[35BN](https://www.statista.com/statistics/269244/graphics-hardware-market-value-in-the-gaming-segment-since-2009/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,by%20the%20end%20of%202020.)\\+.\n2. Chewy’s market cap is [$44BN](https://www.google.com/search?q=chewy+market+cap&oq=chewy+market+cap&aqs=chrome..69i57j0j0i22i30l3.6432j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) on [$6BN](https://s23.q4cdn.com/610444331/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/3Q-2020-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf) of annual revenue.\n3. Chewy’s Q3 quarterly income was up 45% YoY. While GME’s quarterly income was down YoY, [its e-commerce revenue was **up 257%** trouncing Chewy’s growth rate](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-third-quarter-results-positive-start-fourth).\n4. GME’s Q4 early sales preview reported [**300% E-commerce growth and annual run-rate of $5BN**](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results)\n\nIn other words, *even if you give GME’s physical locations no value*, GME’s ecommerce business is **growing 5x faster than Chewy** and already has 75% of online revenue.\n\n**Summary:** Chewy is priced > 7X times its annual **total revenue**. GME is priced at .45 **its annual ecommerce revenue,** despite GME having **5-6 greater TAM** and growing its ecommerce business **5X as fast Chewy.**\n\nWhat. The. Fuck.\n\nI’ve never seen a stock more mispriced.\n\nPeople talking about $100 price targets are suffering from a *fucking lack of imagination.*\n\nEven if you *completely* discount\n\n1. GME’s physical business\n2. its rev sharing partnership with MSFT\n3. its 5x faster growth and 5x TAM\n\nand give GME the same P/S multiple that Chewy has on its ecommerce business, **that puts GME currently at a fair market cap above $35BN.** That means GME should be **at least $500/share.**\n\nIn pictures:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparing Ecommerce Revenue vs Market cap on Chewy vs GME today](https://preview.redd.it/ig5kkkan38c61.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6a955c07ef3502d4644fc0b35949c9d0726c4af)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Showing what the fair market value Market Cap of GME would be with Chewy's P\\/S](https://preview.redd.it/qtac0v6r38c61.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=54331bbdf749bdea5818092970edf17094d6e752)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fair Market Value \\(using comps\\) of GME is at least $500\\/share.](https://preview.redd.it/gimdi0au38c61.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b7a548c7125ccb14d3e93c78f8c24f5123e2ed)\n\n**$35/share is a fucking steal.** Who cares about the short-term dips as shorts try to weasel themselves out of their positions. The market will eventually wake up to this sleeping beast. In a year you’re not going to care if you got in at 4, 12, 20, 35, or 50. You’re going to only care if you’re in or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Potential Investors\n\nAn asset is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it, right? So are the potential buyers of this growing company?\n\nHere’s a list in decreasing order of likelihood.\n\n1. **Elon** (Least likely, completely improbable, but cataclysmic event). Elon hates shorts. Elon, with TSLA, went through the pain that GME is going through. TSLA almost went bankrupt because shorts were pushing the price down so it was difficult to raise the cash they needed to survive. Sound familiar? ***Elon’s wealth swings more in a day than GME is worth in entirety.*** Elon could **buy all the fucking float of GME with what he makes in 8 hours**. One call from fellow entrepreneur and [aspiring twitter-meme-god](https://twitter.com/ryancohen) would absolutely wreck the game.\n   1. **If you are short gamestop**, you are one meme purchase by the richest man in the world away from a fucking cataclysmic event. \"Hey son, I heard you like games. So I bought you gamestop. All of it.\" 🚀\n2. **Buffett** (More likely, still improbable). I’m actually amazed that while Buffett & co were lamenting that there are no interesting stocks to invest in and moving to cash, that they absolutely missed the boat on GME while it was at its lows. It’s a complete value play right up his alley (in a business he can understand). My only hypothesis here is that the market cap is too small and he could not make a meaningful investment. Once GME grows to a more respectable market cap ($10b+) I can see Buffett stepping in and making an investment.\n3. **Cohen’s connections. (Highly likely if Cohen is CEO).** This is the big one. And I mean absolutely nail in the coffin re-pricing of GME for the foreseeable future. [Go read this Harvard Business Review piece](https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-founder-of-chewy-com-on-finding-the-financing-to-achieve-scale) on Cohen specifically on how Cohen puts importance on raising money and the people that backed him.\n   1. Look, I’ve started a startup before in the valley (unsuccessfully unfortunately). However, you don’t start a company without making a shit-ton of venture capitalist & angel investor connections. Cohen has stated that when pitching Chewy he was rejected by [over 100 investors](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackfriedman/2020/08/16/entrepreneur-chewy-founder-ryan-cohen-shares-his-best-advice/?sh=4e3c77f95840). I can absolutely-fucking-guarantee you that every single one of them remembers their mistake and would not miss the opportunity to invest in Cohen again. And don’t forget all of the investors who DID invest with Cohen and reaped the benefits with Chewy. While venture capitalists don’t generally make investments in public equities, this is a **truly unique situation. Cohen is treating this like a rebirth, a new venture bootstrapped from GME’s bones.** If VCs as a firm will not invest, you can bet your ass that those individuals will throw their personal money at Cohen. **However this only happens if he’s CEO.** As soon as he’s CEO, a single long weekend trip to the valley might mean 100+ investor meetings with the strategic pitch.\n      1. My biggest fear here is that VCs/PE band to take the company private at some small multiple (2-3x) and then reap the benefits while Cohen turns the company around only to re-list it to us 5 years down the road at 30X the valuation.\n   2. Thus far, it’s been us retail retards vs the wall street shorts. HFs shorting this thing have the advantage in both tactics and capital. However, **if Silicon Valley money starts pouring money into this the game is over.** You cannot believe the amount of money that gets thrown into startups with 90% of it burning up into thin air. $3B market cap? That’s nothing. Folks with Silicon Valley money & risk tolerance would have no problem betting on a serial entrepreneur making something amazing out of a company that already has a customer base, revenue, distribution - all in the same business (e-commerce) the entrepreneur already proved themselves in.\n4. **You, and every other retard that believes.** Look, this was my point at the beginning. You need to think like a VC here. VCs are the ultimate YOLO autists making million dollar bets and not seeing a penny of it for years. They are the ultimate 💎✋🤚. **You need to decide if you have conviction** for the long term and then buy in. 💎✋🤚 doesn’t mean selling at $100. It doesn’t means selling at $200. **It means not selling at all this year no matter the price, and at least until you learn for sure whether Cohen is the new CEO**. It means believing so hard that you 20-100X your investment in 2 years when the market wakes up to the ridiculous mispricing.\n   1. Remember that if Cohen is elected CEO he can (and likely will) buy more than a 20% stake in 2022.\n   2. Remember Buffett’s actual quote: [**\"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\"**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2018/01/30/winning-in-the-market-with-the-patience-of-the-wright-brothers-and-warren-buffett/?sh=26303ec3633b)\n\n**I’ve put every dollar I can** into shares in IBKR, minus some April calls.

{"title": "🚀$PLTR Premarket DD", "selftext": "Alright, as promised in some comments last night I’ll give you retards some buy sentiment for Palantir.\n\nWHO AM I AND WHY GIVE A FUCK\n\nI am a big tendie eating retard that works military intelligence for the Marine Corps, I worked Palantir before they stopped funding. (Don’t let that scare you). I bought in day one around lunch, if you wanna see DM me and I’ll provide receipts. Additionally I’m now 135 shares in and opened 5 call contracts.\n\nMilitary use of the program is simply not  “spying on you” bullshit they’d have you eat up on the 🌈🐻 articles that cause our tendie machine to slow down. In fact military intelligence is legally prevented from conducting intelligence on US Persons. I can’t speak for other actors in the Intel community but it’s expressly forbidden on my end. Palantir doesn’t enable us to spy on you, but it allows for us to compile data and speed high level decision making up at a rate that was simply beyond expectations previous to utilizing it. What does that mean? Well for one, if you provide military organizations with success in ‘killing bad dudes’ then they’ll always have you in their pocket. I say if your taxpayer dollars are funding a program, you might as well double down and buy what you’re already paying for. I wouldn’t bet against a country that nuked another...twice. We can talk about Japan more later tho.\n\nCommercial use? The fucking cuck circus over at shitron fails to see that they’re reliably and consistently expanding business. France, South America, Africa, JAPAN 🇯🇵 (should’ve put Japan first but stuck with caps to provide a bit less of a smooth read for you autistic cunts.) I’ll elaborate that. Japan has been historically tough for US companies to break through to, but Sompo and its associates are big Palantir and we shouldn’t be taking that lightly. The uses for Palantir are unlimited and can greatly improve over time, with new products ie. Palantir Apollo. The market for data collected or data synthesis isn’t ripe with competitive companies like the 🌈🐻s would have you believe. Sure snowflake and other peers have similar mission but none have the same reach and same customer specific outreach and development cycle. I can’t express enough how much of a buy this is.\n\nPalantir as a company. This is huge because it speaks volumes about where they could go. Palantir was operating shy of 20 yrs before their listing, and they’ve been increasing the amount of ‘news’ on their site loading up on contracts all over the globe. Sure their operating losses are scary at first sight but they’re dumping heavily into R&D, building new SaaS as mentioned before and expanding heavily into the commercial market. Karp is the new Jobs, or even the next Alphabet CEO. Palantir is headed to household notoriety. Expect it, sooner than you can imagine it’ll be everywhere, even Queen Cathie bought in. \n\nTL;DR \nI wear camo and hate life...but Cathie, Japan, and Biden are fucking fueling our little rocket, next stop, fucking Jupiter \n\n🚀🚀🚀📈📈📈💎🤲🖕🌈🐻\n\nPS: Thank you window lickers for my first Reddit gold, truly humbled by your response.", "id": "l0k8aw", "created_utc": 1611064400.0, "score": 224, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "Hello fellow crayon eater, you lost me at intelligence and marine corps.

Looking at the cyber security industry, BB outperforms on a number of metrics.  Price to sales is 5.85 vs 11.31 industry.  As well price to book is 3.11 vs industry 11.44, this indicates relative to its industry BB is highly undervalued(Value investors look for P/B ~(0-3), so BB just about fits in there). They also operate on gross margins 3.3% higher than industry.  All this to say, BB is going to reach a more accurate share price, it’s just a matter of time🚀🚀🚀\n-outperforms market in cyber security, 10% more growth on the year than the industry average and it still has undervalued metrics, this is only the beginning🚀🚀🚀\nAWS Partnership\n\n-Partnership with Amazon Web Services to expand QNX systems that are already trusted and viable.  New system will be backed by Amazon and allow new capabilities for car manufacturers to interpret sensor data and improve driving experience for their cars.  Possible features included but not limited to predictive maintenance, tracking driving habits and even book spots for EV charging along your route.  Once integrated with Amazon’s IoT and machine learning services, IVY will be ready and is expected in 2023.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n-Amazon is helping to market IVY so it will be extremely competitive from an industry leading cloud computing company and also backed by the goat of cyber security (BB), their birth child IVY will secure Tendies for all WSB retards🚀🚀🚀🚀\n-John Chen👑\n\nSaved BB in 2013 from sinking to nothing with Apple as competition, pioneered them back to the front(soon)of another field and is still CEO.  If that wasn’t enough, he is taking bonuses in shares and gets a huge bonus when shares reach $30, this means his bottom line for the company vision is the same as ours. Shares🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚\n-Large Mobilization of Funds\n\nBB sold 90 patents to Huawei, which serves 2 fold, no more fees on those patents and also increased capital.  As well they settled with FB for an unknown amount, this also is a double edged sword, no more uncertainty(or fees) due to lawsuit and they will have a sizable settlement (hopefully to spend on R &amp;amp; D) for IVY🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nReasons (not)to Buy:\n\nEarnings Down/\nAnalysis, QNX loses a significant portion of revenue, given auto industry was significantly impacted, so was licensing sales of QNX, Chen says sales will return to previous when auto sales correct.\n\nIf IVY cannot increase profit margins or expand user base it will be an R and D cost alone...  Given the new value however, I’m confident in its larger profit margin.
