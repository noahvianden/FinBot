Trust me your wallet will thank you.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "My advice is to look into selling puts first.  Basically pick a stock that you don’t mind owning for a lower price (let’s say Tesla as an example).  You sell a put for the end of the week at a way OTM strike that suits your fancy.  Let’s say you pick $500 strike or something.  You’ll make $30 for one contract - yes I know not a lot of money but bear with me here.\n\nSo if Tesla does not fall to $500 by Friday, you pocket the $30 free and clear and are free to do it again next week.  Now this is a very bad example - why?   Well you’re locking up $50k in value to earn 30 bucks - talk about not worth it right? (your broker will require you to have this amount waiting to go in case Tesla does fall to that amount and you’re assigned).\n\nSo there are a couple things you can do.  Pick a stock with a relatively low price so you don’t need as much capital locked up.  Or you can do a vertical spread ie sell a put let’s say for $500 then use the proceeds to immediately buy a put for $495 or something even lower.  This is a little more advanced as a concept but the execution is relatively straight forward.\n\nI’m still learning myself but have made quite a bit in the last few months just by doing cash covered put selling (then the wheel when assigned) and vertical spreads several times a week on SPY.\n\nI even created a small account challenge for myself with a 10k starting balance to trade for 2021 so I can better understand the mechanics and limitations of small accounts - so far I’m up a hair over 7.5% in the first week on vertical spreads in that account.  I should be up another 8-9% this week doing very YOLO type stuff for now in that account like betting the farm on SPY verticals but I won’t keep doing this.  My goal is to help my sister and friends who have tiny accounts and little experience in stocks/options and help sift through various strategies to give them some safe bets to execute regularly to grow their accounts this year. \n\nAnyway I wish you luck!  Feel free to DM me for videos that helped me understand all these types of trades.  I think eventually I’ll learn more advanced strategies but I’m the sort of person to sift through various things and find the simplest and most efficient means to accomplish something and these suit me well thus far.\n\nEdit: fixed bunch of typos\nEdit again:  Figure I should post this here as I’ve gotten a few messages already:\n\nSimply put the vertical spread on SPY seems to be the most optimal thing I can find right now.  Again, I’m just learning this...\n\nBasics of the vertical I’m doing now: https://youtu.be/YfYjNovwph8\n\nVerticals let’s you highly leverage for a defined risk is there is a cap to how much you can lose (and gain for that matter). \n\nExample:   I have 100 vertical contracts in my 10k account right now.  This is the Max allowed given my account value.  Each time I do this, I gain $400-600 depending on what strikes I pick.\n\nNow this is not recommended (bet entire account all at once in one play) but it’s my process for learning about something - it wouldn’t be the most I’ve lost in a day haha. I like to test limits and see what happens.  Better for me than just reading about it or watching a video.\n\nSo if I earn $500 on average each trade against my 10k, I earn 5%.  Do this 3 times a week and I make $1500 (15%).\n\nThere a few risk factors of course that and scenarios that can generate max loss which is why I would not keep this.  But short of the market completely tanking by 4pm eastern in Monday, I will have made another $500\n\nThe key is to have an exit criteria settled on (like, I’ll sell out after I hit 75% max gain) and a management strategy ie “what to do in case things go the wrong direction”.  Like example:  for most of my covered calls, the goal is premium collection and not to sell the stock.  The side effect of Tesla running up so high is that most of my covered calls have to get rolled up and out each week.  This is my management strategy since I don’t want to sell the stock now. \n\nIt’s no sweat off my back as I don’t count rolling as losses really (rightly or wrongly).  I’m just delaying the premium being mine free and clear - plus at some point I will win since Tesla will have a price shock sooner or later because something Elon says/does or they miss a short term target and the pundits/tv hosts do their thing.  At that point, the calls I sold will tank and I can buy them back for a win.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks. Will look more into that.

It is way less stressful and more likely to \"work out\" doing boring things like covered calls than YOLOing. I was trying to \"make it work\" with more conservative bets (spreads, condors, etc...) but even then I had one particularly bad month and lost almost everything. I came to the conclusion that options-only positions aren't backed by anything, so they're much more likely to go to 0 than positions backed by a real asset (a share). A few caveats, I didn't really feel like I had enough buying power to get this working until I had ~$5k (but I also turned margin on, so actually $10k without it). You need to choose your underlying carefully. It should be rising or neutral, but good luck getting enough premium from a neutral underlying. If it's rising, don't compare yourself to the \"perfect\" trade. You *will* underperform buying precisely at the bottom and selling precisely at the top. That is not the opportunity cost of selling a covered call. Instead compare to a baseline like $SPY. That's what you're trying to beat. \n\nSo while it's \"boring\" compared to other strategies, keep a stable of candidates around and buy some of the one you feel best about.

I thought to myself, “who in their right mind would give me 5k right now for the right to buy 100 shares of Tesla stock today?  That’s nuts!”  So I sold one at market price and it filled immediately.  Easy money for now.  I just need to wait for the stock to pull back sometime nearer to the expiration and buy this back for much less.  If I’m wrong, the stock goes up to 1200 on or before that day then I can roll the option: buy it back for a loss and then sell a new one further out in the future that is about the same premium that I loss.  In this case, let’s say it goes way up and I buy the contract back for 10k (losing 5k).

Better for a boring/mature stock like Microsoft (which I have and sell weekly calls against too).  This a very sleepy boring low income trade but that’s the point.

You need to go back to what an options contract *is* to understand the answer to that question. \n\nA call option gives the buyer the right to purchase 100 shares from the seller at a given price by a given date. If the price of the underlying is below the agreed upon price (the strike price), then there's no incentive for the buyer to exercise the option and it becomes more worthless over time. If the price is above the strike price the buyer can exercise the contract and buy at the strike price. Then they can sell on the open market and pocket the difference in price. The value of an \"In The Money\" (ITM) call will be a little higher than that, but will decay toward it in time. \n\nSo you end up losing money over time no matter what, but that can be offset by movements in the underlying. For example, if it moves from being \"Out of the Money\" (OTM) to ITM then you start accumulating intrinsic value very quickly. \n\nSo yes, it's possible to buy a contract on Monday and sell by Friday for a profit if the underlying moves favorably, but the risk is that the underlying *doesn't* move favorably and the value of the contract decays to nothing, in which case you lose everything you paid for the contract -so the risk is... high. \n\n\"The Greeks\" are some mathematical terms that describe how the value of an option *should* move with relation to changes in the price of the underlying and time, but they're only approximations because there's a big fudge factor called implied volatility that can only be observed, not predicted. They're very useful to understand, but also understand that the ones making money from \"abusing\" the Greeks are the really big guys to whom the extra few basis points you pick up by playing those positions perfectly are worth it. \n\nPick up a single Greek, I recommend Theta because it's kind of mid level in terms of complexity, but offers a nice risk/return on introductory strategies. Go all in on strategies based on that Greek. You might need to get up to level three options to really do that. Then once you've got a handle on something like Theta, start branching out -Delta is a natural follow on from Theta.\n\nThat would be my advice.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "“If I will buy a call option (at the money)on Monday and then sell it on the same week on or before Friday hoping the stock price will go up. What risks am I involved in?”\n\nMax risk: The amount you paid for the option. \n\nWhile that’s true, it conceals some of the juicier nuances that make options so interesting and strategic!\n\nFor example, you mention, kind of in passing, that you’re buying at-the-money (ATM) calls. \n\nThat detail is absolutely *CENTRAL* to the conversation and arguably a mistake right out of the gate given your objective. \n\nAssuming I’ve read your note right and your thesis is that the stock is going to go up then you’re likely better off with any of the following:\n\nA) in-the-money (ITM) or out-of-the-money (OTM) calls instead of ATM or, \nB) a bull call spread \n\nHere’s why:\n\nTime value is *greatest* at-the-money.\n\nAs such, 1.) as the underlying price goes up AND/OR down, you will lose time value AND 2.) as time passes, theta (or time decay) will also be decreasing your time-value (extrinsic value).  You time value cost/risk will be greatest with ATM calls!\n\nOTM Calls\nUsing OTM calls will increase the chance your calls expire worthless BUT 1.) you will have less money at risk and 2.) moves in your direction will improve your time value, not hurt it like with ATM calls. \n\nITM Calls\nUsing ITM calls can reduce your exposure to time value as well. The further ITM you go 1.) the less you’ll have to spend on time value and 2.) the more your option’s gains will mimic the gains in the underlying i.e., deeper ITM calla have higher deltas. However, you will have to put more money at-risk. So, if you’re wrong and the stock goes down, you’ll have money money on the table (and remember, you can lose it all if the stock drops below the strike at expiration)\n\nBull Call Spread\nIf you’re dead set on using ATM calls, you could reduce the cost of time value by turning it into a bull call spread i.e., writing/selling a higher priced call. You’ll be capping your upside should the stock rip but, you’ll get a decent amount of time value back. \n\n/TLDR:  While your max risk is “losing it all” using ATM calls is probably putting you at the biggest risk of realizing that loss. Consider using ITM or OTM calls to reduce your “time value” costs and effects of time decay. Alternatively, consider also selling a higher priced call to turn the trade into a bull call spread which will reduce both the amount you spend on time value and your time decay. \n\n“How can I correlate with theta and iv volatility?”\nSince you’re planning on using ATM calls, high IV will increase time value. As such, theta will be higher (because there’s more time value to erode by expiry)\n\n“Can I still make some profits before the expiration?”\nYes, but using ATM calls vs any of the options above will probably make it harder. You’ll need a decent move in your favour and likely early in the week. \n\nI know that’s a lot so let me know if you have any follow up questions. Options are just the most beautiful game!

Primarily using short put/call spreads, 45 dte, 40% ITM. This is just the starting point, I adjust based on chart. This one is just starting with less and using Robinhood instead of Tastyworks. Last one went well, even with Corona, but starting over always brings risk. I realize prior success means nothing about future returns but the first challenge ended 2020 with a 337.1% return. It started on 2/20/2020 with $2,200 and is currently sitting at $9,300\n\nIf interested you can watch some of my old videos and see if it's something you could get into following. I will complete this challenge one way or another and keep everyone updated (via ongoing youtube videos and a reddit post at end of year). Either I will hit 0 or I will hit 10k. If you have any questions please let me know and I'll answer to the best of my ability.\n\nFeel free to follow on youtube ([https://youtube.com/tastytracker](https://youtube.com/tastytracker)) and twitter ([https://twitter.com/toddhorst](https://twitter.com/toddhorst)). I post charts on twitter daily.\n\nI will be starting on monday, currently have no positions.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI have been asked to add more details to ensure this is a valid post. I will try to be as descriptive here to hopefully avoid a takedown.\n\nAccount Setup: First, lets get out of the way, that to start you will need $1000 in a MARGIN account. Cash accounts usually don't allow spreads due to the collateral that is required. This isn't the same margin that you would use to purchase say $4000 of stocks, when you only have $2000. If you do that you are borrowing from the broker, and you pay them interest on that money. Because these are risked defined spreads, we can skate use margin, but not be charged for it because the broker knows we are only responsible for the difference between the strikes we choose.\n\nSymbols: I am only looking for best of industry type of companies, and a slow and steady up trend. That means no ipos, spacs, and generally avoid earnings. These are too risky. So I'm playing things like aapl, amzn, fb, cost, sedg, ma, etc. I have about 30 that I use and am very intimate with so I am comfortable with their ranges. This is preferred to me compared to the scan and pray method. Wait of the setup, then strike. These have the benefit of a tighter bid/ask spread.\n\nSetup: Ideally we are hugging the 20day or 50day sma line up, and are using that as support. Maybe recently there was a leg up, and we are building a base in a tight range for several days, looking likes its coiling, macd and rsi are oversold and are starting to curl up. Because Im playing quality companies, and I want to follow the trend, this means Im typically doing short put spreads, meaning I want the stock to go up in value.\n\nEntry: Looking at the 40% ITM (in the money, delta is approx), 45 days to expiration. This is a starting point. I look at the chart to see where possible levels of support may be, and try to determine if the premium the 40% itm strike gets me is adequate. Im typically looking for $160 premium, $5 wide spreads, so a $340 collateral per position. But if the chart is telling me its about to take off, its at the bottom of its channel, then I may go more aggressive (as I did today in the apple position).\n\nExit: Right after I get filled, I enter a closing order for a 50% gain of the potential profit. This allows me to not have to watch the computer all day. I will check in once a day to see what the stock is doing. If needed I will roll puts up, or out for a credit.", "id": "kps1xl", "created_utc": 1609704976.0, "score": 433, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 183, "comments": [{"body": "Good luck!

Palantir is doing two things that are untouched at the moment. First, he says that as a contracting agency is doing their own background research on their own needs, Palantir is at the table and listening and constantly sculpting their product to meet that demand. This means that when an RFP comes out that Palantir already has the product ready and tailored for the need. That's one great advantage. Second, Palantir is eliminating the need to hire a secondary \"integrator\". In layman's terms, their competitors like Salesforce and Oracle and so on only sell the client a license to use the software. This means that you need to hire an external consulting firm to integrate (tailor) the product to the contracting agency's demands. Palantir eliminates this middle man (integrator) entirely. He says that the product and service that Palantir offers is more expensive than their competitors, but there they offer the product at a much lower effort level than anyone else.

See below.\n\nSales team:\n\nEssentially Palantir in the 17 years of existence, only has had a sales team for 1.5 years. The reasoning behind this is because internally, Palantir did not want to go the whole sales route of software but recently, that they needed to if they ever wanted to go public and thus reward their share holders. Since the sales team is so new, one can say that they are essentially a new company in that they are in the early years of growth. Palantir also finally has built out their Foundry Platform and Apollo platforms over the years and are now ready to ramp up a lot of customers quickly. \n\nEfficiency / Apollo:\n\nPalantir as a company has become extremely more efficient the past 1-2 years when it comes to acquiring new customers and ramping them up. The reasoning behind this is their Apollo Platform. It’s an in house platform that uses ML to help get a customer up and going a lot faster than previously. In the past, Palantir would have to send “forward deployed engineers” to customers to get them up and running and that could take weeks / months and is costly. Now With Apollo, Palantir can get a customer up and running in hours without sending anyone. This frees up cash for Palantir the invest back into R&D. Also wanted to mention, during the last Q3 earnings call, an analyst asked the headcount growth for the company. Most high growth companies tend to hire a lot of ppl to keep that growth rate up. A company doing that that comes to mind is Snowflake. Palantir’s CFO said that their headcount is only growing 2-3% and mostly in the sales department. The reasoning of this is directly due to Apollo. Palantir’s employees have become more efficient and that with Apollo, they can onboard a lot of customers without hiring more expensive engineers. \n\nPalantir Modules:\n\nOn the Q3 earnings call, Palantir alluded to an ERP type Modules for Foundry that they are working on so that customers can pick and choose which aspects of Foundry they want, instead of getting the whole suite. This is great because it’s way cheaper for a company to get started with Palantir’s software and then slowly ramp up with more options. Palantir has a very high retention rate with their software so by having a company only pick 1-2 modules, it most likely will result in getting more and more modules which in turns create more revenue for PLTR. I suspect they will talk about this come the Demo day.\n\nFinal thoughts. \n\nPalantir has great leadership and are very smart people. They are very methodical in their planning. This company is 100% a long term hold. Think 5-10 years at least. They only had a sales team for 1.5 years and already will have over $1B in sales with virtually no sales team.

Buying weekly and buying stock were comparable before tax. With a wheel you can probably do little better. Obviously there are weeks in where you would not want to mess with covered calls and avoid some callaways. \n\nill look into it further but first signs point to that buying stock is overall a good idea. And selling up to 25% otm weekly covered calls on them have been a losing proposition vs just holding if you dont have your own strategy behind. Just blindly selling covered calls i bet most strikes would be in the red vs holding stock and not messing around with it.\n\nI would not probably do it if i couldnt come up with my own flavor for it.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "When Tesla releases subscription-based full self driving, they should also offer a financing option that would lock in the price.

The information is abundant.\n\nGiven the above, most people aren't likey to invest much in a response because you 1. Either already know and don't care and are likely just trolling or 2. Are shorting companies with a very limited understanding of the bull thesis which implies some pretty poor judgment in the first place so why fill a leaky bucket?\n\nI think it might be more fruitful for you to explain why you are short and at what time horizon and ask for reasons why some of your assumptions or info could be wrong. I think when people hear short they automatically think this means you are expecting tesla to go to zero, which might not be the case for you.\n\nIf someone was short tesla on a very short-term time horizon, I could understand that a bit more given the meteoric rise this year. Pretty much no one predicted the SP to grow this quickly.

{"title": "Why did PLTR sell off last week? (An analysis)", "selftext": "# Everybody that wanted in, was already in\nAccording to finviz.com, retail investors own 79% of PLTR's float (shares available for trading), suggesting that much of the price increase from $10 to over $30 in the past 3 months was driven by said class of investors. It's unlikely that risk-sensitive institutions would be heavily involved in such a feverish stock. For example, Palantir's market cap increased by more than $10 billion in a couple days after the announcement of a $44 million 3-year partnership with the FDA. $44 million over 3 years is a rounding error relative to its annual revenue.\nAfter hitting its $33 peak, PLTR pulled back and consolidated at a $25 to $29 price range. During this time, people continue to be bullish for the stock with many believing that it'll soon break all-time-highs again. Unfortunately, at least in the short term, everyone that wanted in was already in and the lack of new buying primed the stock for a sell-off. Another way to spot this is when /r/WallStreetBets starts being filled with bullish commentary for the stock. On a few days in November and December, the majority of the subreddit was talking about PLTR. If you think about it, users would only create a bullish post or upvote bullish posts of a stock if they already had a long position.\nOnce the buying pressure waned, a small amount of selling compounded with other bearish factors discussed below were sufficient to trigger large waves of selling.\n# Options market makers selling hedged stocks for sold calls\nOptions market makers are institutions contracted by an exchange to supply liquidity to the options market, even when there's no willing external buyer or seller. Market makers make money by buying or selling options to traders at slightly worse prices than the actual price, and pocketing the difference. As such, they aren't interested in making a directional bet on a stock's price by being short or long options and whenever you sell or buy an option from them, they need to hedge their position.\nSpecifically, when a market maker sells a call option to a trader, the market maker needs to hedge by buying the underlying stock. When a market maker buys a call option from a trader, the market maker shorts the underlying stock. Vice versa for puts.\nPLTR had a large number of open call positions expiring at year-end. As price fell, most of these options expired worthless and the market makers that sold them had to unwind their hedges. Because market makers buy the underlying stock to hedge against a sold call position, they sell said stock when unwinding the hedge. As large numbers of PLTR's call options expired worthless at year-end, options market makers sold the PLTR they bought as a hedge which contributed to the year-end price decline.\n# Institutional funds rebalancing\nEven though retail investors own most of Palantir's tradeable shares, institutions do own a non-trivial amount (12% of the float, according to finviz.com) that were mostly acquired during the IPO. These institutions include Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, and Soros Fund Management. Funds have a target ownership percentage for each portfolio stock and when its price increases or decreases dramatically in a short period, the fund needs to rebalance by selling or buying said stock. Rebalancing happens either at a fixed time period or when an imbalance threshold is crossed. Because PLTR's price appreciated so rapidly in just a couple months, it probably fell victim to year-end institutional rebalancing.\n# Frontrunning profit-taking in 2021\nBecause PLTR's price increased so rapidly in 2020, traders are expected to sell in 2021 to defer taxes for one year. It's likely that some traders attempted to get ahead of this expectation by selling a few days before December 30th (trades executed on and after this date settle in 2021). PLTR's price started to fall off a cliff on December 28th and it kept falling until the year's last trading day on December 31st. As such, the selling on the 28th and 29th is partially attributed to traders frontrunning new-year-profit-taking while the selling on the 30th and 31st is new-year-profit-taking.\n# Frontrunning the 2021 lock-up period expiry\nPalantir's IPO was a direct listing meaning that it only made existing shares sellable on the market. No new shares were created and sold. This means that insiders (founders, employees, and VCs) own most of Palantir's shares. During the IPO, these insiders could only sell 20% of their holdings and the other 80% are locked up until after 2021's first earnings report. Unsurprisingly, traders expect more selling than usual when these shares unlock since 80% is a lot of shares. Long time PLTR holders will want to divest at least some of their holdings. It's plausible that, like new-year-profit-taking, traders are selling early to get ahead of the lock-up period ending.\n# Price chart sell signals\nTechnical analysis (using price charts to determine when to buy or sell) is controversial but still popularly used to predict short term price movements. PLTR's chart displayed several sell signals ever since it peaked at $33. For one, the chart has a giant double top with rejections at $33 and $31 on November 27th and December 8th respectively. A double top is a very popular sell signal. Bullish momentum and volume has also waned since the price peak with daily MACD (a technical indicator) becoming bearish on December 10th. Falling momentum is no bueno for a stock driven by momentum.\nYou can find more of my stock market analyses in the [FinanceTLDR blog](https://www.financetldr.com).", "id": "kpkd97", "created_utc": 1609679388.0, "score": 255, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "So buy more PLTR, got it chief", "score": 378, "replies": [{"body": "Scrolled past OP to first comment.

TRUELY HONORED TO BE PART OF THE GME FAM. 🚀\n\n# Introduction\n\n[**PDF VERSION HERE**](https://gofile.io/d/RvbNnA) (20+ pages) with all the references and better quality illustrations but without updates and typo corrections. This is the FIRST VERSION of the post, but there could be more edits. I wanted to do a more extensive DD but as my exams start tomorrow I don’t have more time. If you want to take my work and extend it, please feel free to do so, just give a little shout out.\n\n***FIRST AND FOREMOST, SHOUTOUT TO 🚀💎🙌 GME GANG 💎🙌 🚀, YOU’RE IN MY ❤️.***\n\n**This DD is just my own analysis. I put my money where my mouth is but this is definitely not advice. Do your own DD.**\n\n**Last thing**:  Some stuff might be unsourced in this post but everything is sourced in the pdf version. While it’s not impossible that I might have missed some stuff, most of the time I put the stuff that I quote from other sources in italics. My ego is not big enough to feel like reformulating other people’s ideas and even less to steal other people's ideas. All I do is just gather insightful facts, figures, ideas and analysis.\n\n# Big picture\n\n## 1.1 Macroeconomic View\n\nI will be brief here, I think everyone knows what’s up basically.\n\n[Figure 1: although the USD is worth a lot less, the S&P 500 is doing alright. Thanks Jerome.](https://preview.redd.it/iqtnlebs96961.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=056c4261f530831621fb22bf4f4bf199e5e21f6a)\n\nEnthusiasm is the key word here as we are in an environment with a very accommodative monetary and fiscal policy (thanks for the stimulus checks). Equities and Bitcoin hit record highs thanks to positive vaccine news and the markets hope for a fiscal package. The Federal Reserve is going heavy on asset purchases, bailouts and loans. And its balance sheet is expanding as well as money supply. Interest rates are extremely low.\n\nCheck for example, the [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) to see the enthusiasm driving the markets.\n\nOn a macro-level side from the risks related to the pandemic, the only worrying signs would be the shrinking money velocity or a suddenly-rising inflation (hyperinflation is bullish for stocks but not for the real economy).\n\nThat being said, we know how the FED and the government reacted to support the economy and the markets. Low interest rates and weak US dollar which is continuing to depreciate is very bullish for stocks overall.\n\nI keep the macroeconomic view very short for that GME correlation with the S&P 500 is low - about 28% over the last 6 months. Moreover despite GME’s heavy reliance on brick-and-mortar stores, GME continues to get closer to profitability even with the pandemic.\n\nIf the pandemic would make the stock market to crash again during the trade, I wouldn't sell at a loss but wait a few days and then buy a LEAPS. This is my plan. Don't follow it, just make sure you have a plan in case it happens, it's important to avoid buying too much the first dip (because you might get a better price later) or worse, avoid a panic-selling and take a loss instead of tendies.\n\n## 1.2 Sector(s) View\n\n[Figure 4: Video game market value worldwide from 2012 to 2023 \\(in billion USD\\)](https://preview.redd.it/zcaacwtnd6961.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e1ff470e54a8f9821f188793f7bbd2bee5d0986)\n\n[Figure 5:  Retail ecommerce sales in the United States from 2017 to 2024 \\(in million USD\\)](https://preview.redd.it/51jh22amd6961.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=10993f493748a17354b3fb4e83dd7781da73c0f7)\n\nVideo game total adressable market and ecommerce total adressable market keep growing, that's all we need to know on a macro-level.

The pandemic could have been an opportunity but GME has still too many physical stores and not enough ecommerce presence yet to take advantage of it.*\n\nFor the next earning release, the question is : how much PS5 and Xbox GameStop was able to get? And how much they sold in bundles (at high margins)?\n\nAlthough it’s still unclear from what I’ve found it’s pretty bullish:\n\n*GameStop Corp. employees across the country were caught by surprise on Saturday when the video-game chain suddenly announced new shipments of the highly coveted PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles* \\- [bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/gamestop-employees-rattled-by-surprise-shipment-of-ps4-xbox](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/gamestop-employees-rattled-by-surprise-shipment-of-ps4-xbox)\n\n[inverse.com/gaming/xbox-series-x-restock-walmart-target-gamestop-january-2021](https://www.inverse.com/gaming/xbox-series-x-restock-walmart-target-gamestop-january-2021)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8lt7bwhd6961.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=e29536613629d3d86bce03bc9e4a89a4e983c337\n\n**Figure 6** : [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=gamestop](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=gamestop)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n42qka5prw961.jpg?width=1030&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e634ddea7ccf954277a70e57ffa4e957badff22b\n\nThe recent **Microsoft deal** is extremely bullish for GameStop and could help the company to reach profitability sooner than expected. Here are the details about how it could impact GameStop’s profitability:\n\n* *In years 3 and 4 combined, if just 5 million customers extend the subscription for two years, GameStop makes $180 million in incremental profit with zero cost involved. That's nearly a quarter of GameStop's current market cap in recurring income at 100% margin*. - Justin Dopierala, “[GameStop Revenue Sharing Agreement With Microsoft Shifts Sentiment](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378623-gamestop-revenue-sharing-agreement-microsoft-shifts-sentiment).” SeekingAlpha.\n\n## 2.2 Business Model and Management\n\n* Gamestop is omnichanneling into **online activities** according to Ryan Cohen recommendations although it doesn’t mean they will execute it perfectly this is bullish.\n   * “*GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences – not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.*” Ryan Cohen.\n\n[Table 2: GameStop is dangerously \\(for the shorts\\) getting close to profitability.](https://preview.redd.it/awmm34afd6961.png?width=562&format=png&auto=webp&s=e22229a87f8b29e59f43822c903a54893b9e3a6a)\n\n* *The company attributes the losses this quarter to the end of the console cycle and the limited hardware and accessory availability that came with that, as well as various game delays, and an 11% reduction in its store base - partially offset by recaptured sales at other locations and online*. → **The company should be profitable very soon** **despite being priced for bankruptcy for a long time → Expectations are incrediblly low until recently, more investors are believing in the vision esp. with Ryan Cohen.**\n* GME **e-commerce sales were up 257% year-over-year**.\n* GME **reduced its selling, general, and administrative expenses by $115 million**.\n* GME **repaid $10 million in debt in Q3 2020**.\n* *GME is* ***diversifying sales to include more high margin items*** *like PC accessories, PC monitors, etc (If I speculate, there may be partnerships with certain brands).*\n* ***Focusing on loyalty programs*** *like power ups and* ***rebranding***.\n* As of Feb. 2020, GameStop had 5,509 physical stores.\n* GME is **closing unprofitable locations**: they are closing 1,000 stores in Q1 2021 (by the end of March of 2021).\n   * I’d like to quote a fellow GME gang member on this: *It's no secret that brick and mortar is falling off, and if GameStop were to fight tooth and nail to remain a largely brick and mortar retailer they would go bankrupt in no time. It is also a fact that underperforming stores drain cash, which lowers net income and thus lowers earnings per share. Any store that is LOSING MONEY or is barely breaking even is keeping the stock price down because it's preventing future growth and killing net incomes. Closing underperforming stores will lead to a higher EPS and more cash that can be allocated to growth.* \\- horny131313.\n* *Gamestop is rebranding, and shifting to becoming the one stop video game and video game related product online retailer. While we haven't seen exactly what this will be, it is bullish to see them pivoting into other products besides just video games. Headsets, TVS, PC parts, you name it. You've seen the omnichannel memes, but we know that If they are bullshitting, Cohen will step in. Expect to see real progress made.*\n\nSome words from the last earnings:\n\n* \"*We anticipate, for the first time in many quarters, that the fourth quarter will include* *positive year-on-year sales growth and profitability*\\*, reflecting the introduction of\\* *new gaming consoles*\\*, our\\* *elevated omni-channel capabilities* *and continued* *benefits from our cost and efficiency initiatives*\\*, even with the potential further negative impacts on our operations due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.\\*\" George Sherman, CEO.\n\nPossible catalysts (from KYJELLYTIME69):\n\n* A possible new Nintendo console release in \\~1-2 years\n* Currently distressed commercial REITs = ability to negotiate lower rent = more $$$\n* Likely return of inflation (debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit) with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0% even when inflation comes back = bullish for all stocks, bears will get slaughtered\n* OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month + possible dem senate = more stimmy checks = more money going into GME\n* If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve, we might see more credit upgrades\n* Better sales = possible dividend reinstatement, I couldn't care less about dividends but guess who's going to be paying? The shorts lol. If Sherman had balls, he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend , which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as we get meme returns from this boomer move.\n\n## 2.3 The Short-Squeeze Thesis\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 6: Stare statistics from Oct. 2019 to Nov. 2020](https://preview.redd.it/juvh5y1bd6961.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=614c135c89f8d0e5a168e20c3e68cfd3005a5c7c)\n\n**In terms of metrics**, the DTC (days-to-cover) actually decreases, lowering the probability to get a short-squeeze short-term. Don’t get me wrong, this DOESN’T mean that it can’t happen, the % of shares shorted is still crazy high.\n\n**Days to cover**: *It gives investors an idea of potential future buying pressure. In the event of a rally in the stock, short sellers must buy back shares on the open market to close out their positions. Understandably, they will seek to purchase the shares back for the lowest price possible, and this urgency to get out of their positions could translate into sharp moves higher. The longer the buyback process takes, as referenced by the 'days to cover' metric, the longer the price rally may continue based solely on the need of short sellers to close their positions. Additionally, a high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze. This information can benefit a trader looking to make a quick profit by buying that company's shares ahead of the anticipated event actually coming to fruition.* (Investopedia).\n\n**In terms of corporate actions**, here is a quote from September mentioning the hostile takeover from Ryan which would trigger a massive short-squeeze, here is the explanation:\n\n***Short Squeeze Potential -*** *If Ryan Cohen successfully negotiates a purchase price with the Board then the shareholders will have to vote on it. Unlike the proxy battle where Hestia and Permit were running a minority slate of directors, an offer to purchase GameStop would force institutions like Vanguard and Blackrock to call in their shares. By doing so, the shorts would be forced to close out their positions and GameStop would finally have the greatest short squeeze of all-time. Ironically, Cohen could use this opportunity to sell all of his shares and use the proceeds to entirely fund the acquisition of GameStop going down as the first person in history to acquire a billion dollar company... for absolutely nothing. In fact, his acquisition price would be less than zero. It will be exciting to see how it all plays out as according to Bloomberg/WSJ there are now 58 million shares short as of 8/31/2020 with only 65 million shares outstanding.*\n\n*If I were short, I'd be sweating bullets right now. This won't end well and will ruin many*.\n\nJustin Dopierala is President and Founder of DOMO Capital.\n\n**How to know when the potential short-squeeze could happen?**\n\n* *Massive volume in short dated calls. \\[...\\] If you have shares, DO NOT SELL COVERED CALLS FROM THEM. by doing this you make the likelihood of a squeeze decrease.* \\- horny131313\n* U*nwind their short position with some behind closed doors deal. A scenario like this could include: Melvin offering shares of other stocks at discounted prices in exchange for GME shares or to unload a portion of their short shares. The second party to this deal could also offer to buy GME shares for higher than market prices* \\- horny131313\n\nIf you want to do a further analysis on short-metrics I put some additional figures - you might find some kind of pattern idk.\n\n[Figure 8: Share statistics of December 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ijbl9ay4d6961.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd9d0e786520d092df26cc80effa0dbe147cde2f)\n\n[Figure 9: Available shares to short vs. fees in &#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/7sp7ni43d6961.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=42ac1cdfbfdc4e0dbe6b3b256893e885e876c74c)\n\n## 2.4 Is GME Manipulated?\n\nMaybe.\n\n[I know there is actually a prob. with the &#37; daily returns \\(it isn't equal to 100&#37; BUT the proportions still hold true on a non 100 point basis\\). The main point is that: negative daily returns were much higher than positive ones.](https://preview.redd.it/xyzx8bl1d6961.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=efcf0647ba66214ff5fbb75f177f65d3cdb053d3)\n\nIf you are familiar with the stock market, you might have noticed that winners do not act like this usually: total return was +21% yet there has been 53.3% red days. If you look at regular stocks which have positive cumulative returns it doesn’t happen that often (outliers aside).\n\nThis is why I suspect that the stock is being manipulated but the weird stats might be explained just because the stock kept being shorted although it was not enough to keep the price down.\n\nAnother opinion on this:\n\n* *Melvin and BoA both have short positions, and are desperately trying to drive the price down. Unfortunately, it is getting harder and harder to convince people that gamestop is a failing business. They are sweating and will continue to sweat. Given the buy side volume, they could close these short positions gradually without triggering a massive squeeze, however it WILL drive the price up significantly higher than it is now.* \\- horny131313.\n\n## 2.5 What 2020 Has Taught Us?\n\nI think at this point it is the wrong question to ask (*is the stock being manipulated?*). To me, the most important thing is what is the upside potential and the risks associated? Then, how to trade GME?\n\n* *If you're new to gamestop, the volatility will seem scary but the shorts fight hard with this one. -10% days followed by +20% days are not unusual.* \\- horny131313\n\nI would like to elaborate on this very idea. For this, check GME statistics for 2020:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t05xum2zc6961.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2e092560bba3b3091a6fe8bf0bceea2ce7b9f5c\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odbxo3sxc6961.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=7897f1dac841aa381b916046c3652e2d2c4ece68\n\n* Whether the stock is manipulated or not, MOST of the 2020 trading days were negative.\n* The worst daily returns were hard to handle honestly we are talking multiple worst than 14% daily drawdowns.\n* You could more than triple your money WITHOUT LEVERAGE.\n* Let’s say you bought late Apr. and sold late Aug. you could have been at -13% returns and +31% the next week if you had diamond hands. For the real diamond hands you had +147% returns the next 2 months.\n\nPsychologically this was a hard trade for sure. But for those who had diamond hands, it was pretty amazing. If you don’t feel comfortable being at -20% or even -30% returns for months before the stock literally BLOWS UP… Reduce your position and diamond hand with a smaller size. Better to win with less than lose with a lot…\n\n**TLTR: DIAMOND-HAND THIS OR DON’T TRADE THIS AT ALL.**\n\n# Risks\n\n## 3.1 Upside Risks\n\n* RC Ventures LLC increases its stake.\n   * It could be VERY soon.

Because when holding the stock you could “feel” like you bled when you watch the stats:\n\n|Positive daily returns|Negative daily returns|\n|:-|:-|\n|49.3 %|50.7 %|\n\nBut IT WAS IN FACT THE SHORT SELLERS WHO BLED HARD:\n\n|Best daily return|Worst daily return|\n|:-|:-|\n|23.0 %|\\-13.7 %|\n\nImagine you sold GME when the -13.7% happened. You would not have captured the 94% returns.

Haven’t heard that companies are legally obligated to stay in businesses before...\n\nReasons why I think this is wrong:\n(1) This DD doesn’t really factor in anything on business fundamentals and competition. Sure stores are getting profitable (says mgmt. mainly due to closing shittier stores) but the four wall margins on these stores are incredibly low as it begins and the cash generation of the business is de minimus. Effectively, the company generates no free cash flow and more recently this has been exacerbated. \n\n(2) This isint really a short term problem for the company. The industry is experiencing a shift and GameStop is not well positioned to compete against other online competitors, Amazon, other commoditized online marketplaces, etc. The business is battling to shift strategies and stay alive. The company has already seen operating margins decrease from 6% (already low) to negative territory and to further make my point gross margins are sub 30%! The company is on a race to restructure, gain expensive financing, buyback stock (pre covid) to keep investors happy, and cut dividends to save cash in the hope of a digital strategy. An old company trying to stay alive in “new times”. Not to mention COVID...\n\n(3) Related to the long-term, even if they are successful in building an online marketplace, consumers won’t be buying games (software, which is  50% of revenues) IMO, from marketplaces or from physical locations. My view is that they will buy and download directly from the console as i) internet speeds increase ii) internet spends become cheaper and iii) or smart TVs link in a “gaming marketplace” where consumers buy/rent games... same goes for PC etc. Think what Netflix did to Blockbuster. Even Blockbuster tried to do a “Blockbuster Online” in August 2004... in September 2010 the company filed for Bankruptcy protection. Why is GameStop different? Why can they make the switch more effectively? Why do people continue to go to Brick and mortar stores vs. Purchase online? How can GameStop’s executive team truly turn around? Why do executives leave this company due to “personal reasons” (previous. CEO/CFO)...my guess is they saw the writing on the wall.\n\n(4) Valuation: so what are you really paying for? 8x 20A EBITDA and +60x 20A PE... -50% FCF yield... in a company that is experiencing extreme structural headwinds and competition. Are you sufficiently compensated for the risk you are taking on in their “digital strategy” execution? I think not, but that is your decision. I guess they have $500M in cash to fund the dream for a bit, but odds are a dilutive equity financing comes or something worse. Your better of IMO buying a met coal producer at 4X EBITDA or an “actual” tech company at 15x sales. What do you really want to pay for a shitty Brick and Mortar business with low margins that has dreams to have a website... when the dust settles you can only cut so many costs and this company will be fighting for life over the next few years (if it survives)\n\nMy bet is the company goes bankrupt before it executes the strategy and/or your money is in limbo for the near term.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Here's the consensus I'm seeing on all the serious DD:\n\nLong term (2+ years): bearish for all your reasons and more.

How come index funds are compared to CDOs if they only track industries or sectors of economy?**\n\nWhat we often miss is that the index fund, instead of being a neutral observer, is an active participant in the fundamentals of the companies that compose a particular index. The fund does so by providing capital and influencing market value of a security (this also opens a window of opportunities for the company behind the ticker to raise capital via bank loans or private investments). What’s so bad about this? Well, passive funds don’t go through balance sheets, there is no fair value assessment, no analysis and no risk taking. They just buy whatever company is big enough to make it into the index. This company can then use provided capital to stay afloat or influence it’s price by share buybacks, dividends or simply pay huge bonuses to it’s management. Just like banks didn’t care about subprime mortgages that were packed into CDOs, index funds managers don’t care about what exactly goes into their ‘soup’. With the banks it was just greed and ignorance – in case of index funds it’s by design.\n\nWhen there is a stable influx of new capital into passive funds, zombie companies are dragged higher and higher. WSB goddess **Cathie Wood** called this the greatest misallocation of funds in the history. But why is so much cash flowing into index funds? Is it a trend? Is someone incentivized to promote them? Well, yes, but the main reason is different: boomer psychology and our friend, the FED. See, boomers have massive capitals. All those pension funds, retiring firefighters, trust babies, capital heirs – they all seek safety. They don’t try to get 500% returns YOY or lose it all. They are very content with just beating inflation. Throw few percents above inflation and they will be over the moon. For a long time their favorite asset class were treasuries.\n\n**2. What is happening to the bond market?**\n\nIn 2016 US bond market was almost $40 trillion in value, compared to less than $20 trillion for the domestic stock market.  Now, I haven’t seen yet the data about the size of US bond market of 2020, but everything points that it’s ratio to stock market is deteriorating. The US 10-year government-bond yield fell from nearly 2.00% at the beginning of the year to an all-time low of just 0.31% in early March. That’s what Rick Rule called ‘return free risk’, since allocating capital into these treasuries almost guarantees you to lose money to inflation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q6r2fhqfu6961.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=b72fad038a47ee1a0adca587881f46bafc25cc89\n\nLook at what is happening in Europe: “The ECB, which added 500 billion euros ($606 billion) to its pandemic bond buying program, is set to own around 43% of Germany’s sovereign bond market by the end of next year and around two-fifths of Italian notes, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. That’s up from around 30% and 25% respectively at the end of 2019... Trading volumes in bund futures have collapsed 62% since the ECB started buying bonds, according to Axa, while ranges the lifeblood of traders have nosedived across Europe. In both the safest and riskiest nations, this quarter’s spread between the highest and lowest yields is the tightest it’s been since at least the global financial crisis.”\n\nThe FED is doing quite the same. Buying bonds (including corporate) all over the place and lowering interest rates to the ground. What’s even more devastating for boomers is that there’s no hope on the horizon: the FED promises to keep interest rates low for the next few years. We are really heading towards Japan situation where the central bank is that fat ugly bully kid playing all by himself in the sandbox.\n\n**3. Where to go if the bonds are not so hot?**\n\nThis all causes big money to chase the next best thing. What do people consider safe? Real Estate. And indeed it rose: according to Knight Frank Global House price index US housing prices rose 7% from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020. But that’s a lot of hustle for big money. And that is hardly a passive income, rather a career. So the next best thing is index funds. What can be better than tracking the whole US economy? Never bet against America, am I right? Even if we stumble upon a market crash sending S&P down – the economy will recover, it always does, right? The influx of cash into ETFs is basically a self fulfilling prophecy: it drives prices up and those yearly returns get even more lucrative compared to *sexy* 0.31% provided by treasuries.\n\n[The data shows that 2019-2020 saw again a spike in passive management allocation, but I couldn't find more up to date graph ](https://preview.redd.it/db73yu15u6961.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d03efe94938505122915c672d823855b779f6ef)\n\nEven worse is that actively managed funds and bank investments start to, basically, replicate index funds. That is due to the risk/reward factor: if the funds outperform the market - they get some good rep and few new customers; but when they underperform the market – they get absolutely obliterated. Only few outsiders can risk picking deep value stocks or plays, that are not common portfolio dwellers. Or it takes someone with huge authority like Warren Buffett or Howard Marks.\n\n**4. Bubbles everywhere**\n\nNow, at this point you might be on the edge of your seat, banging your fist and thinking that this is nothing but a bubble and the boomers, index funds and the FED are to blame. Well, it is. Hard truth is that fundamentals in the long run always kick-in. So-called Buffett indicator (total stocks market cap to GDP) is almost at a record high. And on top of that we have Dot.com bubble 2.0 with crazy tech enthusiasm. And a second real estate bubble too. But I urge you to notice, that bubbles are not all the same with the same outcome. Well, they all go burst, but that’s not the point. There are bubbles that I would call ‘General Market Heat’ - situations when too much money goes into the market, causing it to overheat. Then some sort of event, panic, fear, or rumor, not necessary caused by declining fundamentals, sends the market to downward spiral. As an example: panic of 1857, 1929, 1987, etc. The better the fundamentals were and the least the government gets involved – the faster it rebounds. Those bubbles do nothing but attract more speculators and their only result is the number of bankruptcies. Then there are bubbles that I would call ‘Thematic Bubbles’ - those are dedicated to some specific industry or a number of particular stocks that are expected to grow enormously. Tulip Mania in Netherlands (1637), Railway Mania in UK (1840s), Video Games Crash of 1983, Dot Com Bubble (2000). They all chased some particular novelty and all landed on their faces. But doing so they provided huge capital to developing industries. Dot Com Bubble gave us rapid growth of internet usage. Video Games chase of the late 70s and early 80s gave us the golden age of arcade gaming and huge inventions in graphics and game tech. Railway Mania left Britain with the largest system of railroads in the world. And guess who is the biggest exporter of tulips and holds 49 % of the global flower market? Yep, Netherlands, to this day, almost 400 years since the mania!\n\nThis did not in any way benefit the majority of investors who went down with the bubble. But you can view this as a sacrifice of dumb and greedy people for the benefit of the progress. I get a sense of pride in this noble cause, as a member of WSB community.\n\nBack to boomers and index funds. By pouring money into index funds they provide capital both to disruptive industries and to zombie companies. The good thing is that the tech gets the majority of it, since it has the biggest share. Just look at the SPY top 6 holdings:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ien160wku6961.png?width=361&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4fb8528478110ff0f2d5f9e1a793d7b5e5a9085\n\nIt’s genuinely good that companies like Tesla will get allocation of billions and billions which they (frankly) do not quite deserve at current fundamentals. This will accelerate their growth. The bad thing is that such allocations cement big tech monopolies, damaging competition. And it also provides liquidity to zombie companies big enough to make it into indexes.\n\nDifference is that innovative companies use this cash to reinvest into future growth. That’s exactly why their P/E ratios are so bad. Zombies spend cash on buybacks and management bonuses. Because of how all these companies are tied together in index funds and due to the nature of modern margin calls – once any segment of the stock market falls, there will be a massive dip. Tech can drown any industry stocks with them and vice versa. But the Tech will be able to cut investments, R&D and expansions and become profitable, while zombies with a big debt will go bankrupt. Either way it’s investors, who will bear the pain.\n\n**5. What shall we draw from here:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. There are huge inflows into the stock market. And the blame is not so much on the kids with RH as it is on the boomers and ‘smart money’ chasing index funds;\n2. If you want to short any of the bubbles as a hedge – do not short the most growing and volatile sectors and ETFs like QQQ, because they benefit from the current market in a long run. And also the premiums are huge due to IV. Rather short slow and steady industries, because they will get nuked just as much in case of a crash, but the premiums you pay now will be much lower;\n3. Passive index funds investing makes ‘price discovery’ and a search for deep value so much more challenging. But not impossible. Basically, Peter Lynch’s advise to look for companies with smaller institutional ownership still lives up today. Does this mean that prices can’t be good or go up under big index allocation? Hell no. But the chance to find a ten-bagger declines.As an anecdote: look into our champion’s GME institutional ownership: on Jan 31 2020 it was 96.6 % and declined to relatively low 66.7 by Sep 30. Exactly before it doubled in the next 3 months;\n4. Some bubbles provide needed capital to developing and hyped industries causing structural change. Unfortunately, it is paid by investors who rarely see any return;\n5. FED is to blame for everything (as always);\n6. WSBers will lose money either way (as always).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n**The bond market is similar to boomers wives: sexy in the 80s, not so much today. Constant intrusions by their relatives (the FED) into their relationships makes things even worse. That sends boomers chasing young girls - the stocks. But their dongles aren’t so active anymore, so boomers prefer passive approach, using a dating app - index funds. Unfortunately, there are only so many hot girls among young ladies on the app. This leads to ugly ones receiving attention and money from boomers, which they otherwise wouldn’t deserve. Some of those ladies spend money wisely and will be good to go once the boomer dies out. Others immediately waste it on shopping. Now, if a young man wants to find a truly beautiful lady with reasonable expectations – he has a better chance searching outside of the boomer dating app.**\n\nObligatory pictograph of a rocket for those of us who are not yet fully developed for an alphabet\n\n🚀  🚀  🚀", "id": "kpu9z2", "created_utc": 1609711738.0, "score": 1249, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 241, "comments": [{"body": "That analogy is fantastic.", "score": 335, "replies": [{"body": "Truly the best ELIAR I've seen in a while.", "score": 103, "replies": [{"body": "Like?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "A retard", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "A was meant to be autistic", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Explain Like I Autistic Retard\n\nYep, sounds about right.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Because it's \"Explain like I 5\", right?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I know lol :) just had to poke some fun.\n\nMay your calls be in the green and your stonks go up asymptotically.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Lol", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "So PLTR is a sexy wife...", "score": 111, "replies": [{"body": "I've heard this lemon guy talking shit about our lady.
