Here‚Äôs something to consider.\n\n[WSB will not allow me to post since I‚Äôm less than 45days old on their sub. If you think this makes sense, please feel free to repost]\n\nI love you all and this group. And I still hold a large proportion of my GME and AMC positions. That said, I do want to call out that the short squeeze we were all expecting may now not materialize. Here‚Äôs why:\n\nThere were 50M trades today. Retail investors couldn‚Äôt buy much due to restrictions. So very likely that majority of the buys were done by short sellers covering their position. Total short was around 60M as of Jan 15. Assuming they accounted for 80% of the buys today, that‚Äôs 40M positions closed. Only 20M shorts likely left, if that. High enough - but not enough for the kind of squeeze projected. Daily trading volumes are 100M - 200M and these shorts can easily cover their positions without moving the price much in these volumes.\n\nDoes that mean the price won‚Äôt go up? No - the price can still move if enough people buy. But at that point, it‚Äôll be no different than a pump and dump - we will just be taking money from a fellow retard who‚Äôll be left holding the bag. Not from the hedge funds who‚Äôve likely already exited their positions.\n\nThis is all theory. I hope I‚Äôm proven wrong and the hedge funds were fools to short even more. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd want to play with fire again after getting burnt though.\n\nWelcome your thoughts. But please don‚Äôt pile on without rationally thinking through this. A lot of people‚Äôs money is at stake here.\n\nPS: I intend to hold the GME and AMC positions I have right through the end of this (wherever we end up). For me, this was as much or more about the cause as the money. And so, I‚Äôm prepared to lose the money as well if it so happens.\n\nPS2: Please get the hell out of Robinhood.

Not wanting to disparage your intentions, but personally I'll take harsh truths over kind falsehoods any day.

Have you seen what a government budget looks like?\n\n[I'm mentally changing this to the **Canadian** Government, as I have no intention of speaking for any other.]\n\nI'm torn on whether the government can spend money better than I can. There's something to be said for the ability to negotiate on larger issues, to have significantly improved efficiency from moving at scale. But at the same time, as a member of the Canadian military for nearly a decade I can confirm that efficiency is not the rule in governmental organizations.\n\nI understand that there can be (and are) *significant* wasted resources, that there are many projects which I am not in favour of, and many that I like that are underfunded. I don't intend to be defending government budgeting by asking for increased taxes.\n\nSo I would trend towards no, they can't, while also acknowledging that the capacity for large-scale organizing is also something not to be underestimated. If it weren't for the existence of large, highly effective charitable causes, my answer would be much closer to yes.\n\n> Why would you not want lower taxes and then distribute the money in the way you see fit? [...] Why don‚Äôt you just make a donation to the government every year along with your taxes?\n\nNow *this* is a hard statement to address. Because while it seems reasonable on a surface level, there's a heck of a lot of subtext to unpack. I'm going to start at the larger scale.\n\nFirstly, the government issue: your statement is reasonable when applied to a single individual, but makes no sense collectively. You are essentially advocating for individuals to choose exactly where their taxes go, and to spurn \"organized\" government entirely. There will not be sufficient donations to road and infrastructure projects, or sewage and sanitation, or other such non-flashy projects to guarantee long-term functionality. Of this, I have no doubt. \n\nSecondly, the personal intent issue: you are assuming that a sufficient number of people will take those now-free tax-dollars and spend them on things to benefit the collective. I would instead argue a significant number would choose to spend their wealth on personal luxuries and ignore societal problems until well too late. So clearly \"government donation\" is also not a valid strategy, as it would have a negligible impact unlike raising taxes on the entirety of a people of a given wealth.\n\nBut the most important issue, in my mind, is that by denying the beneficial nature of taxes you are implying an illegitimacy of governance.\n\n> Wanting to be taxed higher is one of the stupidest fucking things I‚Äôve ever heard of.\n\nWhile there is some wiggle room in interpreting this as \"the current rate of taxation is right, but higher would be worse\" or \"there exists an ideal level of taxation that is ideal, but it's lower than this\", I can't honestly say that's what your words bring to mind. The closest reasonable interpretation that comes to mind is \"people know where money should go better than Government does\".\n\nIf you don't believe a government is able to spend taxes effectively, and are openly stating that to be true, you are in effect advocating for governmental change. In this case, I'm expecting it to be a better correlation between the \"will of the people\" and governmental spending. \n\nBut that doesn't actually match what you've said, does it? Because what you've argued is that *any* individual would know better where to send their money. There is no \"just this one person\" tax break. Any person could mean Elon Musk, or some asshole *rolling coal down a highway to own the environmentalists*. \n\nAnd so now comes the bitter truth: I don't believe that everyone knows the most effective places to spend their money. I believe that just as much of it would be wasted away on things of no benefit. And while they are *deeply* flawed, I believe that governmental actions are better on average than individual actions. Because for every Elon Musk, trying to use his wealth and personal industry to save the world, I think there's a lot more like Jeffrey Epstein who will use wealth greedily, for personal gain, and utterly fail to consider the needs of the people around them. \n\nAnd so I would rather approach this issue democratically: all are required to contribute, all have an equal say in what matters are of importance, and those who choose where the money goes serve at the mercy of the electorate. That's taxes, in a democracy. I think that this is the best method, on average, and I want to support it.\n\nBut the most important reason why I am pro-taxes is that it removes the most significant issue of your \"personal choice\" proposal: under your system, **people with more dollars get more votes**. And that isn't something I'm willing to abide. Again, Epstein.\n\nI can afford to pay more taxes; in my tax bracket, I believe that I am normal in that sense. So I would rather see my tax rate raised, and in doing so theirs, because I simply trust the government better than I trust the average person. \n\nTl:dr; My preference is to know rather than be left unaware. My apologies if I was pushy. I don't believe that the government will spend money more efficiently than me. I *do* believe that the government will spend the money better, and with more accountability, than the average person. I don't believe that having accumulated large amounts of wealth should allow people outsized influence in societal matters. I know I can afford to pay more taxes, and I am pretty darn sure that others in my tax bracket can too.\n\n-----\n\nSome final notes: I'm still interested to hear your thoughts, as I'm sure you don't immediately agree with everything I've just written. I'll be curious to see where and how you differ. \n\nIn addition, the primary reason I *don't* spend my money as charitable donations, or give it to the government, is because of the opportunity that Tesla embodies. Any funds I invest now will almost certainly have an outsized impact then, and I'm trusting my future self to spend those future funds in a moral way.\n\nBut moreover, I don't believe that differences of opinion on this matter should impact whether a person is qualified to moderate this subreddit. Moderation is inherently an undemocratic tool: I was not voted for, I am only loosely accountable to the subreddit, and often my actions will go unseen. Despite that, I have tried many times in the past to take the beliefs of subreddit members into account and ask for their feedback, as I've done here. And despite your probable preference, I have no intention of leaving. Because despite some of the arguments I've made above, I do have faith in my own judgment. And so long as this company, this stock, and this subreddit remain of interest to me, I'll be here.\n\nAlso, paging /u/space_s3x, /u/__TSLA__, and /u/TheWizzDK1. As I stated before, I don't want moderation action taken here; I'm more curious to see if any of you have thoughts on this topic. And while I don't think my flair is important enough to matter, given this is the first time in over a year someone has remarked on it, I will change it in this sub if you think it would help avoid issues.\n\nCheers!  \n~Corinth", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Upvoting this not just because I agree with it, but for the effort that was put into it.

He had to pay out of pocket, $1k a month. We're talking years of prep to realign teeth and everything. His surgery was due after Trump became president. When Trump became president he made it legal to not have insurance, which caused insurance companies to bail on ENTIRE STATES. My friend's operation became a \"either you don't get this or pay $80,000 out of pocket.\" what's worse is another insurance company came in to the state to offer coverage. They made him commit to a year of insurance, $1,000 USD per month, for a YEAR. Out of desperation he signed up. He got refused coverage for the procedure, too. So for that year he can't get the procedure and is stuck paying that. After a year the other insurance company came back and he had to start the whole thing from scratch, sorta. A year after that he did get the procedure, tho. But Jesus fuck was this horrible. And a lot of other Americans were similarly affected.\n\nDuring this ordeal I looked up alternatives and found medical tourism to Canada, Europe and India.

If macro continues to be a disaster and we head into a true correction then thats one thing, but otherwise I think we hit 900 well before May.\n\nReasons:\n\n\\- Model S/X Refresh: In a lot of ways these are entirely new vehicles except for the exterior design and so far we know very little about the features. Apparently there is enough new things to discuss that Elon wants to hold a dedicated session in the next couple of weeks to talk about those features. Things I'm very curious about: The main screen can be angled, how does that work? There seems to be some sort of gaming platform included, is that going to be an entirely new revenue stream? When they say it can match the performance of a PS5, what exactly do they mean? Whats the plan for the rear screen? How does the touch gear shift controls work? So lots there... from an investor perspective I'm most curious about the Tesla arcade, or whatever. Is this Tesla's app store moment? that could be HUGE. And speculation is that software V11 will be released alongside the new S/X which will surely generate some buzz.\n\n\\- FSD: We know wider release is coming, probably to the EAP group. I'm doubtful we see release to the public in the next few months but getting out to EAP will be a big step and as they continue to improve the software there's the chance the market starts to share elon's confidence about a full release this year which will be a watershed moment in tesla's history and in human history. Truly autonomous vehicles everywhere and anywhere would be earth shattering. (I understand it will still make mistakes here and there for probably the first few years, but still, if they release a slightly more polished version of today's FSD beta to the general public its something *everyone* will be talking about and of course unlocks huge revenue potential, even just considering recognizing all FSD revenue accrued to date.)\n\n\\- Federal Policy: We've heard the broad strokes of the Biden admins EV plan but we should be getting firm details in the next few months. If Tesla becomes eligible for a new round of tax rebates that will generate huge demand, even if only the M3 is eligible. A push by the federal government to put charging stations everywhere should help too, just make the public more comfortable with the tech.\n\n\\- Q1 production numbers: We know in the earnings call they undersold expectations for this year, once we get the Q1 numbers that will become evident. We can take those numbers and extrapolate out for the full year and people will see very clearly \"yeah, they're gonna blow their projections out of the water\". Obviously it wont be conclusive after Q1 numbers come out, but I think it will be enough evidence for the street to understand they'll easily beat projections.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Totally.

The stock fell 0.6% in premarket trading Friday, after losing 5.4% over the past two days. Selesky reiterated his buy rating and raised his price target to $1,010 from $777. That would make him the second-most bullish on Tesla, of the 37 analysts surveyed by FactSet, behind only Oppenheimer's Colin Rusch, who has a $1,036 price target. Selesky said he expects EVs to account for an increasingly larger portion of auto sales, as lower costs for battery packs makes them more affordable to the average car buyer, and Tesla is the \"undisputed leader\" in the EV space. \"We also believe that Tesla is well positioned to expand in the Chinese market and further believe that the incoming Biden Administration will offer rebates and new tax incentives to encourage consumers to buy EVs, which we think favors Tesla versus all the rest,\" Selesky wrote in a note to clients.

That said, here is some insight into Musk...\n\nWhen he feels like he's been wronged by someone, be it a competitor or the government, Musk will fight back with everything he's got. In this case, it seems pretty clear that Musk feels the FAA is wrongly withholding approval for SN9.\n\nHe has sued the government on multiple times. He has lashed out at government officials. Musk feels justified in these actions (and indeed, sometimes he is) because the system is set up to prevent the kinds of disruptions he is bringing about.\n\nBottom line: hopefully cooler heads prevail and this gets resolved.

One in particular stood out to me -- SKT, Tanger Outlets.\n\n[The average volume over the past 3 months is 3.55m](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SKT/key-statistics?p=SKT), and has been slowly building -- the avg volume over the past 10 days is 10.82m, so some scouting and positioning has clearly already been done.  \n\nThe float for this stock is only 89.64m shares.  That's way less than other recent meme stocks like NOK (5.6 **billion**), BB (508 million), and comparable to AMC (102m).  \n\nGiven that AMC has a similar float, I then checked out the short % of the float -- for SKT it's **75.26%**.  AMC is 38.12%.\n\nFurthering the case for SKT, [the open interest in puts has been dropping drastically](https://twitter.com/TeresaTrades/status/1354865732748599296/photo/1).  4th largest OI put decrease.\n\nSKT recently reinstated their dividend, and being a dividend/real estate stock, this seems to be one that is safer to hold, and that current holders are less likely to try to exit on a pop.  I live right near one of their outlets, and you wouldn't think we were in a pandemic with all the traffic it has.  Even if malls begin to shutter their stores, outlet stores generally stay open as the stores relocate their inventory to the outlets for clearance, figuring bargain hunters will go scoop them up.\n\nAt the start of this year, a new CEO was installed - Stephen Yalof, who previously headed up Simon Property Group (SPG).  He was CEO of SPG starting July 2014, when SPG stock was at 168.19, and hit a high of 227 a few years later.  He ended up departing SPG in April 2020, obviously after the pandemic/crash.\n\nMelvin Capital, as of 9/2020, [was short 1 million shares of SKT](https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1354162604311261189/photo/1).\n\nThis seems like an extremely attractive target for a short squeeze to me and I ended up buying shares and leaps last week, and intend on holding for a while.  The charts the past couple days have been following other meme stocks, but not as drastic -- up 10%, down 8%, etc.  Twice today the stock bounced off the 14.50-15.00 range, and it seems like the [AH orders showed that as well](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_279693951.png)\n\nThere's certainly some resistance at $20, but given the low volume and high % of float, OI put interest dropping sharply, I think it's a matter of time before this one hits the radar of more traders looking for the next thing.  Good risk/reward play.\n\nEDIT:  [March update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7g8a0/the_bullish_case_for_tanger_outlets_skt/gplpbew/)", "id": "l7g8a0", "created_utc": 1611886390.0, "score": 656, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 246, "comments": [{"body": "I love how r/investing nuked this post there, and yet there's upvotes and solid discussion here.\n\n[Also the stock ticker has high meme potential](https://youtu.be/bKTqHsMqkb0)", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "[I‚Äôm a SKT man](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JY0U1uq6BIQ)", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "If the $SKTman an do it, brother, so can you\n\n\"Why should we be pleasin' all the politician heathens   \nWho would try to change the seasons if they could? \nThe state of the condition insults my intuition  \nAnd it only makes me crazy and a heart like wood. \n\nEverybody stutters one way or the other \nSo check out my message to you. \nAs a matter of fact, don't let nothin' hold you back  \nIf the $SKTman an do it, brother, so can you.  \nI'm the $SKTman \n\nBa-da-ba-da-ba-be bop bop bodda bope  \nBop ba bodda bope  \nBe bop ba bodda bope  \nBop ba bodda  \nBa-da-ba-da-ba-be bop ba bodda bope  \nBop ba bodda bope  \nBe bop ba bodda bope  \nBop ba bodda bope\"", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Your post made me think of:\n\n \n\n# Nietzsche: To Do IS TO BE, \n\n# Kant TO BE IS TO DO, \n\n# Sinatra DO BE DO BE DO\n\nLike SKT.

Foot traffic during this summer was also near [pre-pandemic levels](https://www.globest.com/2020/08/25/outlet-centers-are-seeing-higher-foot-traffic-than-malls/?slreturn=20210030105638).\n\nThe transition to more confidence in safety is happening at the same time nicer weather is going to occur, too. \n\nI am having trouble as a new-ish investor understanding the BVPS of an REIT, considering how leases of stores and real estate value are calculated in [their balance sheets](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/viewer?action=view&cik=1004036&accession_number=0000899715-20-000153&xbrl_type=v#).

So although I wouldn‚Äôt use the word cure outright, excluding re-dosing tech coming down the pipeline this is a functional cure for X years in a patient population that not only experiences life threatening frank bleeds, but other debilitating symptoms secondary to small bleeds and clots (arthralgias, limited quality of life), and ultra-high cost factor infusions (up to $ 100,000k per year) for some.)\n\n* **And as far as safety/efficacy is concerned,** SGMO had one bleed 52 weeks out and Biomarin (BMRN) had so many bleeds and low/unresponsive factor levels and intra-patient variability that the FDA requested a more data when they tried to file for accelerated review and got rejected.\n* **And in case you don‚Äôt believe BMRN think's you're stupid and is doing everything they can to try and get their inferior product to market before SGMO,** [check out this graph of factor levels where coloration does not correspond to zero on the y-axis to make its data look better](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/twitter.com/maxpowerngs/status/1348521834749169666?s=21__;!!Cjnu1T6GFXg!8xRKAHZ2s_AeGmrM05Eannm-jgMJedChjUH8nRCTTw16jCWU93xUaWA7foP_XePvMSQTtpXK8A$). I even think BMRN seems like a good candidate for some LEAP puts...\n* **BMRN market cap is 15 Billion with 5 programs, one of which sucks. SGMO is** ***2 billion with 17 programs***\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n* **SHORT INTEREST**\\- Normally I wouldn‚Äôt post this given the difficulty of finding up-to-date, accurate short info, but given recent events I think it‚Äôs of interest. SGMO has had a longstanding short float, [about 17 millions shares](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/twitter.com/_b_i_o_t_e_c_h_/status/1354336139994345472?s=21__;!!Cjnu1T6GFXg!73JP2BJmbnZDnIT1jAW2WQwMUQgI8dhQHmLrN-6ps4n11L_HV7kG9T-4cWpTMQWqifTy3h9uOQ$) right now, about 11 days to cover. Also, every major pop this stock has had due to good new or collaborations was methodically whittled away to the pre-event price (which is why I said **BE VERY CAREFUL SURROUNDING MARCH 9th**). So although it can be tricky to trade, there‚Äôs a metric shit ton of stuff not priced in.\n* **And if you want to see real stock price manipulation in action**, check out the share price on the following dates that correspond to the article header pic:\n\n\n* **12/7-12/10:** Best-in-class hemophilia A results for SB-525 reported 12/7, premarket and SGMO opens $9.93 and closes at a loss for $9.05. Positive beta thalassemia results reported 12/9, premarket. Notice the run up doesn‚Äôt happen until 12/10, ***A FULL 3 DAYS AFTER INITIAL HEME A TRIAL NEWS***. Sounds like enough time to cover. Stock immediately pulls back after run-up 12/10.\n* **12/18-12/23:** stock runs from low of $13.50 to high of $18.24 on announcement of Pfizer taking over heme A trial in phase 3 following stellar Phase 1/2 results. Notice the run up starts 12/18, ***5 DAYS BEFORE NEWS RELEASE ON 12/23***.\n* For record I posted my first DD on Sunday Dec 20th, with shares at $14.36 from the previous Friday, in full fucking disbelief that share price hadn‚Äôt gone up from Heme A results and Pfizer takeover of the trial. Next few days it rocketed to $18.64 before the shorts decided it was time to tap it down again. **Since then, red days on low volume. Just taaaaaaap it down, shorts. Give it a little tappy. Tap tap taparoo.**\n* YOLO Screenshot attached, and that's one of 3 accounts (need to roll out those May calls). SGMO is still the majority of my tradeable retirement.\n\n**TL;DR- SGMO undervalued with proven gene editing tech headed to market. Buying shares or LEAP Jan 22' and Jan 23' calls seems cool, but I'm not going to tell you how to live your life. Selling some covered calls each month to buy more OTM LEAPs makes the time pass quicker.**\n\n[YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/6ngp46n1i6e61.jpg?width=1184&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=f7c6f88f32c8daaad55a492863cf2977ea62dfcf)\n\nEdit 1: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\nEdit 2: ~~I forgot I rushed this out because notorious dickhead JPM analyst Eric Joseph just upgraded PT to $35 after years of misrepresentation and shoddy research undervaluing SGMO, so I think he knows an upward move is coming.~~ I was informed this was not the case- I got this info from a repost of an older-dated post from 2018 for IV.

I incorrectly put ‚Äúbelow $10‚Äù. I‚Äôve been holding for 2 years and adding on all the new data, but the first post was above $10.\n\nEdit 4: I follow SGMO on Investor Village for most of the information to keep me up to date. You should too, but I‚Äôll keep distilling it all down for wallstreetbets until stock hits $100. To all my Investor Village buddies, I‚Äôve loved lurking the site, and if I pay off my student loans I‚Äôll buy a membership and say hello. Until then- spaddy, MaxNGS, gomansa, retirement, bct1192, bioimmuno, gg100, NewJeans, 2Fingers, shammy, ackje, Templedog21, compostman, SFV- you guys rock and have kept me informed and üíé  üôåüèæ. **Marty Chillberg- we miss you.** Civic and Rhyno- Every village needs an idiot but we have 2 at this point (I kid, and I value the contrarian POV)- I love you guys but calm the fuck down. I‚Äôll pay for a membership and say hello when we hit $25. Maybe earlier if I‚Äôm feeling rich on some particular day.\n\nEdit 5: Whatever SGMO is paying their PR/IR guy, it‚Äôs probably too much because I feel like I‚Äôm doing a better job for free.\n\nEdit 6: if anyone knows the people picking the new Chamath Reddit team-if you guys need a PharmD BCOP doing fucking stellar, conflict-free DD who‚Äôs willing to actually be transparent and show his portfolio (I think that should be in the model).

{"title": "High GME valuation explination, the price is justified.", "selftext": "We are not a short targeting group, WE LIKE THE STOCK! I am tired of hearing this on the media, and even AOC's twitch stream is parroting this. Melvin is just in the wrong place at the wrong time. DD below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME is a gaming company that got a CEO and board members who are experts in e-commerce and know how to succeed in an industry dominated by Amazon.  This same CEO and these same board members created Chewy, which is a successful and growing $42B market cap company, and it is not unreasonable to expect this same group could provide similar returns for GME too. GME's current market cap is only $13B, even at it's current closing price price. This means there is a long way to go - about 4X more to be specific.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoreover, ARK invest thinks gaming and specifically VR will grow massively in the next five years. ARK details this explicitly in their 2021 research report, which you can read here, it starts on page 21.\n\n[https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1\\_Download\\_Files\\_ARK-Invest/White\\_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest\\_BigIdeas\\_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ARK%E2%80%93Invest_BigIdeas_2021.pdf?hsCtaTracking=4e1a031b-7ed7-4fb2-929c-072267eda5fc%7Cee55057a-bc7b-441e-8b96-452ec1efe34c)\n\n>‚Ä¢A virtual world is defined as a computer-simulated environment that can be accessed by anyone at any time. Society interacts daily with virtual worlds which today are in their infancy.  \n>  \n>‚Ä¢According to our research, revenue from virtual worlds will compound 17% annually from roughly $180billion today to $390billion by 2025.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt therefore makes perfect sense to assume GME, now with a new CEO who is an expert in e-commerce will position GME to take advantage of a potentially $390B industry. Therefore it is not unreasonable to assume GME may be worth more than Chewy in the near future given this potential market growth. Finally, modern gaming requires a tremendous amount of computational power, meaning we should expect GME to sell this expensive and high margin hardware as well as accessories along with their gaming consoles and games.\n\nLets put this all together, if GME grows to the size of Chewy, and becomes a $42 billion dollar company, their share price should be about $623. And depending on how they position themselves to take advanatge of the VR market, they could potentially see far more upside in the near future.\n\nGME is well positioned to do so because they own brick and mortar stores around the country that will act as distribution centers, meaning they already have an upper hand on their competitors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWE LIKE THIS STOCK.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImportant updates and information I missed:\n\nFrom u/[MrLancaster](https://www.reddit.com/user/MrLancaster)\n\nBro you forgot about the cut they get from Microsoft's¬Æ GamePass¬©  subscription service.

Friday is the night (or day). Tomorrow we head for our mission to finally get the money we deesrve. Unlike most of you (wether fortunately or unfortunately) I've been bagholding GME since 10. I saw myself through multiple ups and downs. I have gone through around 4(four) low, low, low -30% swings (the fourth being today's). If tomorrow goes well, the shorts will have such a ridiculous demand coming from the suspension of GME in brokerages, demands of the r/wallstreetbets brotheren, and Elon Musk, Chamath, and A-O-FUCKING C will skyrocket our diamond hands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast time there was a \"dOnT gIve mE awArds\" post it got $18,000 worth of reddit awards. If you woudl have spent that on long dated, april calls (aka when GME was around 17) you would have broken 6 figures and would probably be in Millionaire status. **GME is our stimulus.** Those fat ass republican (& Democrat) motherfuckers didn't want us to give $1200 checks so we're taking $10,000 instead.\n\n[üöÄüöÄüöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/didzepevr6e61.jpg?width=1214&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f349bd1c568c33b4d8ccbcac49e829d36dc5baf7)\n\nThe institutions have always made fun of us, they thought we were just a trend in the stock market that would come and go. THEY thought they could get away with breaking families in 2008 while earning just enough money to get another Yacht, this time gold-plated. NOW this is a movement. While unfortunately this wouldn't make these zillionaires broke, these motherfuckers are going to take us seriously. This wont be a cat and mouse game anymore, this will be an elephant seal vs elephant seal $GME now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur lord DFV was just a regular value investor before he started to dive deep in GME.

If GME goes to $1000 (Which could be a possibility) this motherfucker will be 9 figures and I would never be more happy. He got me into GME first, shortly after Ryan and his goon squad arrived.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo tomorrow, open your parachutes. Be ready for shorts trying to attack, and high volatility if that's the case. If the squeeze does not happen by tomorrow, worry not my fellow GME bretheren.

{"title": "Update from the Scientist who posted original NVAX DD: NVAX reports best efficacy to date against original COVID variant (95.6%) and remains massively undervalued üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ", "selftext": "For those who followed my NVAX posts over the last few months and stayed with the trade, congratulations. For those looking for a new trade, I will outline why NVAX is de-risked and remains enormously undervalued, even with the 26% pop since data was released today. **I will also explain the significance of the results and why the reduced efficacy against the SA variant is bad news for the world, but actually presents a huge opportunity for NVAX and moreso than any of the other vaccine makers**. For those who didn‚Äôt read my previous posts, I worked in vaccine R&D for several years and am currently a biomedical PhD candidate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Tldr: Despite the confusing headlines, today‚Äôs data confirm that NVAX has a highly effective vaccine on par with PFE/MRNA and will allow them to lock in the billions of dollars of existing supply deals. NVAX is uniquely positioned to benefit in the booster market because it‚Äôs the only vaccine that can be easily multiplexed and repetitively dosed and can be stored in standard refrigeration. There is still time to get in before the market digests this information and realizes that NVAX is tremendously undervalued with a market cap of $10.7B and is on the cusp of several billions of annual COVID vaccine revenue.***\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Headlines may have undersold the results, but make no mistake - NVAX has highest efficacy reported to date\n\nUnlike trial results we‚Äôve seen from Pfizer/Moderna, which were conducted in the US during summer/fall against the original COVID variants, Novavax‚Äôs two trials were conducted in the presence of the troubling UK and SA COVID variants. For those unaware, these variants have several mutations on the spike protein which have subtle, but important differences from the spike protein in the vaccines.\n\nWe already knew that the ability of antibodies from people vaccinated with PFE/MRNA were less effective against the new variants, so differences in efficacy between variants were expected (2-fold less effective against UK variant, and 6-fold less effective against the SA variant).  As a result, the only way to compare results between MRNA/PFE/NVAX is to subset the data by each variant, otherwise it‚Äôs not an apples to apples comparison. When we subset the data, here are the results:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b2u6g4lwb7e61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b107fc15468cbc899f85fbccc7be6d7200a8ec18\n\n**Against the original COVID variant which PFE/MRNA was tested against, NVAX has the highest** [reported](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3) **efficacy.** Yes, it‚Äôs a slight margin and yes this is a smaller subset of patients than for PFE/MRNA, but the data is the data and it matches what we expected based on pre-clinical and phase 1 immunogenicity data. The fact that NVAX had higher efficacy than PFE/MRNA against the same strain seems to be missed based on most of the headlines I've seen tonight which report the 90% number. Also note that NVAX had the highest proportion of participants >65yrs old, with 27%, compared with PFE and MRNA, which had 21% and 24.8%, respectively.\n\nNot surprisingly, efficacy against the SA variant in non-HIV+ patients is significantly lower at 60%, but the vaccine will still be useful against that variant. Once again, the overall number including HIV+ patients is what seems to be getting reported which is not a reflection of the efficacy that we would expect in the general public. Note that the original benchmark from OWS was for a vaccine that was at least 50% effective so a vaccine with 60% efficacy isn't useless. The big question is the efficacy levels that the other vaccines will report against the SA variant. We‚Äôll know soon enough, but as I explain later in the document, I suspect that other vaccines will have a more significant drop off in efficacy against the SA variant than NVAX.\n\n# NVAX stands to benefit most from boosters and updated vaccine formulations to cover new variants\n\nThe results against the UK and especially the SA variant have huge implications for vaccine makers and how countries around the world are going to manage this pandemic. If NVAX went from 95.6% -> 85.6% -> \\~60% against the original, UK, and SA variants, respectively, then I expect to see similar, if not more significant drop-offs for other vaccine makers (see footnote at the end of the post for explanation).\n\nThis is a big deal because it's expected that protection will drop off over time but if you start off with lower protection and lower neutralizing antibody titers at baseline, then you‚Äôd expect to lose protective immunity even faster. I made the graph below to illustrate the concept (red line for SA strain crosses the threshold of protection sooner than the blue line for the original strain).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3z6mnc1oi7e61.png?width=371&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5f8e6030b1f7237ee43aeab7703be6ba6cdb597\n\nSo, what does this mean? First, boosters are going to be essential and vaccine makers are going to sell a lot more doses as a result. Second, vaccines will be updated to cover multiple variants, which will continue the virus evolves. We already knew that Pfizer and Moderna were working on new versions of their vaccine, and after NVAX‚Äôs conference call today we know that NVAX is working on a bi-valent vaccine (i.e. a combination shot).\n\nThe need for boosters and coverage against additional strains is a huge deal and favors NVAX significantly over MRNA/PFE/AZN/JNJ because it‚Äôs the only vaccine that can be so easily multiplexed and repetitively dosed:\n\n1. Novavax‚Äôs existing vaccine has only 5ug of protein (millionths of a gram) and can add multiple additional strains without concerns over dose limiting toxicity. For instance, they could add an additional 4 strains and have only 25ug of protein, which is a dose evaluated during phase 1 trials that was found to be safe.\n2. mRNA vaccines don‚Äôt have this same luxury because there is an upper limit to how much mRNA can be included in a dose before toxicity becomes a problem. For instance, Moderna includes 100ug of mRNA in each shot and we already know that they discontinued their 250ug dose from Phase 1 due to toxicity. They‚Äôre not going to be able to just add another 100ug of mRNA to cover another strain. This will be much more complex and may require separate shots for separate strains.\n3. mRNA vaccines also have higher reactogenicity symptoms from subsequent injections. Note that there‚Äôs a huge difference in symptoms between dose 1 and dose 2 for both MRNA and PFE. This will likely carry over for boosters and additional shot and could become limiting.\n4. The adenoviral vector vaccines ‚Äì AZN/JNJ ‚Äì suffer from vector-mediated immunity, which makes additional doses problematic bc your immune system develops an immune response against the vector itself and significantly less DNA is transcribed into spike protein. It‚Äôs unlikely that the adenoviral vectors will play a big role in the booster/additional strain market without some relatively complex and unattractive logistics (i.e. mixing Ad26 and Ad5 vectors).\n\n**The need for boosters and for strain updates means that COVID vaccination isn‚Äôt going to be a one-time event.** This is bad for the world, but this is a huge deal for NVAX bc revenue forecasts for 2022 and beyond will be significantly higher than the DCF models used to arrive at current price targets from JPM and Jefferies, both of which are over $200.\n\nAlthough the need for updated vaccine formulations presents an opportunity for 2nd wave vaccine makers to become relevant (i.e. $ALT, $VXRT, $ARCT, $CVAC), it will be more challenging to recruit and conduct trials, creating a bit of a moat for NVAX and other 1st wave vaccine makers. There might be some interesting plays in that space, but NVAX remains best positioned at this point in time for future COVID vaccine revenues.\n\nAnother thing worth addressing is the fact that the speed by which the mRNA platforms can develop new candidates is very exaggerated. They have about a one month jump over NVAX's platform, which is time that's easily made up by the ease with which NVAX can be distributed due to standard refrigeration requirements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# NVAX's is significantly undervalued with a $10.8B market cap ($170/share)\n\nI'm not a CFA and prefer to stick to the science, so I will reference the fact that multiple analysts had price targets north of $200 (Jefferies at $200 and JPM at $215) BEFORE considering the newly revealed importance of boosters and multivalent vaccine formulations which will add billions to annual revenue projections for 2022 and beyond. I suspect price targets will end up being much higher once the data and implications are digested and models are updated. These price targets were also before considering having best-in-class efficacy data against the original COVID variant.\n\nFor reference, consider some COVID vaccine competitors such as MRNA, BNTX, and CVAC, which have market caps of $63B, $26B, and $15B, respectively. Yes, their platforms are being given a higher multiple due to potential revenue for other indications, but NVAX successfully completed its phase 3 trial for their flu vaccine ($4B market) by demonstrating superiority versus existing best in class flu shot and have an advanced RSV vaccine candidate. Oh and they'll likely have a multi-valent COVID vaccine and annual booster revenue.\n\nLast but not least, it's important to emphasize how big of a deal it is that NVAX requires standard refrigeration and not the cold chain requirements of MRNA and particularly PFE. We tend to think the most about the US and EU, but a lot of the world cannot distribute vaccines with special temperature requirements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Upcoming catalysts\n\nAs mentioned above, I anticipate that we‚Äôll see a wave of analyst upgrades in the coming weeks.  I expect that we‚Äôll see a wave of new supply contracts with countries that don‚Äôt yet have a secured supply of vaccine.\n\nJNJ will be reporting data next week from their Phase 3 trial evaluating their 1-shot formulation. They had several sites in SA and I anticipate that they‚Äôll be reporting efficacy specific for the SA variant and I expect it to be low. The efficacy readout for JNJ‚Äôs 1-shot trial is based on protection at day 15 post injection and based on immunogenicity data published this month, I‚Äôm expecting poor efficacy against the SA variant due to low NAb titers at day 15. I anticipate that poor results against the SA variant will act as a positive catalyst for NVAX as JNJ is viewed as an important competitor for NVAX due to also having standard refrigeration requirements.\n\nAnother likely catalyst will be the revelation that UK data will be able to be used for US emergency use authorization. For reasons that I can't understand, the media has largely ignored the fact that UK data can and will be used to support US EUA and that the US trial is relevant for eventual full licensure in the US which is a status that no COVID vaccine will have for at least another year. I don't think this has been appreciated and I think it will serve as another catalyst.\n\nFinally, we‚Äôll see efficacy data in the near future for PFE/MRNA against the UK and SA strains. It‚Äôs possible that we see some of this data next week at conference that all are attending on February 2nd.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Positions\n\nCurrently have 1/29 $150c, $160c, and $170c with a handful of 2/19 calls and call spreads.\n\nAfter I dump the 1/29s tomorrow, I plan to buy a combo of shares and 2/19 call spreads to play the next wave of catalysts.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThanks for your time üöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n1. There are two reasons why I'm expecting to see bigger drop-offs for other vaccines against the SA strain compared with NVAX: 1) lower baseline efficacy in the case of AZN and likely JNJ and 2) lower baseline neutralizing antibody titers compared with NVAX ‚Äì true for PFE/MRNA/JNJ/AZN. Yes, T cells are important and may be an important differentiator for the mRNA  vaccines, but efficacy numbers to date have correlated with neutralizing antibody titers. T cells can‚Äôt prevent a virus particle from infecting a cell; they can only kill a cell once it‚Äôs infected (impt for disease prevention) whereas sufficiently high levels of neutralizing antibodies can prevent a virus particle from ever infecting a cell in the first place. One way or another, we‚Äôll have comparative data very soon.", "id": "l7l3nn", "created_utc": 1611900443.0, "score": 413, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "This is great and all but we‚Äôre kind of in the middle of something right now", "score": 194, "replies": [{"body": "I will donate 10% of my gains to the GME shares of your choice", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "So you think it‚Äôs still a good time to invest at this $220 price?

In the very near term, I think it‚Äôs possible that we see some revised PTs (JPM already revised up to $290) as well as increased discussion around the new variants and need for boosters/updated vaccines and a continued increase in PPS. \n\nThe other important missing piece of the puzzle is that we don‚Äôt have comparative data from other companies for efficacy against the SA/UK variants. JNJ managed to avoid reporting it with their evasive PR, but we might get updated efficacy in the near future for Pfizer/Moderna.

Ill go into detail\n\n1. 2 billion annual production capacity\n2. 1.7 billion in contracts\n3. Lower efficacy for SA strain means people will need a booster every 6-12 months\n4.  mrna strains will not be able to provide boosters for multiple strains at once like novavax\n5.  Novavax is only company in world to test a flu/covid combo in a phase 3 trial (UK)\n6. Nanoflu will become the market leading flu vaccine\n7.  The potential for an annual flu/covid booster is enormous.\n\n1. So the first one is pretty straight forward.  8 manufacturing facilities in 7 countries including the massive facility at serum institute.  Serum Institute expects it to cost about $2 to produce each dose.\n\n2. Novavax has contracts with US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, EU, India, Israel, Philippines, and all poor/middle income countries via CEPI.  about 1 billion of the annual doses will be sold via cepi for a profit of .50 a dose.  The other billion are close to $16. cost on those may be closet to $4 a dose and a portion of those are partner shares via japan south Korea.  lets say 700 million with $12 profit and 300 million with $6 profit.  Thats .5 Billion plus 8.4 billion, plus 3 billion.   11.9 billion annual profits for the best in class vaccine...\n\n3. The lower efficacy was actually good news for vaccine manufacturers as it means demand will be perpetual (like flu) as vaccine companies will need to protect against different strains. (as a result of the JNJ and NVAX data JPMorgan increased their expected covid vaccine market size\n4. Going forward, the mrna vaccines are at a disadvantage in responding to multiple variants due to the side effects.  They are unlikely to be able to increase dose size as demonstrated by all Moderna phase 1 participants getting very sick with the high dose(100% had fever over 101).  novavax went with their 5 dose instead of 25.  Both were safe and equally effective.  This means novavax could easily give a booster for 5 variants.\n5. 400 participants were tested with a flu/covid combo in uk trial.\n6  often forgotten is Nanoflu which beat the market leader in head to head phase 3 comparison for all 5 flu strains.  Flu market is 4.1 billion for over 65 and nanoflu is positioned to capture a large portion of that.\n7. So um who isnt going to want a flu/covid booster? This is why Ra capitol invested early.  They saw the potential.  Who wouldn‚Äôt want the best in class flu and best in class covid vaccine combined??  This is going to be HUGE..........\n\nSo in summary we‚Äôre looking at 11.9 billion in profits... before even talking about income from nanoflu or the future covid/flu combo which is going to be the most demanded vaccine in history.  We now know there will be annual boosters needed due to reinfection rate seen in nvax and jnj trials as well as the new strain being less effective.  Other future strains are bound to happen and will also require different boosters.\n\n11.9 billion times 20x PE is 230 billion... Thats a stock price of 3570... even before accounting for increased sales from nanoflu/covid combo.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!\n\nFurthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!\n\nREAD THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\n\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\n\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )\n\nWhen do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )\n\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\nNow, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!\n\nüíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôåüöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ\n\nAnd of course, this isn‚Äôt financial advice.

COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\n\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\n\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )\n\nWhen do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )\n\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n‚Ä¢\t‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\nNow, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet!

CRitical stuff will get done, don't get me wrong.  But people start trying to push out maintenance 10-20-50% and stuff starts slipping, making it more likely that one of those supply issues happens.\n\nIt's also not totally in their control.  The supply chain to semi's has been stressed with covid and while better now, is still close to a cliff.  Most critical materials don't have a quick backup available and if a suitable replacement can be found its a costly and timely qual with added risk.

{"title": "We are doing silver squeeze wrong", "selftext": "Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see from my wsb post history, I am an OG precious metals bull. And I am all for teaching a lesson to silver short sellers and manipulators if you believe they are the next level boss compared to those funds, who shorted meme stocks. But dear friends, if you want to stick it to likes of JPM you are doing wrong if you buy ETFs like SLV or SIVR because **JPM will be on both sides of your trade**. You can read my old simple write up about how this came to be [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/idjk61/cornering_silver_market/).\n\nTL;DR: JPM is, supposedly, both the biggest shortseller of Comex futures contracts and the custodian of silver on which above-mentioned ETFs are based upon. You can not initiate a short squeeze if the other side‚Äôs long position is increasing in value by your own hand.\n\nThere‚Äôs a possibility, that those paper ETF obligations are largely speculative and uncovered by actual physical silver. We don't know. You can see that Comex delivery and generally silver market recipients are mostly ETFs in recent years, who cover their paper positions when they want to. Read the prospects of those ETFs: SLV is not required to immediately purchase physical silver to cover your investments in that instrument, they simply track the price.\n\n**Again, I repeat: do not buy SLV or SIVR** if you are aiming for a short squeeze. That would be exactly like trying to start a short squeeze on GME by sending fees to Melvin Capital.\n\nInstead, if you can, **buy actual silver futures**. Store it in your mothers basement, if you have to. That will make them feel the real pain.\n\nIf you absolutely have to buy silver ETF, I suggest going for PSLV by Sprott or similar instruments. They are redeemable for institutions actual physical silver ETF and purchase silver from Canadian Royal Mint, if I‚Äôm not mistaken. You can read the prospect [here](https://sprott.com/media/1451/pslv-prospectus-en.pdf). However, this will not help your goal of squeeze much. \n\nFull disclosure: not an investment advise. I personally hold no physical silver ETFs, but I am long on numerous silver miners positions (most of which I listed on wsb).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.: funny enough, PSLV is an actual name of Indian rocket. So  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** many people are focused on the statement that there might not be enough physical in SLV Trust Custodians accounts. Those are speculative assessments. However, prospect specifically allows Authorized Participants to allocate some silver via unallocated accounts (that is, basically a credit, IOUs).But that is not the point. The main thing is that if you jack up the price of SLV you will be sending money to JPM and their partners at 3 stages this way:\n\n1. arbitrage  trade: once they see that SLV is jacked very much compared to the price of  futures or spot prices of silver, they can purchase it, allocate to Trust and sell in form of 50k shares, collecting premium on the deal;\n2. Trust expenses. Basically, you will be paying for their operating expenses;\n3. ETF expense ratio, which is not the smallest among ETFs.\n\nHow you plan to make shorts bleed if you are sending them cash?

Also, for simplicity, SLV is always gonna mean the SLV trust ticker, and silver will always mean physical silver.\n\nSay we all just absolutely pile into SLV, largely with calls but I suppose shares work too, whatever shifts the float towards retail, and drive up the price of SLV.

So, yes, even if JPMorgan is just playing numbers games and winning both sides, my theory is that at a certain critical mass point, they just can't. Because at a certain point JPMorgan won't be able to back SLV with their holdings and they, or SLV, will have to look elsewhere, presumably also driving up the price of silver and in turn driving up the price of SLV, which would, presumably, continue going up based on the demand created by trying to shore up JPMorgans holdings, and continue backing SLV physically, all while decreasing the available supply.\n\nCan you show me where it says it doesn't have to be physical silver? I'm not saying you're wrong this time, I just very much got the idea that it was stipulated as backed by physical silver. I need to read it about half a dozen more times... and maybe go to law school... but still.\n\nI honestly still think SLV is the play here, *but* it's not the only piece. I don't think it's going to drive up the price of silver all by itself, I think we absolutely should be pushing to buy physical and one for one backed shares, locking up the actual supply drives up all the other shit based on silver, like SLV even if it does get ratfucked out of being backed by physical AND it has options available so we can spike our group leverage even further, and the miner stocks that are shorted all to hell.\n\nMy argument for SLV is that it's about as simple as it gets, its available at basically every broker, it has options available, it doesn't require anybody to leave their jerk dungeon, and massive volume should, in theory, drive up interest in silver which has a great big market outside of WSB, namely boomers.

Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. \n\n# Know Everyone's Hand\n\nYour guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.\n\nRemember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? \n\nYou are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.\n\n# Know What Can Go Wrong\n\nNobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.\n\n# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose\n\nThis one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***\n\n# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital\n\nIf you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. \n\nThere are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.\n\nSecondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. \n\nThirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake.

We all know to hold and buy, but some of us out there might not realize how low the other side will stoop to mitigate their losses. Here are some tips for making sure you stay alert and ready:\n\n**1. If you are still on Robinhood, go elsewhere to watch the market.**\n\nThe app has \"gamified\" trading to make it more interesting to investors (aka you). Bright lights, constantly moving charts, ever-revolving news additions. Some of the pages look like they belong on the Vegas Strip, begging for a cigarette in exchange for some tendies. These are the same tactics used by social media companies to grab and hold your attention (watch The Social Dilemma), and they aim to use your emotions against you. When the stock dips below opening and the whole screen turns red, it's pretty scary, right? Remove yourself from this and calm your emotions. I'm sure others can suggest better sites.\n\n**2. Get some sleep, go on a walk, eat some carrots.**\n\nThis may very well be a drawn out process. I know I've been getting less sleep lately and it's impacted other parts of my life. These hedgefund cowards are going home to 50,000 thread count sheets and beds stuffed with imported wool from Alpacas in Peru. I hope they're losing some sleep, but chances are they know how important it is to be alert and ready for anything. Put your phone on silent when the market closes at the end of the day and go contemplate existence while hugging a tree.\n\n**3. Talk with someone who isn't involved in all this about something besides this.**\n\nI'm not suggesting you forget what's going on here. But it's important to gain a bit of perspective.

I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!\n\nREAD THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\n\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\n\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )\n\nWhen do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )\n\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\nNow, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!\n\nüíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôåüöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ\n\nAnd of course, this isn‚Äôt financial advice.

I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!\n\nREAD THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!\n\nEVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!\n\nSince it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )\n\nWhen do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )\n\nToo much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.\n\nFirst, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n\nOfficial definition:\n\n‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n\nDumbed down version:\n\n‚Ä¢\t‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n\nNow you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n\nSo you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n\nSo what does that mean for us?\n\nWell, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n\nFriday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n\nNow, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!\n\nNow, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!\n\nThe only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.\n\nWe're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.\n\nTL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD.

I read a book and watched hours of talks on this to fully understand it, which I've outlined below.\n\nBasically, demand exceeds supply, and neither have anything to do with the price because this is all manipulated by JPM and other banks, while they silently accumulate massive positions. Any buying catalyst that moves the price beyond $50 could be enough to to trigger a massive upwards move.\n\nThesis on Silver:\n\nA. Silver prices are being intentionally kept low by JPM and others to allow central banks/JPM to accumulate silver for the past 8 years.\n\nB. Price reflects paper trading in derivatives/futures market rather than supply and demand factors.\n\nC. Silver has far more uses than gold and is a key component of solar panels, electronics, and the EV revolution.\n\nD. Mining is now unprofitable for several miners due to the low prices, and thus reduced supply.\n\nE. JPM and other banks paid +1 billion for rare metals market manipulation during the previous 8 years.\n\nA. 8 years of accumulation - JPM has amassed the world's largest supply of silver at 900 million ounces. Yearly demand is 950 million ounces, where close to 80% of that is for industrial uses, and therefore 100-200 million ounces is for investment.\n\nB. Price divergence from supply and demand - US mint produces \"silver eagles\" each year and always runs out, in 2019 they ran out in February. Over the past 8 years there have been months were silver was on backorder with a lead time of over 3 months from any of the 5 major global mints.\n\nC. Silver is used in practically all electronics and is a key component in everything from electric vehicles, to solar panels. Dupont has greatly reduced the amount of silver needed for their silver paste during recent years, and demand is still quite high. Silver is not just a store of value.\n\nD. Several miners have shut down unprofitable mines, and (almost) all cost reductions in operations have already taken place. New mines take 5+ years to become operable. The vast majority of silver comes as a byproduct from mining other basic metals. Miners have no control over the price because supply/demand have no effect.\n\nE. Regulators (CFRC) have ignored whistleblowers, and sometimes don't even respond. Documented group chats from traders bragging about how they can manipulate the markets are in the public domain and nothing has been done. The irony is that JPM is the custodian of $SLV, meaning that they are the ones responsible for purchasing and storing silver, while also paying fines for manipulation.\n\nFutures contracts are supposed to delivered in silver, but are also deliverable in cash if silver is not available. Obviously if silver is not available to be delivered then the price should reflect this, but it doesn't.\n\nExchanges:\n\nCOMEX - bank run/organized exchange.\n\n\\- Limit to long position sizes\n\n\\- No limit on short position sizes, biased towards downside\n\nSilver Manipulation Critics:\n\n1. Ted Butler - has been calling this out for decades.\n2. Chris Marcus - The Big Silver Short\n\nMajor Historical Events:\n\n1. 1979-1980 Hunt Brothers try to corner market. Buy up 30% of silver and price goes from $5 to $50. COMEX restricts all buying and pressures for margin requirement changes. Everyday people start selling their silver which provides liquidity. Hunt brothers lose billions. They 100 million ounces approximately and had derivatives contracts for another 125 million.\n2. 1997 Warren Buffet buys up silver. 100 million ounces. Price doubles from $5-10. Rumors of pressure that forced him to sell and book a $100 million profit.\n3. 2008 silver price drops from $20 to $9 within weeks/months on financial recession news, the opposite of what anyone would expect.\n4. 2011 silver price runs up to $49. 40-49 was due to short squeeze. Sunday evening $6 selloff, highly abnormal and possible manipulation.\n\nDuring the 2008 Great Recession, JPM received 30 billion dollars to takeover Bear Stearn's positions. One of these was a short position on silver that was so big that they needed special and temporary regulatory approval to put it on their books. They were supposed to shrink the position to a reasonable size within 6 months; instead, they initially added to it.\n\n\\##########################################################################\n\nI am not an investment professional, just a fellow autist who likes shiny things.\n\n\\##########################################################################", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Given the arsenal of \"control\" held by institution like JPM over silver, would retail buying of something like $SLV really be sufficient to make mad gains?

{"title": "GME - Shkreli Thoughts 1/29", "selftext": "I was away the last few days giving depositions to a different three-letter government agency--sorry about that. GME continues to be a Carollian experience. Through this looking-glass, there is a world where stock prices do not reflect the value of the underlying companies whose partial ownership is traded through common stock. To some, the market is, more or less, broken, for now. That's not a good or a bad thing. The market mechanism is not supposed to make an implicit judgment. There is information in price, but that information is difficult to divine and interpret. Markets aren't good, bad, rational or irrational: they just are.\n\r\n  When one group takes action in a market to alter the playing field, the market is not a pure market anymore. It's lost 'integrity' and loses more with every modification. This typically only happens in moments of crisis or technological change: countries ban short-selling, for instance; exchanges will unwind clear 'fat-finger' trades, etc; speed bumps may make the market more 'fair' for the technologically behind. We're learning more about how markets can have what appear to be 'unintended' consequences (flash crashes, GME-style reverse crashes), or can be 'gamed' (spoofing, quant as a whole), but we're back to square one: markets don't have feelings. The rules are simple: post your price, the amount, and the rest is order-matching. All of the rest are modifications against the spirit of the laws of the jungle.\r\n  \nSo, like you, I'm disgusted by what happened the other day. My guess is the DTC and others required incremental collateral for clearing any GME trades--this required RH to raise capital. I actually don't think RH is to blame here! Every broker did the same thing, so there must be a root cause. I mentioned something like this may happen the other day, and I repeat my admonition to not trade on margin. I suspect GME long buying will require 100% margin at virtually any broker. Brokers have to protect themselves, but they can be influenced by the rest of the parties in their food chain, as we saw.\n\r\n  GME is still worthless compared to its current price. Keep that in mind. You're buying a flower, a baseball card, a beanie baby, a photocopy of a Picasso, all for prices that you know are a lot more--not just a lot more, but insanely more--than anything close to what it could be worth. Those are the facts: GME is just a shitty retailer that will struggle to survive, let alone become a business worth 20 or 30 billion dollars. All of the Ryan Cohen transformation stuff is BS relative to the price change. A good team may be able to turn around GME to the point where it is worth $40, MAYBE. It'll never be worth $300, or at least, the probability that GME operations could support a reasonable price like that is about as small as my odds of becoming a MLB starting pitcher.\r\n \n That doesn't mean the stock can't go up. The world is conflating what a market is by trying to assign it implicit judgment. Traders have the right to buy and sell anything they'd like for any price that they'd like. One man's \"bubble\" is another man's \"deep value.\" I bought a rap CD for millions of dollars. That's my right. Did I overpay? Well, that's really not a judgment anyone can make, is it? If I paid $10,000,000 for a baseball card which is well-known to trade for $5, then it seems clear I've overpaid, right?\r\n  \nNo. Speculators buy assets for many reasons. Sometimes its because they're making a value judgment: this is WORTH more than my purchase price. But what does that imply? What is worth or value? Most speculators (I suppose you can define that as a buyer who has an explicit intention to sell at a later date, probably soon) buy things because they are confident they can sell at a higher price soon. The value judgment is secondary, and sometimes not relevant at all. Speculators are the animating spirit of the market. If you curb the ability for speculators to act, you have a farcical excuse of a market. But, you can't blame a clearing broker for saying, \"what happens if your client can't clear this trade?\". The stock just went from 300 to 150--what if your client is broke? To me, the simple answer there is to require 100% margin. Limiting the ability for someone to buy a stock for 100% margin (literally the cash to cover the trade is set aside) smells awful. I wouldn't bother with conspiracies--they won't help you trade well.\r\n  \nMany of you are brand new to the world of trading. I've traded my whole life--it is very, very hard. I am not very good at it, to be frank. I do think I'm a very good value investor, and in biotech, an extremely good binary-event trader. 99% of people, including in finance, are not good traders. 99% of people are not good 'value' investors, either. That doesn't mean you shouldn't want to become one or try. But it is inordinately difficult. There's nothing wrong with hobbies or 'side gigs', but I really think you should think about the market like a professional sport, or fighting/boxing league, where you are permitted to 'play with the pros'. It doesn't make too much sense to 'part time' fight Brock Lesnar or take LeBron 1-on-1. But this is what you're doing when you trade. Be careful.\r\n  \nFor those newish to trading, here is my advice on some reading materials:\n\r\n1) Market Wizards series. This is one of the best series on great investors/traders, which takes you into the mind of the successful trader, in their words. It's always by the same author (JS), too, who is very experienced and knowledgable.\r\n    \n2) Trading to Win by Ari Kiev. Read it. Probably the best book on the theory of trading ever written.\r\n    \n3) AVOID most books on trading. Unless there is a reason to read them that you can really digest, they're probably empty wastes of time at best, or at worse, could mislead you into some terrible strategy. You can't go wrong reading the books by or about people who have made fortunes in the market. But always take everything as a grain of salt. AVOID the opinions of others in general. This sounds self-referential, but will make a little bit more sense after reading 1/2.\r\n  \nWhen you read these books, you'll realize that my life of 'value investing' is basically irrelevant to the near-term of the stock market, especially in situations like GME or TSLA. GME will probably go down over time, as I mentioned, because it is wildly overvalued and, generally, wildly overvalued stocks tend to go down over time. That doesn't have to be true. That's why investors diversify and 'stop-loss' and do other things to protect themselves. You should do all of that, too. My style, and those of others, simply relate the price of something to the amount of cash it can generate. That's value investing in a nutshell, and it is what the entire industry of Private Equity (Blackstone, Apollo, Carlyle, etc.) is all about. Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds do a little of this as well, but to decide whether a stock will go up or down is this dark art called 'trading'. The \"next\" Steve Cohen might be being born right here, right now, in WallStreetBets. Who knows.\r\n  \nI still think GME will trade at 1,000. Why? I am guessing, like all of you, and every other trader out there. No one knows anything. As I mentioned, the borrow interest rate is what I think is important to watch. You're at a disadvantage to other traders in that respect: hedge funds can pull up that information through phone calls, contacts, etc. which you are hopeless to compete against. It doesn't mean they're going to make money and you won't. It's just something to think about. I like 1,000: it's a big round number that is meaningful in the psychology of the markets, to a very small extent. It may trade there for 5 seconds, or it may trade there and keep going higher. For some reason, I think the stock has a bit of \"destiny\" to go there. I may be 100% wrong. As I said, to the extent I have any skill at all, it's generally in being able to predict the value of stocks of companies (and other assets) many years from now, and in biopharma, if anywhere. \r\n  \nI hope everyone does well, and even is being entertained, by all of this. Just make sure that if you have a massive gain in GME, that you 'take something off the table'. Don't be greedy. Some of this money is life-changing. Even if it is 10% of your position, book some kind of gain. It will feel good. Be objective. Don't use margin--you may lose more than you can afford. I've been there. It sucks balls worse than you can imagine. Don't do it for GME, even if RH or anyone else lets you. Don't go too crazy with options, even if they let you. I hope you all are able to buy Wu-Tang albums, tendies, autism treatment and whatever else your hearts desire at the 'end' of this, whatever that means. \r\n  Good luck WSB, I love you!\n\n(sent from martin, posted by mo)", "id": "l80sl1", "created_utc": 1611946590.0, "score": 1082, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 280, "comments": [{"body": "What are paragraphs and how do I use them?", "score": 319, "replies": [{"body": "ive fixed it sorry lmao", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "You are a legend.

{"title": "How to Buy GME Above Broker Limits", "selftext": "How to Buy GME etc [Loophole]\n\nRobinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.\n\nHere‚Äôs a trick that ~~will work.~~\n\n**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **\n\n1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).\n2) Scroll all the way down the call list.\n3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).\n4) Immediately exercise.\n\nI just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.\n\nBest of luck out there! Let‚Äôs get them!!!\n\nP.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can‚Äôt afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~\n\n_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.\n\n_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._\n\nEDIT:\n\n1) This works for pretty much any stock.\n\n2) There‚Äôs a catch. You need enough money (please don‚Äôt use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.\n\nExample:\n\n- $GME is $300\n- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000\n- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).\n- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)\n\nAfter exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.", "id": "l82y7u", "created_utc": 1611951445.0, "score": 75150, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 3888, "comments": [{"body": "Epic **infinite money glitch**, still unpatched as of patch 69.420", "score": 5255, "replies": [{"body": "lol this is more of a ‚Äúlet yourself spend your own money despite corporate bootlicking RH glitch‚Äù", "score": 1352, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1417, "replies": [{"body": "**INVESTORS HATE HIM**", "score": 182, "replies": [{"body": "*because of this one simple glitch*", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "AH MY SIDES", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Is that this \"free market\" I've heard so much about?", "score": 475, "replies": [{"body": "Now this is the real american dream", "score": 120, "replies": [{"body": "Lol what a fn joke , free market my ass", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "U-S-A", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Too soon .", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You'll find the \"free market\" in a U.S. storage unit next to \"journalistic integrity\" and \"justice for all.\"", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "Gah shit, that was in the clearance aisle last WEEK!", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "That's accurate and funny AF.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Man, they burned that storage unit to the ground 4 years ago!", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Truth!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Free and fair market*", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "God no.

Normally they stop trading and expire at 4 pm on Fridays . For an option to be worth anything it has to be in the money or have time left on its expiration.\nTwo types of options are PUT and Call you can buy these or sell them.\t\t\n1 call or put represents 100 shares of stock.\nThe price of a put or call contract is the price X 100 shares \nBuying a Call gives you the right to purchase the stock at a given strike price (this is the price to purchase the stock) the price of the option is based on the strike price and the time left till the option expires. \n\nAn out of the money option will never be executed after the market closes even if  after hours trading brings the stock higher, you have until 4pm at some brokerage firms to execute 5pm at others.\n\nAn in the money option will always be executed by the brokerage firm as long as it‚Äôs .01 in the money so be carefull if you don‚Äôt want to execute call them by 4PM. \t\n\nYou can make money on options several ways. If you buy an option on a stock  that is trading at $9.75 you might want the $10 call strike price (this is considered out of the money) ( that means you can buy the stock at $10 this would cost you anywhere from $ .05 to $2.00 depending on how much time is left to expiration.\nIf you bought a $ 10 put option on that same stock it would be considered in the money.\nBuying a call gives you the right to buy a stock if you want, at anytime regardless of the date the option is due.\nBuying a put option allows you to sell the stock at a given price so if you buy a ( in the money) $20 put  and the stock goes down to $9.75 you could buy the stock at the 9.75 price then exercise your put option and sell it at $20. Making 20.00 - 9.75= profit of 10.25 less fees Or sell the put back at more than 10.25.\n\nExample : Your account starts with $45,000.00 cash    \nGME Price as of Feb 1 $325 \nplan to buy 100 shares or 1 option\nThe call at the strike price of 325 for Feb 5 is trading at $125. \n1. If you buy the call your cost is  $12,500 for the call and you will have $32,500 in cash + value of option until expiration date but your cost to buy the stock is now $450.00 ( 325 plus cost of option of 125) so you may or may not make money and you will need to save the cash until you exercise or sell the option. \t\n2.You could just buy the stock at 325 leaving $12,500 cash\n3.You could also buy the stock at 325 and sell the 325 call option for 125,  your cost on this stock is now 200 but you can‚Äôt get anymore than the 325. Cost is 325 - 125 profit from option sold. (38% return in week)\nOn Feb 5 the stock and option is either above 325 (in the money) or below 325( the option expires out of the money. If the option is in the money on Friday you could either buy it back for the price the stock is at less 325 or let them take the stock and start over.  If its not in the money you can sell a new option again. (325 for the stock, sold call get 125 cost of stock 200 the max gain is 125 until option expires stock risk is 200 a share)\t\nFeb 5th  comes and the stock is at 300 the option you sold expires with no one exercising.  \nProfit on option is 125.00 per share  the price you sold it for .Total profit on option is 12,500.00 you still have your 100 shares but the cost is 200 not 325 NOTE: there is no profit if stock is below 200 and total profit or loss would be -325 plus current price plus 125 option sold price\nDo it again and again will lower your cost each time.\n\nRemember Once your call option is sold you cannot sell the stock you must wait for the option expiration and 1 day because you won‚Äôt know if it was executed until Sunday night. The good news is when you sell the option the money you get is yours to keep. So some people might want to look at selling an option that has more time which means more money and might cover their cost of the stock and a little profit. But I think near term options are best to do when selling options against stock\t\t\n\nOne final note normally I would sell options in a stock position but not with GME selling a call option near the current stock price will only hurt you all.

If you buy an option on a stock  that is trading at $9.75 you might want the $10 call strike price (this is considered out of the money) ( that means you can buy the stock at $10 this would cost you anywhere from $ .05 to $2.00 depending on how much time is left to expiration.\n\nIf you bought a $ 10 put option on that same stock it would be considered in the money.\n\nBuying a call gives you the right to buy a stock if you want, at anytime regardless of the date the option is due.\n\nBuying a put option allows you to sell the stock at a given price so if you buy a ( in the money) $20 put  and the stock goes down to $9.75 you could buy the stock at the 9.75 price then exercise your put option and sell it at $20. Making 20.00 - 9.75= profit of 10.25 less fees Or sell the put back at more than 10.25.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExample : Your account starts with $45,000.00 cash    \n\nGME Price as of Feb 1 $325 \n\nplan to buy 100 shares or 1 option\n\nThe call at the strike price of 325 for Feb 5 is trading at $125. \n\n1. If you buy the call your cost is  $12,500 for the call and you will have $32,500 in cash + value of option until expiration date but your cost to buy the stock is now $450.00 ( 325 plus cost of option of 125) so you may or may not make money and you will need to save the cash until you exercise or sell the option. \t\n\n[2.You](https://2.You) could just buy the stock at 325 leaving $12,500 cash\n\n[3.You](https://3.You) could also buy the stock at 325 and sell the 325 call option for 125,  your cost on this stock is now 200 but you can‚Äôt get anymore than the 325. Cost is 325 - 125 profit from option sold. (38% return in week)\n\nOn Feb 5 the stock and option is either above 325 (in the money) or below 325( the option expires out of the money. If the option is in the money on Friday you could either buy it back for the price the stock is at less 325 or let them take the stock and start over.  If its not in the money you can sell a new option again. (325 for the stock, sold call get 125 cost of stock 200 the max gain is 125 until option expires stock risk is 200 a share)\t\n\nFeb 5th  comes and the stock is at 300 the option you sold expires with no one exercising.  \n\nProfit on option is 125.00 per share  the price you sold it for .Total profit on option is 12,500.00 you still have your 100 shares but the cost is 200 not 325 NOTE: there is no profit if stock is below 200 and total profit or loss would be -325 plus current price plus 125 option sold price\n\nDo it again and again will lower your cost each time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember Once your call option is sold you cannot sell the stock you must wait for the option expiration and 1 day because you won‚Äôt know if it was executed until Sunday night.

AMD has, until last year, been the lower quality bargain brand of CPUs, unable to match Intel. In early 2020 they showed a product lineup that almost totally eclipsed Intel‚Äôs across the board. This is showing first in the enthusiast market (gaming) but with the right investments and time this will move into enterprise sales. Enterprise is slow to move and AMD B2B sales+marketing+support is not as established as Intel‚Äôs. They will see big wins in the coming years as they have a better product that is significantly cheaper.\n\n2. AMD traditionally pioneers higher memory bandwidth to their CPUs, which is synergistic with accelerators and their GPUs.\n\n3. AMD had an unexpectedly amazing showing in their consumer graphics cards compared to Nvidia. Here they were recently a bargain brand as well but couldn‚Äôt even get close to touching the performance of Nvidia products. Now for rendering they are about on-par and much less energy hungry. The competition is strong here compared to the CPU space. It is important to note that Nvidia ships even it‚Äôs graphics focused chips with AI accelerators and they still own the general purpose SIMD space, which is generally what data center and AI is consuming. In summary, AMD is outperforming here but still has work to do if they want to beat the competition on all fronts.\n\nNow for the risks:\n\n1. ARM: it‚Äôs been talked about as the x86 killer for nearly a decade now and many have written it off. I think Apple showing they can make it work for their laptops and continued work on Windows support is going to eat into this. Not to mention several well funded startups have been taking big steps in making arm servers accessible. There is major incentive to arm‚Äôs lower power solution, even in data centers. Nvidia squiring ARM and networking companies is a large threat.\n\n2. RISC-V: similar to arm, but less developed and likely much further off. I don‚Äôt see this as any immediate concern.\n\n3. Capital. They don‚Äôt have the means to invest more than their competitors to fight on two fronts. This hasn‚Äôt mattered since Intel has dropped the ball and gotten themselves into a monopolistic, enterprise mindset where they invest more in sales than in R&D but if their competitors decide to put in the investment they can easily outspend AMD and we could see that take effect in 3-6 years.\n\nTL;DR: expect market share of Intel and AMD to flip. Great R&D progress on CPU and GPU. Graphics/gaming market share will increase but to an unknown extent due to heavy competition. Watch out if Intel starts putting heavier R&D on its balance sheet or for major ARM advances outside of traditional mobile computing.\n\nAyyyyyMDüìàüöÄüöÄ\n\nDisclaimer/disclosure: just a redditor, not your financial advisor.

{"title": "A breakdown of how the short squeeze started and what‚Äôs going on with brokerages.", "selftext": "GameStop short float is currently around 250%. \n\nFor a second, let‚Äôs just imagine there are only 100 shares total of GameStop.\n\nThis means that person A owns 100 shares. Person B is a short seller and borrows them, sells them to person C who buys them. At this point the stock is 100% short.\n\nPerson C then lends those shares to Person D who is a short seller who then sells them to person E who buys them.  The stock is now 200% short. \n\nPerson E lends 50 of them to person F who is a short seller who sells them to person G who buys 50. The stock is now 250% short\n\nSo now person A, C, and E all own the same 100. The brokerage sights are limiting buying because they are attempting to unwind that! If everybody right now demanded their shares. The brokerage sites should be on the hook for $34.5 Bil worth of stock that doesn‚Äôt exist.\n\nThat‚Äôs fucked up but here‚Äôs where it gets crazy. \n\nThere were never any controls on monitoring if somebody‚Äôs shares had been sold short twice. \n\nWhen a short seller sells shares. They are immediately paid. So cash is in their accounts. \nWhen a person buys shares they pay money out and theoretically own shares. But because the short selling wasn‚Äôt tracked brokers do not possess the shares they were putting into the market. If everyone were to request their shares they would default on their obligations and fold. Meaning they only have 100 shares and person A, C, and E all have a claim to those shares. Meaning the buyers are left fighting over who has shares. And the short sellers are left holding the cash they collected. \n\nIt gets super messy. \n\nIf Robinhood were to default. Short sellers win. Then most likely the fed has to come in and save the buyers spending tax dollars. That‚Äôs why the fed is getting involved.\n\nBy limiting shares and removing the ability to continue to short, they are trying to unwind this mess without it causing a panick.\n\nThat is why the broader market is down. \n\nNot because of shorts covering... but because of the potential for brokerages to collapse. \n\nI‚Äôm guessing Robinhood, TD, IB, and E-Trade are on the hook for a vast majority of the shares that don‚Äôt actually exist but multiple people own.\n\nImagine if person A says he doesn‚Äôt want to lend his shares.  The broker and clearing house has to figure out how to balance person B-G sourcing shares from somewhere else.\n\nIf the brokerages don‚Äôt go under. Short sellers, the hedge funds, are on the hook. \n\nIf they do go under... economic recession. \n\nRetail investors once again left holding the bag.\n\nInstitutions don‚Äôt use these little guys. They use IB to trade and then they have the physical shares transferred into accounts at 5/3rd. If IB were to go under their fund would be fine. But most brokerage accounts are only insured up to up to $250k.\n\nThis is a failure of the system as a whole. This is a problem created by the top .001% and they are trying to call it a Reddit rebellion. Fuck that. \n\nThis is totally a short selling fault. I think the outcome of this is that short selling gets banned.\n\nEdit: Changed we to they, our to their.

But we don't directly interact when we do a trade. Instead there is a market setup to facilitate the transactions. This market has a number of middle men entities that help keep the system flowing. Your brokerage account platform establishes an interface for you to buy/sell securities. So person A is selling a security to person B (with brokerage A and B servicing each individual). The end result is for money from B to end up in A's account while the security A sold ends up in B's account. To facilitate this transaction, the middle man entities have been established to move the assets between A and B. \n\nThere is a multi-layer system of clearing houses that facilitate the transfer. Each brokerage interfaces with a clearing house. The clearing houses then interface with a trust company to complete the transactions. In our system, this is the Deposit Trust Company (DTC) which is organized as a limited purpose trust company and provides safekeeping through electronic record-keeping of securities balances. It also acts as a clearinghouse to process and settle trades in corporate and municipal securities. The DTC is designed to lower costs and risk and increase the efficiency of the market. It provides end of day settlement of transactions where before it used to take 5 days to clear a transaction. Apparently 95+% of all transactions clear through DTC. They are there to manage risk in the trading system we have.\n\nSo the flow is Person B enters a buy order for a security. When a seller is matched up, Brokerage B registers the buy through their clearing house, the clearing house registers the transaction with DTC, and DTC logs the transaction and matches it up with the selling sides security. At T+1 or T+2 days, the transaction settles and now the funds are moved and the digital record of the security is updated. Note that our view of what happened is that we now have the stock or monies in our accounts immediately but in reality this is still clearing and may take a day or two. Why this happens is that each entity is taking on some level of risk to show the transaction as completed.\n\nTo manage the risk, DTC has a collateral requirement of 2-5% of the value of the security. This means that the buying side has to put up 2-5% collateral as a guarantee that the transaction will complete. The selling side is easier because their collateral is just the stock. The collateral requirements floats around depending on the volatility and level of risk of the security. But this also means that the entities involved have to have some level of capitalization to float around these collateral requirements. This whole system has $$$ floating all over the place all the time.\n\nBut then consider what happens if their is a problem with one side. If person B entered a buy order on margin, the brokerage is assuming some level of risk. If it turns out you can't pay then the brokerage will pay for the security and turn you away as a client. But if you multiply that out to a large scale the brokerage may not be capitalized enough to cover those trades so they will push that responsibility to the clearing houses. IF the clearing houses are not capitalized enough then it gets pushed to the DTC.\n\nThis is where things went sideways. DTC put the collateral requirement on a number of securities ($GME included) at 100%. Given the huge volumes of some of these stocks, a number of the clearing houses decided to stop accepting buy orders for these stocks because they were not sufficiently capitalized to handle the orders. This trickled to the brokerage firms who then had to stop buys of these securities... but not sells because the collateral requirement of the sell is just the stock which they had hence the ‚Äúwhy the f*ck can I sell but not buy?‚Äù. Some big brokerage firms do self clearing and are sufficiently capitalized to handle the DTC requirements (think Morgan Stanley, Fidelity, etc...). The \"nuclear bomb\" that almost occurred was that if these clearing houses did not stop buys of these securities, all of their capitalization would have quickly been tied up with these particular stocks and then ALL sells of ALL securities would grind to a halt from these clearing houses. The markets would collapse. \n\nOne interesting side observation of this is that when the markets move to block chain technology for handling transactions, it will make this whole system even more efficient and instantly fast. It would also likely remove the clearing house companies and change the collateral dynamics that we saw.\n\nI've changed my view of Robinhood in this debacle and decided that what they really have is a horrible PR department. Educating their customers on this would have gone a long way to keeping their goodwill. But I fear that it is too late for them.\n\nAlso, serious changes need to be made to prevent this shorting situation we find here with $GME and others. The perverse incentives these hedge funds now have to ensure they crush a company is ridiculous and likely leads to really shitty activities on their part. There is a place for shorting a badly run company.

For the last 4 years, we‚Äôve been told that Civil War was around the corner. For the 12 months, we‚Äôve been worried about a pandemic, lockdowns, losing jobs, a divisive election, an insurrection. \n\nThe truth is ‚Äì we‚Äôve been fighting the same enemy this whole time. We just didn‚Äôt know it.\n\nTo the liberals here ‚Äì how often have you worried about the gap between the rich and the poor? The 1% vs the 99%? Wages stagnating? Inequality? Environmental destruction from multinational corporations? We were all listening to Green Day not too long ago, railing against the establishment. Are you not a little suspicious of the number of corporations that have suddenly changed their ‚Äúvalues‚Äù to be progressive? Are you not suspicious over Big Tech‚Äôs rush to censor dissent? \n\nTo the conservatives here ‚Äì you have been worried about your jobs being outsourced overseas, about your factories and manufacturing base disappearing, about the destruction of the family unit (particularly in rural communities). You wanted to drain the swamp. You‚Äôve worried over the rise of China and our trade dependence on them. Yet so much of the GOP‚Äôs policies have favoured the corporations who have abandoned you for decades. \n\nWe (the liberal and conservative base) have been worried about the same thing. We‚Äôve been fighting the same foe this whole time. And yet we‚Äôve both allowed the Corporatist Media and Party Establishments to pull the wool over our eyes. We have been so focused on fighting each other for years, blinded by our (skewed) perception that ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù was working with the enemy, we failed to see who was behind us this whole time. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all Gandalf, just realizing now that Saruman is in league with Sauron. \n\nThis is beyond hedge fund predators. This is the 1%. The swamp. Crony capitalists. ‚ÄúThe man‚Äù. Whatever you want to call them. They‚Äôve been making trillions of dollars during this pandemic. They‚Äôve been gambling with your money for decades, causing the near collapse of our economy in 2008. They‚Äôve been milking you dry. They‚Äôve been short-selling and squeezing the life of so many companies, losing millions of jobs, to the point where companies like Sears can‚Äôt even pay the pensions of retirees. Speaking of that - there are no pensions anymore. There is no minimum wage. All wages have been stagnating for decades. Where is your future? They claim the stock market is doing well. The economy is growing. And yet, where are you? Stuck? Still? Do you have a home yet? Are your student loans paid off yet? Will you ever afford to have a family? WHERE IS YOUR FUTURE. \n\nJeff Bezos has enough money to pay $50,000 to 4 million people. The 20 wealthiest Americans have $1 TRILLION worth of wealth. That‚Äôs $50,000 for 20 million people. Or $3400 for 300 million Americans. Sure beats the $600 we got! Their world is completely different from yours. Everything in this system is rigged in their favour. We can have a global pandemic, a lockdown, and yet they can be richer now than they‚Äôve ever been. We could have a Civil War (which is what they wanted?) and they could come out of it completely unscathed. Do you know how many billionaire‚Äôs own doomsday bunkers? They don‚Äôt have to go underground. They can take their yachts and travel the world until shit blows over. They can rest easy in their Switzerland-based chalet‚Äôs or their countryside villa‚Äôs in southern France. They don‚Äôt need you. \n\nWe should be ashamed of ourselves. We have fought with our neighbours these last few years. Called the other side (people who vote differently from us) idiots and fools. Persuaded in the righteousness of our own cause. We have all been individual pawns knocking each other off. But there‚Äôs only one King in this game, and nobody is trying to topple them. \n\nI want you to think about the other side for a moment. People different from you. Place yourself in their shoes right now. We‚Äôve had a year of protests and riots and destruction. We‚Äôve all placed the blame on each other. But at the end of the day, our needs are exactly the same. We all just want to be treated with respect. We all want the inherent dignity of being a human fucking being. And all of us have been getting robbed ‚Äì of our dignity, of our jobs, of our future - by the Barons of Wall Street. We are suffering from opioid crisis in our communities. We have an entire generation of NEETS (not in employment, education, or training) who have been cut-off from the supposed Great American Dream. Even those of us who have jobs ‚Äì was this the job you actually wanted? Was it the job you actually went to school for? Things are supposed to get better with each generation. And yet it seems like our futures were stolen for us before our lives even began. \n\nSo now you know why WallStreetBets, the Gamestop Short Squeeze, is IMPORTANT. This is a beautiful moment we are witnessing in history. You are in the midst of a true DIGITAL SOCIAL MOVEMENT. No more petitions. No more cancel culture. Real digital action. \n\nThe party establishments won‚Äôt do anything. The media has been railing against us this whole time, gaslighting you against your own interests. WE ARE FIGHTING BACK. WE WILL NOT LISTEN. Get your diamond hands on those stocks and never let go! \n\nIf you cannot afford Gamestop shares, then get to:\n\n\\*Blackberry (BB) ‚Äì hedge funds are trying to short sell them right now. \n\n\\*AMC \n\n\\*Nokia (NOK)\n\n\\*KOSS\n\n\\*Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)\n\n\\*this is not financial advice, just the ramblings of a retard. Do as you wish\\*\n\nThere are dozens of others that you can find on the r/WallStreetBets group. It‚Äôs time we build our own hedge fund that works for US. \n\nAnd who‚Äôs to say that we can‚Äôt turn Gamestop or Blackberry or AMC theatres around? Who‚Äôs to say it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbad stock‚Äù. I like the stock. Hell, I even like the companies! We‚Äôre the OWNERS now, we can change how things are done. Have our own Reddit WSB Board of Directors, and appoint u/DeepFuckingValue as all-encompassing CEO/Director/COO/etc. at large. Whatever the hell it is these guys do. \n\nSo, look to your left, and look to your right. Give each other a hug. It‚Äôs time we moved on from the bickering and divisiveness that has been plaguing this country. We want the same things. It‚Äôs time we get our share. \n\nWe want our future back.", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "Amen.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "And awomen", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Will be buying more on Monday.

Worked loyally for a small dealership and built a great referral network and repeat business basis. I brought one of MY customers in that was a granddaughter ( just 19 ) of a great customer of mine that had brought me many customers and been very very loyal to me. His granddaughter saved up 3k serving tables at a restaurant to put down on a new car. Her old\nToyota Corolla literally puttered into the dealership parking lot, I don‚Äôt have any idea how she made it that far. She was beaming with excitement because the day she had been working for was finally here. She was a first time car buyer and didn‚Äôt have any credit, that in  addition to banks not looking kindly on servers because most can‚Äôt verify earnings being the nature of serving tables and tips are mostly cash. \nBut since she had 3k down a couple banks were willing to pick her up. My boss tells me to go get the keys to a Ford Focus we had just traded in with only 15k miles on it. It was a 2015 Ford Focus, WITH ONLY 15k miles on it. That was instant red flag to me. Pair that with my knowledge of the Ford Focus double clutch tranny lawsuits..... so I went to check it‚Äôs history and of course it was an effected vehicle under lawsuit. I told my boss I‚Äôll sell her any car except that one because of the issues I KNEW she would have with it . I was cussed at, ridiculed and He tried to make me out to be a ‚Äú weak dick ‚Äú salesman.I was told ‚Äú it will be fine we will just make her buy a warranty ‚Äú .  I was top producing and highest earner of 10 salesman ( and I did it with integrity and never scammed ANYONE ) . I did it by treating my customers the way we would want our grandmothers treated, and my customers would send everyone they knew to see me because of it. \nThat being said, I blew up at my boss. Closed his office door and went FULL BLOWN RETARD on him. Smacked my big aluminum coffee thermos at him and left a big hole in the wall lol.  He was trying to get me to sell a hardworking young girl a car we KNEW had a bad transmission, AND she was a direct referral to me. Not a customer that just happened to come to the dealership. \nI was about to quit on the spot, luckily my finance manager with a heart made sure she didn‚Äôt get approved for the shitty focus and got her a zero percent loan through TFS by sweet talking a loan rep. \n30 days later I quit a career I had invested the last 8 years in because I saw the decline in morals, and I was sick of the fat greedy SOB‚Äôs like him stomping all over people.

That is a violation of the Constitution because it disregards property rights.Because with naked short positions hedge funds can determine the capital value of a company.  However, only the shareholders' meeting of a stock corporation is allowed to do this. In this way, small successful companies are massively depressed and then taken over at the sell-out price.  The SEC's task would be to prohibit this practice and to monitor this prohibition.But in recent decades this has been deliberately neglected, with the result that thousands of companies have gone bankrupt and investors have lost hundreds of billions of dollars.

At the start of trading that day, gme was just under $500 per share and gaining.

The clearing process (the dirty work behind the scenes) involves having the ability to process trades all the way through to the settlement process. This is a calculation of what they're systems can handle and their ability to provide capital to clear the trades. If they're systems have reached capacity, and/or they are having issues collecting money from the buyers to clear the trades, they have to limit the number of trades they process. Sales are easier to process because they involve collecting money from the clearing corps and then distributing it to the clients. Buy trades are more problematic. If the funds for the purchase aren't already in the account, they have to collect it from their clients. This is a much more difficult process in times like this and involves resources they don't have. They aren't trying to screw their customers, they have just made a calculation that they have reached the limits of their ability to process more buy transactions. \n\nFrom the Prime Broker (hedge funds) perspective: These firms are limiting the hedge funds from trading until they can capitalize their existing positions. The only way for the hedge funds to get capital internally is to liquidate existing positions, both long and short. Capital (margin) is required to maintain their existing positions. Capital gets freed up from closing either long or short positions, and the Wall Street firms are preventing those hedge funds that at risk from putting on any additional positions, whether long or short. \n\nPut simply, your last sentence is 99% correct.

Would like to know if you all agree.\n\nInterviewer:\n\nIt seems like people have really bought into this cause and are willing to take signficiant losses\n\nwhy do you think that is\n\nheapsp:\n\nI think you have a combination of rising expenses such as student loans, rent, and stagnant wages causing a whole generation of folks to lose faith that life for them will be the American Dream that everyone talks about. With crippling debt and no way out anytime soon, you have people who want to succeed but feel like they can't. Then they see Wall street folks or CEOs making record profits, they know it is wrong but have no way to fight back. A bunch of people get interested in activism or politics thinking that they can make a change for the better and improve the situation, but the game is still rigged against them. This is an opportunity to fight back. The fact that everyone is worshipping /u/deepfuckingvalue is obvious, because he is also a father of two and took all of his savings and made it. Everyone is just looking for an opportunity to level the playing field.\n\nheapsp\n\nThe idea that you can succeed by pulling yourself up by the bootstraps in this day and age is so false. I have a good job and career that I've been working at for 11 years. I work in technology. I still worry every month about buying formula and paying rent in a decent neighborhood so my kids can have a normal life. I have no savings and I don't waste my money. Half of my friends in their 30's either still live with roommates or at home with their parents. I am fortunate to be working with a great company, but I work incredibly hard. 60 hours a week, sometimes nights and weekends. The board of directors is insanely wealthy - I am scraping by. I can't imagine how difficult it is for people who are out of work or are under-employed and trying to make a decent life for themselves. For a lot of us, joining this community and banding together is about a lot more than trying to make a quick buck. We see it as our 'French Revolution' where we can strike back at the greedy and corrupt. Who better than greedy hedge fund managers that have pushed their greediness to the maximum level by shorting businesses into oblivion. The fact that we are in a pandemic and a hedge fund can short a brick and mortar store into the ground with illegal naked short selling and no one is going to do anything about it - well we are doing something about it. If the system won't handle it, the community will.\n\nheapsp\n\nI think you will find that wallstreetbets investments for the most part are really grounded in altruism. Tesla - Making the world not rely on fossil fuel and improving the environment.  Gamestop - punishing a hedge fund that wants to step all over a brick and mortar store during a pandemic. Also notice that you won't see many companies being supported that would have made the community a ton of money - AMZN for instance. For the community investment isn't only about making money - lots of retail investment is done from the heart. In no other community of investors would you see so many people HAPPY for other's success. We treat each other like a band of brothers, not competition. That is why we hold. That is why so much due diligence is shared. Some very smart people share some very insightful information without even investing themselves, if it would help the community succeed.", "id": "l87j8t", "created_utc": 1611962402.0, "score": 356, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "‚ÄúI just like the stock‚Äù\n\nEND OF INTERVIEW", "score": 202, "replies": [{"body": "WE LIKE THE STOCK", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Yesss!

They're kinda changing tune just like Cramer but I don't think they'll never be unbiased.\n\nI think Left tried to get false sympathy with \"threats\" but for one I know people here can be retarded but def not that retarded. Secondly if it was true he would've gone to law enforcement. Could also have been arranged by himself. I think the late night pizza delivery was really funny if it was true but I don't believe he really got any threats.\n\nNext time you talk to media tell them about the guy who posted he now had enough money from GME to treat his sister's lyme disease. Tell them may be if people had healthcare and reasonably priced medications (which is driven by hedge funds and PE these days) may be they won't have on GME. \n\nOr the other comment where another guy said his home was foreclosed even though he paid them the mortgage for technical reasons (basically it appears that the mortgage company wanted to take over the home). It was in the daily threads part I, I think. I have a screenshot if you want, I sent it to a bunch of my friends. Tell em about that.\n\nAlso tell them we millennials feel like we don't have a fair representation in media because we don't have any money. That's why we use social media a lot.\n\nA lot of media incl Yahoo News, CNBC, WSJ(which I usually respect but don't anymore) are trying to make us look like the villians. WSJ speculated about China being behind this without citing anything, it's unusual for them. Looks like someone told them to write an article.\n\nAlso that Massachusetts regulator he's obviously working for hedgies.\n\nCheck out that Kevin O Leary vs that MA guy video on cnbc. Some of the most ardent capitalists and socialists are behind us but it was an exception for CNBC.\n\nAlso tell them hedge funds and bankers were never  punished after 2008 and everyone incl media forgot. But people who lost home and jobs and filed bankruptcy whose lives were permanently altered couldn't forget.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8cgu0/melvins_losses_are_societys_gainz_if_you_made/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nThere were many posts like this.

And that difference, means (when buying a call), that if you get it wrong, you are only out that token price. And at best, if you exceed the price that you bet on in the time that you're given then you start making extra ordinary amounts of money - possibly.\n\nNow the *problem* with options is there's a risk if you make that call and sell it and someone buys it and they're right in your wrong you can lose infinite amount of money. There's also a bunch of funny things you can do by linking options together, and it gets really exotic.\n\nOptions are generally used to hedge. For example if I was a farmer and I routinely buy my grain for $4 in the spring. However I'm a smart farmer and I know this winter has a strong possibly of going to be very bad - or just for good financial sense, I just don't want to take the risk. So I go and buy an option for a dollar (token price) that allows me to buy an option for $4 (strike price I want) in the spring. The whole thing now costs me five bucks total - but only 1$ upfront/is consumed.\n\n- If winter comes around and it's bad and in spring the wheat is now $25. I can exercise my option and buy it for $4 and bank the saving, or because I'm now the owner of a $25 commodity/stock, I could then immediately turn it around and sell it and turn a profit if I wanted to. \n\n- If winter was mild and the wheat turns out to be abundant, and thus cheaper then 4$. I just let my option expire for 1$ in loss and I buy the stock itself/commodity for the new lower price of $3 or whatever. Then you are out $1 if you want to look at it that way, but you hedged, against crippling 5x (25$) normal costs. \n\nAnd that's kind of the basic principle, but of course like all things in financials *people get very exotic with it* - and when you're hedging corporations that are mostly non physical-made-up stuff/value, it gets a whole lot of complicated. Example: Tech companies trade at 30 times plus what they're worth - So if you're hedging. You saying are they going to just be more exorbitantly overpriced? Or less overpriced?

I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised at all if it were to get a higher price than ERIC in two weeks (hell, possibly by EOW). NOK even plans to merge with top tier companies in the near future due to their prowess in the 5G tech that they‚Äôre developing.

GME hype can‚Äôt last forever (even tho it can for a long time as long as we remain retarded). However being on team NOK makes me feel like I‚Äôm on a loosing, shitty ass baseball team and no one is hitting over .100\n\nWhat‚Äôs the plan, Stan?\n\nThe fucking plan is that you don‚Äôt buy market price.

This next week is going to be fucking spectacular ü™ÑüöÄü§≤üèªüíé and I need to know if my fucking NOKle heads are even in it to win it or just downright frauds. \n\nYou say NOK was a plan by the bots? Take a look at fucking BlackBerry. That shit took the same swerves NOK did that it‚Äôs pretty much identical.

I am trying to build a life just like you guys are. We are in something way bigger than ourselves so if you can for ONCE IN YOUR LIFE consider that maybe that the process is a trustable process then maybe we can win this shit.\n\nIf NOK hits $50, I will literally buy new fucking silverware (like expensive handmade shit with sterling silver cutlery) and eat my own shit. I don‚Äôt give a fuck whether you‚Äôd want to see it or not, because honestly boys I‚Äôd eat my shit to go to the moon and I am 200% willing to take one for the team. \n\nThis year, BANG is for real.\n\nSo hedgefunds, keep your ears out for the NOK NOK sounds on the door.
