{"title": "Blackberry (BB) Strategic Analysis using Options", "selftext": " Hey ladies and gents, hope you're having a great weekend. Just dropping in a quick strategic analysis on Blackberry. The details of the discussion are applicable for the week ahead and can be found below:\n\n**Expected move: +/- $3.00**\n\n* Upper Expected move: $17.00\n* Lower Expected move: $11.00\n\n**Potential move: +/- $3.90**\n\n* Upper Expected move: $17.90\n* Lower Expected move: $10.10\n\n**Historical Volatility: 98%**\n\n**Implied Volatility: 167.2%**\n\n* Put-To-Call Interest: 0.30\n* 10-year high: $17.21 (Feb-4-2013 the date when Research in Motion changed their name to Blackberry)\n* 5-year high: $14.55\n* 1-year high: $14.28\n\n**Bullish Trade idea (short-term):**\n\n* 15/18 weekly Bull Call Spread\n* Debit: $0.58\n* Max Profit Potential: $2.42\n* Risk/reward: 4.17\n* Breakeven: $15.58\n* Max profit occurs above $18 at expiration\n\n**Bullish Trade idea (long-term):** \n\n* Given the elevated implied volatility and low stock price, it is more prudent to own the equity. \n* Alternatively, $12 February monthly opex puts are trading at $1.40 and can be sold cash secured for an effective ownership price on the stock of $10.60 if assigned (this represents an 11.77% return on risk in less than 1 month)\n\n**Other considerations:** \n\n* Next ER is in Mid March\n* BB has announced partnerships with AMZN, ZM, OnwarMobility and Huawei\n* Blackberry owns over 30,000 patents, by far the most of any company in Canada and many of which are applicable to smartphones, which they will no longer focus on. \n* Expect more patent sales, further bolstering their balance sheet. \n\nFor those of you who would like to watch the video discussing the information above, the link is here:\n\n[https://youtu.be/uRHtwmzoc2Y](https://youtu.be/uRHtwmzoc2Y) \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. \n\nStay safe and healthy and trade well!", "id": "l46gwy", "created_utc": 1611518401.0, "score": 844, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 287, "comments": [{"body": "I was like oh another 🚀🚀🚀🚀💎👐 DD but then I saw all the words and realised I was not in the sub I thought I was in.", "score": 924, "replies": [{"body": "Haha...

That's what we've all been taught: P/E, DCFs, revenue/earnings growth and multiples. \n\nTSLA completely shattered this reality. A promise of a company that could transform an industry led to retail investors piling up shares and increasing valuations past any sense of normalcy. \n\nWhile we can say that \"eventually all bubbles pop\" it doesn't really matter anymore.

While this week's movements is a game of liquidity between longs and shorts with a limited float, GME could end up being a leader in the gaming industry simply because of the amount of cash it will undoubtedly end up raising at these valuations.\n\nWe've all heard that \"the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\", but that was said in a world when access to capital was more limited and a lack of technology only allowed linear growth. \n\nI'm slowly being convinced that due to technological exponential growth and access to capital, (many cases, not all cases of) irrational valuations will more quickly be caught up by fundamentals than they're caught up by a lack of support.

From this point, one of two things will happen. \n\n\nScenario 1 - The best case: consumer demand for GME will continue as investors buy more shares and options. This will continue the upward drive in price. The retards from WSB along with some big market players will go in heavy on short term calls. The price sees a hefty jump. Demand continues, and more shorts get called to cover there positions as the float continues to shrink. A combination of gamma squeeze, further increasing market demand, and a shrinking supply of stocks accelerate the price jump. We'll probably see circuit breakers tripping again. This further tightens the belt on the shorts. Going into the middle to later part of the week we start to see the short squeeze. This is the big one. Short sellers begin to starve each other out in an escalating bidding war for whatever float they can get their hands on. The algorithms go wild, investors grab up everything they can, and short sellers lose money faster than J-Pow's money printer can Brrrrrrr. The mother of all Viagra fueled rocket ships shoots so hard it carries the moon with it. Even people who get in on Monday can see their money possibly double or triple. We surpass the magic holy grail of $1000+ share price and your wife's boyfriend finally gives you that high-five you've always dreamed of as that crappy broken iPhone you trade on rains out money as if you're a high class stripper.\n\n\n\nScenario 2 - Worst case: Consumer demand for shares is not nearly as strong as WSB is counting on. The boomer propaganda scares investors into believing this a bubble and we're already at the top. The price stagnates and doesn't move much. The majority of holders feel their paper hands growing weak and they sell out to lock in their gains. New investors will probably keep pace with those looking to exit their positions which gives time for short sellers to cover their positions. As investors lose steam, people begin to lose faith and assume this is all the squeeze we are going to get. The stock becomes more liquid and the float pool grows easing pressure on short sellers which further hinders upward mobility. The stock price will fizzle out and settle down wherever the market deems appropriate.

Big short-squeezes are very rare, but they do happen. They are related to both the interest the one has to pay when borrowing a stock (which we call shorts), and what happens when the stock you are borrowing and hope to sell later for a profit, actually goes up in price. Usually heavily shorted stocks are ones that big companies believe are going out of business, or ones that simply are overvalued. However, sometimes companies turn their outcomes around, and price goes up. The shorts are faced with an option: Either give up and sell for a loss, or wait it out, and hope the growth is temporary or unsustainable.\n\nSome of the biggest short squeezes out there include the VW squeeze in 2008, the Overstock.com squeeze from this year, BlueApron short-squeeze, Tesla short-squeeze, and others. There's not a lot though, they are highly irregular.\n\nIf by 'unprecedented', you mean rare, then I'd rate a short-squeeze as being a 10 for super-rare. If you are talking about how likely it is to spot one coming, from 1 being impossible to tell they are coming to 10 being easy to spot, I'd rate it a 2 or 3. General, short-squeezes happen very quickly, and out of the blue.\n\nThere have been a lot more short-squeezes in more recent years with the spread of information quicker. You can just look online and view a company's short interest, or short to float ratio. There are also many places, like Reddit, where the possibilities of short-squeezes can be quickly shared. Two short-squeezes happened just last year, in both Overstock.com and Tesla.\n\nAs for GME, here's the facts. Approximately 130% of the float is shorted. That means that out of all the shares available for trading, all of them have been borrowed and then some through naked short selling. Most shorts have shorted GME at $15 all the way down to nearly zero. So shorts are deeply underwater, and have to pay exorbitant amounts of interest to their brokerages. We're talking millions upon millions of just short-interest now. This is a lot of pressure to do something. They can either hope it goes down REALLY REALLY fast, or short more and push the price down, but that can just exacerbate the problem. Also, at this point in time, there are no shorts even available. Brokerages are getting slammed with buys and theirs no float that short-sellers can get their hands on. Their last choice is to cover their shorts, which involved buying the stock. This pushes the stock price up, which means that for every short bought, the next short's price is even higher. Uh-oh. This creates a cycle called the short-squeeze where the shorts are either margin called into covering, or choose to escape before prices are too high. But there are always losers in this scenario. You might get unlucky and have to cover all your shorts at VERY high prices.\n\nIn short (no pun intended), there is nowhere for shorts to run that doesn't end in disaster. The short-squeeze in this particular case, is highly identifiable, has been highly publicized, and everyone is jumping on board for the wild ride up.\n\nI highly recommend looking up the history of the short-squeezes of these companies. Typically, short-squeezes send stock prices up 300% to 1000% over a span of a few days. Since shorts are constantly buying stock, there's always buyers, and you can sell anywhere up the elevator so-to-speak\n\nThere is a plan to both long GME and short GME. I personally aim to do both--sell off my shares and options during the short-squeeze, and buy back in some when it settles after dropping, because the company does have some significant long-term potential. Estimates believe that GME could be a 10B+ market cap company within the next 2 years, meaning its stock price actually deserves (without any short-squeeze) to be in the 100s or higher.\n\nMost people are planning to play the short game. I'd say 75% are planning to sell during the short-squeeze at some point, but that's mainly due to the many people hopping on board not really knowing much about the company. But many people will stick around afterwards\n\nedit: 920 shares GME, 5x 4/16/21 25c\"", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Where are you getting $65.39 a share.  shows $61.00 a share for me", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Huh 🤔 \nI’m a Brit viewing it through Trading 212.

Big short-squeezes are very rare, but they do happen. They are related to both the interest the one has to pay when borrowing a stock (which we call shorts), and what happens when the stock you are borrowing and hope to sell later for a profit, actually goes up in price. Usually heavily shorted stocks are ones that big companies believe are going out of business, or ones that simply are overvalued. However, sometimes companies turn their outcomes around, and price goes up. The shorts are faced with an option: Either give up and sell for a loss, or wait it out, and hope the growth is temporary or unsustainable. \n\nSome of the biggest short squeezes out there include the VW squeeze in 2008, the Overstock.com squeeze from this year, BlueApron short-squeeze, Tesla short-squeeze, and others. There's not a lot though, they are highly irregular.\n\nIf by 'unprecedented', you mean rare, then I'd rate a short-squeeze as being a 10 for super-rare. If you are talking about how likely it is to spot one coming, from 1 being impossible to tell they are coming to 10 being easy to spot, I'd rate it a 2 or 3. General, short-squeezes happen very quickly, and out of the blue.\n\nThere have been a lot more short-squeezes in more recent years with the spread of information quicker. You can just look online and view a company's short interest, or short to float ratio. There are also many places, like Reddit, where the possibilities of short-squeezes can be quickly shared. Two short-squeezes happened just last year, in both Overstock.com and Tesla.\n\nAs for GME, here's the facts. Approximately 130% of the float is shorted. That means that out of all the shares available for trading, all of them have been borrowed and then some through naked short selling. Most shorts have shorted GME at $15 all the way down to nearly zero. So shorts are deeply underwater, and have to pay exorbitant amounts of interest to their brokerages. We're talking millions upon millions of just short-interest now. This is a lot of pressure to do something. They can either hope it goes down REALLY REALLY fast, or short more and push the price down, but that can just exacerbate the problem. Also, at this point in time, there are no shorts even available. Brokerages are getting slammed with buys and theirs no float that short-sellers can get their hands on. Their last choice is to cover their shorts, which involved buying the stock. This pushes the stock price up, which means that for every short bought, the next short's price is even higher. Uh-oh. This creates a cycle called the short-squeeze where the shorts are either margin called into covering, or choose to escape before prices are too high. But there are always losers in this scenario. You might get unlucky and have to cover all your shorts at VERY high prices.\n\nIn short (no pun intended), there is nowhere for shorts to run that doesn't end in disaster. The short-squeeze in this particular case, is highly identifiable, has been highly publicized, and everyone is jumping on board for the wild ride up. \n\nI highly recommend looking up the history of the short-squeezes of these companies. Typically, short-squeezes send stock prices up 300% to 1000% over a span of a few days. Since shorts are constantly buying stock, there's always buyers, and you can sell anywhere up the elevator so-to-speak\n\nThere is a plan to both long GME and short GME. I personally aim to do both--sell off my shares and options during the short-squeeze, and buy back in some when it settles after dropping, because the company does have some significant long-term potential. Estimates believe that GME could be a 10B+ market cap company within the next 2 years, meaning its stock price actually deserves (without any short-squeeze) to be in the 100s or higher.\n\nMost people are planning to play the short game. I'd say 75% are planning to sell during the short-squeeze at some point, but that's mainly due to the many people hopping on board not really knowing much about the company. But many people will stick around afterwards\n\nedit: 920 shares GME, 5x 4/16/21 25c", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "long position, short timespan", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Oh wow.

Look forward to an interesting discussion.\n\nI will probably just start you off here, Steve, in a sense,* we- before we dive into Q&A for the benefit of investors, reengaging with the BlackBerry story, who probably know BlackBerry from a smartphone days more, can we just start with a high-level overview of the business today?\n\nSteve Rai\n\nSure.* Thank you, and pleased to be here today. So, while we don't build phones anymore, we absolutely continue to leverage the strong software and security heritage of the company. Our trusted software platform, which we call Spark, can connect, secure and manage every endpoint in the IoT landscape.\n\nSo, it leverages next-gen threat protection, intelligent security, and provides a single pane of glass to manage the environment. Further, through AI and machine learning, it continues to get smarter and provides excellent return on investment. So, this area represents a $38 billion and growing addressable market.\n\nBeyond securing enterprises, our solutions also enable critical infrastructure such as securing utilities, automotive safety through QNX, which as John will speak to, and securing people through our AtHoc critical event management solution.\n\nWe've got deep credentials which have been hardened in the regulated space. At nearly all of the G20 governments and top 10 global banks as well as the top 9 automotive OEMs, we've got them as customers. Our solutions are equally applicable and provide significant value to enterprises of all sizes.\n\nSo, I believe all this and the strong financial position of the company, of course, sets us up very well to serve the markets that we’re in*. And it plays right into the macro trends that we're seeing, including an ever-increasing mobile and work-from-anywhere workforce, rapid IoT proliferation, and an ever-increasing threat landscape, which, of course, the unprecedented cyberattacks of 2020 underscore, and the evolution of vehicles and smart city infrastructure that John Wall will speak to.\n\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n\nQ - Samik Chatterjee\n\nSo, before I kind of move on to some of the other markets, let's kind of hit on QNX and the inbuilt software offering here. For those who are less familiar with QNX, John, maybe if you can kind of explain what it does, that would be helpful?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely, I'd love to. So, QNX has two, what I would call, foundational products. One is the real-time operating system called Neutrino, and the other is our hypervisor that provides virtualization of CPUs. Both are microkernel-based. These are deeply embedded products that are particularly suited to safety critical applications.\n\nWe've been able to reach the highest level of certifications for both those foundational products in the automotive field, medical and industrial. We've achieved ISO 26262 ASIL D and we've achieved 61508 ASIL C and -- ASIL 3, sorry, which is the highest level of safety. And that means that our products are designed for mission-critical. In automotive, in particular, that means our products are designed for things that control steering, braking, anything that controls the vehicle.\n\nSo, examples of this within automotive is obviously ADAS, which is active safety, digital cockpit, which is a new trend where we are seeing the consolidation of infotainment systems and other in-cabin functions such as digital cockpits, get consolidated to one hardware module and using our virtualization to separate safety and non-safety systems, the infotainment being non-safety. But also in other markets such as MRI scanners for medical, medical robotics, nuclear power plants, oil and gas. So, if you've ever seen a wind turbine on your travels across various parts of the world, more than likely QNX is running in those systems to control the pitch of the blade, which is very important for keeping the system stable. So, those are just a few examples.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. John, you did mention kind of the safety aspect becoming one of the key enablers here. Maybe if you can broadly hit on what are the overall trends in autos and kind of where and how are those impacting QNX's addressable market?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely. So, I mean, I think everybody is aware of the macro trends. We have connectivity. Cars are getting more connected. We have electrification and we have automation, so autonomous drive or levels towards autonomous drive. So, what we're seeing within a vehicle is software is starting to play a bigger and bigger role. There are some studies that say that by 2030, 50% of the vehicle's BOM will be electronics, and of that, 30% would be software.\n\nSo, what we're seeing as a trend is the car today is made up of a lot of what we call ECUs, and these are electronic control units. And these today are typically single function. So, you can think about it in terms of door locks is an ECU, my transmission controller is an ECU, my digital instrument cluster is an ECU, and so on and so on.\n\nSo, what we're starting to see within a car is a consolidation of these ECUs into what we call domain controllers. And domain controllers will handle multiple functions on one module. And these domain controllers are typically high-performance compute platforms. So, when you think of these, you think of Qualcomm, Samsung, NVIDIA, things that would run in your computer or things that would run in your smartphone. And this is a sweet spot for QNX, since the QNX products run on high-performance compute platforms, not on the lower end 8-bit and 16-bit single function ECUs.\n\nNow, as more of these systems migrate to these domain controllers, there's an element of safety that's required because these things are either controlling chassis, they're controlling functions within the vehicle. Outside of the infotainment, most of these modules have a safety function. So, this again is a sweet spot for QNX.\n\nWe saw this trend developing four or five years ago, maybe five* or six years ago. We saw that infotainment was moving more and more to Android, but we also saw that the car was moving towards this grouping of domain controllers. And we knew there would be an opportunity to get more in the vehicle, more software sockets within the vehicle. So, we really started focusing our efforts on safety and security knowing that as the car evolves, we have more opportunities within the vehicle to hit many more modules as opposed to just infotainment, for instance.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. You recently announced BlackBerry IVY, a co-development and co-marketing agreement with AWS. So, how is this different to what QNX is currently doing?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nActually, this is quite different from what QNX has been doing traditionally. So, we announced IVY, which is the intelligent vehicle everywhere. So, IVY is a cloud-connected and cross platform that is multi-OS, multi-cloud, in-car software that allows automakers to access a vehicle sensor data in compliance with safety and security requirements to process that data with updatable code to create new vehicle insights and then share those insights with developers through a consistent and simple in-car API mechanism.\n\nSo, essentially, what we've done here is we've looked at how do we make vehicles look common from an API perspective? How do we access vehicle data in a way that is consistent from car brand to car brand? This is a very tall order, because vehicles are still pretty bespoke as far as their electrical architectures. No two cars from different OEMs look exactly the same. They use different sensors. They have different architectural layouts.\n\nSo, the idea with IVY is to create a middleware, I would say, translator that goes into the vehicle. At the bottom end of IVY, we are talking directly to sensors within the vehicle. But then, we use either machine learning or other processing to normalize that data into what we call synthetic sensors.\n\nAnd as an example that I'd like to you look at is if you think of a smart city and you think of a smart city that wants to know the conditions of their roads during the winter, a synthetic sensor within a vehicle could be a combination of wheel, speed sensor, antilock brake sensor, temperature sensor and potential camera input. And with those four sensors, you could normalize the data into a synthetic sensor that would allow the smart city to know, do I have an icing condition? Do I have cars slipping in a certain part of my route?\n\nNow, imagine the power of this, if the way to access that data was consistent from carmaker to carmaker. So, the real power behind IVY is to make sure that we grow an ecosystem that allows scale and allows app developers to create common applications, smart cities to access common data across different car brands. And so, the idea here is to ensure that the carmakers have the best ability to monetize their data or to save money by being able to do things like analytics of how their cars are behaving on the road. The idea is to grow an ecosystem that will become a de facto standard in the industry.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nWhat is the level of commitment that it slightly* brings to this, particularly -- I mean, obviously, I'm guessing investors will be looking at what’s the level of commitment of AWS to this?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nRight. So, it's a 50-50 joint development. And something I didn't stress enough in the last question, just to be clear, this is OS and cloud agnostic. No dependency on AWS cloud and no dependency on QNX. This is truly a generic piece of middleware to create this ecosystem. So, obviously, we're doing development on QNX. We expect QNX to be the high runner within the vehicle because of our dominant position in the car. I mean, this is part of the reason that AWS is very interested in working with us.\n\nWe have a very good pedigree. We're in over 175 million cars. We've been doing this. This is our bread and butter as working within the vehicle. We have exceptional record of delivery. We've never held up a start-up production, and we have very, very strong relationships with the top automakers.\n\nNow, obviously, AWS is a leading cloud provider. They're an unrivaled provider of ML tools. So, they have a lot of the data expertise to do analysis of the data to create these synthetic sensors. And first and foremost, they're a massive company that has the ability to drive an app ecosystem.\n\nFrom a commitment perspective, it's -- as I mentioned earlier, it's a 50-50 development. This type of a relationship with Amazon is very rare. They do this with customers. They don't typically do this with partners. I think, we have a very, very strong alignment on the direction of IVY with the exact same goals, and that's to drive this ecosystem and to provide an app ecosystem within the vehicle and off the vehicle that is common across OEMs and brands. And I think that is really the thread that binds us.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIf I kind of think back almost like three, four years ago, I do kind of remember some start-up companies, private companies that were trying to harmonize the data across coming from different vehicles. So, are companies already doing this? Why would IVY be different on this front?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. That's a great question, and there are lots of companies doing this. This is -- we haven't invented anything new here. Carmakers are very interested in monetizing their data. They know there's a lot of value in their data, especially as the car continues to evolve towards autonomous drive and active safety, lots of sensors within the vehicle, one of the most complex IoT endpoints. So, they know there's a lot of value in their data.\n\nI think, the challenge has been, each carmaker is creating a bespoke solution, and there's really no scale to it. And since there is no scale or very little scale, it creates I think a challenge to really get application developers out there ideating on what the next big thing could be. I think, you'd like to be able to see the ability to leverage the ecosystem from the phone. Lots of people have great ideas out there. And I think the more people that have the ability to access this ecosystem, the more great ideas the carmakers will get.\n\nI think, the other challenge with some of the bigger players in this area has been ownership of the data. So, from -- right from the beginning, BlackBerry and Amazon have made it very clear. We have no desire to own the data and we have no desire to control the data. That's solely in the hands of the OEM. And that's really not an area that we're looking to get involved. The real purpose of this collaboration is to create that de facto ecosystem that will really get the ecosystem out there, developing ideas and applications that are going to be cool for the car.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSo, I have like almost 15 questions here, and since I have 15 minutes remaining, let me start tackling some of them. So, let me start with the ones that relate to IVY. A couple of similar ones. What do you think the TAM is that IVY will open up for carmakers? And on similar lines, there is a question which is -- give me one -- yes, when do you intend to provide tangible color around the commercial opportunity that IVY represents? So, I'll let you guys tackle those two together.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nSteve, do you want to take that?\n\nSteve Rai\n\nYes, I'll start. So, the first vehicles to have IVY are expected to come out in 2023. So naturally, leading up to that time, we expect to be engaged with the OEMs and potentially with Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers working on this and generating professional services revenues along the way. We're targeting a subscription or usage-based model, in other words, building a recurring revenue stream. And so, that's sort of the time frame I think to address that part of the theme.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nTwo follow-up questions on IVY and more related to automakers. So, again, I'll just combine them for everyone's benefit here. Is BlackBerry QNX or IVY going to be in the new vehicles that NVIDIA and NIO will be working on together? The second question on similar lines is IVY something Tesla will consider?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. Those are great questions. Obviously, I think, everybody -- I think, most people know we have a very strong relationship with NVIDIA as we announced a few years ago that QNX is the foundational OS of their DRIVE OS offering. I don't know that we can make any comments at the moment about specific OEMs as we made the announcement on December 1st. What I can say is the reaction by OEMs to the announcement has been overwhelming. We've already had a workshop with one OEM prior to Christmas.\n\nSo, there is a lot of excitement about the ability to create this ecosystem. When people think about the ecosystem in the past, they've thought about, well, the carmakers are going to have to get together, they're going to have to create a kind of a unified architecture for the vehicles to be able to create this ecosystem. Try to think of it kind of in terms of iOS or Android -- not iOS or Android, but something like that, but that's appropriate to the automobile. This is kind of really taking -- this is really looking to take a shortcut and really create that app ecosystem before the car makers have had the ability to necessarily unify their architectures.\n\nTo the point of Tesla, Tesla could definitely be a customer of this.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nOkay. Is it possible to implement back into the captive market of 175 million QNX current users? So, I'm guessing they are -- it's asking about IVY. So, is it -- yes, so is it possible to implement IVY back into the captive market of QNX users?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nAbsolutely. I mean that’s -- in a lot of cases, that's the intent. There are very few carmakers that we are not working with, especially today when we look at our move towards more of safety software within more modules within the vehicle, especially when it comes to ADAS, autonomous drive, chassis control, digital cockpit. We're very dominant in the digital cockpit market. So, I believe that, that's obviously going to be the case, but I also think it's going to open up new customers. And I mean, that's a very strong reason why we made this OS independent and cloud agnostic is we wanted to address our current customers, but we also wanted to address carmakers that are not our customers that are running different operating systems or have different architectures or have different cloud solutions. We wanted this to go to our existing customers and to open up new customers.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGot it. A ton of new questions on QNX, but before I get to that, one question that came in is the patents for sale, which kind of coincides with a news release, I think I saw saying that BlackBerry’s selling to 90 patents to Huawei. And I'll just give you an opportunity to answer that question as well as comment in terms of anything that's been announced recently.\n\nSteve Rai\n\nSo, if that question is referring to what has been in the press in terms of some of the broader rumors about the portfolio, I'm not going to comment on those rumors. Regarding Huawei, there was a very small number of patents that are no longer relevant to the business. So, small sale, not part of our recurring transaction. And certainly, it was permitted under the applicable rules. So that's it.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nSo, moving to QNX, let me take this one. Could you outline the content per vehicle opportunity for QNX on an EV and separately on AV? And if you don't want to give dollar per car, could you suggest the number of QNX RTOS, I apologize, I don't know the acronym and hypervisor installs for EV and AV versus internal combustion engine vehicles. So, essentially, I think, in a nutshell content for vehicle for QNX on EV and AV separately?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nYes. I don't know that I really look at them all that separately. One has a battery manager, one has an engine controller. I think -- so I'll try to answer it more generally speaking, and then I will make a comment to EVs. So, generally speaking, the ability for QNX to be used in more places within the vehicle is what drove our decision to focus on safety.\n\nTraditionally, if you look back at where QNX was playing in automotive 10 years ago, the opportunity was typically a telematics box, an OnStar or an infotainment unit. And at the time, we were very dominant in infotainment and in telematics. If you -- so you kind of add two potential sockets there that we were fighting for, and for the most reason, those were the most -- those were the two high-performance compute platforms with telematics box and the infotainment box. I think as we see this consolidation of ECU to domain controllers, the opportunity has gone up dramatically. You have domain controllers that are handling gateway. So, you have a gateway functionality within the vehicle, you can do that almost like a router, that's going to manage safety systems and non-safety systems within the vehicle, the different buses. You have chassis controllers, you have ADAS controllers, you autonomous drive controllers. You have the digital cockpit, which is probably the first consolidation that's been happening within the vehicle, where we're taking cabin functions such as digital instrument cluster and infotainment and merging that onto one high-performance compute platform, using our hypervisor.\n\nSo, I think, without actually throwing out numbers, as far as the dollar amount, from an opportunity within the vehicle, there is definitely going from 2 or 3 opportunities to 5 or 6 or 7 opportunities within the vehicle. To us with IVY is just one more, a different function.\n\nNow, having said that, from an EV perspective, I think we put a status during earnings before Christmas that I believe we're in 19 of 25 of the top EV producers and that we have a 61% market share of working with EV customers. And one of the reasons that EV is interesting is in a lot of cases, it's clean sheet. They're starting with new architectures, and they're able to move to these new domain controller type architectures more quickly.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIs Automotive Grade Linux a strong competitive threat? Who is the most significant competitive threat in terms of the auto ecosystem? And how is QNX superior to these over time?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nRight. So, I would say that we have two groupings of competitors. We have the traditional under-the-hood safety-based operating systems. And those are Green Hills and Wind River. Green Hills is very well-known in aerospace and defense, and so is Wind River. I think, we've been quite successful against those two.\n\nAnd then, on the other side of the spectrum coming more from consumer side and coming more from high-performance compute platform, you have Linux in all forms, whether it's AGL or Ubuntu or something else. It doesn't really matter.\n\nNow, the advantage that QNX has over Linux is that those Linux distributions are not safety certified. Safety certification is a lot of work. It's very hard to achieve. It's especially hard to achieve when you look at a product like Linux that -- part of the beauty of Linux as it moves very fast, and it's contributed to by the community. But that's also -- it's Achilles’ heel when it comes to safety because safety requires due diligence around safety cases, design, knowing the providence of where the software came from, a lot of testing, a lot of impact analysis.\n\nSo I mean, our view is we take all the competition seriously. And we're just trying to continue to push our product forward to be better performance and a higher level of safety against all our competitors. And we believe that will help keep us in the lead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nIn the couple of minutes we have remaining, let's take a couple of questions on IVY here. First question, and I’ll again kind of club them together. How will the IVY app store ecosystem be monetized? And then, a second question, can you talk about the dollar investment and the time investment, how are you splitting that as it relates to development of IVY?\n\nJohn Wall\n\nI'll answer the second piece first. As I mentioned earlier, it's a 50-50 investment by both, Amazon and BlackBerry. It's a significant investment. But, we're not providing any numbers. But, there is a significant investment in doing this.\n\nAs far as monetizing from the OEMs and the app store and how that's going to look, we're just starting to have those conversations with the OEMs. I don't know that we have a clear picture on this. Based on the discussions we've had with the OEMS, we know there's a lot of value there. And the idea of providing a more comprehensive and more standardized SDK and API across car brands is only going to make that more valuable. But, we haven't gotten into all the nuts and bolts of what this is going to look like, except that we know that the OEM is going to control the data, and it's going to control the access to the data.\n\n**Samik Chatterjee\n**\nOkay. Last one, let me squeeze this one in. Where do you see the biggest catalyst for your loyal shareholders?\n\n**Steve Rai\n**\nWell, I think, the trends that I spoke to in my opening comments are really what position -- all of the Company's technology, the way that it's come together and the drivers that we have play in very directly to these trends, and the trends being proliferation of IoT, security, all of the concepts that John described in the auto sector as well as the general embedded space. And those are things that the Company is just ideally suited for in terms of the expertise and the solutions that we have.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nGreat. That's all we have time for. Steve and John, thank you both for taking the time to attend the conference. And it was a pleasure hosting you and great discussion. Thank you.\n\nSteve Rai\n\nThank you, Samik.\n\nJohn Wall\n\nThank you very much.\n\n🚀\n🚀\n🚀\n🚀", "id": "l3nxjh", "created_utc": 1611446516.0, "score": 644, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "bro everyone in here has attention deficit and you just wrote a 1000 pages novel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nplease give me a tldr with some emojis or somthing", "score": 347, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "score": 125, "replies": []}, {"body": "Somebody create a calculator that converts text into emojis", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Tldr: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🐂🐂🐂🐂", "score": 43, "replies": []}, {"body": "He didnt write it dumbass it was a transcript", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "A transcript lacking a TL;DR or emojis.\n\nI only react to colourful emojis, especially rockets.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "!emojify", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "$APPS", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Can you chill out you retard I can't read", "score": 110, "replies": [{"body": "Omfg.

{"title": "BB DD Bull case 100x by 2030", "selftext": "Retard TLDR:\n\nBlackBerry IVY is like the browser, it unlocks a shit ton of monetization opportunities. BB 100x by 2030. 🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nIVY is the upcoming vehicle data platform built by BB with AWS providing the infrastructure.\n\nAccording the McKinsey, potential revenue generated by car data will reach 450-750B by 2030. This was written back in 2016 so I'd say this estimate should be at least 50% higher. Thanks JPOW.\n\nI think by 2030, BB will have this sector BY THE BALLS. BB QNX is already in cars manufactured by TOYOTA, HONDA, GM, FORD, MERCEDES-BENZ, VW GROUP, BMW, HYUNDAI, MASERATI (FCA, Now STELLANTIS), JAGUAR (TATA MOTORS). That's literally ALL of the major car companies in the world. By having an existing business relationship with them BB will take them to bed and make sweet love to them with their IVY dildo.\n\nIf you look at current \"platform\" revenue models from VISA to AAPL, the platform can take in anywhere from 2.5% to 30% of the revenue. Given a 50% market share and 15% revenue share that would be 50B revenue a year for BB. Thats ONLY from cars. They can expand the data platform to other embedded platforms like... anything you fucking want. By 2030 Starbucks' coffee cup's gonna be an embedded system.\n\nRisks:\n\nCar companies are known fuck ups. They fucking suck at everything, even making cars. Hopefully they invest enough to build something meaningful on top of IVY.\n\nPosition: 300 shares, various calls.\n\nBuying more shares on Monday. probably $10-15K total.\n\nMcKinsey article \nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive%20and%20assembly/our%20insights/monetizing%20car%20data/monetizing-car-data.ashx", "id": "l3o334", "created_utc": 1611447008.0, "score": 835, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 177, "comments": [{"body": "Bro.. 2030 for 100x??

Gamestop has received an incredible amount of free advertising over the past few months - this will only continue with the squeeze and feels similar to the free advertising for Tesla by resident meme lord Elon. I took a look at google trends but it doesn't work like robinhood with the green and red and so I couldn't read if it's up or down (**If anyone is in marketing or some shit and has any good ideas for getting a rough value for impressions created in the past months please share**)\n3. Reversal of the negative GME stigma - I know we all got fucked out of our used games with shitty prices once upon a time and that kind of badwill is something a lot of bears bring up. With the amount of retail investors in gme, I think this has been more than counteracted by the good vibes of riding a rocket to the moon and taking out the big bad hedgies. I've personally converted at least my family from buying gaming shit from big box stores by getting them a pro membership and showing how they will undoubtably save money. **This will 10x with RC's focus on the customer's experience over all else.**\n\nTLDR: Bears going extinct, GME to continue up bigly, we should all calm the fuck down and wait patiently for RC to use that big stick of his and act like we've been here before.\n\nEdit: One last thought, I keep seeing people talk about current price and what if big guys get out etc. and I was definitely worried about this for a while when gme was hovering around 20. I read something though and am now more confident at 60 than I was then - This long/short battle feels like a zero-sum game and investors love The Art of War, Meditations, etc. - Essentially this is war and the big guys feel they have other guys bent over a barrel in addition to what I believe is a good-to-great growth turnaround story and chance by RC and crew", "id": "l3ore9", "created_utc": 1611449259.0, "score": 549, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "I wager that massive +70% spike reported all over the press brings a few fresh shorts to exploit.\n\nNext report on %shorts and holdings comes at the end of this week.

Let me play devil’s advocate and look at two direct subsidies and also an overall picture of the situation,\nFour points in all:\n\n1. Intangible drilling costs. O&G company has to pay per hour for a rig to be in their location drilling. They deduct this expense from their taxable amount. This acts as a deducted expense just like other industries.\n\n2. Depletion: They buy/lease an asset (piece of land) that has hydrocarbon reserves. When they extract hydrocarbons and pay their expenses, they deduct the amount they extracted from their asset base. Another example of this is how you can depreciate the value of your heavy equipment as a construction company, or write off depreciation on a rental property over time. It’s called something else, but it’s the same as almost every other industry. (Tesla depreciates the equipment in their factories.)\n\n3. When an oil company writes things off, they make more profit. When the make more profit, other companies begin to compete, driving the price down. We all save money on heating our homes and driving to work because oil companies extract more hydrocarbons for less.\n\n4. The US government heavily subsidizes agriculture because it’s a good thing, but they also want the US to be able to feed itself in dire situations like war. It’s the same for oil. If we produced no oil, another nation could simply cut off the supply chain being shipped into the country and take over in a week. It’s a national security concern.\n\nSummary: The tax subsidies first and foremost are far, far, far below 50%, the number isn’t comparable. Other industries are subsidized in identical ways, but those subsidies have their own special names. The burning of fossil fuels absolutely has negative externalities but it has massive positive externalities as well which are often overlooked.\n\nI’m sharing that just for a new perspective, not trying to start an argument or anything.", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "This is a myth.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Or when government subsidizes student education! \n\nOh wait... nvm", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It bothers me so much.

Her break-even owning 3 call options vs 100 shares is probably close to 875 from my back-of-napkin calculations.

It's a different approach - they're solving the much harder, but more lucrative problem of general FSD with no geofencing only using cameras and some radar. Waymo is solving the easier problem of highly focused FSD with extremely detailed maps, expensive lidar, and expensive teleoperators. \n\nTesla went and crowdsourced FSD essentially, as every single one of their cars on the road gathers real world mile data to train their AI with - 15 billion miles last I looked. They did it more with offering early access FSD, which records every single correction a driver makes. They're doing it again with FSD beta. And they haven't even applied their new Dojo AI to FSD yet to achieve the march of nines - that increment of \"its 99% safe.\" 99.9 percent. 99.999 percent, etc. \n\nAnd Tesla vs Waymo is nowhere near the same amount of value.

The reality is nobody except Tesla makes money on EVs mostly because nobody except Tesla can sell you a cabin with zero stuff in it and have it come off as futuristic instead of cheap. There's simply less stuff in the cabin. The model 3 takes this to an extreme. The other part is Tesla has a very good EV platform which does a lot to reduce costs which can make or break a profit on EVs. Combustion vehicle start at a few thousand dollar advantage though just due to drivetrain costs being insane for EVs compared to combustion.\n\nThe reality is that the margins at mass market pricing are not there. Realistically Tesla has pulled luxury car buyers who plunk dowb $45k-$70k on a sedan. But this market is limited in size. I suspect we will see Teslas growth slow down for this reason unless they can continue to break into lower price brackets.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You dont need to believe them. Watch the YouTube video I linked, or just google FSD beta 10. I expect I'll get FSD in a month or so just from watching the videos. \n\nCabin has nothing to do with Tesla's margins. This does. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giga_Press theres also teardowns by Sandy Munro - he's st the beginning of one on the 2021 model 3 - that take apart the car to see how their manufacturing is done. \n\nNot only that, but Tesla is producing batteries at volume and continually pushing that manufacturing price down as well, while making the batteries themselves better. \n\nThey could very easily lower car prices, and they have, a bit. Tesla's main issue preventing it from offering a 25k car right now is that it doesn't have the manufacturing capacity to keep up with the kind of demand that would incur. You already have to wait 2 months for a Model 3, people would get angry if that wait became years. Of course, they have multiple factories set to come online this year, so I expect the 25k car soon. Next year maybe, 2023 definitely. \n\nGrowth and demand are beyond not a problem. \n\nPotential problem I see is the Cybertruck running into unforeseen manufacturing issues - Cybertruck manufacturing is wildly different enough from the rest that there is likely to be a screw up or two. Last time someone produced an exoskeleton car was the Delorean.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Eh.... Tesla has been delivering vehicles with dents, unfinished interiors etc. I don't think they've perfected the other cars either. I've seen Sandy's teardown and the drive.\n\nIt's good but the issue is not doing it once for FSD it's doing it 10s of billions of times without issue. I have seen autopilot drift across a double yellow before. If you want it to be FSD it  CANNOT do that. Maybe once every 100 trillion miles.\n\nIt just be safer than a person. Also autopilot systems even in planes suffer from the issue of delayed human reaction. A person often takes far longer to react to an errant autopilot than their reaction time while just driving themselves. This means anything requiring human monitoring is inherently a flawed solution and eventually will result in accidents. In aviation this is solved with redundancy, training, checklists etc. In a car there's not enough time to solve the issue. You don't have 30k feet to plummet before you die.\n\nAlso I'm well aware of Elon's claims that autopilot is safer than drivers. There is however the issue in his claim of selection bias in data. Autopilot is more likely to be enabled on interstates etc where you can travel more miles without incident even as a human. IE autopilot is enabled most often in conditions that are less likely to cause a crash. There are many more confounding factors that can be argued one way or another but this is one way Tesla biases data to paint the picture it wants.\n\nNext the sparta interior is 100% a result of cost savings. If audi launched a car with that interior they'd get laughed out of the room. The chassis is not the interior. That's the structural component. Also I'm mixed on their manufacturing. It seems like a good idea, but I can't be sure as I'm not familiar enough with per unit costs on the chassis on a traditional car let alone Tesla's novel approach. Their tooling must be quite expensive though and I suspect the reason it works out is volume. Note that their approach though will not work well for a work truck for example. Body on frame is inherently superior there as rigidity can be your enemy when it comes to repeatedly loading 10k+ lbs onto the frame. Fractures etc. However for regular cars, seems quite brilliant on the surface but I just don't know enough to say exactly how brilliant.\n\nI still don't understand how the cybertruck will pass pedestrian crash safety. Exoskeleton card also might result in some very very hard crashes at low speeds. It needs to be rigid and crumple. Not exactly easy to accomplish but if anyone will get it done it's probably Tesla.\n\nLastly the $25k claim. I know it's been said they can turn a profit on cars at that price but I am not convinced Sandy is right. Also that's a 200 mile car without autopilot. Seems like a lot less reason to buy a Tesla at that point. Also incentives are gone. There's no cluster. I like some button controls, they're just easier to use while driving. And lastly I regularly do 300+ miles in a day and I'm not interested in waiting at any supercharger.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Because it acts like owning the actual stock outright, with less risk.

It also has a huge float of 2 billion shares. It's moving up slowly, but it will never moon, it will always be a $1-2 a month type thing.

{"title": "Positive Steel News - MT, CLF, VALE, etc.", "selftext": "So I'm on the steel train and these past couple of weeks have sucked, but a bunch of news came out today regarding the increases in steel and iron prices and how that's impacting the market. This news may give us a peek into the kind of shit we might see when the steel players we follow start reporting from next week into February. Sharing this here as a lot of the steel info exists on another subreddit now. So this is for any of the stragglers still here.  In recent days (not covered in this post) we saw [Tata Steel post awesome results](https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/tata-arm-show-hints-at-sunny-days-in-steel/cid/1803856) for one of their subsidiaries as well as Jindal Steel & Power report a 29% increase in revenue along with their [highest ever steel production volumes](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/jindal-steel-and-power-q3-results-posts-profit-of-rs-2432-crore-revenue-up-39-25/ar-BB1cXpps).\n\nOne of the biggest highlights in the news today for me was that **the world's fifth-largest steelmaker**, Posco, is estimated to have logged **double digit operating profit growth for the fourth quarter**. This is with them needing to absorb the iron ore costs. Remember that ArcelorMittal (MT), the world's largest steel manufacturer, doesn't experience this issue at the same magnitude (they provide 50% of their own iron ore). Nothing is certain, but that tells me to expect better than expected results from MT earnings that will surprise Wall Street.\n\nThe iron ore input cost angle continues to bolster the case for integrated players MT, Vale, CLF. As noted, they can widen their margins and even offer competitive pricing if they'd like due to providing a lot of their own raw materials.\n\nSomething that I'm mildly concerned about and watching is the push for steel price regulation which is happening in [India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/will-use-alternatives-nitin-gadkari-warns-steel-cartel-on-price-hike/articleshow/80428821.cms) and [Malaysia](https://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news/165251/after-mco-prices-of-materials-have-gone-sky-high-complain-builders/). In New Delhi the road transport and highways minister is threatening to use synthetic and composite fiber bars in place of steel for roads and bridges. The argument being that steel industry is inflating prices despite mining their own iron ore and therefor don't have higher input costs. Curious to see how far that goes.\n\nMy positions: MT (Calls June $25-$35, Sept $24-$32 \\[added this week\\], Commons), VALE (March $21)\n\n\\---\n\n**Posco, the world's fifth-largest steelmaker by output, is expected to have logged double-digit operating profit growth in the fourth quarter.** [Link](http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210124000086)\n\n>Posco is estimated to have posted an operating profit of 838.3 billion won ($760.1 million) in the fourth quarter, up 50.3 percent from a year earlier, according to a median forecast of market research firm FnGuide.  \n>  \n>The quarterly results reflect a quick recovery of steel demand amid short supplies in the United States and Europe and a hike in steel prices, analysts said.  \n>  \n>Posco's quarterly results also \"got a boost from increased demand for steel in China,\" Park Hyun-wook, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Investment & Securities Co., said in a research note.  \n>  \n>Looking ahead, Kim Hyun-wook, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp., said Posco could enjoy the effects of a price hike of its steel products, noting a spike in raw material costs could lead to an increase in Posco's steel prices.  \n>  \n>A spike in raw material costs can weigh on Posco, but the company can increase prices of its steel products amid strong demand, which could help improve the steelmakers' bottom line.\n\n**Tata Motors is passing on the cost of input costs to their customers placing orders past 1/21/21 calling out steel costs as a major reason. Demand for vehicles continue to rise.** [Link](https://www.drivespark.com/four-wheelers/2021/tata-cars-price-hike-announced-for-all-models-new-price-list-effective-date-details/articlecontent-pf134171-033441.html)\n\n>Steel, which is a major component in the process of automotive manufacturing, has increased substantially in pricing over the past few months in the country. This is because of the rising domestic demand and iron ore prices, higher international prices and subdued production and limited imports. As a result, it could be among the key factors for automakers announcing a price hike on its entire model range.  \n>  \n>Despite the current market conditions, Tata Motors has seen a significant increase in its demand for its passenger vehicle range. The sales of its cars grew by 39 per cent in the first three quarters of the current financial year as compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year.\n\n**JSW Steel’s net profit jumps** ***14 times*** **to Rs 2,669 crore backed by a strong recovery in steel demand for the three months of October-December** [Link](https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/news/jsw-steel-s-net-profit-jumps-14-times-to-rs-2669-crore/ar-BB1d0CDZ)\n\n>\"Various high frequency economic indicators are better than the initial expectations pointing to a robust recovery. Growth in passenger vehicles and motorcycle sales, railway freight traffic, and electricity consumption is also strong,\" the company said in a statement.  \n>  \n>The company r**ecorded highest ever quarterly sales** of flat products, propelled by strong demand of coated products. Automotive steel sales increased by 57% y-o-y, while India's domestic automotive production grew by 16% y-o-y. Consequently, exports were much lower during the quarter. Overall value added and special products sales were up 12% y-o-y, making up 57% of overall sales versus 51% in Q2FY21. This was mainly driven by robust automotive sales and increased off-take from industrial and engineering, solar and appliances segment.\n\n**Port of Duluth-Superior saw December and January tonnage topping the previous season** ***significantly***\\*\\* [Link](https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/other/pounded-by-the-pandemic-duluth-shipping-seeks-rebound-in-2021/ar-BB1d0Kdh)\n\n>The season \"will be remembered for early promise crushed by coronavirus, but the late-season rally was encouraging,\" said Jayson Hron, spokesman for the Duluth Seaway Port Authority. \"**December and January tonnage topped the previous season — significantly**, in January's case — and **with mines reopening, steel demand rising** and COVID vaccinations beginning, it hints at hope for 2021.\"\n\n**Malaysian contractors are asking the government to step in and try to regulate material pricing. Steel prices were called out among others.** [Link](https://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news/165251/after-mco-prices-of-materials-have-gone-sky-high-complain-builders/)\n\n>Md Nasir Ibrahim, chairman of the Guild of Bumiputra Contractors Bhd, said that steel in particular had increased in price by nearly 40% in the last six weeks up to nearly RM3,000 a tonne.  \n>  \n>He urged the government to “interfere” by controlling the prices of these products and penalising suppliers who take part in unethical price manipulation.  \n>  \n>This was echoed by the Master Builders Association of Malaysia, who said price increases are particularly damaging to smaller stakeholders, who may not have predicted the cost of adhering to Covid-19 standard operating procedures, like testing workers and operating with a limited workforce.  \n>  \n>“The government should implement strict control over prices of construction materials to prevent cartels and monopolies taking advantage of these,” it said.  \n>  \n>It further suggested that it be made mandatory for a price variation clause to be included in all contracts to account for fluctuations in material costs.\n\n**US steel buyers continue to struggle to find materials. Some folks think the price is going to correct in May, some folks don’t. Lack of supply is opening door for imports.** [Link](https://www.metalbulletin.com/Article/3971961/Carbon-steel/US-hot-rolled-coil-index-edges-lower-tightness-continues.html)\n\n>Sources reported that there was still a shortage of spot material, with some distributors and consumers able to purchase only a fraction of the material they need. The surge in prices and lack of supply are opening the door for imports, some respondents said.  \n>  \n>Split between those projecting that the rally is coming to an end and others expecting prices to climb further. Respondents who think the rally has run its course pointed to weakness in the ferrous scrap market and a decline in Chinese flat-rolled prices. Sources who anticipate additional price increases were focused on tight supply, and did not see any indications that the situation will change during the first quarter.\n\n**China iron ore edges higher on supply concerns.

However, I personally can't take the risk of buying calls or even holding GME long (a few days ago I bought at $37 and sold at $39), or any ONE company for that matter. I understand the bear case as well (even if I don't \\*currently\\* agree with it). Every company has a bear case. Even Amazon.\n\nI started in December 2020 with exactly $20,000.

You'll never pay taxes again. Yes, it's true. If you need money at any time, you will only pay a 10% penalty to withdraw it, still way lower than tax rates.\n\nThe biggest battle is discipline when daytrading. The rules Vapes lists are very good if you can stick to them.

If I lose I lose, but it's a **very** good bet.\n\nOn Thursday, I saw that all consumer goods stocks were down 0.5-2%. When PG hit (if I remember correctly) -1.5% down at $1.60 (at around 11:45AM EST, maybe a little before that), I bought in 260 shares. Saw an almost immediate pop and sold at $131 for a 40 cent gain. If I held longer, I could have made a $1 gain per share, but remember - I'm textbook scalping and didn't want to risk another downturn back to my entry point since it was a down day. I knew at that point (at $131.60, down 1.5% on the day in the middle of the day on low volume) that it would pop a quarter to a half of a percent. If it dipped, I would have held unless it went more than down 2%. It had already dipped eight-tenths of a percent from the open and was down 1.9% from the high of the day before...all when PG released phenomenal numbers. Unlikely it crashes more than that during the day. They may run lower over the next few months (maybe, maybe not) but during the day?

Right now, and why people are happy buying at any level/thinking they’ll see a ridiculously high and quick return is because of a speculated short squeeze. \n\nWhy do people think a short squeeze is on the horizon? Because the shorters have been far too over confident in their plays to the point that they’ve created a pretty dangerous situation for themselves. That being that far too many naked short positions have been created on the stock, to the point that they have been running out of shares to borrow to create new positions (so they can’t force the SP down either to try get themselves out of this predicament). So as soon as they’re called upon to close their positions they’ll be forced to buy whatever they can on market. And this is where the other side comes in with everyone telling each other to sell at a much higher price. Since for as long as there is still a shorter that needs to close their position but has yet to do so, they’ll need to buy whatever is available to them. So if no one is willing to sell their shares but only at $100’s above current price then bad luck but the shorters will need to pay. After that point it will inevitably fall right back down, as legitimate investors (those that are long on the stock) aren’t going to buy at crazy high levels, maybe some traders might but fuck that would be risky as hell. Although you probably will see some mom & pop retail investors get burnt if they get FOMO and aren’t aware of what’s actually going on.  \n\nNow this isn’t a risk free strategy by any means (so as always don’t put in more than you’re comfortable losing). Some big risks here are things like assuming the shorters haven’t been closing positions along the ride up (though from how many shares were shorted there would still be lots still waiting to be closed), or if the company decides to issue a whole bunch of shares (if I owned shares I’d be contacting the CEO and board and seeing if they have any thoughts about raising at current levels, they obviously won’t tell you exactly but you might be able to gauge what their sentiment is, in addition to reading over past announcements and seeing how many shares have been previously voted for placement - basically whether they need to request a vote or not on issuing a certain amount of shares), or if people paper hands and sell off well before the squeeze, or if a squeeze does occur whether you’re able to get your sell in before shorts have been closed (for instance how much of the stock is owned by people that aren’t on wsb or might not even realise what’s going on). For the first issue (shorters already closing their positions) I doubt it’s been done yet, since one thing (aside from there being too many) that’s kind of still telling is you still have them talking shit and trying to encourage behaviours that would work in their favour (Andrew Left was telling people if they want to save GME to not buy the stock but rather go buy from the store itself, while that would help GME it would also help the shorters as they only care where the SP is at). Whereas if they’ve had to close and have realised a massive loss we’d probably expect to see them to start complaining that it’s unfair/this was manipulation or maybe even dishing out some lawsuits. \n\nAlso as a side note there’s been talk about a gamma squeeze too, which we may have had/may still have some more legway.

Welcome to the casino.\n\ntl;dr QNX is not high-tech, isn't primed for crazy growth and isn't something that can milk a monopoly position.  🌈🐻 \n\nThe retards with their bullish DD for $BB are getting off on explaining RTOS, the impenetrable security, the moat of standards, QNX's usage count, the EV & autonomous car revolution, and IVY. All of these points are weak and don't combine to create a strong bundle of sticks.  \n\n**RTOS**  \nStop throwing around the term RTOS like it's magic. An RTOS is just OS that lets tasks ask to be run within a certain time. Engineering students spin up basic RTOSs in half-semester courses. Sure QNX is going to be vastly more complicated than a student project, but stop throwing around \"RTOS\" like it's secret tech.\n\n**\"It's so secure!\"**  \nKnown vulnerability counts of a software can be low for non-flattering reasons: the software is not open-source, no-one cares to hack it, there arn't many features and the software doesn't change fast. I think that the autonomous and EV progress will increase scrutiny of automotive software and we will start to see some QNX bugs. In addition, the pressure on QNX to start adding features faster will also bring some bugs. Random speculation: I bet that there are some zero-day vulnerabilities of QNX known to organizations like the NSA.\n\n**\"But QNX has a moat! Look at all these safety standards.\"**  \nThese safely standards are a shitty moat that will backfire. \nIn general, I think safety standards for software are a joke. Check out this [PDF guide to ISO 26262](https://www.feabhas.com/sites/default/files/2016-06/A%20quick%20guide%20to%20ISO%2026262%5B1%5D_0_0.pdf). The standard focus on, among other things, to \"use style guides\" and \"use naming convection\" and \"restrict coupling between software components\". The whole standard seems like a joke.\n\nOne illuminating document I found titled \"Tesla comments on the cyber security regulation interpretation document\" ([source](https://globalautoregs.com/participants/409-tesla)) is Tesla making recommendations on how to update the W.29 standards. It has the following passage:\n\n> \"We believe the current regulations and interpretations extensively consider the context of a traditional OEM \"model-year\" release rate, but do not factor in the perspective of a company that releases software at a faster rate than once or twice per year - similar to the model used by every other modern internet-connected consumer device. The current regulations and interpretations do not fully consider the overhead introduced to a manufacturer that releases software at a frequent pace. We believe is the direction the entire industry will move in, especially to address security and safety considerations. Any requirement to submit documentation, or wait for approval, for every individual software release will compromise velocity and agility; and works against the goals of a cyber security strategy. The regulation should be designed so it is based on evaluation of the manufacturer's internal processes, appropriate records of activities, and trust between manufacturers and authorities.\"\n\nClaims that Tesla is having difficulty passing these standards carry truth but are misguided; the standards are archaic and don't fit with modern software development and Tesla is contributing to these standards being rewritten. \n\n**\"Look at the 175 million vehicles using QNX!\"**  \nIs this an argument for growth or for a monopoly? An argument for growth shouldn't be \"QNX already has a large % market penetration\". In comparison, the growth argument for EVs and self-driving cars is that there are hardly any now, and in 30 years most cars will be EVs with self-driving capabilities. If QNX has X% of the market now, I need evidence for why this will grow. Instead, if you are arguing that QNX has a monopoly, this also seems flawed. A quick google finds other companies have automotive platforms, such as GreenHills software which claims also to be \"Proven in Hundreds of Millions of Vehicles\" and also meets the standards such as ISO 26262. \n\nI'm pretty sure nearly every car released in the last 20 years runs an OS of some sort. It's used to run tasks like like controlling the breaks, turning on your window wipers, lights, sound etc. RTOS is already a fundamental requirement of cars. Saying things like \"EVs and self-driving cars means BB to the moon\" is like saying we should invest in air bag companies because of strong growth of EVs and self-driving cars.\n\n**BlackBerry IVY**  \nI don't get how this is huge news. The press release is vague on the details.  What actually is BlackBerry contributing here? What does BlackBerry get? 50/50 of what? Amazon wants everyone using AWS and will be happy to make deals to get people onto AWS. My guess is that AWS just needs a partner to figure out a good way to design some good APIs for car data. BlackBerry will be useful to AWS for a few years and then discarded. \n\n**Talent**  \nBullish $BB DD doesn't even cover this, and it's probably one of the most important factors. A software companies long term advantage is it's strength to attract top talent. I don't see BB being able to compete in this game at all. I encourage people to check out some of the reviews of [BlackBerry QNX on Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/QNX-Software-Systems-Reviews-E9037.htm). It seems that most employees enjoy working an QNX but think that the parent company BlackBerry is dragging them down. Poor QNX doesn't even have a separate careers page—you get redirected to BlackBerry's career page which mixes all of their departments together on one page. Furthermore, looking at LinkedIn profiles of [current BlackBerry QNX employees](https://www.linkedin.com/company/blackberryqnx/people/) shows that the developer workforce is heavy on the old-guard and doesn't seem to have much young top-tier talent. If $BB can moon, maybe it can attract more talent, but currently, I think talent is going to be a serious issue for BlackBerry QNX.\n\n**Parting sentiment**  \nQNX will either continue to be a low level RTOS that moves your window wipers, or they will be squeezed-out as car companies or companies like Cruise or Deep Scale develop their own low-level OS or use an open-source one. I bought BB in the hype and I think there is a strong case for it being undervalued, but I place a low probability on BB becoming some automotive superstar based on QNX. \n\nPosition: I have 160 BB shares.\n\nEdit: emoji  \nEdit 2: links for LinkedIn and Glassdoor.  \nEdit 3: a lot of you retards overlook arguments and base your opinion solely on me getting high on GME.

{"title": "What Everyone is Getting Wrong About GME", "selftext": "WSB Controls GME Sentiment, not the Price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong read here but there is analogy using the Magic School bus so........yeah.\n\nTL:DR: at bottom.\n\nI've seen far too many people on this sub, Stinktwits, Tweeter, CNBC, WSJ, Barron's etc. incorrectly state that WSB is controlling GME.  We have not, nor will we ever be in control of GME.  Simply put, our \\~5% ownership isn't enough to push the price around.  As much as you retards, and the retard(s) on CNBC, and the retards on print media WANT everyone to believe it, its just not true so I wanted to clarify a few things going forward.\n\nFirst, the media, Shitron, and others are trying to paint WSB as a collective or a whole entity, and NOT as a group of individuals.  This claim is baseless, and has been mentioned here before but of course that won't stop them.  If in fact we were a collective, that would set a dangerous precedent and we would almost certainly be shut down.  Think of like Pirate Bay. If one person illegally uploads a movie that person is in violation of the law, but if 10000 people upload a couple seconds of said movie, and those pieces are stitched together it becomes a lot harder to make it illegal.\n\nThe story of GME began much like M. Burry's big short began - someone looked!  That person was r/DeepFuckingValue (and M. Burry, himself).  Let's use the Magic School Bus as an example. DFV is played by Ms. Frizzle. Here she comes around the bend in her little short bus on route to pick you mini autists up, but when she opens the door to the bus no one gets on!  Ms. Frizzle is not discouraged, so she wrangles you retards up and throws you on the bus.  Off you go on the adventure of your life, launching into the stratosphere to discover a new planet further than the Moon and Mars. You name this newly found planet Valhalla.  When you return you can't stop telling people about your trip!\n\nThis is where we get to my point.  We are in control of the SENTIMENT surrounding GME, not the price.   You little autists have seen valhalla already, and can't stop telling others about how magical it is. Soon enough, other autists want to ride the short bus out to Valhalla, and so they buy their tickets (stonks) and then they tell their friends etc etc.  Take Tesla for example (with a P/E of 1700), does that stop the ~~retards~~ geniuses from buying?\n\nThis is what we are doing to GME.  We didn't push our weight around as WSB and somehow, singlehandedly destroy the shorts.  No, retail just doesn't have that kind of power (hence why its B.S the media is pushing the narrative...LOL though they sure know how to make an autist blush).  WSB somehow, SOMEHOW edgeukated enough people on the GME story about how undervalued they were, financially healthy they were, how shorted the stock was, Lord Cohen et al, etc, and the story took off.\n\nYou see? We are controlling the SENTIMENT around GME which in turn, is controlling the price.  Lets continue this going forward because its what got us to where we are.  If we really want this squeeze to happen there is going to have to be conviction on behalf of the buyers.  So go out there and edgeukate more people on the stock that everyone missed (apart from you DFV (xoxo) and Burry).\n\nMake sure they know this ain't no pump and dump. Everyone gets caught up in the stonk price when they should be looking at market cap.  Sure, we hit the highest price last week, but not the highest  market cap GME has ever had. In reality, we've just recently corrected to the proper valuation GME should have been at all along (if it weren't for those greedy shorts!).\n\nSo next time you post about GME, make sure you remind people about the above points and the fact that  the squeeze hasn't squoze yet, and that RC and Reggie Fils Aime are now driving this short bus!\n\nYou keep the SENTIMENT high, the stonk price goes more uppies.\n\n(someone add a rocket emoji...or perhaps a school bus?)\n\nTL/DR:  WSB is controlling the SENTIMENT around GME, not the price.  \n\n\n\\*EDIT: Position:  557 glorious shares @ $20.21", "id": "l3xy7m", "created_utc": 1611488490.0, "score": 1789, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 290, "comments": [{"body": "Talk down to me more.

Let's face it, shorters have immense amount of capital compare to WSB, but they are in a hole they need to dig themselves out. In my head there are two possible broader strategies they could take:\n\n1. Use their shit ton of money (including margins based on other collaterals in their holdings) to double down on shorting, hoping to suppress the price long enough so enough paper hands exit with relative small gains while thinking they've made out like a bandit, eventually restore some stock liquidity in the market so they can cover at the lower price.\n2. Capitulate, but using their shit ton of money to manage the price curve so there wouldn't be any explosive price spikes as they cover.  \n\nI believe they've been using plan 1 for the last few weeks. Thus the little covering we've seen so far. There are reports on additional short interests being added in the past few weeks, which further backs up this theory. But due to our  💎👐  it didn't really pan out as they would've hoped.  Also this has the massive side effect of dragging down MMs with them due to large amount of call options purchase. Not only they threw MMs under the bus, but also further reduced stock liquidity as MMs need to deliver assignments.\n\nI think they might start to seriously consider plan 2. This is basically spending lots of money to avoid losing even more money.\n\nTo shorters, plan 1 might be a cheaper way to exit if it works out, but carries immense amount of risks. Also it hasn't worked that well so far so history is not on their side. Plan 2 is really, really expensive and needs to be very carefully executed to be worthwhile, but carries a slightly lower risk.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised they have a bunch of high IQ lvy leaguers and Asian quants they poached from MIT running all kinds of calculations on the risk profiles of these two strategies over the weekend, so they don't get sucked dry by a bunch of retards. \n\nComing up we might see explosive price action if they go with plan 1 but couldn't keep the lid on. Or continuous swing up and down if they act on plan 2. But as the stock liquidity dries up (on the premise that they can't create too many additional synthetic shares), even plan 2 has a pretty big risk of blowing up the price.\n\nTL;DR buy more shares and hold them to the moon.   🚀🚀🚀 💎🙌", "score": 567, "replies": [{"body": "Probably the most useful response to this question in this thread!!

{"title": "A Closer Glance at Nokia", "selftext": "Sup glue sniffers. I’ve seen some Nokia thirst posts over the past couple weeks, and figured I’d look into the company. I used to have a windows phone, and while the OS was absolute shit, the phone itself was solid. NOK also ended trading at 4.20 on Friday so I figured why not look into it.  After briefly looking over the past couple quarterly reports, I’ve found Nokia is as resilient as the phones it manufactures. **Today I’m discussing the long term case for Nokia.**\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** I don’t get paid for this. I’m not a professional. I’m not giving financial advice. I won’t have a lot of pretty charts in this so just eat some fucking crayons like you normally do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Gossip**\n\nAs some of you less smooth-brained retards know, Nokia has been getting shat on from shareholder’s perspective over the past couple years. Seeing a few big dips in share price both in 2019 and 2020 (which I will explain later). It appears that a lot of traders have left the company by the wayside for corporations like Motorola (MSI) and Cisco (CSCO).\n\n**I see you lookin’**\n\nInvestment Journalists have already been discussing speculative success for Nokia long-term.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n[https://investorplace.com/2019/12/nokia-short-term-pain-clouding-long-term-future/](https://investorplace.com/2019/12/nokia-short-term-pain-clouding-long-term-future/)\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/12/where-will-nokia-be-in-5-years.aspx](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/12/where-will-nokia-be-in-5-years.aspx) (I include this link also to provide context for the link posted right after this.

Notice that some dark blue exists outside the dotted square? That’s all NEW STUFF LOOKIE THERE FELLA UR SO SMART. At the same time, some of the 4G footprint remains because of interest in providing service to..um.. legacy products?\n\nAs of the Q3 report, Nokia owns 27% of the 4G + 5G mobile radio market share- excluding the Chinese market for that matter. This hasn't been a company that has lacked resources or experience, but direction and focus; there is a LOT to telecommunications and there are many doors this company can take. It has the connections, money, and focus necessary to achieve these long-term goals that its leaders set. If done right, 2021 won’t be a year of killer cash flow and revenue, but will establish Nokia with one massive cock.\n\nI know it’s not exactly flashy/sexy and won’t see immediate results in the next two or three quarters, but the newly appointed Chief Technical Officer, Nishant “Big Daddy” Batra knows R&D and knows the ins and outs of Cloud Service Programs. Nokia has some BIG brain boys steering the ship. Let’s talk about something you troglodytes can follow: money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Source: https:\\/\\/www.nokia.com\\/system\\/files\\/2020-10\\/nokia\\_slides\\_2020\\_q3.pdf ](https://preview.redd.it/aif0x17jkcd61.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b4650681395aa96124aa6f64772bf42b5a02395)\n\nNet sales, operating profit, and margin are on track for another consistent year albeit *slightly* lower than 2019. This is good news considering that it lost a large north American customer this previous year due to its lackluster 5G footprint WHICH Lundmark (the aforementioned new president of Nokia) has explicitly stated that this will be the primary focus: R&D in tech that will position it as a long-term leader in the 5G space. They can do it too. I’ll dumb it down for you retards:\n\nBoys, this is FISCALLY-DISCIPLINED leadership.\n\n“BuT sHoUldN’T aLL lEadErShIp bE gOoD wItH mOneY??”\n\nFirst, shut the fuck up and let me explain. There was a major dip in share price in 2019 after Nokia announced that it would not be paying dividends for two consecutive quarters. The boomers and gay bears in r/investing didn’t like the sound of that and decided to sell to really stick it to Nokia, and bought shit like CRUS because MMs told their sheep to.\n\n**Nokia cut dividends temporarily in order to offset the cost of rolling out 5G tech**. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/nokia-cuts-earnings-outlook-and-pauses-dividend-to-invest-in-5g](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-24/nokia-cuts-earnings-outlook-and-pauses-dividend-to-invest-in-5g)\n\nIt was supposed to be a short term biting of the bullet for shareholders in order to see long term benefits, but God forbid people didn’t get their 19 cent-a-share dividends. There has been open discussion of bringing back dividends within the next couple years if the company sees continued growth in its cash flow, Nokia mentions the possibility of:\n\n>“an earnings-based growing dividend of approximately 40% to 70% of non-IFRS diluted EPS, taking into account Nokia’s cash position and expected cash flow generation.”\n\n*source:* [*https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-nokia-stock-before-the-company-resumes-dividends-2020-10-21*](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/buy-nokia-stock-before-the-company-resumes-dividends-2020-10-21)\n\nIf Nokia officially announces a re-rolling out of dividends, boomers will get  **Rock. Fucking. Hard.** and slurp up shares on the cheap. This is where speculation comes in and is **ultimately why I am posting this shit in WSB.** Nokia has some major competition, minus Huawei in the United States which is a big fucking deal and I’m amazed how that escapes people considering the recent contracts Nokia secured with the US government. Some of that competition currently has the leg up on Nokia and betting on them is risky, but if Nokia can prove within the next year that it has a plan, we have got some SERIOUS upward potential.\n\nAlso, check the options activity on Nokia for the next 2 weeks leading up to its Q4 report. It’s getting me \\~frisky\\~\n\nI could further dissect additional strategies associated with Nokia’s portfolio including what else it has it’s toes in, but big picture: Nokia will begin to hone in on a specific set of specializations (5G and Cloud-native software services).\n\nOh and you degenerates aren’t paying me.\n\nTL;DR Nokia has potential for long term skyward trajectory with its new leadership.", "id": "l47wzb", "created_utc": 1611523195.0, "score": 1114, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 215, "comments": [{"body": "That’s enough text and pictures to get me in.

Once 🔥 I 💰 saw 👁 the story changed, 📈🚼 the 🏻🌎 numbers changed. 😩😩 They ❌😅 were eating 🍴 from 😮 the 🐄🍄 top, 🔼🔼 and 🏽 they ✊ were 👶 eating 👄🍴 from the 😤🚪 bottom. ⬇⬇ And 👏 I 😞 identified the 💬 fact you can't be 🐝 short 👉 this 👈 game. It's 😽 up 🔺☝ I ⌨👈 think 90%. ❌💯 Since then, it's the 👏 opposite when it comes to 💦 GameStop NPD is 🏿🎃 the gold standard when ⏰💤 it 🙂 comes 💦 to gaming reports. On 🔛🔛 January 🕑 14, 👦 they 😅 put out 🏻👌 their analysis of 💡 what December looked like in 🏼⬇ the video ⏸📽 game 🎮 season, 💦💦 hardware sales had their 👈👏 best 🐔 month 📆 ever 😘😃 up 23% year 🙌🏼 over 👏 year, 😘 because 📝 the 😍 two ✌ cycles over 🤔 that time. 🙈 GameStop was 👇 down 9%. Now 🔫 I 🐝😭 understand this 💦🙋 is 👆 what 😌 physical 💏👊 locations, 🌍📍 forget about 🥕 all ✊🌞 the future, 👅 what 😲👏 they're 🗓 going 🏃 to lose to downloading and 🗣👏 streaming ⛵ their 🍆 physical locations. We're 🏾👑 actually down during the past month, 💸 they were losing to 👊➡ Amazon, 💸 Best Buy target, and ➡ Walmart.

{"title": "PLTR vs Child Rapists, Starvation, Hurricanes, Ukranian Mafia, and $CRM (DD from an Early Palantir Engineer)", "selftext": "I joined Palantir in early 2007, back when it was a penny stock (I paid $0.011/share for my initial stock options). As one of the first 50 employees, I wrote code for the core product, then transitioned into a Forward Deployed Engineer role, and ultimately led Palantir’s Philanthropy Engineering Team. \n\nI came to WSB for the fucking hilarious Palantir memes, but I stayed for the education and DDs. I’m on the tendies train with GME and BB, so I figured I’d give back to the sub with a DD on PLTR in advance of Demo Day. \n\nImportant caveat for the mods and alphabet regulators reading this: I left Palantir in 2015 to co-found Ada Diamonds. I no longer have any insider knowledge about Palantir. All I am sharing in this DD is publicly available information with links to my sources, as well as my personal strategy for the Palantir shares I own free and clear.  Neither Foundry nor Apollo were launched when I was employed at Palantir, so I am excited to see the demos of both, as well as how far Gotham has come in the last 6 years.\n\nLots of words below, so here’s the TL;DR for those of you that can’t read good: By 2030, I believe that PLTR could have a $250 billion market cap. I’ve yet to sell all of my 20% that is unlocked and am largely diamond hands-ing my soon-to-be unlocked 80% until PLTR is past Mars and approaching the asteroid belt. \n\nWhy am I so bullish? I view Palantir as the kid-brother of Salesforce (more on this thesis below), and I think PLTR is just fueling up. If Palantir continues to execute well in the decade ahead, I believe they will capture enough market share to grow like Salesforce has in the last 8 years:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aubihrloscd61.jpg?width=635&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c2f897fda6f7c75a8a315dab02aaa4909b40dd6e\n\nTL;DR of the TL;DR - (lots of rocket emojis and some Mars emojis)\n\nPositions or ban:\n\n* More than enough PLTR shares to cover Cathie’s latest purchase\n* r/smallstreetbets on GME and BB (shares)\n* A boomer portfolio of low risk bonds\n\nIt’s also worth flagging that many other early employees are in the same boat (rocketship) as me. Unlike alumni of some of the quick to IPO companies, we’ve been responsibly diversifying for over a decade in the private markets. In addition to private market sales, Palantir did multiple internal liquidity events where employees could sell 10% of their holdings to a large Palantir investor as part of oversubscribed fundraising rounds.\n\nThus, it’s not a question of what I am doing with my remaining 80%, but instead a question of what I am doing with my remaining \\~35%. I’ve used pre-IPO PLTR tendies to buy a nice house, 1,635hp of cars, nice vacations with friends, etc. So, I’m diamond hands-ing my remaining PLTR stock with a decade long diversification plan, as I believe PLTR will far outperform the market, just like CRM, TSLA, and the FAANGs have done in the last decade.\n\nAlso, most of the bears I know from Palantir (including those that quit, got fired, pushed out, or flamed out) long ago sold most/all of their shares. The alumni I keep in touch with are collectively long-term bullish as well.  \n\nI’m going to break this DD down into a few sections:\n\n1. What is Palantir\n2. Examples of Palantir in Action\n3. Why CRM is the closest comp to PLTR\n4. The Under Discussed ‘Secret Sauce’ of Palantir\n5. What I’m looking for during Demo Day\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**What is Palantir?**\n\nPalantir is one of two things:\n\n1. The best product on the market to help organizations make better decisions\n2. The best product on the market to help organizations find, fix, and finish/prosecute malicious actors & dark networks.\n\nYou can add as many buzz words as you want on top- SaaS, AI, big data, operating system for data, UBL, deviant philosopher, cloud, Skynet, link analysis, off-road rollerblades, GIS, ML, terrorist hunting, multi-level security, etc.- but at the end of the day, large organizations pay 8 to 10 figures for Palantir because Palantir is the best product available to help them: A) make better decisions and/or B) find bad guys.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Examples of Palantir in action- #1** **World Food Program (WFP)**\n\nThe WFP delivers 15 billion meals per year in 80 countries around the world. WFP uses Palantir’s Foundry to bring together data sources from across the organization, enabling staff to access and analyze programmatic and operational data in a secure, unified environment to make better decisions.\n\nThe sheer scale of WFP’s operations, assisting some 90 million people in about 80 countries, means that even small efficiencies in operational and supply chain management can lead to dramatic savings. WFP generates vast amounts of data through the purchasing of 3 million metric tons of food every year and the delivery of 15 billion rations across dozens of development projects worldwide. \n\nMaking this data accessible across the organization helps WFP become even more efficient in multiple programme areas, including cash-based transfers, supply chain optimization, and nutritional requirements.\n\nThe WFP literally won the 2020 Nobel Prize for their incredible work to help those in need, powered by Foundry.\n\nSources: \n\n* [https://www.wfp.org/news/palantir-and-wfp-partner-help-transform-global-humanitarian-delivery](https://www.wfp.org/news/palantir-and-wfp-partner-help-transform-global-humanitarian-delivery)\n* [https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-and-the-world-food-programme-9d8b418dd94b](https://medium.com/palantir/palantir-and-the-world-food-programme-9d8b418dd94b)\n* [https://www.wfp.org/stories/world-food-programme-chief-lauds-front-line-staff-and-partners-after-nobel-peace-prize-win](https://www.wfp.org/stories/world-food-programme-chief-lauds-front-line-staff-and-partners-after-nobel-peace-prize-win)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#2 - National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)**\n\nNCMEC is a non-profit that leads the fight against the sexual exploitation of minors, as well as a few other garish responsibilities, such as the solving of cold cases of murdered children.\n\nNCMEC is congressionally mandated to securely hold evidence of crimes against children (aka child porn), and works closely with law enforcement bodies around the world (Interpol, FBI, etc) to find, arrest, and prosecute the producers and distributors of heinous material.\n\nNCMEC has been using Palantir since 2010 to ingest evidence, find clues in the evidence, and connect the dots to find the perpetrators. In 2019, NCMEC received 16.9 million images/videos of exploited children, and COVID has caused an exponential increase in online exploitation of minors.\n\nOf all the work I did in my 8.5 years at Palantir, this was my most important work. I can’t get into details of sources and methods (for obvious reasons) but I can say with absolute certainty that many truly evil perpetrators of crimes against children are behind bars thanks to the power of Palantir’s products in the hands of NCMEC analysts. Without the power of Palantir’s products, many of these pedophiles would still be abusing children today. \n\nThere’s an important part to the DD to understand here - Palantir is entrusted with the most sensitive data in the world by some of the most important and high functioning organizations in the world. It takes decades to develop the technology and trust required to provide audit logging and access control sufficient to handle this type of data, and that is a huge moat of Palantir.\n\nSources:\n\n* [https://medium.com/palantir/fighting-child-exploitation-with-big-data-86868bad559e](https://medium.com/palantir/fighting-child-exploitation-with-big-data-86868bad559e)\n* [https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/25/us/child-abuse-online-coronavirus-pandemic-parents-investigations-trnd/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/25/us/child-abuse-online-coronavirus-pandemic-parents-investigations-trnd/index.html)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#3 - Hurricane Sandy** \n\nWhen Superstorm Sandy ravaged New York, all communications methods (phone, internet, cell towers, etc) went down in large areas. As a result, information was scarce, and the response was disorganized, chaotic, and ineffective. \n\nIn less than a week, my team (the Philanthropy Engineering Team) built and deployed a brand new satellite-based system to manage response efforts by hacking and deploying simple Garmin satellite communicators that are used by hikers and sailors. \n\nIn partnership with Team Rubicon, a kick ass non-profit group of military veterans that respond to natural disasters, we used these devices to support some of the hardest hit communities.\n\nHere’s Bill Clinton and me talking about the project:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0yCcTRSa4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch0yCcTRSa4)\n\nTeam Rubicon is a data-driven organization, utilizing Palantir extensively to collect, catalog, and analyze information during operations and inform the rest of Team Rubicon’s support functions. Palantir Operators train members on Structure and Damage Assessments using the Palantir Mobile application as well as provide crucial situational awareness information for Command and General Staffs and government Emergency Managers during approved Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance Programs. \n\n[https://teamrubiconusa.org/blog/remote-support-a-crucial-part-of-tr-operations/](https://teamrubiconusa.org/blog/remote-support-a-crucial-part-of-tr-operations/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#4 -Disrupting Ukranian Mafia from Laundering Body Parts**\n\nOne of the areas I supported in my time at Palantir was data-driven investigative journalism. Here’s a demo of Gotham being used by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) to integrate and analyze dozens of data sources to expose a criminal enterprise that was stealing dead bodies, laundering the bodies without the required testing for diseases, and selling human tissue for a profit. \n\nNote that this demo of Gotham is 8 years old, so you might be interested to compare this to Demo Day to see how far Gotham has come:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLyWXGaaMYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLyWXGaaMYA)\n\nHere’s the results of the investigation: Safer knee surgeries, skin grafts, etc.\n\n[https://www.icij.org/investigations/tissue/our-blog/](https://www.icij.org/investigations/tissue/our-blog/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**#5 - United Airlines & Airbus**\n\nThis work started after I left Palantir, but I want to mention it as it touches on the network effects of Palantir, and it highlights the core utility of Palantir’s products: improving high-stakes decision making.\n\nPalantir & Airbus’ Skywise breaks down traditional data silos by bringing together an airline's operational, maintenance, and aircraft data with data provided by Airbus. Now, airlines can use massive-scale sensor data, maintenance systems, aircraft schedules, passenger bookings, and more in one environment. On top of this data asset, Skywise offers a diverse analytical suite for operators to make sense of that data in both code-free and code-based environments.\n\n[https://www.palantir.com/solutions/skywise/](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/skywise/)\n\n“Deployed on United’s instance of Palantir Foundry, these models aim to minimize discounted cash flows spent on maintenance activities and maximize operational flexibility in the face of air travel demand uncertainty. The aircraft storage optimization recommends the best storage states (parked vs. active vs. prolonged) and locations (internal & external) for nearly 800 mainline aircraft. The return-to-service model recommends which specific aircraft to return at which time in the future and how to utilize our available maintenance capacity (internal & external) to ensure they’re airworthy when we need them. Since we don’t know when air travel demand will recover, the models need to account for slow recoveries, fast recoveries, and everything in between, then produce a single, discrete solution that considers all likely scenarios. In practice, this means the models help create plans to execute specific maintenance activities over the next several years; it also means when our Network Planning team unexpectedly asks for N planes by a certain date, the models help decide exactly which planes we should provide.\"\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Why CRM is the closest comparable to PLTR**\n\nInstinctually, people compare Palantir to the traditional consultancies and system integrators: Booz, Boeing, Raytheon, Accenture, etc. \n\nYes, Palantir is currently competing with those types of organizations for various contracts, but Palantir is fundamentally different than those entities, as Palantir is a \\*product\\* company leveraging repurposable platforms, versus a services company seeking to deploy as many contractors as possible, and bill as many hours as possible to reinvent the wheel over and over again.\n\nFrom a technology standpoint, Salesforce (CRM) is the closest comp to Palantir. \n\nI say this as a computer scientist who has written core features for Palantir Gotham, written integrations between Salesforce and Palantir, and written tens of thousands of lines of Apex and Lightning code for Salesforce.\n\n* Both are cloud based SaaS data entry and analysis platforms. \n* Both can ingest or access existing data/systems to provide analytics on that 3rd party data.\n* Both have dynamic ontologies capable of modeling virtually any data set and any use case. \n* Both have granular access control to information at the property level.\n* Both have default tools and visualizations, as well as no-code builders.\n* Both have robust APIs and programing languages for bespoke tools and capabilities.\n* Both have (deserved) reputations and niches; however, both are general purpose tools to help organizations make better decisions.\n\nSalesforce started with CRM data entry (easy) and has matured to offer higher level analytical capabilities and AI. Palantir was always focused on advanced analytical capabilities, and it would be trivial to build a CRM capability on top of Palantir’s products.\n\nI run my entire business on Salesforce. Lead gen -> diamond selection -> bespoke CAD creation for custom jewelry -> hand production -> delivery -> service as well as ERP functions of inventory management, shipping/logistics, etc. I could easily replatform my business from Salesforce to Palantir in a month or two, if Palantir chose to sell its products to small and medium businesses (Which they shouldn’t, but I want to highlight that the two core technologies are isomorphic).\n\nIt’s my belief that by 2030, **Palantir and Salesforce will divide the business analytics market like Android & iOS, Coke and Pepsi, or Facebook and Twitter.** CRM will lead in market share of small and medium sized businesses, whereas PLTR will lead in market share for governmental organizations and larger scale businesses.\n\nDon’t believe me? It’s little discussed, but Palantir does offer a competing Sales/CRM product:\n\n[https://www.palantir.com/solutions/sales-and-revenue/](https://www.palantir.com/solutions/sales-and-revenue/)\n\nStill don’t believe me that CRM and PLTR are converging technologies? Salesforce bought a company founded by two Palantir employees, RelateIQ, for $390 million dollars in 2014. Salesforce’s headline on the purchase?\n\nGoodbye Relationship Management. Hello Relationship Intelligence.\n\nGoodbye CRM. Hello data analytics.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**The ‘Secret Sauce’ of Palantir: Granular Access Control & Vetted Information Sharing**\n\nIMHO, the one thing that has not received enough attention in the IPO is Palantir’s ability to track the source and pedigree of every single piece of data in the system, empowering granular access control on a need-to-know basis, which enables organizations to share information across borders/boundaries.\n\nBig data is hard. Providing granular access control to big data is much harder. Convincing sensitive organizations that your tech is safe enough to share classified information with other countries/organizations is even harder. \n\nI cannot overstate how difficult access control is at scale and why it’s a key part of Palantir’s present and future value.\n\nHere's recent videos from Palantir explaining the tech:\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zqE8J4WKOU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zqE8J4WKOU)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbo65u9Yt1o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbo65u9Yt1o)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**What I am looking for on Demo Day:**\n\n* Has the usability & approachability of Gotham significantly improved? \n* How flexible/customizable is the Gotham Object viewer? (Salesforce is FAR superior here versus my 2015 knowledge of Gotham)\n* How mature are the admin tools and speed to deploy? Are they mature enough that 3rd party contractors can create and manage Palantir instances? \n* Is there a robust marketplace for 3rd party tools, data sources, and plugins?\n* What is the AI offering, and how does that help organizations improve decision making?  \n* Will there be enough rocket emojis used in the presentation to win over WSB?", "id": "l49dut", "created_utc": 1611527494.0, "score": 645, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "Tbh?

Based on the interviews that's what Palantir seek to address. You can see the same failure playing out right now between Federal and state governments, hospital systems, pharma companies when it comes to a reliable vaccination plan. Why is that? Because of all the legal requirements.\n\nBesides all the problems I mentioned about good access control, the difficulties are compounded exponentially when you talk about multi-organization data share. PLTR has the experience in implementing platforms compliant to the highest standards (IL-6, or SECRET). This should help them tackle healthcare where the HIPPA laws have prevented hospitals, universities, and pharmaceutical companies from meaningful collaboration.
