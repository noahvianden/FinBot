I had a scare this morning with the market drop on some options I bought at market open but came out with a break even. I would love any advice and ideas feel free to comment them down below. Let’s hear your options for tomorrow 1-7. Thanks", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Please read the links at the top of this weekly thread.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "When running the Wheel strategy on margin accounts, how much of your available option buying power are you supposed to use? What do you do with the leftover BP?\n\nI understand that the \"Cash Secured\" part of writing CSPs means that you have the cash available to purchase the shares at the strike you sold in the case you are assigned. However, the buying power needed for selling puts is usually less than that.\n\nLet's say you have a $30,000 account. On a margin account, this is usually $30,000 of option buying power and $60,000 of stock buying power. Also say, if assigned, you don't want a single stock to take up more than 10% of your stock buying power. So, the highest strike you can sell would be $60.\n\nFor simplicity, assume the strike price/stock price of every stock chosen is 60$. Let's also assume that the option buying power required for all short puts on the $60 strike is always $1,000. (In reality, I know that the actual BP needed is determined by the broker and can vary wildly depending on volatility and other things).\n\nTo me, these are some options:\n\n**Option #1:** only use option buying power such that you could handle assignment of all contracts at the same time. This means, at the $60 strike, you could only have 10 open contracts maximum. You would have $20,000 option buying power leftover and $40,000 stock buying power leftover. While the account is truly \"cash secured\", you'd have a lot of buying power sitting, doing nothing. \n\n**Option #2:** same as option# 1, but use a portion, say 50%, of your leftover stock buying power on \"safe\", diversified investments like bonds/safe ETFs. If assigned on too many of your contracts at the same time and you don't have the stock buying power, liquidate part of your bonds/ETFs in order to take assignment and not get margin called. With this option, you at least have some of your leftover BP working for you, but in the case of, say a market crash, your long positions' value decreases and your puts could get assigned, leaving you to be margin called.\n\n**Option #3:** Use up, say, 50% of your total option buying power selling puts. I normally see for premium selling strategies that it's recommended to use \\~50% of your option buying power, so that's where this comes from. So, if in our example each short put is a $1000 BP reduction, this means you could have 15 open contracts maximum. If assigned on any one position, you'd have the cash to take it, but you would not be able to handle assignment of all positions simultaneously. \n\nSo what's recommended for the Wheel?

Selling covered calls won't add to your margin requirements in this case. So you only need to keep your margin equity above the maintenance margin for the shares.\n\n**I'm going to assume you have a $26250 account with no other positions on. If this changes, the calculations will be slightly different, especially the margin equity part.**\n\nI'm also gonna assume that PLTR has **50% initial margin requirements, and 33% and maintenance margin requirements.**\n\nYou start with $26250 net liq, and $26250 in cash, and $26250 in cash buying power.\n\nThere are three important numbers to keep an eye on here:\n\n**1) Cash buying power.** This will determine if you're allowed to open this position or not.\n\nTo hold the shares, since they have 50% initial margin requirements, you will use 50%  of the notional value from your cash buying power.\n\nBut, when you sell the shares, you receive the credit in advance, and this will be added to your cash and buying power.\n\nHence, total buying power required is 25000(number of shares) x $24.60(PLTR share price) x 0.50(initial margin) - $11.25(premium per share) x 100(shares per contract) x 250(number of contracts) = $307,500 - $281,250 = $26,250.\n\nSo you'll use all your buying power for this position, but you can put it on. Remaining buying power = 0. You can't open anymore positions, **AND you can't close the short calls.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) Cash balance:** This will determine how much are you borrowing and hence your margin interest.\n\nYou received $281,250 as premium, and you had $26,250 of your own cash.\n\nThe shares require 25000 x $24.60 = $615,000 in cash.\n\nHence your cash balance will be $281,250 + $26,250 - $615,000 = -$307,500. **You're borrowing $307,500.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) Margin maintenance:** This determines when you'll get a margin call.\n\nYou need to keep your equity + cash  above maintenance requirements for the position.\n\nWhen you open the position, your equity = $615,000, cash  = -$307,500, hence your equity + cash = $307,500.\n\nIf PLTR is having a 33% maintenance margin, then maintenance margin is $202,950.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo get a margin call, PLTR needs to drop below $18.45.\n\nFor example, if PLTR drops to $18.00, your equity drops to 25000x$18.00 = $450,000. Hence your equity + cash  = $450,000 - $307,500 = **$142,500.**\n\nWhile maintenance margin requirements = 0.33 X 25000 X $18.00 = **$148,500. More than $142,500, you'll be in a margin call.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some notes:** \n\n1. **This calculation is based on my understanding of margin requirements. I've never been in this situation to actually verify this. If I'm missing something Someone please educate me.**\n2. PLTR is volatile. It might have more than 33% maintenance margin requirements. If it has 50% maintenance margin requirements, then you'll get margin called once PLTR drops even one cent.\n3. This is a lot of leverage. And will be very hard to get out of.\n4. **When PLTR drops below $18.45, and you'll be forced to liquidate, however there is no guarantee on the value of the calls at that point. Your netliq can be negative, a lot negative. This makes me think that I might be missing something important.**\n\n**Very interesting case.

It's called the *expected value* formula, which is the probability weighted sum of profits and losses. If the sum of all that is positive, it's a good trade. If it's breakeven or negative, it's a bad trade.\n\nI'll give you an example of a winning trade (+ev). I like to trade XSP and SPX. I exit at 10% or more of initial debit (ROC is *at least* 10%). I also exit at around 20% of initial debit lost. So my maximum loss on the trade is -20% ROC.\n\nThat would be enough to calculate my breakeven win rate, but by looking at my actual trades, I know that I have approximately a 76% win rate (POP). So roughly 1 loss out of every 4 trades. You can see right away that the expected value will be positive, but we'll run the formula to demonstrate. Let's say I trade $1000 net debit. We'll use a conservative max profit of 10% ($100), but remember that I sometimes get more than that. Nominal loss is 20% ($200).\n\nEV = (.76 x 100) + (.24 x -200) = 76 - 48 = +$28 on average. A 2.8% ROC doesn't seem like much, but I do that trade a few hundred times per year, so it adds up to decent money.\n\nThe generalization of this strategy is high POP, high frequency, low rate of return, low risk.

In order to do that I needed to have a brokerage account that had low interest margin for me to be comfortable. The best one I found at the time was M1 Finance at 2%.\nFor Example: Lets say I had $1,000,000 in TSLA, and now need to get to 5% on margin. I add $50,000 borrowed. The cost of that money is 1k a year to have work for me in the stock market at 2%. Working asset is now $1,050,000\nTime passes, and in this example the account is now valued at $1,250,000 but 50k is still debt. So I then take the real amount of $1,200,000 5% is now 60k, and I already put in 50k, So I'll add another 10k to Ballance it out back to 5% margin usage. If you keep doing this for the long run, with these historic low interest margin rates it gets crazy. All you have to if find a company that will keep pace or exceed inflationary rates at 2%.\nSo for paying off the margin, I don't have to, but I do. I pay it off monthly. It's pennies on the dollar for the return I have gotten, and will get over the long run. FUN FACT! Did you know you can write off margin if you itemize your taxes and you have enough margin debt to do so? YES you can write off margin!\nI am in the process of moving over to IBKR for a lower rate than M1, starting margin is 1.59% and much lower, it's insane. \nMy account is so large now that with my income I can't make a meaningful impact to its overall size. That's why I use the investor tool of margin like this to move the needle more with caution and for the long term. There's a real possibility I will never pay off the margin. However if the rates change to a rate that I feel my investment in TSLA can not out perform, I will likely then pay off the debt. I just cant see that TSLA would move up in value lower than sub inflationary rates in the long run at this time. Just look at these low rates on IBKR.

{"title": "I beat the S&P returns by 0.5% (taxable), 10% (IRA), and 23% (Roth IRA) in 2020 by selling options. Here are all the mistakes I made.", "selftext": "Like many, I started selling options earlier this year.  My primary sources for learning were [thebluecollarinvestor.com](https://thebluecollarinvestor.com) and [tastytrade.com](https://tastytrade.com).\n\nI determined performance vs the market by spreadsheet tracking a \"purchase\" of shares of SP500TR every time I added money to my account, then comparing EOY values of my account (after taxes) to the SP500TR value.\n\nI used as underlyings dividend aristocrats and a few others that I felt were high quality companies that  will pay reliable, growing dividends in the future.  My list that I sold puts or covered calls on in 2020 is:\n\nABBV\n\nAFL\n\nAMCR\n\nAOS\n\nBAC\n\nBEN\n\nBMO\n\nBMY\n\nBTI\n\nCAH\n\nD\n\nDUK\n\nENB\n\nGD\n\nGILD\n\nIBM\n\nIVZ\n\nJPM\n\nKO\n\nLEG\n\nMET\n\nMMM\n\nMO\n\nMRK\n\nOZK\n\nPBCT\n\nPEP\n\nPFE\n\nPM\n\nSO\n\nT\n\nUl\n\nUNM\n\nVTRS\n\nWBA\n\nWU\n\nXLE\n\nXOM\n\nI sold some weeklies at first but mostly did the 45 DTE target a la Tastytrade.\n\nHere are my mistakes/lessons learned for the year:\n\n1. **Not understanding how to use portfolio margin responsibly.**  This is one of the two primary reasons (taxes being the other) my taxable account barely beat the market.  I started out in March only selling cash-secured puts thinking naked puts were too risky.  Tastytrade has some good back tests showing that up to 60% of buying power could be allocated through events like the great recession without  blowing up.  Much later in the year I starting to target using 25-30% of my buying power instead of only selling cash-secured.  Had I done this earlier my returns would have been greatly enhanced.\n2. **Taxes take a huge chunk out of returns in a taxable account.**  I'm in a higher tax bracket so that matters but it is almost to the point of the effort not being worth it.  With my adjustments going forward and using a touch of margin I think 2021 will be much better even taking taxes into account, but if I am wrong and it is not then I will need to re-evaluate this strategy in my taxable account.  **Edit for clarity:** I am in a \\~35% combined federal+state tax situation for short term gains.  My \"beat the market by 0.5%\" calculation is after paying 35% of my gains in short term tax and 15% on long term gains/dividends.\n3. **I committed fully to positions too soon, which did not allow me to add to them when better opportunities showed up.**  Two tickers this happened with were IVZ and WFC.  I had committed full positions to each, and then they dropped significantly lower, which should have been an opportunity for me to grab more.  However I just wasn't comfortable doing it because of a nagging voice saying \"what if you're wrong and they go bankrupt, that would be too big of a loss to take.\"\n4. **I Figured out too late that I needed to roll out and up before getting deep itm on calls.** Because of this, I have some June WFC 27.5 calls that I wish were at the 30 strike instead. Cost basis on the shares is $25.02 so it's still a gain but it could be a better gain if I had acted sooner.\n5. **I Figured out too late that I really want to be long stock and sell options around my positions.** I let KO, PEP, SO, MET, LEG and AOS get called away at some great prices. All for a profit but I wish I had rolled my calls out and up.\n6. **I Bought back some calls in June for a small profit when I was sure the underlyings were going to pop.**  They never popped.  I could have just kept them on and collected all the theta.  I guess this is the option equivalent of market timing.\n7. **I got assigned some BTI 40 puts early**.  I was planning to roll these until I was right, and it was a surprise that they got assigned to me early.  I had expected that was possible with it covered calls, didn't realize it could happen with puts too.\n8. **Order entry mistakes can happen.**  Using the web version of my broker I sold 10 puts when I wanted to sell 1, and I sold in my taxable account when I wanted to in one of my IRAs.  The web interface is just clunkier.  Thankfully the options I sold too many of had narrow bid-ask spreads and the loss correcting the mistake was only about $2 total per contract.\n9. **I sold some PFE puts not realizing they were about to spinoff VTRS.**  This meant my adjusted puts would become much less liquid.  I bought them back at a small profit thinking I needed to avoid the illiquidity of having adjusted options.  Now that I know whats up I can be prepared for IBM later this year.\n10. **I took some months off from actively monitoring my positions.**  I know this cost me because I didn't buy things back at 50% profit for most of June, July, August, and September.  I was just mentally fried at the time with quarantine, having homeschooled the kids, and everything else going on.  This is an active strategy and taking time off = money lost.  I've since trimmed the time commitment but when the market has a big day I need to take the time to redeploy capital to keep the returns flowing.\n11. **I don't even know why I am comparing returns to the S&P.**  If I was long all of my underlyings that wouldn't compare to the S&P, so I am not sure of the point, other than to make sure what I am doing is worth my time vs buy and hold SPY.\n\nIf I can think of more beyond that 11, I'll edit them in.\n\nHopefully this is helpful to others just starting.

Getting tired of the daily \"What should I wheel?\" and \"account total goes up!\" screenshots.\n\n2: **Taking time off**, taking a break is not a bad thing. You had a lot of stress going on and that can be a distraction. Far better imo to pause and recollect your focus then start getting sloppy with trades that impact your accounts.\n\n3: **Comparing to the S&P500**. The idea for a benchmark is to grade how well you did. Comparing to the S&P benchmark because you could just place all your money in an index fund and be done with it. The amount amount of time you put in to beat your benchmark should be worth it to you. Otherwise just buy SPY and save a lot of time and hassle. Personally I use a 75% SPY and 25% TLT mix cause that is probably what I would do if I didnt sell options and make individual stock pick investments.\n\n4: **Selling PFE puts**. Didyou also record how many positive unknown events occurred that made you money via vega? Theoretically given enough trades this all balances out. Since you mentioned tastytrade, they stress hitting lots of trades for probabilities to pan out over thousands of trades. There isnt enough time to research and keep track of companies when you have a dozen or more trades going on at once. \n\nStill, I get what you are saying. I use ToS and on my chart page I have the news for a company. A quick glance through is usually enough to spot major news.\n\n5: **Taxes**. Keep in mind that in the beginning of learning any skillset we are going to be making dumb mistakes. If your S&P benchmark makes 8% for the year and you can avoid a dumb mistake that would have caused a 2% loss then in essence you just made a full quarter's worth of profit.

And please don’t be an autist and say something retarded like “if Tesla is a car company then Apple is a phone company”. Yes, over 50% of apples revenue is from phones, but they also have huge revenue segments in Mac, IPad, Audio, Services, etc. So, if Apples revenue was 90% phones then yes that statement would be true, buts it’s not so please don’t try and justify it with that stupid brainwashing comment (which I know someone will post in the comments and get 1k upvotes). \n\nNow, Tesla is a phenomenal company with a visionary leader, don’t get me wrong - but they are being priced like the next Amazon. One slip up and they will tumble - or if they can’t find that one thing that will essentially print money for them (Apple iPhone, Google ads, Microsoft Azure, Amazon web services), then valuation will get cut in half.

(I \\*do\\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)\n\nHere's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.\n\n1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?\n2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...\n3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.\n4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.\n5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...\n\nSo, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.\n\nHaving said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time.

Palantir also finally has built out their Foundry Platform and Apollo platforms over the years and are now ready to ramp up a lot of customers quickly.\n\nEfficiency / Apollo:\n\nPalantir as a company has become extremely more efficient the past 1-2 years when it comes to acquiring new customers and ramping them up. The reasoning behind this is their Apollo Platform. It’s an in house platform that uses ML to help get a customer up and going a lot faster than previously. In the past, Palantir would have to send “forward deployed engineers” to customers to get them up and running and that could take weeks / months and is costly. Now With Apollo, Palantir can get a customer up and running in hours without sending anyone. This frees up cash for Palantir the invest back into R&D. Also wanted to mention, during the last Q3 earnings call, an analyst asked the headcount growth for the company. Most high growth companies tend to hire a lot of ppl to keep that growth rate up. A company doing that that comes to mind is Snowflake. Palantir’s CFO said that their headcount is only growing 2-3% and mostly in the sales department. The reasoning of this is directly due to Apollo. Palantir’s employees have become more efficient and that with Apollo, they can onboard a lot of customers without hiring more expensive engineers.\n\nPalantir Modules:\n\nOn the Q3 earnings call, Palantir alluded to an ERP type Modules for Foundry that they are working on so that customers can pick and choose which aspects of Foundry they want, instead of getting the whole suite. This is great because it’s way cheaper for a company to get started with Palantir’s software and then slowly ramp up with more options. Palantir has a very high retention rate with their software so by having a company only pick 1-2 modules, it most likely will result in getting more and more modules which in turns create more revenue for PLTR. I suspect they will talk about this come the Demo day.\n\nFinal thoughts.\n\nPalantir has great leadership and are very smart people. They are very methodical in their planning. This company is 100% a long term hold. Think 5-10 years at least. They only had a sales team for 1.5 years and already will have over $1B in sales with virtually no sales team.

Is the AI basically a bespoke product of Palantir to scour the clients databases and bring it all together?\n\nOr can it also assist the analyst in writing algos to filter and find patterns like a human analyst would?

The task Palantir solving is somthing that is not entirely computer and AI assisted. if you see the demo and what Karp says, their target is to empower the most frontline employees with the similar kind of decision making ability as top PHD and C-suite.\n\nIn short, it is helping them to do tasks which are critical and take much longer with better insight and improved consistency with big picture clarity. As i understand that their AI suite has several bespoke portion, this is the reason deploying Palantir is not straightforward in the starting and company don't have domain expertise.

SLB,HAL, BHGE who are established player in O&G services and digital space can deliver the same solution. What sets Palantir Unique is their ability to scaleup. Scaling up and speed to market is the Achilles heal of industry.

She has already stated that genomics will be the future in terms of tech development. ARKG is heavily invested into PACB which is BNGO’s competitor. \n\nBNGO recently released that their product Saphyr is now 30%ish more efficient than PACB’s product.\n\nPACB’s market cap is 4.9B\n\nBNGO current market cap as of this writing trading at 6.58 which leaves them at 1B market cap.\n\nAssume similar price trajectory to PACB’s market puts this at 4.9x of its current share valuation. Which puts this around $32.00/share!!\n\nBNGO is waiting on FDA approval right now which could be further catalyst and reason for Cathie to enter. \n\nBNGO got an extension of nasdaq delisting by 6months a few weeks ago which at this point no longer matters. (This means BNGO needs to trade above $1.00 consistently for 10 trading days to meet compliance) \n\nI recommend buying now. Load up. Anywhere between 2-5 is sexy. I expect a small dip\n\nMy current positions: 500shares averaged at 2.73$/share\n\nMy strategy is to sell a quarter of my position at $10 and let the rest ride long term. If this dips anywhere below 3 again, I am adding more to my shares\n\nFirst DD so do your own research! Tbh, I’ve never felt more confident about this. \n\nEDIT 1: This is posted after the run up to fit the market cap requirement of 1B that this sub requires prior to posting or auto removal. \n\nEDIT 2: I am being told in the comments that PACB is actually complimentary to BNGO's technology. This makes me even more bullish & likely that Cathy would invest in this game changing tech. \n\nEDIT 3: A team member from ARKG (Cathie's fund for Genomics investing) has already contacted BNGO via Twitter. \n\nEDIT 4: Previous TESLA EXEC (Christopher Stewart) joined BNGO as CFO - news reported Aug 2020\n\nTLDR: buy BNGO before you miss the boat.\n\nTo the moon 🚀🚀🚀", "id": "kqfsy5", "created_utc": 1609788392.0, "score": 209, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 233, "comments": [{"body": "Up 1000% in the last month ?

Then over the weekend there was news of model Y pre orders in China reaching over 100k, which was obviously bullish. It is my opinion that the model Y news temporarily papered over the bad deliveries number which is why it was green today. Also note that the nio hype helped Tesla today as well.

{"title": "Reeeeeeeeecap of today's (and recent) market driving news (Jan 4, 2021 after market close)", "selftext": "* 2021 starts off with a bang as VIX shoots up an ungodly 22%+ during intraday high. During intraday low for the market, the Dow was down as much as -700 pts (-2.3%), Nasdaq -345 pts (-2.6%), and S&P -94 (-2.5%). WSB reeled in horror as stonk somehow doesn't always go up. Beyond renewed COVID fear, market sell-off accelerated in the morning after 10 AM as the market continues to keep an eye on the GA run-off election with polls increasingly being more favorable for the DNC candidates. No doubt an extra wrench was thrown to the GA GOP Senate campaigns as POTUS continues to pressure GA officials on figuring out votes - cuz that's totes normal thing for a sitting President to do.\n\n* For those WSBer who failed basic HS civics class, just one GOP win in the two run-off Senate seats will keep Biden's more progressive agenda at bay (and likely the recent tax cut intact) as the GOP and McTurtle retain control of the Senate. Conversely, Dems winning both seats will secure both legislative branch for Dems, as VP Harris be the tie breaking vote in the Senate. Will this mean an eventual bigger stimulus package? A renew market-sell off? Should ANTM, UNH, and others quiver in fear? Find out later this week as results will unlikely be clear even after polls are close on Tues night.\n\n* With renewed COVID fear as the UK variant likely running rampant undetected in the US, shares of travel sector are pressured today. In airlines, AAL closed down -4% to $15.13, UAL -3.75% to $41.63, and LUV -3.37% to $45.04 (similar price action across the sector for JBLU, SAVE, etc.). Cruise stocks took a bigger beating with NCLH down -6.69% to $23.73, RCL down -5.23% to $70.72, and CCL down -5.91% to $20.38. Conversely, safe plays and essential stores such as WMT, TGT, and COST are all up today at 1.65%, 0.62%, and 0.89% despite S&P being red.\n\n* Jack Ma, Alibaba's very public CEO has reportedly been missing in action in the past few months as speculation starts floating about his disappearance due to the CCP. While memes float about of Ma being tucked away in a Chinese state prison with Randy Marsh due to pissing off Pooh Bear, shares of BABA continues to be pressured despite a rebound last week as CCP's antitrust probe on both Alibaba and its subsidiary Ant Group chugs on. BABA closed the day -2.10% at $227.85, while competitors PDD closed -6.13% to $166.78, and JD closed the day -1.79% at $86.33. \n\n*  QS, the SPAC turned meme EV stock took a nice more than -40% dive today as shares sold off on... well, who the fuck knows why it sold off (PIPE shares became available and are no longer locked? I didn't look into the lockup period, someone let me know the dates). The EV battery maker took on a NKLA-like trajectory and rallied as high as $120 before steadily trimming its gains in the past week. For those who are adventurous in selling the IV, OTM Jan 15 puts such as 35p are going for $1.55 while 40p are going for $3.3. But honestly, do you really want to baghold QS at those pricing if assigned (cash secured)? Go with a spread, you dumb fuck. Shares closed the day down more than $34 (-40.84%) to $49.96. If you sold puts before today, you dun goofed.\n\n* QS edit: thanks to trojanattorney1 [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqi8e8/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_and_recent_market_driving/gi48nvd/): more early investor shares were available today and millions were dumped into the market. If you're trying to catch the QS knife, be warned as there are many more dilution to go. You can check recent filing [here](https://sec.report/Ticker/QS) if you're so inclined.\n\n*  Haven, the AMZN + BRK + JPM venture in \"disrupting\" health care has disbanded after a 3 year attempt. Turns out having sensible health care in America is hard as fuck. Shares of healthcare companies UNH, HUM, et al. were up during pre-market and morning hours, but faded through the day as overall macro pushed the sector down.\n\n*  In more \"I thought this is America\" news, more than 200 GOOGL employees and contractors in both the US and Canada have decided to unionized to promote a less shitty workplace and ethical business practices (once a upon a time, Google's motto was \"Do No Evil.\"). Collectively known as the Alphabet Workers Union, the group's aim is to start small and eventually amass enough membership to actually address some of the more lofty goals: namely pay and working conditions. GOOGL closed the day down -1.51%, though more likely due to overall macro than this thus far non-material news.\n\n*  Elon chan and his meme stock continues to kill whatever remaining short sellers are left, as TSLA reaches new ATH after Q4 delivery report. Despite the FY number being \"missed\" by 450 vehicles, the quarterly delivery of 180,570 vehicles handily beat Wall Street's estimate of about 174k vehicles and shares are up bigly to close up 3.42% at $729.77. How did we ever doubt those WSB degens who loaded up $3,500 strike Jan 15 calls pre-split which are now ITM!? Truly, they were ahead of the times in knowing that TSLA will shoot up an additional 76% in the next 3 months.\n\n*  On Chinese EV side of things, NIO delivered 7k vehicles in Dec 2020 while XPEV delivered 5,700 vehicles - both numbers are record \"growth\" for the two company which shows a YoY growth of 121% for NIO and 326% for XPEV. (WSB with OTM FDs know these \"growth\" well as their FDs goes from 100% in value but are still down all-time of at -85%). NIO closed the day up 9.75% to $53.49 and XPEV trimmed their intraday high of 10%+ to close up 2.97% at $44.10.\n\n*  In WSB meme stock land, things are a fairly mixed bag as GME continues to fade after reaching a recent 52-week high of $22.35. The definitely-not-going-bankrupt gaming retailer closed the day down -8.44% to $17.25. PLTR, despite being up more than 2% in pre-market, closed the day relatively flat at -0.76% to $23.37. Finally, steel gang got a respite today as MT closed the day up 4.59%, though intraday high was up as much as 8%.\n\n*  Looking for cheap and relatively \"responsible\" WSB meme stock play? You can do GME covered call and sell April 35c for about $1.6 (though selling on a green day for $2+ is probably a better idea). This will net you 100 shares of GME for less than $15.70 per share and cap your imaginary gains at $35 if the squeeze does happen. (All those GME DDs can't be wrong?)  Conversely, you can go with GME April 20c/35c debit call spread for a \"low price\" of $2.4 per spread, or for those who prefer to sell FDs to fellow WSBer, poor man's covered call of Jan 2022 $25c and selling weeklies and/or April 35c will suffice. At the end of the day, the fact that April 35c has so much value still to it should be taken advantage if GME has a green day. For MT, June debit call spread is probably the way to go, with 25c/35c a possible spread. These are not financial advice and if you listen to a random stranger online and lose your pants on the play - then that's on you, you dumb stupid motherfucker.\n\n*  DJI closed down -382 pts (-1.25%), IXIC closed down -189 pts (-1.47%), SPX -55 pts (-1.48%), and RUT is down -28 pts (-1.47%). Notable numbers and ERs this week: ISM manufacturing index tomorrow at 10 AM ET, BBBY reports on Thursday before market opens while MU reports after market close. Load up on those MU 90c for 7/20 - this time it'll definitely hit!\n\n(Last week's recap: none cuz I was enjoying a NYE covid yacht party.
