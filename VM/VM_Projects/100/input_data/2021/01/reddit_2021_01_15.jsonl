{"title": "Bet on the recovery of the travel industry with this 1 yr option play", "selftext": "The history of financial markets tells us that these good times won’t last forever. Eventually, a significant correction will come along to rain on the parade.\n\nThat said, I believe select sectors of the market – like 5G stocks and battery metals plays – will continue to zigzag higher amid the volatility.\n\nGiven the robust travel recovery I’m anticipating later this year, I’m recommending a great company in the sector:\n\n**Sabre Corp. (SABR)**, a technology leader in the travel industry, is one of the travel industry’s “Big 3” global distributions systems (GDS).\n\n**Amadeus IT Group SA (AMADY)** and the privately held Travelport are the other two. Together, these three companies make up 97% of all travel bookings worldwide.\n\nSpain-based Amadeus is the largest of the three. It processes about 40% of travel bookings worldwide. Texas-based Sabre is No. 2, with a 35% market share. Travelport is No.3, with a 22% market share.\n\n**More than 400 airlines and 1 million hotels use the Sabre system to process travel bookings.** Every major travel website also uses Sabre. The company’s client list is a “who’s who” of the travel industry:\n\n* **Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG):** Kayak, Agoda, Priceline, CheapFlights, Momondo, OpenTable, RentalCars\n* **Expedia Group Inc. (EXPE):** Orbitz, Travelocity, [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com/), [TripAdvisor.com](http://tripadvisor.com/), [SeatGuru.com](http://seatguru.com/), [Cheaptickets.com](http://cheaptickets.com/)\n* **Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)**\n* **Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (HLT)**\n* **Marriot International (MAR)**\n* **Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H)**\n\nIn all, Sabre’s system processes 2.5 million bookings every minute.\n\nSabre generates its revenues from the volume of transactions it processes, not the dollar value of those transactions. So when travel activity increases, Sabre’s revenues also increase. The connection between the two is very close and predictable.\n\nTherefore, when the COVID pandemic torpedoed travel activity, Sabre’s revenues tumbled. The company’s second-quarter revenues collapsed more than 90% year-over-year.\n\nNot surprisingly, Sabre’s share price also collapsed.\n\nBut that vicious cycle is becoming a virtuous cycle of rising travel activity… and rising Sabre revenues. From the second quarter to the third quarter, revenues more than tripled.\n\nAnd this favorable trend is certain to continue strengthening in 2021.\n\nThere’s no mystery here. As the pandemic recedes, travel activity will increase… and Sabre’s revenues will climb. The share price should follow.\n\nOnce travel activity recovers to pre-COVID levels, Sabre’s share price could easily double from current levels.\n\nBut the company has not been simply sitting on its hands during the last 10 months, waiting for the inevitable recovery. Instead, it has taken decisive steps to fortify its competitive moat.\n\nSpecifically, it has collaborated with Google to migrate its IT infrastructure to Google Cloud. Sabre followed up that initiative by partnering with Google last fall to develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technology platform that is an industry-first.\n\nAs Sabre explains:\n\n>*The technology, known as Sabre Travel AI, is infused with Google’s state-of-the-art AI technology and advanced machine-learning capabilities that will help its travel-industry customers to deliver highly relevant and personalized content more quickly.*\n\nSundar Narasimhan, president of Sabre Labs, further explains:\n\n>*Sabre Travel AI is a game-changer. We are proud to be working with Google to build technologies that will seek to re-define the way travel companies do business, and turn the insights derived from analyses into repeatable, scalable operations…With the creation of Sabre Travel AI, we are rebuilding our platform on cloud-native, data-driven technology that can be integrated into the existing and future products that Sabre offers. We are combining Google Cloud’s infrastructure, AI and machine-learning capabilities with Sabre’s deep travel domain knowledge to create, not next, but third-generation solutions that we believe are smarter, faster and more cost-effective – a first-of-its-kind in travel.*\n\nThe company expects to integrate Sabre Travel AI into certain products in its existing portfolio and begin rolling them out into the market over the next few months.\n\nFrom an earnings perspective, the Wall Street community expects Sabre to generate about $300 million in gross earnings (EBITDA) next year, and then ramp up to more than $600 million in 2022.\n\nIf the company hits those targets, the stock would be trading for 12 times 2021 EBITDA and six times 2022 EBITDA.\n\nBut I expect earnings to ramp up more quickly than that. I also expect the company’s technology and AI investments to amplify the company’s recovery and growth trajectory over the next couple of years.\n\n$1 billion of EBITDA by 2023 is feasible.\n\nOne word of caution: The company’s balance sheet isn’t bulletproof. It has “B-rated” credit, which puts Sabre deep into junk territory.\n\nThat said, only $500 million of the company’s $5.6 billion in debt outstanding comes due over the next two years. Offsetting that near-term obligation, Sabre is sitting on more than $1.5 billion in cash.\n\nIn other words, it possesses ample liquidity to ride out the rest of the COVID storm… unless the storm rages anew and lasts well into 2022.\n\n**Bottom line:** I consider Sabre to be an excellent speculation on recovering travel. To make this play, I’m recommending a one-year call option on the stock.\n\n**tl;dr:** **Sabre Corp. (SABR)**, is a tech leader in the travel industry. **More than 400 airlines and 1 million hotels use the Sabre system to process travel bookings.** Sabre generates its revenues from the volume of transactions it processes, not the dollar value of those transactions. So when travel activity increases, Sabre’s revenues also increase and the share price should follow. It is also using AI to become more efficient and thus more profitable.\n\n*Buy the* ***Sabre Corp. (SABR) January 2022 $12 call options*** *for $3.60 or less. The current offer price is $3.30.*\n\nI am not a financial advisor.

What I read, I KIND Of understood. I understood the gist of it: that they're not very reliable long-term. I will try to explain it in the best way I can with my limited brain capacity.\n\nSo, UCO says it can give you 2x or 3x the profits on an index, so oil, in this case. The reason UCO can do this is because it's a LEVERAGED ETF. The way it earns this leverage is through debt which itself is obtained from options and other stuff. So pretty much, they like, borrow money and spend it to get those extra 3x earnings on the index.\n\nUnfortunately, just like they can get 2x or 3x profits, they can also get 2c or 3x losses. This is true of any leveraged ETF.\n\nLet's say you have an example leveraged ETF which we will denominate as ICUP. ICUP leverages the S&P500, let's say. So if the S&P500 goes up 1%, ICUP goes up 2 or 3%,which is good for you. But if the SP goes down 1% then ICUP goes down 2 or 3%. That's just how it works.\n\nNow, remember I mentioned options? Those things have decay or something like that, which means they have to be paid back within a certain amount of time. So  that money that ICUP (or UCO) used, which came from options, will have to be paid back eventually. I think those are like on 1 or 2 year terms, idk. So the stock inherently will go down, usually.\n\nFurthermore, UCO recently (I believe April?) did a 25-to-1 conversion or something like that, which kind of inflated the prices of the past? What I read is that pretty much, if you went back in time to the day where it supposedly traded for $540, it wouldn't go for $540,it would go for much less. \n\nNow, I haven't been investing long and I am sorry for my terrible grammar and writing, I am a bit hungover but yeah.

Delta tells you how much the option will change based on a change in the underlying. Delta is smaller the further otm the option. Gamma shows how much delta will change based on a change in the underlying. As stock price approaches the strike price, gamma increases linearly, increasing delta super linearly, which increases the option value super super linearly.\n\nAs for your question, think in percentages. If xyz goes up both options will increase in value. The 10c will go up more, as it will have a higher delta,  but as a percentage it will be small. The 13c will go up a little, but as a percentage will be big. Generally atm options will experience better percentage growth than otm options, but if the stock takes off the otm will have a better percentage. For example, in the extreme case, if the stock took off to $25, both options would have a delta near 1, meaning the option value goes up by 1$ for each $1 raise in xyz. But, the $13c has a lower cost basis so an additional $1 in value is a greater percent increase than for the $10c. \n\nSo, to answer your question, if xyz is $10 now but you think it will be $15 soon, a $13c costing $1 will be worth 2$ (15-13), or twice the value, while a $10c costing $4 will be worth $5, or a 25% increase. \n\nAll that said, this is pretty elementary option stuff, so I would recommend paper trading to see what happens if this is confusing.

{"title": "PLUG 🔌 will soar way beyond the current price point this year.", "selftext": "\n\nAlright, I know there are a lot of skeptics out there on fuel cell. I was one myself for a number of years. Musk even called it “fool cell”. But the truth of the matter is as technology advances, fuel cell has been proven to be more commercially feasible. Fuel cell isn’t just applied to niche applications anymore and is increasingly adopted in other end-markets (commercial vehicles, aerospace, robotics, etc.). In other words, TAM has become enormous. Fuel cell is argued to to be cleaner and more weight efficient and to provide more range than batteries. I’m not going to debate on this. In my opinions, both EVs and fuel cell could co-exist in the future given the world’s accelerated transition to clean energy. \n\nPLUG’s two groundbreaking partnerships with SK Group and Renault validated the increased fuel cell adoption around the world and only marked the beginning of the fuel cell era. PLUG already has an established base of blue chip customers such as Amazon, Walmart, DHL, and Home Depot. PLUG’s partnerships with these customers have continued to expand over time. Interesting fact is that Amazon is not only a key customer but also a shareholder. I expect more partnerships with big names to be under way. Marsh projected revenue to significantly grow to $1.2 billion by 2024 but that could be revised to be more optimistic based on growth. \n\nIn terms of capacity, PLUG is in the process of building out its first gigafactory this year along with 5 hydrogen stations across the country by 2024. PLUG is in a nice position to continue to expand its infrastructure to scale and handle the increased demand. \n\nIn terms of competition, there are no serious competitors that could threaten PLUG in the long run. Unlike EVs, barriers to entry for fuel cell are high due to the capital intensive nature of the business. It took PLUG many years of growing pain, let alone significant capital investments, to get to today’s position as a clear leader in fuel cell.\n\nIn conclusion, I’ve become a firm believer in fuel cell and believe PLUG is ready to capitalize on the rapid growth in fuel cell applications as the next “Tesla of fuel cell”.", "id": "ky5wkh", "created_utc": 1610750782.0, "score": 343, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 209, "comments": [{"body": "Whenever I see it rise, I tell myself it's too late to buy now.

I will say it has been a few years since I've been in H2 industry, so please correct me if I'm wrong with my information.  I do hope that this will help people make informed decisions with what they are getting into and not just jumping on a bandwagon.  This is my understanding of Plug Power's business model:\n\nImagine I'm a large online retailer and I build a warehouse/distribution center near a major city that I want to deliver goods to. I need to figure out what type of forklifts I want to use. Prior to H2 fuel cell powered, there were two non-ideal options:\n\n1. I can use a petroleum powered forklift. Probably not the best idea to be dumping a bunch of CO and CO2 in my facility with thousands of workers breathing in those fumes.  OSHA and whatever the European equivalent is would probably not be happy.\n2. I can use Battery Powered. No fumes, but for example lets say every 8 hours or so my forklift has to get plugged in for four hours to recharge. After 1000 or so battery cycles, I need to do maintenance to replace the batteries. Ultimately while this is safer than using petroleum, my forklifts spend 1/3 of their time being recharged and I have to continually do maintenance on the forklift batteries.  Overall this affects the efficiency and productivity of my warehouse.\n\nWhat Plug Power's solution is:\n\nI can have plug power put a hydrogen fueling station on my property, convert my existing battery powered forklifts to utilize hydrogen fuel cells. The only waste product of the H2 fuel cell process is water which solves the indoor emissions issue. The H2 just needs to be compressed into a fuel tank which only takes a couple minutes. Now my forklifts can run continuously with very little downtime and without battery maintenance.  The fuel cells pretty much last forever, so one less thing to maintain.\n\nNow imagine I have invested all of this money to put a H2 fueling station on my property, but I need to deliver stuff from my warehouse into town. Wouldn't it be nice if I could just use the same fueling station for my delivery vehicles to make their milk runs instead of having another fueling depot on-site? I imagine this is what they are partnering with Renault to do.  If you look at their partnership they are looking to develop commercial light vehicles which look very similar to the vans amazon and other online retailers use to deliver their products directly to their customers.\n\nIs this or will this be green? Most hydrogen is produced from Natural Gas, and I don't envision that changing any time in my lifetime.  Them using \"Green\" H2 is somewhat of a publicity stunt.  If electrolyzers were cost efficient, the hydrogen majors would all be using them to produce hydrogen, but they don't.  I think if they try to become a major H2 producer, they will definitely go out of business.  I imagine Ultimately Plug will continue to purchase H2 from the major H2 suppliers for years to come and focus on what they are good at (fuel cell technology).  \n\nThat being said, I don't really think being green really matters, since the solution is better than the material handling alternatives. I know there are other uses for hydrogen fuel cells, but to my understanding this is the major one fueling their growth.\n\nIn terms of it's market.  I highly doubt any of us will be driving a consumer H2 car anytime soon.  The benefits of H2 fuel cells do not outweigh gasoline vehicles or even battery powered on the road for consumers.   But if you look at what they are doing with Renault, they are focusing on light commercial vehicles I'd imagine to sell an entire transportation package to their customers.  This seems to me to have a lot of value.  I believe that there is definitely a lot of room to grow in this space, especially with online retailing continuing to grow.

It can also be recharged within minutes and a lot faster than batteries. Fuel cell is ultimately a cleaner, energy-dense (lighter), and easier to recharge energy source.

I have never seen something like this. However, there is no room for panic. Apple is expected to have historic earnings in less than 2 weeks and the stock experienced a huge dip today, GME fell hard also and every fucking autist here was buying it. We finished the day at 8 percent up.\n\nI would not judge anyone who sales next week, not everyone needs to be a long term investor, but fuck the paper handed mfos who bought shares today and immediatly sold 1 hour later. How much can you actually lose? The absolute bottom is 4 per share and that would put the company at 2.5 bil valuation. The brand name is worth more than that and BB is a significant player in the IoT, Cybersecurity and EV industries. The cyber firm Crowdstrike has  180 mil revenue compared to BB near 1 billion and is valued at 50 billion, ten times more than BB. If you are gonna paper hand, at least wait till you are an in profit, the retards  who sold GME after the last dip are deeply regretting it now. \n\nPS: Today was tough, but the battle has just began.
