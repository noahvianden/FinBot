{"title": "Clover Health ($CLOV) will moon soon", "selftext": "Alright listen up folks. I know this industry isn’t sexy like EV or FinTech, but this space is important. Let me tell you why Clover Health ($CLOV) is going to see a great returns within the coming months!\n\n$CLOV merged with $IPOC (Chamath’s SPA). Chamath’s track record speaks for itself. His investments including SPCE, OPEN, and his other current PIPE investment have all done really well and are quality companies. Since the merger with Clover Health, Chamath upped his stake in the Clover Health and now owns roughly 30%. Not long after, a 13D was filed by Clover’s CEO to up his stake in the company and now owns around 37%. The CEO has a proven track record of building successful healthcare businesses on the services side that he’s sold for billions. Another notable mention is Bill and Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea. She is on the Board of Directors for Clover and has been a believer in the company for a while now. She recently opted to exercise her shares rather than sell after merging because she’s in it for the long haul.  if there’s one thing we know, it’s that the Clinton family gets their bag. Numerous other executives at Clover and Social Capital have done the same  including Ian Osborne. There’s 70+ institutions holding the stock but other notable “smart money” includes backing from Google and Sequoia Capital. If you don’t know what Sequoia capital is, I encourage you to look up previous companies they’ve invested in. Follow the smart money 💎💎💎\n\n\nLet’s talk some numbers. Medicare Advantage spending was $270 billion in 2019, and is expected to expand to $590 billion by 2025. As of now $CLOV is only in 34 counties. That doesn’t sound that impressive at first glance. However, just being in 34 counties generated them 507M in revenue. They already said this year they’ll be in 108 counties which will take their revenue to just shy of a billion. There’s 3,000 counties in the US. Being in 108 counties is just 0.03% penetration of the total addressable market.... They’ve already said they want to be in every corner of the country and the cash generated from this IPO will help them expand to get there. Their market share is growing exponentially (9x faster than its closest competitors) and revenues are growing 50%+. Speaking of total addressable market, 10,000 boomers turn 65 a day. That’s an extremely concrete and measurable customer base that can only expand. We now have president Biden who has sworn to revamp Medicare and possibly lower age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 60. If that happens, that’s fucking millions of extra potential customers a month. \n\nLet’s talk a little more about what Clover does. They’ve proven to build Medicare Advantage plans that balance quality and cost. They’re fixated on how they can deliver the lowest cost possible. Any business obsessed with delivering value and cost savings to consumers is always successful. Always. To me this is reinforced through their very impressive partnerships with retail giants in the counties they operate in including: Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Costco. But wait, that’s not all they do. Here’s what makes $CLOV special. Clover is a double edged sword. In addition to their Medicare business, the other side of the business (that can be leveraged in conjunction to their Medicare plans) is called Clover Assistant. This is their proprietary AI focused and data driven software. It allows doctors to leverage historical patient data in order to create more effective treatment plans. This results in lowered costs, fewer visits, and better outcomes for everyone involved. Think of this as Einstein for Salesforce CRM or Watson for IBM. Clover Assistant can be the Einstein for the EHRS (electronic health record systems). This industry is prime for disruption. There are very few tech advancements in the healthcare world from an operations perspective. Keep in mind this side of the business is still in its infancy with only 2000 physicians on it. They plan to ramp exponentially with an upcoming direct contracting model in addition to using proceeds from IPO for further market penetration. \n\nFuture catalysts include:\n\n-$20 price target from Bank of America (doesn’t seem to be on web yet but pic from Bloomberg Terminal shared on Twitter) \n\n-they were invited to speak at the prestigious JPM Health Conference on 1/12. Check out the deep dive presentation. Tons of great growth states there. JP Morgan coverage/price target soon?\n\n-they are presenting at the 4th annual Medicare Advantage Leadership Innovations Conference on 1/27 where they mentioned they will reveal their latest currently announced partnership. Could be great PR. \n\n-Biden has laid out themes of what he will discuss in the coming week each day. He will discuss his healthcare plans on 1/28 where he will surely discuss his Medicare plans including his plans to lower the Medicare eligibility age \n\n-future PR from Chamath, Clover, major news outlets, and price targets. There is very little PR on the web about Clover Health currently as a recent IPO. Once that picks up we are going to the moon!\n\n-technicals: there’s been a lot of speculation that the suits have held this stock down to shake out weak hands and load up before the fireworks begin. The stock has been heavily accumulating in a descending wedge. Looks like the short volume is decreasing and when PR starts to come out, shorts will cover, basically making this a mini squeeze out. Chart looks ready. \n\n-float: a lot of the public float has been eaten up with the executives involved increasing their share. 67% is owned between $CLOV CEO Vivek and Chamath alone. According to Yahoo Finance data, there’s only 11M float left of 145M shares outstanding. That’s not too much left for retail to buy especially once there’s more eyeballs on this stock via PTs and PR. That’s getting close to low float levels. Low float + short squeeze = 🚀\n\nThis to me seems like a no brainer especially under this new administration. See you all on the moon 🌚 \n\nPosition: YOLO averaged up to $14 with entire life savings", "id": "l31s4g", "created_utc": 1611364126.0, "score": 374, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 178, "comments": [{"body": "I have no idea what you said\n\nI’m in", "score": 138, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao I’ve been doing this lately and the gains are great.

So if you spend 50k buying the calls, thats is your maximum risk. On the upside, your gain potential is infinite.\n\nMost call buyers rarely exercise the option- which means using it as a means to buy a stock at it discounted price. What they do is sell it to someone else, most of the time, and take that profit (and the initial fee to buy the options) and do what they want with it. If you do want to buy the shares using your options, you do need the cash or enough margin power to do it.\n\nYou can hold the option open until the expiration date, and you WANT it to hit your strike and beyond before the expiration, the sooner the better. But you have to be careful about your exit- Time and a falling price are your greatest enemies in buying calls. I've had calls worth be worth 20 grand at one point, go down to worthless because of the timing, greeks, price, etc. I've also sold options at a loss, when if I had held them longer, they would have made money. It can cut both ways... so you have to learn about these complex things before you put money on the line.\n\nThat is just the beginner course on options, there are many things you need to consider.

Those became 500 shares at cost basis of approximately $80/share post-split. These shares are in a standard brokerage account. I have since purchased another 160 shares mostly in my IRA. Those 660 shares of TSLA now make up 20% of my invested portfolio (including 401k and 529s). My preset target when I rethought investing few years ago was no more than 20% of portfolio would be allocated to individual shares (I also own AAPL, DIS and AMZN so the 4 stocks now make up 33% of my portfolio).\n\nMy question is: What do you think of setting a stop-limit at $750 or $800 for the lot of 500 shares?\n\nI would be happy to sell at those prices in case the stock fell because of not hitting high market expectations. That would still leave me 160 shares and would balance out my portfolio a bit more. However I don't necessarily want to miss gains so I could also keep riding the stock higher and adjust the stop-limit every 60 days.\n\nThoughts?\n\nThanks!", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "If you don’t understand why this is stupid then go for it...\n\nIf you want to hedge losses sell deep otm covered calls.

{"title": "Clover Health ($CLOV) will moon soon 🚀🚀", "selftext": "Alright listen up folks. I know this industry isn’t sexy like EV or FinTech, but this space is important. Let me tell you why Clover Health ($CLOV) is going to the fucking moon soon 🚀🚀🚀🚀 \n\n$CLOV merged with $IPOC (Chamath’s SPAC). Chamath’s track record speaks for itself. His investments including SPCE, OPEN, and his other current PIPE investment have all done really well and are quality companies. Since the merger with Clover Health, Chamath upped his stake in the Clover Health and now owns roughly 30%. Not long after, a 13D was filed by Clover’s CEO to up his stake in the company and now owns around 37%. The CEO has a proven track record of building successful healthcare businesses on the services side that he’s sold for billions. Another notable mention is Bill and Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea. She is on the Board of Directors for Clover and has been a believer in the company for a while now. She recently opted to exercise her shares rather than sell after merging because she’s in it for the long haul. 🚀🚀🚀🚀 if there’s one thing we know, it’s that the Clinton family gets their bag. Numerous other executives at Clover and Social Capital have done the same  including Ian Osborne. There’s 70+ institutions holding the stock but other notable “smart money” includes backing from Google and Sequoia Capital. If you don’t know what Sequoia capital is, I encourage you to look up previous companies they’ve invested in. Follow the smart money 💎💎💎\n\n\nLet’s talk some numbers. Medicare Advantage spending was $270 billion in 2019, and is expected to expand to $590 billion by 2025. As of now $CLOV is only in 34 counties. That doesn’t sound that impressive at first glance. However, just being in 34 counties generated them 507M in revenue. They already said this year they’ll be in 108 counties which will take their revenue to just shy of a billion. There’s 3,000 counties in the US. Being in 108 counties is just 0.03% penetration of the total addressable market.... They’ve already said they want to be in every corner of the country and the cash generated from this IPO will help them expand to get there. Their market share is growing exponentially (9x faster than its closest competitors) and revenues are growing 50%+. Speaking of total addressable market, 10,000 boomers turn 65 a day. That’s an extremely concrete and measurable customer base that can only expand. We now have president Biden who has sworn to revamp Medicare and possibly lower age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 60. If that happens, that’s fucking millions of extra potential customers a month. 🚀🚀\n\nLet’s talk a little more about what Clover does. They’ve proven to build Medicare Advantage plans that balance quality and cost. They’re fixated on how they can deliver the lowest cost possible. Any business obsessed with delivering value and cost savings to consumers is always successful. Always. To me this is reinforced through their very impressive partnerships with retail giants in the counties they operate in including: Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Kroger, Costco. But wait, that’s not all they do. Here’s what makes $CLOV special. Clover is a double edged sword. In addition to their Medicare business, the other side of the business (that can be leveraged in conjunction to their Medicare plans) is called Clover Assistant. This is their proprietary AI focused and data driven software. It allows doctors to leverage historical patient data in order to create more effective treatment plans. This results in lowered costs, fewer visits, and better outcomes for everyone involved. Think of this as Einstein for Salesforce CRM or Watson for IBM. Clover Assistant can be the Einstein for the EHRS (electronic health record systems). This industry is prime for disruption. There are very few tech advancements in the healthcare world from an operations perspective. Keep in mind this side of the business is still in its infancy with only 2000 physicians on it. They plan to ramp exponentially with an upcoming direct contracting model in addition to using proceeds from IPO for further market penetration. \n\nFuture catalysts include:\n\n-$20 price target from Bank of America (doesn’t seem to be on web yet but pic from Bloomberg Terminal shared on Twitter) \n\n-they were invited to speak at the prestigious JPM Health Conference on 1/12. Check out the deep dive presentation. Tons of great growth states there. JP Morgan coverage/price target soon?\n\n-they are presenting at the 4th annual Medicare Advantage Leadership Innovations Conference on 1/27 where they mentioned they will reveal their latest currently announced partnership. Could be great PR. \n\n-Biden has laid out themes of what he will discuss in the coming week each day. He will discuss his healthcare plans on 1/28 where he will surely discuss his Medicare plans including his plans to lower the Medicare eligibility age \n\n-future PR from Chamath, Clover, major news outlets, and price targets. There is very little PR on the web about Clover Health currently as a recent IPO. Once that picks up we are going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n-technicals: there’s been a lot of speculation that the suits have held this stock down to shake out weak hands and load up before the fireworks begin. The stock has been heavily accumulating in a descending wedge. Looks like the short volume is decreasing and when PR starts to come out, shorts will cover, basically making this a mini squeeze out.

The squeeze last week plowed right through that firewall.

The OTM calls (I haven’t verified them, but I’ll take your word on that) is probably due to a “Second Opinion” AI they demonstrated in a virtual radiology conference on Jan 6th, 2021. (I couldn’t find a link to the actual demo, but the other company demos are [here.](https://www.nanox.vision)) \n\nThey have some interesting tech. Their electron source is not filament-based (normal ones use a heavy metal filament, such as tantalum, and run a current through it like a lightbulb, then they slam those electrons into an x-ray emitting material using magnets. Filaments like those generate a lot of free electrons randomly, so the x-rays generated can’t easily be controlled. Control≈resolution.) They claim the nanotechnology electron source is digital, allowing them more control over the electrons generated. In the demo, they used less power to generate the image, so that might be true.\n\nTheir 3-D imaging device looks cool. High res images they can shuffle through layers to see different things. In that demo, they said they don’t have approval for the 3-D imaging device they created, but from what I understand device approval is easier to get when there are similar devices, so that may not be a huge obstacle. (Tons of imaging devices out there.)\n\nI’m guessing there will be a short bull run as news of it picks up and gets translated into mainstream media. However, since they are in the medical research field and haven’t/won’t post a profit for some time, don’t expect it to go to the moon in the short term. Good long term bet tho.\n\nI’m not an expert, this is not advice, I’m just an internet autist with a physics degree I don’t use.

SRPT is a big player in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases. [**SRPT is 1.36% of Aunt Cathie's ARKG**](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_GENOMIC_REVOLUTION_MULTISECTOR_ETF_ARKG_HOLDINGS.pdf) **ETF (ranked #30 in the ETF at the time of this writing)** most of which she added recently.\n\nIn the past couple of years, they've been working on cures for **Duchenne muscular dystrophy**, which is a genetic disease that weakens a kid's muscles (usually ends up with them not being able to walk) and occurs in 1/3500 kids.\n\nEarlier in January, they released the primary results of the trial for one of the treatments (SRP-9001) and it was not very promising. As a result, the stock price dropped by about 60%.\n\nThe CEO [claimed](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/07/2155237/0/en/Sarepta-Therapeutics-Announces-Top-line-Results-for-Part-1-of-Study-102-Evaluating-SRP-9001-its-Investigational-Gene-Therapy-for-the-Treatment-of-Duchenne-Muscular-Dystrophy.html) (which I can't verify) that the lukewarm results of the trial were mainly caused by an unfortunate and unlikely event. In every trial, you have volunteers. Some of those volunteers are in better condition (the disease hasn't progressed much yet) and some in worse condition. A computer program randomly assigned each volunteer to be in the treatment group (receive the actual drug) or in the control group (receiver placebo, i.e. sugar pill). None of the volunteers and the people administering the drugs know if a person is in which group. Also once done, it's not possible to re-hash the assignment. Anyway, according to the CEO, with bad luck, most of the people who were initially in worse condition get assigned to the treatment group and the healthier ones to the control group. This skews the results toward showing the treatment is ineffective.\n\nIn the secondary trial (ongoing now) those kids who were previously in the placebo group are getting the actual treatment. So the results may be promising this time. But it will take time for the results to come out.\n\n[SRPT Chart](https://preview.redd.it/fhuo37gn64d61.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=af2ed01539f704aaa3555e8b9d425ce22264a841)\n\nSRPT has also developed another treatment for Duchenne called Casimerson that has been awarded a priority review by the FDA on 2/25/2021. If approved, this can gap up to where it used to be before the drop. The price may also move up monotonously until then in anticipation of approval.\n\nFrom [biopharmcatalyst.com](https://biopharmcatalyst.com):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1x17uqw374d61.png?width=1110&format=png&auto=webp&s=974f7c2deb936add6033f6ee46251c3c4a6900f4\n\nPharma stocks are tricky. A single trial can send them to the moon or the earth's core. Gap-ups are also unexpected. Sometimes they happen quickly, sometimes they take months if not years to return to where they used to be. If history is any indication, SRPT usually recovers within 3 months of a downfall.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/293ks15u64d61.png?width=1310&format=png&auto=webp&s=7779ce17d73db99c0fcad7249b0f7767e6afc264\n\nThat's it!\n\nPosition again: SRPT 100C 3/19/2021", "id": "l3g3l5", "created_utc": 1611421980.0, "score": 145, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "I'm already in on SRPT.

ITM calls do decay, but the option decay on them is a lot les than an OTM call.  In that way, they are an implicit hedge against maximum downside. Also, if the stock is in free fall, while their intrinsic value (price - strike) will be falling, their option value/extrinsic value will be increasing, so they may hedge a sharp selloff better (but still will lose money) than a direct hold of the stock.\n\nFor example, as of this writing, a Feb 12 call@ 55 prices at $18.50 a share. The intrinsic value is $10, so the option value is $8.50. In contrast, a $70 call, which is slightly OTM, was pricing at $13. So you get a big discount on that option value, which would kick up on a decline. In order to own the same exposure with stock, you pay $65 a share, but with this, you pay $18.5 a share.

My theory: This is showing more hallmarks of Blue Apron squeeze than a short squeeze.\n\n**Short term (coming week):**\n\n* I agree with the gamma squeeze explanation (and I learnt something new!) which means Monday morning will be volatile, likely gapping up and maybe shooting up from FOMO (maybe between $80~$100, or higher)\n\n* We top out between 9:45~10 am then it heads downwards. I expect a ton of retailers to sell and cash out (including a couple of whales) which should bring downward pressure.\n\n* We go back down to $40~$50 (can be wrong about this range) before buyers come in again. This time though, we should expect bigger institutional buyers coming in as well as short-covering.\n\n**Medium term (after next week):**\n\n* We'll stay around that range till earnings or some other announcement from RC (for ex: increasing his stake in the company). Remember, long-term thesis is for a turnaround but that hasn't happened yet. We're putting money on expectation and hyping that. Most retailers don't have the patience to wait for that either as much as they say they will hold till $1000.\n\n* Doesn't make sense for RC to increase his stake at current prices unless he's already done it and it hasn't been announced yet. I'm sure he will at some point.\n\n* I don't think we'll see short-covering at current levels because this price movement is not sustainable and they know that. When you've got shorts holding onto TSLA after losing $38B in 2020, GME is pocket change. They can afford to wait a couple of weeks.\n\n* I do think the price movement caught them off-guard enough to revisit the short-thesis and they will cover instead of doubling down on the short-bets. As I imagine, the turnaround may fail but risking the money to find out may not be worth it for many.\n\n**Long term**\n\n* If the turnaround is executed as well as we hope, I'm sure it'll cross $40B.

Girls love watching beauty youtubers for makeup reviews and tutorials. I haven’t really seen beauty youtubers talk about KKW in a while (nor Kylie)\n\nLooking at all the makeup brands under Coty, a majority of them are drugstore brands.

They still don't own a single brand I would put on my face BUT I wish they had been in my portfolio since they peaked at $15.\n\nI think Coty will do something similar. They still haven't made it back to their pre covid stock price. Which was lower than revlon's. However they own better brands. For example they own both OPI and Sally Hansen. I bet you have at least one bottle by them in your bathroom. I know I do.\n\nBitches love Sephora, that's true. But outside of GME holders? Bitches in this country is broke. I think drug store brands will do just fine in this economy. I've been to the nail salon once since covid started. It was a miserable and depressing experience.
