These sizings are called 'nodes'. \n* Chips require redesigns to work on different nodes (varying levels required depending on how new node is and if changing b/w different manufacturers).\n* Cost normally goes up the newer the node.\n\nSo:\n\n* Automotive chips could be made much smaller and power-efficient if using newer nodes. (cost might go up per unit tho)\n* However, Automotive companies don't want to spend money updating designs to new nodes. They are also risk-averse and older nodes are less likely to 'fail'.\n* Tesla is known for making their own designs for some of their chips, and I wouldn't be surprised if when Elon was talking about 'using other chips' he meant that Tesla is using chips made on newer production nodes.\n* What's unclear is if Tesla had a hand in pushing for the use of newer nodes if it was solely the supplier who led this decision.\n\nTLDR; Legacy auto is using 2002 technology to make their automotive semiconductors because of risk aversion. Lots of room to increase the production of semi's if they move to newer fabs.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "I had an interview at ASML (turned them down) where the dude said they want ultra reliable chips for automobile apps, like airbag deployment. Cannot have bad yield per wafer there. Sometimes old is gold.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The issue is not yield per wafer rather how reliable the chips are (probably some correlation between these). Total useable dies from one wafer is a better measure, and you can almost guarantee you will get more dies from a 7nm than a 130nm. The yield rate for Ryzen chiplets on TSMC 7nm is like 90%+ good dies or something wild. The automotive chips would be orders of magnitude smaller which would result in even higher yields.\n\nThey also didnt just start using 130nm last week. They have likely been on that node for 5+ years. So logically the node 5 years after 130nm would have the same reliability profile as the 130nm chips when they moved to that node, i.e. 45nm intel came out in 2007.\n\nCPU/GPUs run on the most recent node and perform almost flawlessly with billions of transistors. I really don't buy that the failure chance is THAT much higher that it makes sense to make a chip 20x larger and on technology from 20 years ago.\n\nI think also the point is that when it's a status quo its fine to use the older node, but when the supply chain has issues such as this, you should pivot quickly to newer nodes to improve supply (assuming that there is free capacity on these nodes). Automakers do not want to retape, they want chip makers to build more 130nm capacity. This is stupid.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This makes far more sense than what that doofus told me.

There's the pilot line that they're using to figure out production, and then there's the \"roadrunner\" line to scale up production. I believe Musk talked about the road runner line being the one where they get it to go fast, and how they're at the point of finding bottle necks and problems while increasing the speed\n* The Road Runner line(s) will probably be just considered regular production once all the bugs are ironed out, with a pretty respectable 10 GWh/year of production. This is probably enough to do something like the new Roadster, and/or maybe a Plaid+ out of Freemont, or maybe to start Semi production?\n* For now I think they're just stockpiling 4680's that come off the roadrunner line. It seems like the yields are high enough that they're happy with them and are working on increasing speed (and buying/installing equipment for other factories). My guess is that these stockpiled 4680s go in to structural packs for the Austin Model Ys. It seems like they think this is enough to get initial production going, and then as the roadrunner line speeds up, it's hopefully enough to keep up with Model Y production in Austin\n* Then of course they'll need local production of 4680s at Austin to really scale up production. And that's the equipment they're installing now, which should hopefully be running sometime next year?\n\nIf Austin Model Y production scales up much faster than the cell production, they might be able to use 2170s from Giga Nevada? I think Panasonic said they were increasing production up to 40 GWh/year there? They could also use 2170s from suppliers, or potentially LFP cells from suppliers?

Over the past seven days we saw +308 thousand shares of new short selling, worth $313 million, a +1% increase in shares shorted with Tesla’s stock price rising +18%.

Salesforce jumped 25% the day it was added to DJIA. You can only imagine the impact on stock like TSLA. \n6) 25k car unveil late 2022 ? Mike drop by Elon. \n7) 4680 in cars \n8) FSD licensing deal with other automaker. Higher probability as the time goes on. Will lead to another awakening and rerating  by Wall Street.

How much of a dumb fuck would I be trying to answer them in 5 sentences?  Oh and thanks for reading. Much love!\n\nEDIT 2:  To bring the proper gravitas to this situation I'd like to explain how insane the prices are....  \n> 1.5 years ago I was selling steel at .35 per lbs.\n> ONE truckload of steel, one coil is about 45,000 lbs. \n> So the coil costs $15,750 cut and delivered to the customer\n\n> A month ago/3 weeks, at its peak I was selling the same exact type of steel for .97 per lbs.\n> One coil, 45,000 lbs, now costs $43,650 cut and delivered to the customer...\n\n\n\n\nI am steel purchaser and salesman for a large nonprime steel sales/processing company. Been doing it for over 12 years  \n\nMost of the mills in the US are now only equipped with Electric Arc Furnaces, These ONLY take SCRAP STEEL, which they melt down. There are a multitude of Reasons why many have went from BOF to EAF mills, but for us what is important is the following…. (NOTE: BOF- Basic Oxygen Furnace. Actually melting all minerals and produce from “scratch”.)  BOFs are huge, expensive, time consuming and 'old school'\n\nNOTE:  If you have never seen an EAF operate then click the following link and enjoy. No nothing in the video is going wrong, that is how its suppose to run..... insane.....\n\n[EAF FURNACE @ 80 MW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j2jESz7Zl8&amp;ab_channel=%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%90%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B4%D0%B8)  \n\n\nCurrently there is a nationwide CONCERN growing in scrap haulers, steel salesman (me) but most of all, in the EAF mills. These concerns are about nationwide scrap supply. Like serious concerns. In fact steel prices have taken a very aggressive dip within the last 3 weeks and right now there is talk of scrap costs going up. (Seems impossible, but it suggests the mills are nervous about supply moving forward.  \n\n\nSOOO why is this important? Well what happens if for some reason the EAF mills cannot get scrap they have ONE alternative…. They must use what the industry calls iron pellets. And how do you make those in large volume, large enough to sustain an entire mill?  \n\n\nWith an 'old school' BOF mill.........\n\nCLF (gonclaves) has been buying A LOT of the old BOFs in this country. People have laughed at him for it since they arent cutting edge anymore. Perhaps he sees something. And I believe he does.  \n\nCLF could be in a position at one point where they are suppling their competitors pellets because their competitors cant fill their own orders.  \n\nNucor uses an EAF mill.  They also have DRI plants which make these pellets.  However most EAF mills do NOT have that capability.  And even with Nucor they cannot make enough to run all of their operations.  ALSO, MORE EAFs are currently being built, in my opinion flooding the market.... there is another selective pressure on scrap supply/cost.\n\nSo my prediction is that scrap will get tight, maybe even experience the dreaded 'shortage' and the only way for them to melt more steel is buy the pellets from a BOF mill.\n\nAnd who owns most of the BOF mills in the country?  Cleveland Cliffs.....\n\nMy god is this a long play but the upside potential…..\n\nNO i did not look at charts, or do analysis, nor did i look at trends. (Trends are fucking retarded right now, there are no trends.... we in the steel industry are in total uncharted waters.)  Why uncharted? \n\nThis is the highest steel costs have ever been.  And not the highest in the country's history.... the highest they have been in the entire history of the steel industry from the day it was created.... \n\nSo my predication comes from 12 years buying and selling nonprime, working in a processing facility, tracking pricing and steel 'futures' while also analyzing the chemistry of certain items AND bidding on material on a weekly basis. \n\nCharts are great and all, but a chart/technicals cannot hold my jockstrap.

Their Brazilian iron ore production is supposed to be ramping back up now, so I would expect their flow of pellets to get back to a normal level by middle of next year.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Clf consumes all of the ore they mine in house.

AND I DO A LOOOOOT OF MY BUYING FROM NUCOR. I know their prices and they operate. Great stock.\n\n> Most importantly though... this PREDICTION I am making about EAFs running out of smelting material.... Nucor will NOT be effected by this phenomena the most. At least not nearly as severely as others. They have two DRI plants.

Their capabilities are so versatile and they actual MAKE steel.\n\nAs far for the shortage? Hard to say....  If all goes well the Biden administration will keep the tariffs on SE Asia and seal them off almost totally.  Which means we will get import for the EU.  This is a good thing and will hopefully lower prices a bit. This would 'hurt' all mills since they will have to drop price, but will be good for the industry.\n\nIf scrap shortage lingers, CLF will kill it, if its short then CLF will continue as always. Just not boom like it would of.\n\n\n3) Lastly, my dad always taught me that in steel sales when you dont know the answer to something you says \" I dont know but ill find out\".

Irresponsible to make that long of a prediction and for me to make any \"definite\" conclusions.\n\nFor reference.... \"In a DR process, iron ore pellets and/or lump iron ores are reduced by a reducing gas to produce DRI or hot briquetted iron (HBI).\" https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemical-engineering/iron-ore-pellet\n\nNOTE: (SHORTAGE is VERY different then what we are STARTING to experience, which what we call a tightening. a Shortage is a severe situation. All \"shortages\" start with \"tightenings\", but not al; \"tightenings\" lead to \"shortages\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for prices going down and scrap going up? Definitely not unloading excess inventory....\n\nEven though prices have dropped substantially (See my Edits for an example of price), they are still FAR higher then what steel should be. So the mill is still making a killing and making sure they capture business as the market drops.\n\nAs for futures, i watch them for sure, but they are only one of a multitude of 'indicators' i watch to construct a prediction of the future. I dont believe futures carry enough weight in the industry to effect the extreme price drop as of late. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSO my only guess? Mills are worried about their scrap supply. That would be a pretty solid explanation of the paradox between scrap going up and prices going down.\n\nAlso prices have to drop, they arent realistic and nature finds a way. So prices dropping is natural and a relief to be honest. They cant stay 350% high forever....", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I will definitely get back to you today", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You mean you want me to put a few thousand more into my Jan 23 calls?

It is at least worth addressing if Tesla is worth its current price or not. To me, Tesla is still at its infant stage (or better, childhood stage) but the market has already cashed in its growth by too much. It all happens too quickly, and as a long term investor, I hate it.\n\nThere is no doubt on earth that I still love Tesla and Tesla still has a big future ahead. But it’s not like the stonk only goes up. This price surge we see is CLEARLY driven by big money’s on the Wall Street and we the retailers can only watch it happen. It is an invitation from some big money to other big moneys for a risky game play. There will be winners and there will be losers, but at the end of the day, the play will come to an end. Maybe 3 months, maybe 6, but not forever. And at that time we will see another big crash on Tesla, just the same as before. Or there will be a prolonged period of time where Tesla just stayed there doing nothing or even decreases it market cap.

I understand they are implementing things like setting the charging rate and time of the car to charge when the grid is under the least amount of stress.

{"title": "Yo seriously. What the shit would Tesla even need to do for profit in order to even justify it's current valuation???? 1.2t market cap. Amazon is at 1.7t and the most profitable car company rn is Toyota at 300b .......???", "selftext": "Mind you Walmart is at 400b market cap. So what this means is that Tesla would need to make as much profit as 3 Walmart corporations In the future in order to even justify it's CURRENT market cap. It's actually absurd. It almost seems like people who are investing into Tesla don't really understand what it's current market cap even means... \n\nI've heard from a Tesla investor that Tesla would become an industry leader like hibachi Ltd.... And once that happens Tesla is going to moon..... And its like dude .. hibachi Ltd market cap is at 50b . Forget about mooning once Tesla becomes an industry leader like hibachi Ltd. Tesla would need to be an industry leader like 20 hibachi Ltd  just to even justify it's current valuation lol.... \n\nIf Tesla becomes the world's most profitable corp like apple. Get this .... You'll justifiably only 2x your money if you invest In it now 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂 . Bruh such a tall order to fill just to 2x . \n\nLook I get it. Tesla is innovative yadadada yes . The company is still in it's early stages and it'll be better later on. Yes that too. The company is at it's early stages. However, the stock valuation of this company is not. The stock valuation of this company is already at a level where it can swing it's dick around and smack China with it. \n\nThe question is. What would Tesla even need to do.... For profit at a level where it's absurd valuation is justify? \n\nAnother note Toyota is currently the most profitable car company and it's valuation is 300b..... (I'm not saying Tesla is just a car company) Tesla's is already at 1.2t . 4x the most profitable car company already... Without making any profit... Tall order to fill . Let's just say that.\n\n\n\n\nEdit : this is just speculation but hear me out on this Tesla's car margin went up 30% recent quarter ... Now I did some googling turns out Tesla's build quality and assembly is ranked the lowest . So what does this mean? Well it's obvious. This is a very common stock hype strategy. They sacrifice build quality by getting cheap parts and assembly. on paper itll look great for short term profit it's no wonder margin is at 30% then they report it. Boom everyone eats it up HYYYYPPPE. Stock shoots up!! Bruh at this rate Tesla solely survives on hype and elon fucking knows it 😂😂😂😂😂😂 . It's a very obvious stock hype strategy tbh. Do you seriously think this company that is entirely pressured to perform on paper wouldn't go this length? Honestly this is the only thing Elon can do in order to maintain this level of stock price . It's actually a no brainer. Because as soon as that sheet of paper looks bad. Y'all know what's gonna happen. And he knows what's gonna happen. So long as he report good news albeit paper news . All's is well. \n\nIt's a very common tactic for public company in order to showcase short term paper gains. In order to shoot the stock upwards. Some even layoff workers, it's just speculation. But my money is on this.\n\n\n\nEdit 2: reading many of the comments , it seems like alot of people are confused that there's actually a difference between  company and stock. Saying that Tesla is a growth stock (disregarding it's current market cap), just because the company is still growing is essentially the gist of many responses. While Not realizing it's already priced in on a veeeerry optimistic note at that. \n\nAlso do people ever stop to think how the hell is this dude gonna monopolize all these different areas of innovation? Amazon focused on 1 thing only , it took them 2decades to reach 1.7t.  and monopolize that one thing . honestly , the ideas are decent ,but what about execution? People invest like all his ideas are already at monopoly level. \n\nBattery grid, EV cars, AI, spaceX , renewable energy, solar, boring company tunnels, internet grid, something about monkeys , And many more projects. I've heard the argument that Tesla is \"not a car company\" to justify it's current valuation. Like somehow this dude is going to monopolize all these different fields. Ironically If anything EV cars is where he'll most likely have a Monopoly. \n\n\n Saying Tesla is a growth stock just because the company is still growing while it's already at 1.2t marker cap, is the same  as saying GME is a growth stock during MOASS when it's market cap is quadrillions . Just bc \" the company is still growing it hasn't implemented NFTs yet\" .\n\nEdit 3: Also y'all remember when Tesla double in market cap, AKA double it's company's worth (for those who don't understand market cap) ,just because musk boy said \"5/1 split\" 😂😂😂 yo this stock is surreal. Any other company with these kinds of specs , it'll be a no brainer to short. Puts all the way! Not Tesla. Hell fucking no. You think I'm gonna bet against a stock where the company double in valuation just because \"oOoOO it's \"cheap\" now!\" --- (P.S you actually paid more for a smaller piece.) \n\n you outa yo goddamn mind if you think I'm gonna go against this kind of retard strength! This is the kind of company that will go up 100b if they announce theyre creating their own gaming console . 0 - 100.

Following the 70,000 unit production capacity of the Prologue, Honda is anticipating sales of 500,000 BEVs by 2030.\n\n[https://electrek.co/2021/10/13/honda-announces-all-new-models-will-be-electric-after-2030-but-only-in-china-to-start/](https://electrek.co/2021/10/13/honda-announces-all-new-models-will-be-electric-after-2030-but-only-in-china-to-start/)\n\nMitsubishi also only 50% sales will be \"electric\"\n\n>The Japanese manufacturer (controlled by Nissan and part of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance) intends to reduce new-car CO2 emissions by 40% (however, compared to Japanese fiscal 2010), while the proportion of \"electric vehicle\" sales will increase to 50%.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Unfortunately, Mitsubishi's definition of electric vehicles includes various xEVs, including battery-electric (BEVs), plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and conventional hybrids (HEVs).\n\n[https://insideevs.com/news/452102/mitsubishi-electrified-car-sales-50-2030/](https://insideevs.com/news/452102/mitsubishi-electrified-car-sales-50-2030/)\n\nIt seems like \"most\" automakers are planning a very slow trickle of BEVs. Unless you can show me otherwise? And again many of these automakers, especially Japanese ones are mostly talking about plugin hybrids not even full BEVs. Hybrids will look very unappealing very soon.\n\nOnly VW seems to be trying to aggressively change and ramp up.\n\n>But until Tesla can offer much lower priced cars and trucks, it's impossible for them to ever grow to anything near what would justify this valuation.\n\nThey can offer lower priced cars if they want. But they still sell every car they make. So instead, they have increased their prices because the demand for Teslas is insanely high.\n\nYou seem to also be unaware that Tesla's margin's are better than most automakers and these margins are looking to improve based on their production plans.\n\nHere are some reasons why Tesla will be worth 1 tril or more in the future:\n\n* They sell more BEVs than any car company (excluding 3500$ golf carts) and will continue to do so for the next 4-5 years at least. This is not hyperbole, this is based on other car maker's own projected sales/production numbers for 2025 and 2030.\n* They have high margins compared to other automakers. These margins will only get better when they start giga casting the fronts of their cars. Plus the 4680 cell format, plus the structural battery pack, plus the new in house developed production/chemistry for 4680 cells on top of the format, plus more use of LFP batteries.\n* They plan to go into the business of lithium mining to further reduce production cost and increase their margins.\n* Volkswagen claims Tesla can make their car 3x faster than VW can make theirs. Faster production usually means better margins.\n* They're designing and building their own in-house super computer architecture for training machine learning models. They have stated to be open to selling this compute power as a service in the future. This could be a lucrative business. But having an in-house super computer has merits on it's own.\n* Tesla is more nimble and less bureaucratic than other car makers. They were able to mitigate some impact of the chip shortage by using different chips and writing new software within weeks, for example.- Basically they are more vertically integrated than most other car makers. Which offers them huge advantages.\n* FSD will unlock crazy margins in the future. Unlike what many naysayers seem to think, FSD doesn't have to be level 4-5 to be useful or desirable.\n* Tesla insurance is starting to roll out. They will offer better and cheaper insurance for only their cars. This not only brings in a lot of high margin revenue but being part insurance company could create a lot of \"float\".\n* They have the most user friendly and most extensive super charger network. They are expanding this network rapidly, faster than anyone else. They are also cheaper and faster charging than most other options. They will open this to Non-Teslas in the future more and more. Which will obviously make them a lot of money.\n* They have high brand loyalty. A cult like following.\n* While their energy storage and solar businesses have poor margins right now, these have the potential to become huge.-\n* Tesla Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, and $25k car are coming.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "God I love you.\n\nStats with facts then tasty bullet points.\n\nAside from this, these comments have been a laugh so far!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Boggles my mind people still think the competition is going to overtake Tesla and they lose money without emissions credits.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "No offense intended, but you sound like you only know Tesla from reading some pretty biased articles online. For instance, you keep bringing up the point that Tesla only makes money from EV credits... But have you actually looked at the amount of revenue they get from regulatory credit sales versus vehicle sales? How much of automotive gross profit is regulatory credits? In Q3, Tesla took in $279M in regulatory credit sales, which is only 2.3% of automotive revenue. And EBITDA is $3.2B. slicing off the $0.28B from that isn't going to make Tesla much less profitable. Regulatory credits make Tesla slightly more profitable, sure... But without them, you'd hardly notice. And the fact that Tesla is still able to sell a significant amount of regulatory credits after more than a decade should be a strong signal to everyone that the traditional automakers really aren't doing so well with the EV transition.\n\nWhat other at-scale automotive manufacturer are you going to find that has gross margins at 30%? Other manufacturers have much lower margins on ICE cars. Remember ICE cars have a cheap empty tank for fuel vs an expensive-as-hell battery in an EV. Their margins are only going to get worse when they move into EVs. Much worse. Other manufacturers will have a difficult time competing on price alone even if they can design and produce a compelling product at a  scale as big as Tesla. Right now, there is no clear competitor that can catch up to Tesla and Tesla is not slowing down. They are not going to stop at 30% margins. These revenue and profit numbers are not typical for Tesla. They are record numbers. However, delivering record numbers quarter after quarter is pretty typical for Tesla because they are growing.. and fast. They will be more profitable next quarter. Then next year, when 2 new factories are ramping up, they will be able to more than double their production capacity and continue to grow. And you can bet there will be more factories to follow.\n\nAnd everything I've layed out here up to this point is just the automotive business. Everything else (energy, solar, non-Tesla Supercharging revenue, AI, FSD, etc) is a wildcard and many people eliminate these from valuation models.\n\nHowever, I do think that Tesla's $1T+ valuation at this moment in time feels a bit ahead of itself. I'm fully confident that by the second half of the decade, this will be very reasonably valued. So I'm fine leaving my money in TSLA until I can identify an investment with better potential.

You don't have to look very hard to realize that they really aren't that successful... Except for F and TSLA, every American auto company has failed. All of the German manufacturers suck so bad at solving technical problems that they resort to cheating. Even Toyota, which could've been a serious threat to Tesla, looks ho-hum.... Their management is so incompetent that their strategy is to completely close their eyes, cover their ears, and pretend like the world isn't going to switch to EVs... Imagine leading Toyota: They were the undisputed leader in gas-electric hybrid vehicles for like a decade... They then gained inside knowledge and access to Tesla's technology when they sold NUMMI to Tesla, and when they partnered with Tesla to produce the 2nd gen Rav4 EV, and when they invested $50M to acquire 2.3 millions shares  (pre-split) of Tesla stock in May 2010... Now imagine how short-sighted the management team must be to evaluate their investment just 6 years later and dumping all the shares for $538M... They made a 10x gain, sure, but today, that stake would be worth over $14B (almost 300x)! It was clear-as-day to outsiders that they should've done 1 of 2 things: Either continue their partnership with Tesla and increased their stake, or start shifting all of their resources into EV programs to directly compete against Tesla. Toyota had the best chance... now, I feel like they are the biggest laggards in this transition.\n\nI don't know what the valuation should be discounted to present day... but if the whole sector is overvalued, then I'd rather have my money in Tesla than anything else in the sector. I'm confident Tesla will easily justify this valuation (and probably a bit more) by end of the decade (and very likely before), so my assessment of the the risk is relatively low. In my mind, the eventual base valuation of Tesla is a sum total of a large auto manufacturer, a sales & service network (traditional car dealers), a fueling network (gas stations), energy company (like today's big-oil), and a software company with recurring subscription-based revenue (like a S/W service company). Those are pretty certain.

Doubtful.\n\nThis is one of the hundreds, or thousands, of unique problems to be solved when looking at AI in these applications. It's not that no one can reach where they are, but there are *necessary* blocks of development *time* that must be worked through - even if tesla got all of its accumulated data as of today dumped on them 5 years ago, they would not be 5 years ahead. Maybe 2.5 at best, and the funny thing about engineering, depending on the approach of reaping that gift you could set yourself further back as you never developed strong foundations through the problem solving process encountered during that data capture.\n\nThis leads to the other trillion dollar asset tesla has: Musk.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAtLTLiqNwg\n(around 15:00 you can hear how out of touch Sandy Munro, probably one the most in-touch auto engineer guys out there is, on the topic of AI. Whereas it's all common knowledge for musk. Many auto execs are more businessmen than car people. How many of them are part time AI scientists too?)\n\nThis is one of many interviews you can find, and not at all one of the most technically demanding of musk. But it demonstrates his intimate knowledge and involvement in all engineering activities within his companies. I actually think the most bullish content for this is seeing musk talk about the SpaceX stuff. He gets hated on a lot, and much of it deserved, but from an objective standpoint he is a remarkable CEO. Best paraphrased from some of his employees, \"without a doubt, musk could perform well in every engineering position within his companies\".\n\nYou have to know that you don't know what you don't know with topics this grand (such as your discussion of a big automaker simply catching up due to pre-existing scale), and stick with cold hard facts: Musk has achieved multiple things across different sectors that many gaffed at upon initial announcements. His companies have solved many problems that others have not even encountered yet, and their business operations are gifted with objectively better decisions and forsight coming from an objectively smarter-than-average CEO. While generally overoptimistic (debatably a necessary quality for someone to do everything he does), he delivers more often than not. \n\nSo that data capture lead is the headline of the tip of an extraordinarily large ice-berg. IMO, business as usual tesla has a 5-7 year rolling-lead. I think the Ford Lightning will prove to be the best competition yet, and the stock is so comparatively cheap I am also very bullish on them. For many reasons the lightning could be incredible or a flop, can only place bets and wait and see at this stage (which is a similar sentiment for many new EVs from large automakers coming out right now... even just one generation of EV lemons could be a death blow at this stage, especially as their engrained mechanisms for assembly, QA, troubleshooting, etc.. are not as rapid as tesla. Go to ~20:00 in that vid to hear how he talks about the benefits of the new factories being built in germany and china, \"changing the wheels on the bus while its going 80 mph\", they have the benefit of this growth being necessary for expansion that they can make a new iteration - big 3 cannot justify 3x their current production investment just for iteration, and the resulting growth would be unnecessary so the old plants need to be salvaged too)\n\nAnd musk is attempting to be this innovative and forward thinking about pretty much every part of the car. The interview covers a lot of the big topics quickly, I highly recommend just watching it through - he's closer to a university professor than a CEO, for better and for worse.\n\nEdit: Many edits as I reread, clarify, add better points.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate the very thoughtful response.

The valuations are insane in any traditional aspect of the automotive industry but after you see Tesla as a future technology driver in your home, cars, AI, and auto insurance then the 3k valuation starts to make more sense. IMO, I think a 500 dollar valuation on the firm is much more reasonable if it stays as just an EV car firm. However, the basics of 3k valuation are simple:\n\n1. Tesla is the iPhone of EV Consumer vehicles. The affordability issue is being whittled away as Tesla's become more affordable (and batteries become cheaper to produce) this will open the market to a bunch of consumers.  A large part of America likes Trucks and SUVs. Cyber Truck completes this offering\n2. Tesla self-driving cars will be the multiplying factor because it will allow Tesla to start subscription services for all sorts of options. Every Tesla on the road today is collecting data for the self-driving systems (this data alone is worth billions of dollars (ask uber and lift shareholders)  and more importantly if self-driving vehicles become a thing Tesla is years ahead of the competition. You would likely need Ford or Toyota to buy an Uber or Lyft to get an equivalent in data. You could see Tesla eventually having its own automated Taxi service, you know the thing Lyft and Uber are trying to make happen.\n3. Tesla Insurance, self-driving cars would reduce accidents and thus lead to fewer draws on insurance pools. You could have it where Tesla ends up writing its own insurance policies and the premiums would be so much lower. Thus creating a competitive advantage that legacy insurance firms like State Farm and Progressive would have a hard time beating. You could see insane margins and I believe the 3k is doable if they get margins of 46% on insurance premiums.\n4. Tesla robots have a huge potential.  Right now they definitely are a meme but you could have it where these end up replacing maids, pool boys, gardeners, package delivery staff, and truck loading crews. If robots become a thing they will be specialized like the burger flipper Flippy for tasks. Much like EV's Tesla has been ahead of the curve and they could be the next paradigm.

And more importantly, keep at it's current rate of innovation. I think investors realize that when you buy TSLA, you aren't just buying the markets it is in today, but what they will come out with later that is likely not related to it's current product lines at all.   \nAs you note, it's not just a car company. Not by far. It's a tech company. And not just any tech company, one that is revolutionizing entire sectors. Multiples of them. And not just any sectors, but sectors that each of them have significantly larger potential than those other companies you mention. And have first to market advantage in all of them.  \nTesla has the potential to literally change the world. And in doing so, will absolutely be at a profitability level never seen before, period. If it works out like it has so far, Tesla will be more valuable than the next most valuable company by 10X.  \n\n\nThen there is Elon himself. He absolutely will go down in the history books as greater than Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, and so many others. Between Tesla and SpaceX. We have been blessed to have the opportunity to do our part to encourage and even indirectly help the man who is changing the world.  \n\n\nYou do make some good points. Namely, there will be times when Tesla stock tanks. Probably many of them over the coming decades. I fully expect that. Everyone stumbles from time to time.  \nSome other points are probably just a misunderstanding of how businesses succeed. Namely startups and innovative companies. Basically the tried and true MVP, Lean process. If Tesla didn't have those sloppy quality issues early on like this, then they would be doing it wrong. I know that sounds backwards to the average person, but it's not. It is a very specific strategy of sacrificing early perfection for scale. Then continuous improvement to get those quality stats up to where they should be later.  \n\n\nThe real question is, how much of all the above is already priced in vs what will they actually realize of its potential in the various current and future industries? So far, investors are banking on them continuing to innovate beyond what is priced in. Are they right? Who knows. Me personally, I have a decent chunk of cash in TSLA and don't plan to ever sell it even after the many crashes I expect it to have.
