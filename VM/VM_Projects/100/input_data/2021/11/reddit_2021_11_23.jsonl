My apologies ...\n\nOptions update:\n\nWeekly options open interest changes from yesterday open to yesterday close:\n\n      Nov 22: 2021/11/26:  PUTs:   317,478 ; CALLs:   199,863\n      Nov 23: 2021/11/26:  PUTs:   399,620 ; CALLs:   252,143\n\n- As you can see, bears bought 82k puts and bulls bought 52k calls. The ratio is somewhat unusual (The typical pattern is steady & similar accumulation of open interest until the end of the week - not dominance of one side.)\n- I'd say this flow was likely the reason for yesterday's whiplash price action: a big inflow of put buying.\n- MM delta hedging thus saw an outflow of 10m TSLA shares from the ~$1,200 intraday top - which dominated much of the remaining bearish price action for the day.\n- The biggest put cluster is at $1,000 (70k contracts), but the $1,050 and $1,100 ones are significant too with 20k-20k contracts.\n- On the upside it's all much more thinly populated: $1,200 only has 13k calls, $1,250k 9k calls, $1,300 15k calls. Clearly bear shenanigans.\n- I.e. while bulls bought 52k calls, most of them are 'useless' and too far away from the money to have significant gamma effects. The puts on the other hand are in price areas that TSLA visited recently.\n- As usual, the suspicion arises whether it's actually just certain MMs that buy these puts, to reduce the delta hedging losses they incur. For example Susquehanna has two arms: the market maker and the quant fund - they are separate reporting entities that supposedly trade independently. The quant fund is often holding hundreds of thousands of TSLA options contracts ... And at the end of the day, any \"loss\" at the quant fund is a win for the MM and vice versa.\n- Just in case you are wondering: while for example AAPL saw a bearish inflow of puts as well, and call profit taking, it was during a big ATH run yesterday where it's kind of expected & justified, and was not nearly as marked as TSLA's.\n- Other names like NVDA saw the usual steady inflow of both puts and calls, around ~30k & ~30k each. This suggests that the TSLA options flow is ***not*** a market-wide shift towards some big correction, but TSLA specific - at least so far.\n- As usual, HODLers will be fine, these details only matter to the weekly gamblers and maybe to those who want to time their dry powder entry points.\n\nYesterday's TSLA options shenanigans were riding on the coattails of macro movements - greatly amplifying & exaggerating them. I believe going forward TSLA will be coupled with macro, with the usual added volatility on top - all other things equal.\n\nAlso keep in mind that Thursday will be closed for trading (Thanksgiving), and Friday will be a 'short' day.

That’s what 2025 earnings of $40 x 50x =P/E discounted back to 2021 suggest TSLA fair value should be.  A split doesn’t change that.\" \n\n\nSo my own situation right now is that I own\n160 shares at an average of $861 or so.\n\nI was thinking of holding on until at least January of early February because that's when we might reach the PT of $1400 dollars. I can likely hold on longer but kindly follow my reasoning to give me your thoughts on what you would do if you were in such a dilemma. \n\nHere is my dilemma:  If we reach $1400 and I keep holding (HODLing) then the stock might drop back down to 800 or less and I'm screwed because I will spend the rest of the year again waiting for some kind of recovery which may never come (and meanwhile not having taken some profits while I was up some)\n\nOn the other hand, if I trim say 50% of my shares say at $1350 (that would be 80 shares I would sell)... Then I have made a profit of\n80 x (1350 - 861) = $67, 530\n\nBut at least half of that is taxed (I'm in California) so I end up with like\n\n$33,765\n\nThat $33,765 is not a terrible profit...  But then again it's definitely not much in today's expensive economy.   Plus if the stock never drops much below $1000  (assuming we tank from a price target of $1400 down to $1000 during Q1 and Q2 of next year)... Then if I wanted to get back into Tesla by Second half, I would only be able to buy at best about 30 shares with that $30k profit (assuming my cash was kept liquid in my account).   So 80 (my remaining shares that had not been sold) + 30 =110 shares instead of 160\n\nI would likely lose 50 shares in the process.\n\nSo am I not correct in assuming that in all likelihood, Tesla will not drop from $1400 way down to $1000 after January 2022 Q4 earnings for 2021?  And furthermore, that in all likelihood I would be much better off holding longer term to those 80 shares I am considering selling at the PT of $1400 dollars?\n\nUnless an investor is desperate for liquid cash, it seems insane to sell Tesla shares (even if in this example, my profit margin per share would be close to $500 dollars (since my average is $861 and the price \"target\" would be $1400)\n\nI honestly don't understand why Fund Managers stick to their price targets so firmly and trim as the stock price reaches their targets? I realize they are used to practicing safety and conservative precautions etc...  But my mathematics as explained, shows that for small time retail investors like myself who don't own thousands of shares, such conservative approaches may not make any sense? \n\nWhat do you guys think?

So we have to keep that in mind (at least according to one credible Tesla investor / Reddit user who kindly informed me about this stuff).\n\nSo all this hype about Fund Managers trimming Tesla shares if we reach a PT of $1400 may be exaggerated and those fund managers don't have a crystal ball on anything at the end of the day.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> Some fund managers will be trimming Tesla once their price target of $1400 is reached. \n\nThat largely depends on ***why*** Tesla reaches $1,400:\n\n- If it's due to a gamma squeeze then maybe they'll trim.

I had been thinking of trimming (selling) half of my shares once we got to that target price.  At least that's what Gary Black is intending to do.   But after discussing this with other Reddit users, most disagree and say I should hold long term because Gary Black is a Fund manager and those guys own a lot more shares than retail investors... Plus the price targets could get bumped up and there is also 2 trillion dollars of institutional money sitting on the sidelines underweight that could come into the game.\nSo rather than exit by January or February of next year when we'll likely be at $1400, everyone is saying just hold if you can.

I think he might be able to tough it out a few more years.\n\nPersonally, I'm truly hoping that by end of 2022, Tesla shares will be worth at least 2k.  If that goal is met, then although my father would not have made a lot, but at least it would make him feel quite good and motivate him to stay positive and patient.\n\nBut the only thing I kinda worry about is what will happen during Q1 and Q2 of next year (2022).\nIn other words... Will we likely dip way down from say $1400, all the way down to $800 and lower?  Or will we at most dip down to about $1000 but not much less?  You see, for his 160 shares which I managed myself throughout this year, his average cost (price) is $861 per share.  Which is not that great... Quite high.\n\nSo as long as the stock is above $1000 or so... He will be able to likely tough it out regardless of what the price does.  But if we dip down to like $500 or something crazy....

Honestly I don't even know how the current quarter were in now (Q4 2021) will play out by January when the earnings come out.\n\nSo I think about these shorter term things a lot because if the stock tanks from $1400 back down to say $800 or lower....

All that remains as a wild card for me (in my tiny gullible and ignorant head) would be of 10 year Treasury bond yields spike massively, or say of CPI (consumer price index) blows out of proportion and causes major inflation panic?   Or another possibility (as unlikely as many of us would say this is)... Is, what happens if Institutions all started profit taking (dumping) Tesla shares after Q4 earnings in January, and this triggers a major backlash with retail investors and they all start to profit take as well?

He believed her blind and jumped me with his friends. I still have scars to this day. The only reason I'm still alive today is that when he said \"This is for Rebekka\" I said wtf and showed him my phone, that had us dating on Facebook and her in my DMs saying she loved me and long conversations that very day. We compared notes, and not only did we figure out that she had played us both, but also... I realized that she had possibly done the same thing to me, because she told me her last bf was abusive, had me block him, and told me to never contact him and just let it go. When we confronted her she just fessed up with a \"you're just such a nice guy I didn't know how to break up with you\" line... And then tried to tell him a different story, but he asked me what happened, and I forwarded him her voice messages. After that, he was still not completely convinced, so me and him met up, and I called her on speakerphone... And after a Convo with me and her where she confirmed again she had made it all up and \"why\" he got on the phone pissed, she hung up, and we both moved forward without her. To this day I still don't know if I helped her cheat on her previous BF or if it was legit... Because at the time it was just too painful to look into.

And I would have never gotten stitches (I still have a pretty bad scar on my nose 13 years later.)

Let's assume that the premium is roughly the same for both puts and calls.  Let's assume that a stock is at $40 right now.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nScenario 1:  You sell a CSP at around 37 (30 delta) consuming $3700 of BP and earning probably $1.50 premium.  You close at 50% profit in an average of 10 days and then open a new position.  If the stock trades flat then this is fine.  But if the stock goes up to 40, then to 41, then to 45 over 6 weeks or so now you're needing more BP each time and in that number of days you'll have sold 4 CSPs and if all were profitable, you'll have made $3 in premium total.  This assumes that you initially had $3700 in BP available and with the increase in portfolio size from the premium you now have $4000 in BP, but what if the stock spikes up to $50 and you don't have $5000 in BP to keep selling a CSP?  You're done, find a new stock.  This is precisely how \"the wheel\" is supposed to work and you've made a profit so good job.  \n\n\nScenario 2:  You buy the fucking shares at $37, consuming $3700 of BP and then you sell a CC at 40 (again 30 delta) for about $1.50 in premium.  You repeat after the stock rises as per Scenario 1, so it goes to 40 (assume you can close at 50% profit so your call isn't going ITM), then 41, then 45 over the same 6 weeks and you consistently are able to make the same 4 CCs for the same $3 in premium, however your BP was always $3700 (I'd expect the increase in the underlying to actually raise your available margin) and now if the stock jumps to $50 and you're assigned at $48, then you've made an extra $1100 on the shares and an extra .75 in premium with the CC that you were assigned on.

This is the same risk as Scenario 1 except your basis will be slightly lower due to the strangle, and this is how a delta-positive strategy behaves in a long-term drawdown or a crash so know your risks and manage them accordingly by not over-trading and picking a quality underlying.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo technically you are correct, an OTM CC is the same \"position\" as a CSP at the same strike.

{"title": "$GGPI Polestar - Global EV Pure Play - DD", "selftext": "Greetings, lads. Elon’s TweetThreats and PP posts aside, EV stocks are melting faces this month. Consider the following…\n\n* Rivian IPO blew up. Share price $110. Now $98B market cap.\n* Tesla +120% since May. SP $1,190. Now $1.2T MC.\n* Lucid +100% in three weeks. SP $52. Now $86B MC.\n\nLike you, SoFi didn’t fill my $RIVN IPO order. Nor did I catch the $LCID  $15 dip. And sadly, I wasn’t able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two years  ago.\n\nBut here’s our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV “pure plays” in the market:\n\nPolestar — Volvo’s EV spinoff brand — estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.\n\nIt’s now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.\n\nPolestar is the only global EV ‘pure play,’ other than Tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/av4nl8i87d181.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68f1d78905547fea74ffaba96cd6265c7a4a33a8\n\n**History**\n\nA little background…\n\n* “Polestar” takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris — not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That’s *Polstjärnan* (literal translation, “Pole Star”) if you’re Swedish.\n* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo’s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.\n* Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk & Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.\n* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being “independent since 2017.”\n* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.\n\n**Comps**\n\n**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**\n\n* Applying Tesla’s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%.\n* Applying Lucid’s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of  $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase  of 247%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrmfi8ga7d181.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0a7af961e3f7ee4e20df9747b005fbff44af7d\n\n**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**\n\n* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.\n* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:\n\n1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).\n2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.\n\n* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.\n* Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment   opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.\n* As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5mgt00e7d181.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=7487924a42825ba052899aa03fc4fae3d1abe9ec\n\n**Gores' Deals**\n\nGores’ track record speaks for itself…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1uq0jcg7d181.jpg?width=1972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6571264d9347fd8f8c237881e1d511b8cca7fae\n\n**The EV Graveyard**\n\nThe EV battlefield is littered with bodies.\n\nBut Polestar?\n\nThey've   been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars. How  many deliveries of the first-gen Roadsters had Tesla made in 2010 when  they IPO’d? Answer: 1,400.\n\nPolestar just makes cars, baby.\n\nCEO Thomas Ingenlath: “We have a proven track record. We actually deliver cars. We have 29,000 deliveries this year.”\n\nClaim confirmed. And look at that jawline.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdws59yi7d181.jpg?width=279&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acb198c00c9a8a7fd9ddbfa26f07a251d0438ccf\n\nPolestar estimates 65,000 deliveries in FY22 and revenues in excess of $3B.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tdq7nril7d181.jpg?width=841&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dfe3b9e83a69063aec615d270af306824db49745\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzlwasso7d181.jpg?width=991&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db9cf4dfb907d3d3313827d086b4a76b653cd4a7\n\n**The Product**\n\nThe Polestar 1 came out in 2019. It’s a hybrid premium sports car that will set you back $155K… 619 horsepower, 738 lbs of torque, 0-60 in 3.8 seconds and clears the quarter mile in 12.0 seconds at 119.1 mph.

Polestar 2… What is it?\n\nThink Subaru Outback meets the Model 3 — with a dash of the minimalist Swedish aesthetic. It’s a sedan, but its higher ride- height and rugged body make it seem more like a crossover. It opens like a   hatchback.

Polestar also hopes to have the South Carolina vehicles be union-made… no easy task these days (looking at you, Austin   Elon).\n* Ingenlath (CEO): \"Polestar 3 will be built in America, for our American customers.

This is all pending passage in the Senate, but it looks promising.\n\nRelevant highlights:\n\n* The bill includes a restructured federal tax credit for EVs to up to $12,500.\n* Promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations.\n* An additional $65 billion will be invested toward overall clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.\n\nSource: [https://electrek.co/2021/11/06/congress-passes-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-12500-ev-tax-credit-still-awaits-passage/](https://electrek.co/2021/11/06/congress-passes-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-bill-12500-ev-tax-credit-still-awaits-passage/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brand Rollout**\n\nWhile watching the Braves clap the Astros in the World Series a couple weeks ago, I saw this TV commercial:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk)\n\n* It turns out Polestar launched a massive brand campaign on Oct. 22nd across key markets globally.\n* Launched ahead of COP26, the campaign features an environmentally-themed spot narrated by American astronaut Karen Nyberg that reflects on human advancement, the way we live now and the damage we're doing to the   planet.\n* Nyberg: \"Our need to advance our species often comes at the expense of our home.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What’s our boy Cramer at CNBC have to say?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4416g7y7d181.jpg?width=404&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f2cb070788b53713d719de41c9eac937041c70c\n\n***Cramer on $GGPI:***\n\n* “They’re connected with Polestar. OK, here’s the problem: Rivian is coming public. This group has gotten a little too hot. Let’s let things cool off before we get hurt.”\n\nOk,  Cramer has a point here, but not necessarily about GGPI. Your downside risk on LCID, TSLA, RIVN is technically limitless. GGPI on the other hand, has a NAV (net asset value) floor of approximately $10 until merger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does Leo have to say?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ftekhvy08d181.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=323fed8deaa4eac96ef21ac80768900f4afd3bc9\n\nWell, we don’t know a lot about Leo’s investment in Polestar, but Bloomberg reports:\n\n* “\\[CEO\\] Ingenlath declined to comment on how big a stake… DiCaprio \\[has\\] in  the  company. ‘One of the strong stories that is inherent to Polestar is sustainability,’ Ingenlath said on Bloomberg Television. ‘It’s as well very important for Leo.
