{"title": "Some Basic but very useful Options help from a full-time trader", "selftext": "I posted this as a reply to a thread in WallStreetBets.  I thought someone might find it useful.\n\nThe stocks you pick to trade options also matter a great deal.  For example; I prefer NVDA & TSLA lately because they often recover very well from selloffs and will give you clearer direction.  Both obviously are popular and their profitability will continue to bring in more buyers.  Also, they are volatile and move well in both directions with NVDA being the easier of the two to trade.  \n\nIf you have been losing money trading options because of volatility, getting shaken out, stress, etc then the following strategy may help.  Determine the latest hot sector of the market i.e. energy, financials, retail, etc and trade options in the corresponding ETF.  For example XLE - Energy, XLF - Financials, etc.  These ETFs can still make you good money and won't move dramatically in either position.  They can help you learn the mechanics and make money at the same time without exhausting your mental energy.\n\nMy personal basic strategy is to find the ITM call or put that has the highest open interest and volume.  These usually have the tightest spreads and make it easy for me to move in and out.\n\nTry not to focus on the P/L, as you will get shaken out easily, but rather trade the chart. Sell half of your position at predetermined resistance levels that lose momentum without hesitation.  This will ensure profitable trades. \n\nAlso, if you are newer to options trading then I recommend only trading 1 contract at a time as this will keep your stress level down and allow you understand how the particular stock/option you are in behaves.  (Yes, they have their own behavior lol). \n\nIf you are more of an intermediate trader then slowly add to your position.  If i intend to buy 10 contracts I will add 1-2 at the point when I get to my target entry.  Often times what we believe is a great entry will temporarily break down and offer us a better entry.  This is when I will add more.  If I don't get the small capitulation move down then i add on the way up.

The 2 minute helps me see what's happening now while the 5 & 15 help me understand the trend.  In my right monitor I have the 1 hour and the daily chart split.  These give me the satellite view.  I tend to focus much more on those time frames only if the stock is getting close to a major moving average.\n\nFor example: Say I'm trading NVDA and it has sold off heavily in the morning but the NASDAQ (I watch the Qs QQQ) is still green and trending long.  I then need to understand why NVDA sold off.  (I follow these stocks everyday so I typically know) but if there isn't any news then it could be because we are at an ATH, profit taking ect.  I then expect a recovery but that means absolutely nothing until the chart gives me confirmation.\n\nFrom here I will look for a strong bottom wick on the 15 minute or a hammer.  The 5min & 2min will show me if this is developing.  If I get the potential 15 minute reversal candle then I want to see a confirmation candle.  I then look at the high of that reversal candle and keep a  mental note.  I will literally stare at the level 1 last price and level 2 bid price.  If I see the price break the high of the 15 min reversal candle then I know the trade has a chance.  From here I will usually let it prove to me that it will hold this reversal price and if I'm aggressive I will enter.\n\nThe above scenario gives me my support level for the Intraday trade.  I will likely use the last 5 minute candle as a stop or the second previous 5 minute candle of the confirmation 15 minute candle.  It really depends on how well the stock is responding to the reversal.  \n\nI sell at a resistance level set from the same day.

The fact is, we don't know.  I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XtJQzkeAaY) to be very helpful.  He summarizes the potential issues with this new 'nu' variant:\n\n1. It may be more transmissible than other variants, including delta.  That would be shocking because delta is already highly transmissible.\n2. It may be able to get around the vaccines we already have.\n3. It may result in more serious illnesses in those who are infected.  This one is not a serious concern at the moment.\n\nDo note that in this new variant there's 30 mutations to the spike protein, which is why we're concerned that there may implications for vaccine efficacy ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/25/who-calls-special-meeting-to-discuss-new-covid-variant-from-south-africa-with-large-number-of-mutations.html)).\n\nIn terms of investing, I don't encourage anyone to sell off right now.

Pretending like there isn't a problem when there is one doesn't solve anything.  There's a reason governments are taking this seriously.\n\nAnyway, it may all blow over, I fully acknowledge that and I hope it's the case!

I am relatively new and I imagine margin is a fundamental component of investing. When I say investing on margin I don‚Äôt mean leveraged etf‚Äôs I mean buying stocks/etfs on margin. \n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but from my basic understanding, investing using margins to buy shares should not be too influenced by volatility drag because it is based on the underlying asset and not on the gains/losses of the day.\n\nTo clarify, spending 100 on a 2x leveraged ETF would mean that a loss of 10% on the underlying index would given day would result in a loss of 20, bringing your total asset value to 80. You would need a 12.5% increase on the index for you to recoup your losses. \n\nIt would take 11.1% increase to recoup losses had you only bought the index and not the leveraged etf.\n\nBuying shares on margin fundamentally is different. You own 2x shares; you aren‚Äôt just increasing your risk/reward by 2x. This greatly reduces the amount of time required to recoup losses if there are major ones.  You spend 100 of your own money to buy 1 share and 100 of the brokerages money to buy another share. You now own $200 of assets and owe $100 to the brokerage. You have a net value of $100. \n\nIf the stock loses 10%, each stock would be worth 90 and you now own 180 in asset and owe 100. Networth is 80. So just like the leveraged etf when it comes to the losses, but recouping from the losses is much more in line with the non-leveraged approach. \n\nSince an 11.1% gain on the stock brings both shares back to A value of 100, it means you now own $200 of shares and owe $100. Networth = $100. \n\nAm I missing something here?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Downside is market has a couple of really bad days in a row.

For some reason, governments don‚Äôt want to do that...,\" Musk added, deviating from the subject of the factory grant.\n\nTesla itself is investing 5 billion euros in the battery plant, according to German economy ministry estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, construction of a car production site alongside the battery plant, which Tesla has begun building under pre-approval permits while it awaits final approval from the regional government, has made good progress in the last few weeks, a spokesperson for the federal economy ministry said.\n\nThe electric vehicle maker also applied in November 2020 for regional funding from Brandenburg, according to the regional government's website.\n\nA Brandenburg economy ministry spokesperson said this application had not been withdrawn.\n\nThe amount Tesla applied for is undisclosed, but investments worth over 100 million euros are generally given 6.8% of their value, the website says.\n\nThe latest round of online consultations for the public to express environmental and other concerns about the car factory and battery plant closed last week and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he hopes to formally begin production by the end of the year and then ramp up as quickly as possible.\n\nMusk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change. \n\nSource: https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-withdrew-state-funding-application-german-battery-plant-economy-ministry-2021-11-26/", "id": "r2xgg0", "created_utc": 1637962728.0, "score": 527, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 248, "comments": [{"body": "Uh whut?

But surprisingly, the US automaker does not want to accept government money.\n\nThe federal government would have been ready, but Tesla waived: For the planned battery cell factory in the almost finished electric car gigafactory, the funding decision for 1.135 billion euros from the second European battery cell program (IPCEI) was largely prepared. After it was said on Friday that the federal government had given the green light, the surprise came: The US company does not want to accept the state money.\n\nAccording to Tagesspiegel information, the funding decision in the Federal Ministry of Economics under the Executive Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) was practically already signed. The government decided a few weeks ago that Brandenburg wanted to contribute 120 million euros to the funding. Then the Federal Ministry of Economics and Tesla announced that the group waived.\n\nTesla has informed the Federal Ministry of Economics and the Brandenburg Ministry of Economics that it does not want to pursue participation in the second major European project for battery cell production (EuBatIn), the car manufacturer said. That is why the company withdrew the application for state funding for an IPCEI (transnational project of common European interest) for the battery factory in Gr√ºnheide.\n\n\n\"Tesla is still sticking to its plans for the battery and recycling factory in the Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg,\" the group continued.

And: \"The government funds not used by Tesla are now available for other projects.\" The aid for the project in Gr√ºnheide was approved by the EU Commission.\n\nThe Brandenburg Ministry of Economic Affairs said that Tesla's decision to build a state-of-the-art battery cell factory in Brandenburg would lead to additional added value with jobs and structural developments and would be a gain for the state.\n\nThe investment in the factory and development is estimated at around five billion euros.

The gimmicks are there to draw people in but aren't truly what generates ROI. Toyota is the largest and most profitable automaker because they are the best at making cars, not coming up with bullshit like a flashlight in your glovebox made from the same battery as in the car. Or the Nikola water dispenser thing. Those things are not features. They are poor engineering decisions. Last time I checked you always have your phone with you and you have a massive rolling 100kWh charging brick for it. It's unlikely you're going to need that flashlight ever.\n\nIf anything the existence of these 'gimmick' features demonstrates a lack of clear and strong engineering leadership from the top. Who is making the decision to spend engineering dollars on a flashlight? If anything shows that Gali's point about Rivian having too much money is right it's this.\n\nThe thing which will most determine Rivian's success over the next 10 years will be their ability to ramp production and do it profitably. Rivian is literally being valued at $100B for their prototype. They have no evidence of large-scale profitable vehicle production whatsoever. This is the exact opposite of what Elon said. Prototypes are easy, production is hard. So Rivian hasn't even done the hard part yet but is being valued as if they are the same as Tesla, who has already done the hard part? I'm not sure this bet makes any sense.\n\nMaybe at $30 it would be a worthy bet, but at $100 the risk to return is poor imo.\n\nAlso, by the time that Rivian is producing 2-300k of their Model Y replicant in 2025/6, GM/Ford/Daimler/BMW/VW will all have their real EV competitors out.

Risk/return for Rivian is a lot worse than Tesla. \n\nRegarding your pre-order, blame all the people buying 3/Y's! Too much demand for those really means Tesla will just keep delaying the CT until they have excess 4680's. Unless they feel the CT will increase their margin profile for some new reason.
