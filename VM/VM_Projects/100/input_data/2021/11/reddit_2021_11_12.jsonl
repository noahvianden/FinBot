Well, I expected with the political divisions in this country and the need for all incumbents to bring back a win in 2022, that there would be strong movement on legislative action this year. And it’s come true. Weed stocks are not only showing improving balance sheets, but real progress is being made toward legalizing weed in the US.  Now is the time. I’ve bought into many unnamed weed stonks. And even thought the last few weeks have been great, and I could show some gain porn, I’m waiting for the big payoff.  I’ve initially bought mostly Canadian weed, but now I’m buying more and more US.  As of now, I’m 12k in, but I plan to increase that to 50k by the EOM.

My cost basis is $11.90. I was initially in at $29 in February. The price is down after hours despite their Q3 earnings beat because their projected Q4 adjusted EBITDA is $5mln vs the $10mln Q4 guidance. If you look at their financials, Adjusted EBITDA is primarily impacted by changes in the FMV warrant liabilities, which is driven by stock price. So it’s really not a big issue in my opinion. The company still seems solid to me. They just made $50mln in earnings 3rd quarter (adjusted EBITDA of $10mln after accounting for warrant liabilities), and are posed for some solid growth. I could care less about adjusted EBITDA guidance unless it was something material.\n\nWhen you look at the valuations on the 1-yr price targets from all the analysts ($16-$21 range), the price targets and analysis assume no legalization of new states until 2023 and onwards and they apply 20% discounts because of industry risk. This is their base case discussion, and I believe it completely undervalued the stock. MAPS doesn’t touch cannabis so there’s no risk and the DOJ dropped their subpoenas a while back after MAPS dumped its illicit dispensary clients; so there’s literally no issues at the moment.\n\nLiterally 100% of what I have is in MAPS. I think it’s completely undervalued due to lack of understanding. It’s a long position hold, but once any sort of federal regulation hits this thing will take off. 14 years of consecutive positive cash flow with 90%+ profit margins, you can’t find that in other cannabis stocks. \n\nEverything else is positive. They’re solvent, highly liquid from going public. Users are growing, MOU’s growing, and they’re spending a lot on mergers and acquisitions and marketing to prepare for new states that are legalized. Only a matter of time for this one. I hope the price stays down so I can dump more into it. \n\nhttps://ir.weedmaps.com/news-releases/news-release-details/wm-technology-inc-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "I’ll buy a few contracts just on your DD.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I see this as a long play, especially through legalization.
