Their justification was surprisingly convincing to me at least. I did some googling to refresh my memory a bit, but you can find more articles on it from searching. \n\nThere were two main points that jumped out to me.  One is that with their current battery production they can make a TON more hybrids than they could full EV. The number I found from 2019 was about 1 million hybrids compared to 28k full ev. In this way they actually reduce emissions more by having more hybrids in total. \n\nSecond one really got me thinking about EVs in general and is related to number 1. This article or quote I couldn't find again (and may actually have been honda?) so I might butcher some of the numbers. But the summary is that people's general driving patterns don't lend themselves to full EV. A huge portion of driving is short trips,  say like 20 to 50 miles at the end of which you'd largely be able to recharge it. But you can't make a 50 mile battery car because on those instances you're doing a 300 mile trip say every few weeks or months, it's going to be awful. So then you end up making a 300 mile battery, but then your lugging around the full weight and resources (think the mining of resources) unnecessarily for like 90 percent of your driving. So in that way a hybrid makes a lot more sense.\n\nI'm not too keen on a hybrid because reliability and low maintenance cost are my number 1 priorities in car ownership and the nature of hybrids makes me nervous in that regard (perhaps incorrectly).

{"title": "Rivian vs Tesla sanity check: back of the envelope calculation", "selftext": "This will be short and sweet as I am down with covid now (Fatigue is a b\\*\\*\\*c).\n\nLet's assume that $TSLA is NOT one of the most overvalued mega cap ever as many argue and **I agree it is overvalued by a lot**. Not a huge TSLA fan here...\n\n**But ....let's assume TSLA is fairly valued.**\n\nCurrent market cap:\n\n$TSLA: 1T\n\n$RIVN: 127B\n\nratio of market cap: 7.8\n\nI am not going to judge RIVN on current (near zero) revenue. Let's look at 2 years out and 9 years out.\n\nA conservative forecast is that $TSLA can add [1.21M](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/11/09/tesla-growth-in-the-next-two-years-2022-2023/) vehicles to its yearly production. This is based on actual plants in/soon-to-be in production. Assuming 2021Q4 will grow at 15% over 2021Q3 (same growth from Q2 to Q3), TSLA would have produced 900M vehicles this year.\n\nTSLA 2021: 900M\n\n**TSLA 2023: 2.11M**\n\n**TSLA 2030: Elon projects 20M**. This can be super optimistic, I will get back to it soon.\n\nDemand for TSLA? TSLA does not have a demand issue as Elon. For example, currently TSLA is the second largest EV in \\*CHINA\\*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's Look at RIVIAN ($RIVN) production forecast according to its own CEO, however ambitious and optimistic:\n\nRIVN 2023: [CEO projects 200K](https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/)\n\n**RIVN 2030:** [**CEO projects at least 1M**](https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/)**.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Car production:**\n   1. Whether in 2023 or 2030, TSLA will produce at least 10X as RIVN. I say at least because TSLA can prove based on current plans capacity it can deliver 2.1M in 2023, RIVN CEO cannot really prove that, but let's take his work.\n2. **Demand**\n   1. Much hype has been made about RIVN because F and AMZN invested in it. And AMZN has committed to purchase 100K vehicles over the next 5 years. Let's put things into perspective: **TSLA has proved its popularity in CHINA, EUROPE, and US vs. RIVN has a contract with AMZN.**\n   2. **Some misunderstanding by retail investors about RIVN:** Just because F and AMZN backed RIVN does not mean they will be giving RIVN free money OK?  IF that guarantees that RIVN can finance with future rounds (good thing), this will dilute your shares\n3. **Other production**\n   1. **Unlike TSLA, RIVN is ONLY a car company. TSLA produces solar, batteries, software, soon Lithium, + has proven it can navigate through shortages**\n4. **Management:**\n   1. I think we all agree - even TSLA haters - that Elon is one of the smartest most innovative, most ambitious visionary with a long track record of success after success. We know nothing about Scaringe. He is definitely a smart guy, but it would be extremely extremely optimistic to think he can one up Elon on innovation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finally we can talk about returns on your investment.**\n\nRIVN remains largely pre-revenue, it has not proven itself yet. Therefore investors RIVN which is more risky play, needs to deliver higher returns than TSLA. **No one would invest in a pre-revenue company if its expected return on investment does not exceed  more mature companies.** Would you invest in TSLA if the returns on its stock is not going to exceed that of KO?\n\nIn 2030 TSLA/RIVN Car production only **= 20x.** Let's say Elon is too optimistic about 2030 and Scaringe is conservative, **let's say it is 15X**\n\n**Currently the market cap is only 7.8 X half of production ratio.**\n\nThis means that even if TSLA's non-car production (solar, software, chips, etc) does not materialize and is equal to zero (against all evidence) ...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR/CONCLUSION:**\n\nAt fair valuation in 2030 **with extremely generous assumption to RIVN** compared to TSLA **the returns on your RIVN investment will be HALF of that of TSLA**.. (1+x)=2\\*(1+y)\n\n**If the return on your TSLA stock is 100% ===> $RVN will be 0%**\n\n**If the return on your TSLA stock is 50% ===> $RVN will be -25%**\n\n**If the return on your TSLA stock is 0% ===> $RVN will be -50%**\n\nIF TSLA crashes by 30% as some TSLA skeptics such as me believe it is possible, RIVN will have to crash by 65%\n\nAgain, this is under the assumption that TSLA (like RIVN) is only a car company and that RIVN will meet and exceed its goals in comparison to TSLA.\n\n**Would you invest in a pre-revenue company with lower returns than a mature company?**\n\nFor more analysis like this you can follow me on twitter: at TCPresearch ...

Batteries need special rare materials, right? Is anyone cornering that supply?\n\nIt depends on the type of batteries. Most are Lithium based, which require some rarer materials, however those materials have been getting phased out in newer batteries.\n\nAlso they've been experimenting with alternative batteries. Tesla has been starting to use iron based batteries recently that someone else developed. To sum it up briefly they're heavier than Lithium batteries, and don't have quite as much range, however they're cheaper to make, and don't suffer from battery degradation if you charge them to 100% like Lithium batteries do. \n\nThere's other types of batteries being worked on to, but none of which are really in mass production.\n\n> Then there’s the electricity itself. Can’t Elon use his solar panels and battery tech to power his superchargers? He can sell you the car AND generate and sell the electricity that goes into it. Right? It would be like combining chevron and Ford. Or like how Bezos has his own airports and trucking fleets. \n\nAt least some of the charging stations are powered in part from solar. However there's a reason why the faster level 3 charging is more expensive, it's because it uses a lot more power. Also keep in mind you wouldn't want a charging station to run out of power and potentially strand EV owners because they couldn't recharge. That's what could happen if solar powered chargers run out of power at night, or can't recharge on a day with bad weather.\n\n> Someone smart please ELI5 about the future of batteries, the needed materials, who controls that, who can make batteries best — then please tell us about charging networks and power generation— that will tell me who wins the EV game, right?\n\nLike I said somewhat earlier it really depends as there's more then 1 type of battery being used, and there's others being worked on (like the mythical solid state battery, which I personally remain deeply skeptical about hitting the market anything soon). There's some supply issues with batteries yes, a lot of automakers are trying to acquire enough supplies for it.\n\nThat said while Tesla does make their own batteries, they also buy them from other suppliers like CATL, because they can't make enough themselves. A lot of the other automakers have similar plans.\n\nThat said, if you want to learn more about battery supply issues there's an interview with JB Straubel on a channel called \"This week in startups\" you may want to listen to. He left Tesla a few years ago to start a company focused on recycling all the EV batteries when they inevitably reach their end of life.

The other factor is that our grid can support a much larger number of cars than people think, because most of the charging can be done at a steady rate during off-peak hours and is only for a commute's worth of charge per vehicle.\n\nHe's correct about oil being in demand forever.

I would argue industrial vehicle diesel and oil use is probably bigger than products but combining the two, it would be in the 30% range that would be hardest to disrupt.

So it will probably be around the end of this decade oil starts to feel demand pinch in developed world and another 5 years in developing world.\n\nIn that time frame a lot can happen. Heck we talk about robotaxi and Teslabots!. The oil industry will have a lot of dynamics facing it. How will Saudi’s manage supply to keep prices up? Will recycling ever really take off? Will there be other uses found for oil? How much supply is there? There are lots of alternative oil sources like shale oil but needs high prices to make it profitable. Will technology improve to make it cheaper to produce?\n\nRe power grid - is that even an argument? In the short term people will learn to charge during off peak hours which is cheaper and result in less brown outs. This will be incentivized  if a lot of brown outs. Distributed power will ultimately become a thing as solar/batteries become cheaper further reducing strain on grid. And finally the government can always upgrade the system. We’ve seen big battery infrastructure installed within 100 days in Australia and earnings has communicated infrastructure has a 2-3 year backlog so clearly there is demand. More renewable energy plants will be installed replacing gas peaker plants and coal base power plants and batteries will ensure consistent power.

That money will have to be taxed from its citizens, and the nature of tax has always been one of percentages.  It definitely seems broken to me that some of the wealthiest persons pay the least percent in tax relative to their wealth, as this clearly runs counter to the intended nature of taxation.  \n\nBut the lack of tax money is just one aspect.

Do you plan to buy, hold or short when options become available?", "selftext": " \n\nTwo days after IPO Rivian has increased by 69.49% to 132.20$ per share and reached a market cap of 112 billion. Rivian is an electric vehicle company and to date has sold >200 vehicles however hopes to expand that to 1 million per year by 2030. Both Amazon and ford have large stakes in Rivian and Amazon plans to purchase 100,000 of Rivians electric vans that they plan to produce in the future.\n\nThe best company to compare Rivian to is Tesla since it's the biggest all electric vehicle manufacturer. When Tesla first IPO’d it had already sold over 1000 vehicles and had a market cap of around 2 billion which is 55x less than Rivians today. I think this is absurd, Rivian has yet to prove it's ability to scale yet has a market cap a 10th of Teslas while selling more than 1000x less vehicles. (this is excluding the fact that tesla has other businesses outside automotive deliveries that attribute to its market cap) Considering that Rivian is at extremely low volume at the moment and is experiencing its first factory ramp there will most likely be delays which could affect the outlook (we have seen this with tesla having numerous delays). We do not know what rivians margins are, they could be as low as 10% like traditional OEM’s or as high as 30% like tesla. \n\nI do think that Rivian has potential , it looks like they have a good product from the reviews I've seen and they have big backers but at the moment the euphoria around the stock is baseless.\n\nWith all of these uncertainties I think that Rivians current stock price is completely unjustified and I plan on shorting it once options become available.

This means that we have enough stock in total to elect someone to the board of these companies. We can elect a member of this community to become a fully-fledged board member of a large multi-national company.

However, with a fully centralized discussion like we have here on r/wallstreetbets, we can elect our chosen candidate to be a member of a board.\n\nNow we just need a process to elect the candidate.

Nothing has sent this up, good earnings reports pop then sell, bounces in general sell, insider buying did nothing. Stock is routinely down on overall market Green Day’s. \n\nSo obviously there’s something going on here, but what is it and why? I know a lot of you were present during the mooning phase to 100 so should have some insight. Out of all the streamers VIAC seems to be in the best position to grow. There content from paw patrol to Yellowstone is great. Pluto TV is on fire. Still have the big name movies for the big screen. In a time where Netflix and Disney are plateauing when is VIAC gonna get its due. Alright maybe Netflix isn’t really plateauing but their growth has definitely been factored into the stock, while VIAC is trading like a telecom.", "id": "qt1hjz", "created_utc": 1636810858.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "Here's my view on it.\n\nBill Hwang is a Korean American.
