{"title": "My upcoming option plays for December.", "selftext": "In previous to my last SPY post that netted a lot of people 10k+\n\nI thought I would share my upcoming moves and plays for the run into December.\n\nI will not be updating this as much I have done in my previous posts because I am trying to save more of my intraday ideas to people who join my Discord. (Edit: For everyone asking, I charge for my Discord. If you can make 10k-60k off my plays, you can afford $35 a month for me.)\n\nNevertheless, I will post what I am going to be watching and positions I will be taking in the coming month.\n\nLCID-LongReasoning: LCID has a fanbase like TSLA (you gay bears are about to find out) . I also believe it's going to become the baby brother of TSLA.\n\n1.5B order book. 2nd most voted EV stock AHEAD of RIVN right under TSLA. Also, read the daily chart. I believe it's going to shoot past 60 this week. Spike of OI on Friday at the $48 c 11/26. I do NOT like weekly's, but this would be a solid play. Safer play is ATM 55c one month out.\n\nCant get long if we drop under 50. Can't get short if go over 55.\n\nEntry PT : 53\n\nSPY - LongReasoning: Do I really need a reason besides daddy JPOW is supplying? Okay. Here's my reasoning.Fuck Morgan Stanley's PT. 82% of S&P companies reported good earnings. 500 by January if not by Dec 31st. Been playing SPY for months and make a living off it. I understand how this ETF moves. Buying a super spread out play for 470c/480c/485c for December 31st.\n\nCan't get long if we trade under 466\n\nCan't get short if we trade over 470\n\nEntry PT: 468\n\nMU-LongReasoning: Holy shit this thing is a ticking time bomb. Jumped from 76-83 in 2 days. My 100c LEAP for 400 days out is on fucking fire. Can totally play this weekly, but would reccomend you play this month. This stock is baby NVDA with how it moves and sometimes it will have some shit days, but LEAPS are your friend here.\n\nStill waiting to see what will happen on Monday, but I except 100 easily by January if we blast past previous resistance. Could get shot back down to 75 though.\n\nCan't get short if we trade over 84\n\nCan't get long if we drop back down below 79\n\nEntry PT: 80ish (wiggle room here)\n\nSHOP-Want to get long, probably will be short for 1-3 daysReasoning: This is gonna be AMZN's little brother. Options chain has almost the same return ratio as AMZN did on Friday. Buy a 500 call and it runs to 3k in an hour. Amazing financials blah blah, treat this stock like Amazon. Expect huge moves and wild 3 day profit pullbacks.\n\nNo long/short side here, but my entry PT is 1630 at support.\n\nHD-Want to get long, probably will be short for 1-3 days\n\nReasoning: Amazing earnings. Everyone and their mom was whining about it crashing but then I thought, wow 2b in profit? Blackrock sure is gonna need some place around to take care of all those homes they bought. Either way, I made a shitload off my calls from last week.\n\nCan't get long if we go below 395\n\nCan't get short over 405/410\n\nEntry PT: 400 or slightly below.\n\nIf anyone has any questions about my decisions or reasonings please feel free to let me know and share your opinions, either way I hope this helps everyone.\n\nEDIT: I am now adding COST (costco) to this list. Upon further review, I noticed that Costco and Home Depot both have OUTRAGEOUS free cash flows. Very bullish on both of them after seeing that. Which is why they did not crash after earnings.  \n\n\nAlso adding **Visa.

Probably deployed throughout the insurance industry, not to sure tbh.\n\nFrom Lemonades S-1:\n\n>The low cost of capital for reinsurance companies creates an opportunity to share premiums and maintain our gross margins while dramatically reducing our capital requirements through a structure called \"proportional reinsurance\" (also known as \"quota share reinsurance\"). Beginning on July 1, 2020, we will have proportional reinsurance protecting 75% of our business (the \"Proportional Reinsurance Contracts\"). Under the Proportional Reinsurance Contracts, which spans all of our products and geographies, **we transfer, or \"cede,\" 75% of our premiums to our reinsurers. In exchange, these reinsurers pay us a \"ceding commission\" of 25% for every dollar ceded, in addition to funding all of the corresponding claims, i.e. 75% of all our claims.** This arrangement mirrors our fixed fee, and hence shields our gross margin, from the volatility of claims, while boosting our capital efficiency dramatically.\n\nThey cede 75% of the premium and 75% of the risk to a reinsurer. The reinsure then pays them a 25% commission for the business.\n\nAverage US car insurance is $1600/year. The insurer would cede 75% to a reinsure($1200) and keep $400.  The insurer would receive $300 from the reinsurer in commission.

Look for confirmation of this in this week’s PCE deflator and other numbers.\n\nThe average consumers’ expectations on inflation is a good leading indicator. Leading in that the more inflation they expect, the more they’ll want higher wages and the more businesses will raise prices.\n\nThis isn’t limited to the US. Inflation is creeping up everywhere. Most likely, central banks globally will start raising rates in end of Q1. Fed will likely speed up tapering.\n\nBtw, the 10yr rate doesn’t tell the full picture. The yield curve is very dynamic.  It’s possible for short term interest rates to rise because of inflationary pressures but the long end of the curve to stay muted, which implies a more of a stagflationary environment—higher inflation, but low real growth rates.\n\nIn all, I’m concerned this is the local top of a very good bull run in tech. I strongly disagree with Wedbush and other permabulls.\n\nHow the sell off in stocks will occur: besides the macro effects, if interest rates rise, people’s margin accounts will be strained. Because we’re at an all time high in margin borrowing, it won’t take much to stress this.

{"title": "Tesla Stock Split Conspiracy Theory", "selftext": "I don’t normally do threads like this, but I’m a big supporter of Elon Musk and I follow [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) stock closely. This is going to be a nerdy, conspiracy-theory type thread on Tesla, based on some recent hints from Elon himself.  Take it for what you will; I just think it's fun.\n\nTruth or fiction, it’s still interesting to analyze, and I did happen to stumble upon a connection that seems beyond coincidence -- something which to my knowledge no one else has picked up on.  That made it worth writing about.  We’ll save that bit for last.\n\nSo, Elon is known for leaving breadcrumbs, which are usually only evident in retrospect.   A great example is this now-famous tweet:   You’ll notice that his tweet was sent at 8:11 PST; a stock split was then announced on August 11th (8/11).\n\n[stock price too high tweet](https://preview.redd.it/tdggb6cq3w081.png?width=2250&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f12606102b88ef1495cb70463a3dda77a68ba9)\n\nThere are more examples, but this thread deals with the current speculation over another upcoming [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) split.  Why the speculation?   Well, Tesla’s price is nearing the same levels as when the previous split was announced; that alone is enough to fuel some healthy speculation.\n\nMore interestingly, Elon seems to have been dropping some of his famous hints here and there about when the split might occur.  This hypothetical date is 12/09/21, and some speculators think it will be a 5:1 split, as was the previous split.\n\nNow, most of this speculation is tongue-in-cheek. Just us [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) fans having fun more or less.   Consider this, for example: \"129 orbital flights\" -- an oddly specific milestone -- which some believe hints at the 12/9 date.  Eh. Not super convincing.\n\n[falcon 9 milestone tweet](https://preview.redd.it/yn03ahoz3w081.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=01668e9ccad3c8c7885620aa2f8fb3d9df615f03)\n\nOr [this](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1460982932642877451), from [@garyblack00](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00). \"12 million pounds of thrust.\" Gary noted that there are 9 middle thrusters.   Again, 12/9 appears. And Elon Musk's tweet was sent at 10:20 PST. 10:2, reducible to 5:1. Nothing too firm; maybe just fueling the fire a little.\n\n[gary black noting the raptor engines](https://preview.redd.it/dmha5poe4w081.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=765a579c0421c4d5e651c4b92ac0609ad5497783)\n\ncoincidences? Maybe. But this is where it's gonna start to get weird.  [@garyblack00](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00) noticed an oddity in his excellent  research and analysis.\n\n[gary analysing stock sale](https://preview.redd.it/mlktpyyn4w081.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8d9aba1567ffcc82efd85d431575ac85521147)\n\nOf all the random blocks of stock Elon has been selling in various amounts, one very specific number has appeared 3 times (so far): 934,091 shares.  At first glance, nothing seems too special about this number. But, knowing Elon, it just seems too specific to be random.\n\nIt took me about 5 minutes before I saw it, and I cannot possibly imagine how all this is a coincidence.   (I also cannot imagine how he reverse engineered this, so there's that too.)  Anyway, here we go. Nerd stuff only from here on out. You've been warned\n\nWe've established that Elon has been (somewhat)  planting the 12/9 number in our heads, leading many to speculate on a 12/09/21 split.  Then this 934,091 number starts appearing. Could they be connected?  What follows is complete lunacy, but it's too perfect not to lay it out.\n\n12/09/2021 can be written as the number 12,092,021.   Let’s divide that by his \"random\" recurring sale number, 934,091. The result?   12.9  Sound familiar?\n\nBut an iPhone calculator gives 6 decimal places by default, so the full number you see is 12.945228.  We've already got 12.9. But what happens if we add up the remaining decimals?  4+5+2+2+8 = (drumroll) 21.  --> 12.9.21\n\nCrazy? We've barely even started.  The iPhone shows 6 decimal places by default, but the full iPhone result is: 12.94522803452769.  What if we add \\*all\\* the numbers after the 12.9? This is tricky because we have a zero -- so are we adding 8 + 0, or 80?    Elon may have answered.\n\nIn a recent discussion about the concept of zero, Elon wrote \"Nothing matters\" -- \"nothing\" here referring to zero, in that it \\*does\\* matter -- i.e, include it in the number to get 80.   He then followed it up with this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[elon's tweet on zero being a cool concept](https://preview.redd.it/99zj92pw4w081.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=b002072ffab96874114baa209b524366d7a40e5c)\n\n(It's worth noting that Elon's above tweet was sent at 11:34; I mention it because if you return to our full number -- 12.94522803452769 -- you'll notice a 34 immediately after the zero in question.)  Not convinced? Think I'm stretching? Read on.\n\nGo ahead and grant me this “zero matters\" thing and let's add up all the numbers in 12.94522803452769, after the 12.9.  4+5+2+2+80+3+4+5+2+7+6+9 = ?  129.\n\nBelieve it or not, we are still not done.   In true [@elonmusk](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk) fashion, he has personally signed this amazing work of art.  Let's add up all the single numbers in 12.94522803452769, just to see what we get.  1+2+9+4+5+2+2+8+0+3+4+5+2+7+6+9 = ?  69.\n\nOne obvious thing I left out that I’d like to add here — I have no idea if this means a split is happening on 12/9.   Elon could just as easily be trolling; I’m making no predictions here.  I just find it incredible that this much detail, planning, and genius went into this.\n\n\\-Rob Graves", "id": "qyoqoo", "created_utc": 1637475296.0, "score": 1216, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 406, "comments": [{"body": "Was gonna write this pff as crazy talk but after reading it all i think i might be crazy now too....", "score": 754, "replies": [{"body": "Hi crazy im crazy too", "score": 74, "replies": [{"body": "Hi, crazy too.

I have literally looked at the top 12 largest, publicly-traded shipping companies and this one seems to have the greatest mismatch on price:value. \n\n**Margins**\n\n$ZIM has one of (if not, the) highest margins of any shipping company in the industry with a 66% EBITDA margin (that's double $APPL). \n\n**Rate of growth**\n\nWhether it has been their shipping fleet acquisitions, the freight prices, or efficient logistics $ZIM has 18X'd their profit YoY. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tri9nglhkz081.png?width=2508&format=png&auto=webp&s=35275a8fb7642c2953228db9bf8b7be2c00d4c6b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Stock Performance**\n\n$ZIM went public in January this year and has averaged a 100% return every quarter. For a **REAL** company, this is unparalleled. They literally just go up and to the right. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ptd3omdjlz081.png?width=2522&format=png&auto=webp&s=81cc178b902e40d8a4002aff7948ff657e4d5166\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Price Mismatch**\n\nAfter looking at the top 12 highest market cap shipping companies, $ZIM seems to be the most mispriced. The average PE of the shipping industry is  \\~6.9X (nice). While $ZIM trades @ 3.3X. Even if $ZIM were to normalize at the industry's average, that's over a 100% return. If you look at revenue, $ZIM brings in roughly 20% of Maersk's $AMKBY (the largest shipping company by MC) revenue while trading at \\~10% of the valuation.  If you were to normalize $ZIM (66% margin) with $AMKBY (41% margin) based upon net profit, you'd expect a 130% return from the current price of $57. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Comparison across some shipping companies.](https://preview.redd.it/6wve2xa8tz081.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e2984facc1c048ebec1529ea691d516ad1161cb)\n\n**The Next Run**\n\nAfter $ZIM completely destroyed their Q3 earnings ($12.16 vs $8.99 EPS) and announced a market-leading dividend (20% of quarter's net income with a 4th quarter dividend equal to 30-50% of annual net income), and heavy volume has started coming in over the last few days. People are starting to notice. If we assume a similar profit for Q4, their '21 annual profit is \\~$4.5B. We know that based on shares outstanding divided by net income with a 20% dividend is $2.50. This means that their 4th quarter dividend (assumed at the midpoint of 40%) will be $15. At a current share price of $57, you'd basically get **a 26% return just from a single dividend.**  If you don't think boomers and pensions that love dividends aren't going to jump into this stock then go YOLO into some weed stocks (RIP. Long $ROPE). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How to Play**\n\n$ZIM's ex-dividend date is Dec 15th so, if you'd like the dividend (like me) you'd have to get in before that date. If you think the stock will massively skyrocket from dividend investors, here's the options chain. You'll notice the most volume taking place at the $60 strike calls. These calls also have the greatest #gamma and could offer a great return with a breakeven price of $62.60. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/187r26jnqz081.png?width=2574&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3f502b943a2717b68a7a813f87e02fb99a2d554\n\n**Positions**\n\n100 shares @ $57.50\n\n **\\*This is literally my uneducated, unlicensed opinion.
