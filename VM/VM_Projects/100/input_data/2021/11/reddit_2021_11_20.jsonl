A user clicks to buy the product and Pinterest passes the order to the merchant through some common API, or even a script if they have to. The order includes the product wanted, as well as Paypal payment and shipping info. Paypal takes their merchant fees and gives Pinterest a cut.\n\nIt checks out technically, and the financial incentives are there. The last question is 'will people use it' and I am confident that people will. I think a lot of the same demographic that buys garbage from Instagram ads will buy stuff on Pinterest. Likewise, if I'm scrolling through beautiful cars and see an ad for car wax or something, I would consider buying it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Why would the other site agree to that though? Amazon is not going to work with an API to help Pinterest take a cut of business they're already getting. Pinterest already makes income from affiliate links and that seems to be Amazon's preferred way of compensating other sites for driving them business. Amazon wouldn't want to pay merchant fees to another site because Amazon is literally just a merchant.\n\nMeanwhile, it's the content creator that would have to put their item on Pinterest directly in order to have Pinterest own the sale. If the content creator just links away to their Amazon store page, or to their Etsy, or wherever else, then Pinterest is SoL on that sale.\n\nI don't personally think very many creators are going to make new stores at Pinterest in addition to their existing stores at Amazon/Etsy/wherever, at least not without a significant investment in dev, promotion, and incentive from Pinterest. Pinterest has been trying to make this pivot happen, and they've been struggling with it.\n\nCould they do it? Sure. But all of that is still besides the point, because for PYPL, who already has a deal with Amazon via Venmo to process payments... why would they spend all this money to build a new way to capture revenue they're already earning? If Pinterest wants to invest their money to be the next big thing, fine. PYPL could get them as a *client* and they wouldn't have to pay billions of dollars to purchase the company and then invest in all this development. Also, buying a company and trying to directly compete with your brand new customer who you're currently designing an app with sounds like a good way to poison that relationship.\n\nPinterest isn't bad, but PYPL doesn't need to own them. It would be a stupid way to deploy capital, because it would cost maybe $35-$40B just to buy them out, then another $5B or so to build the infrastructure Pinterest needs to capture these sales in-house. And the risks of that massive investment are that a) creators simply don't move over and keep making outbound linking posts, b) Amazon gets pissed and drops Venmo, and c) many of these sales would have been processed through Venmo on Amazon anyway, so you haven't actually made that much more.\n\nIf the investment doubled Pinterest's revenue, it would be a 5% gross cash flow yield, which is not great since your actually ROIC is going to be net of costs and net of the opportunity cost of doing nothing and still benefitting from PINS' growth.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Why would the other site agree to that though?\n\nMore sales.

I have a hyperthyroid senior cat, and that's how they are. She might be in the early stages. They're always hungry yet lose weight and can eventually become emaciated or develop organ failure. It's thought to be caused by PBDE flame retardants that are sprayed on items such as furniture and mattresses. PBDEs are widely used in the USA, but they are banned in several other countries as they should be imo. BPA is another chemical that is thought to contribute, which is found in the lining of food cans and plastic products like drink bottles or even on the inside of lids on glass jars. There is a giant rabbit hole of information on this topic, and it makes me angry at American standards. Furniture made after January 2015 must disclose on the tag if it's been treated or not (several brands stopped using flame retardants thankfully, like Ashley and LaZBoy), but BPA free items are trickier because many companies use it without disclosure or just use related chemicals like BPS and BPF that don't have a known history of safety at the levels they are being used, which usually happens when companies advertise \"BPA free\" like it's safe. We don't know if it's safe yet and BPA certainly isn't, even for humans. My apologies for the length of my comment. It's just something I really care about, and I'm angry that my own cat has been made sick through USA \"safety\" standards (more like lack thereof). Even AHAA which is considered the leading veterinary network in the USA is aware of this, yet it's still happening. Cats were never diagnosed with hyperthyroidism until the 1970s when this stuff started being used heavily, and now it's one of the most common cat diseases, especially in senior cats. \n\nAs for the food for your kitty, Orijen dry food or Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost (also dry) are the only foods that my cat can hold a very lean weight on. Hyperthyroid cats need the most meat you can get (and that you can afford) in a food, and they need to eat it whenever they want. If your cat will eat a lot of canned food, go for that to keep her more hydrated. Try the other too if you can and see which one keeps the most weight on her. Maybe both will work best for her - just make sure the foods are as meaty as you can get, so avoid fillers like grains, peas, potatoes, and other veggies as much as possible. Cats are obligate carnivores and can't pull the nutrients out of plant materials the same way omnivores can. \n\nIt's usually a progressive disease and gets worse over time without intervention. I don't have a vet anywhere near my area who can give my cat the cure which is radioactive Iodine 131 (I know that sounds counter-intuitive but it kills the overactive thyroid cells and leaves the rest intact). It requires a facility that does special precaution because of the radioactivity, and they keep the cat there for about a week until it's safe for you the human to take her home. There is also a pill called methimazole (Felimazole) that can help if your cat can handle it without scratching her cheeks raw (it's worth a try), but the Iodine is a one and done cure in 98% of cases if you are able to get to a vet who does it.

FOR profit prisons, just like any other corporation, are answerable to their stockholders.   \nSince we are in a Stocks subreddit, we are here because we want to make money. Thus, a for-profit prison has an incentive to lobby for every new inmate because they make money on every inmate. Our minimum sentencing laws could successfully ruin lives.  \nPrison is not a solution to every crime. Our thinking is every crime must be punished (instead of rehabilitation), and hence we have one of the highest incarceration rates in the world. Does that mean that we are such a lawless country? No, we are not, but the chance of someone being jailed for an extremely minor crime is high, esp. if it is a person of color, and that I attribute that to the laws written by the lobbyists for these companies. \n\nWe all need to understand, the goal of privatization is not to run the system efficiently. Someone will be/is making money off privatization, and they successfully convinced the lawmakers by way of contributing to their election campaigns. And worst of all, both major parties in our country are responsible for it.\n\nThere are a lot of immoral businesses in the world, but IMHO, a for-profit prison sits among the top of that list. Hence, I will not invest in such companies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>For profit hospitals run more efficiently and often higher quality than the non profit ones\n\nI beg to differ from this conclusion. First of all, non-profit does not mean they are a charity. It only means that they must spend all the money that they make. If you search for salaries of non-profit CEOs, they are not any different from for-profit. In my books, for-profit and non-profit are about the same, just non-profit are gaming the system legally.

You could make the exact same arguments you are making about why laws are as they are w/ regards to prison guard unions, which actually have tremendously more power than prison REITs and private prison operators, and have extremely bad track records as a group. I also think that a corporation is going to be a lot more vulnerable to lawsuits and public pressure than a prison union, so you could argue it's naturally more accountable. Ultimately, I don't think it matters if it's \"immoral\" or not for a private entity to run a prison, because you are going to have the same questions about even running a prison as a state, or having people employed as prison guards. What I think matters is how well the prison performs on it's goals of - being humane, safe and fair to inmates, complying with laws, reducing recidivism, and yes, reducing costs on society/government. That's a separate debate from policing, how we sentence, etc.\n\nWhat I am asking if anyone has actually done that analysis deeply and has the answer (which may be an it depends on context, types of criminals, etc), on how private prisons compare on those KPIs vs state prisons. Maybe they are just worse. But surely there has been quality research done on this at this point.\n\nAs for for-profit vs non-profit hospitals, there's a lot of health care economics work on this, and I've read a lot of the academic stuff. Having read a lot on this topic, the biggest issue is straight up market structure, which is set by government in a sense - hospital groups are now almost without exceptions local monopolies, duopolies, or similar high market power situations, and like all low competition situations, you see an increase in profitability driven by price increases to customers, a reduction innovation, a degree of shortage of the things desired, and an occasional indifference to quality.  As for for-profit hospitals in particular, they seek efficiency more strongly and successfully than not-for-profit just by their structure and that has played out in their performance though to a limited extent. The #1 issue there is industry structure, and the lack of local competition that happens out of it. No one wants to bad mouth your local university that runs the beloved local hospital group, but they are in there on the local hospital board blocking competitors and jacking up prices every year nonetheless.

As are with many things in life, this issue is grayer than it is black and white like many in the comments conveniently calling out whichever sectors get the most frequent/negative press coverage (e.g. Oil, Meta/Facebook, Tobacco, Chemicals, etc).\r  \n\r  \nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is a good non-financial gauge but likely not comprehensive nor standardized enough for the globalized economy we have today.\r  \n\r  \nI strongly believe that at the Fortune 500 level, if one looks close enough, one can find enough questionable decisions made by any of the companies to not to invest in - I will provide some examples of industries/sectors left out by most below. \n\nUltimately, I believe we are making a compromise between generating profit from our portfolio (this gets trickier if one is managing money other than his/her own due to fiduciary responsibility ‚Äì to make the most money in a legal and sustainable way instead of fulfilling the best versions of society, but I digress) and our opinions on how much good/bad the companies are doing.  \n\r  \n1)\tQuick Service Restaurant Chains and Major Beverage companies: (McDonald‚Äôs, Yum Brands (owners of Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, etc), Coca-Cola, and Pepsi) ‚Äì one may argue the unhealthy food and drinks options offered are detrimental to the well-being of society, but often the top dogs in these sectors are household names globally, whose earnings are rather consistently and offer, at times, attractive dividends. \r  \n\r  \n2)\tHealthcare System Related: ranging from drug manufacturers (Pfizer), insurance companies (United Healthcare), major for-profit hospital chains (HCA Healthcare). While it is difficult to think of live-saving businesses as evil but this current ecosystem perpetuates the higher-than-most-countries medical costs in U.S. while offering same if not lower life expectancy and/or quality of lives. These sectors contain some businesses with good profit margins along with predictable cash flow (expect maybe pharma companies who have major drug pipeline issue or multiple expiring patents). \r  \n\r  \n3)\tTelecom: (from giants Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile to smaller regional players): some firms having monopoly power in selected markets so they can offer mediocre services and products at more than average price, limited % of population the opportunity to fully leverage what is essentially a vital utility in modern lives like water and electricity.\r  \n\r  \nTLDR: in my humble opinion, It‚Äôs easier for one to say he/she wont invest in the commonly demonized companies or industries (Oil, Pharma, Tech, etc), but the truth is that most larger publicly listed companies in all sectors are flawed (just way less obvious or discussed) and I believe the answer is a lot more complicated. That said, I do not believe it‚Äôs practical nor justifiably profitable enough to invest in only companies that do pure good (good luck finding them and if so to your retirement plans), however I do believe in adjusting one‚Äôs portfolio weightage according to its positive contribution to society (investing LESS in ‚Äúevil‚Äù companies, instead of none).", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fuck Gamestop up the ass.

Intel is finally catching up with Moore's Law", "selftext": "Moore's Law states the amount of transistors on a chip doubles every two years but the cost of production drops by half. This concept was created by Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel and has actually held up for decades.\n\nASML designs and manufactures EUV lithography machines, which are extremely high precision machines that put complex designs on incredibly small chips. ASML is the only EUV lithography design and manufacturer in the world. Look up their stock performance and financials if you question these claims.\n\nIntel used to be a top class chip manufacturer but they've struggled with the 7nm chips and their stock has been punished. The simple reason for Intel's shortcomings is they've not been using EUV lithography machines from ASML.\n\nPlain and simple, without EUV lithography, Intel has been handicapping itself for years now and is a big reason they have fallen behind. The last link below notes how their 7nm chip design is now using EUV lithography at the 2 new fab plants they are building for $20B in Arizona. Intel is going to start to catch up.\n\nTLDR: ASML provides the technology to keep Moore's Law alive and Intel hasn't been using it until now.

Intel has the first deliveries of high-NA EUV machines from ASML, and is in a very strong position for silicon photonics tech, which is their biggest advantage in foundry work right now. It's a developing field but has some big applications like Lidar and communications everywhere from undersea cables to inter-chip.\n\nNow, problems:\n\n- The low P/E is  a trap, their margins *will* get compressed due to so many wafers on TSMC nodes through 3nm while simultaneously spending as much on capex as TSMC - around 30 billion next year, possibly going to 40+ billion a year. They can afford this, but it's not going to look good on paper. This is up from 14 billion in 2020. I don't think all this has been priced in yet.

There was almost zero conspiracy buzz leading up to the last split. \n\n   - Pareto‚Äôs principal at play where the majority of people will be wrong. \n\n\nI believe that the next unknown catalyst to be announced for Tesla will be an acquisition of Starlink or some type of formal partnership. Bringing Starlink under the Tesla umbrella makes sense for both companies and the stars may be aligning in the next few months to get the ball rolling. \n\nEveryone has been focusing on split hype and overlooking the fact that Starlink dishes have been spotted at SuperCharger stations very recently. \n\nHere‚Äôs why Starlink and Tesla are a perfect fit. \n\n   - Elon has expressed that SpaceX won‚Äôt go public anytime soon if ever due to all the red tape involved. \n\n   - SpaceX needs cash to get to Mars and doesn‚Äôt like answering to outside people or dealing with bullshit distractions. \n\n   - Starlink doing a formal IPO doesn‚Äôt make sense when you already run a trillion dollar public company and hate investment bankers/vultures. \n\n   - Producing a billion Starlink dishes will be a serious task, SpaceX is busy and doesn‚Äôt have a bunch of factories. Tesla has two new factories coming online and could easily add a production line or two for Starlink dishes last minute. \n\n   - Tesla is developing an Apple-like ecosystem and starlink will be a perfect addition to add on to every solar roof install to bundle in with Tesla Energy.  \n\n   - A major weak point for Tesla Energy scaling will be the Powerwalls all communicating with each other. Imagine Comcast being the choke point that tries to fuck with Tesla‚Äôs mission. \n\n   - Tesla bought SolarCity. Tesla could easily buy Starlink or simply become the main customer of the Starlink constellation to keep things simple and provide steady cash flow to SpaceX. \n\n   - Elon has expressed interest in the Company X concept and this would be a foot in the door without too much red tape. \n\n   - Satellite internet is a crazy physics problem that also supports Tesla‚Äôs missions by disrupting some very inefficient communication methods. \n\n   - A couple of the infamous conspiracy tweets have included pics of rockets (129 launch pic, and the rocket engine pic)\n \nTLDR: Tesla acquires starlink and pays recurring revenue to SpaceX for constellation/network = fat checks going to spacex for them to spend on whatever they want without answering to anybody or dealing with a bunch of customers. \n  \nElon hates the SEC/IB drama wants to keep SpaceX private so they can focus on getting to Mars.
