This trade failed a long time ago\n\nLonger answer. During this downtrend, it has tried to break upper resistance almost 6 times and failed. It’s currently trading in a small range trying to break the upper resistance trend line again.\n\nIf it drops below 223, you’ll lose most of your investment on this as it will be a break down through the current trading range and can get as low as the 203 area, where the next support is. If it breaks 227 on an upward movement, you may get a move going towards the 230 area, but it will stall there as there is resistance at that price.\n\nFor the year, the trend is still up, but a significant move up may be months from now.

We are looking at a -5% Monday, quite possibly more.\n- **Lots of key technicals will be broken & turn bearish**, causing quant funds to sell or outright short the stock.\n- **New shorts** who were itching to short \"overvalued\", \"bubbly\" TSLA but were waiting for a clear top to be defined after a monster +125% run will be jumping on board.\n- Lots of **active funds** are still underweight TSLA. They will buy in eventually, but right now they might wait for Elon's Form-4 that shows the first block of selling. These funds have an active interest in seeing a crash & squeezing retail.\n- I wouldn't be surprised if **retail TSLA margin requirements were increased by various brokerages**. Be mindful of your margin reserves and research the worst-case rate your broker might force on you.\n- But the worst effect: Elon probably won't be selling immediately. A lot of the selling will be investors trying to **front-run Elon.**\n\nThis isn't going to be fun. 😐\n\nAs I warned early Friday at the last ATH, TSLA might take a breather:\n\n> https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/qn4ls5/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_november_05_2021/hje4rmw\n>\n> I'd like to warn everyone that TSLA just had a huge run to well over $1.2t valuation - a +125% run from the lows just a few months ago - on catalysts we here on TIC knew or strongly suspected in January-February already.\n>\n> It's natural for a megacap to take a breather at such a junction - Tesla isn't a meme stock - unless some major new catalyst arrives such as a stock split or a surprise upgrade to investment grade.\n>\n>\n> - In particular low & average conviction institutional investors who aren't forced to buy TSLA might stay underweight in the hope of improving alpha via a correction. Overweight ones were probably already selling into the rally.\n>\n>\n> - The \"OMG, Tesla deliveries dropped in October!!\" FUD - ignoring the 12 Tesla ships underway in Q4 already and ignoring that the same FUD was false 10 times out of the last 10 years - will have its news cycle and might draw in unsuspecting shorts, hedge funds or weak hands.\n>\n>\n> **- Elon will have to sell millions of shares for tax purposes until the end of this year: in the next 7 weeks. A Form-4 will drop when this happens, and a predictable flood of \"dilution, crash, Musk cashing out\" articles might arrive - half of them already written by the usual suspects & ready to be published.

How much of a correction we can expect the Stock to experience?

A lot of people think the Tuesday conference call will be nothing but positive catalysts.  But I'm not so sure?  What if they announce delays in the opening of Berlin?\n\nJust imagine the backslash from that on investor sentiment?  I really think right now for the short term (maybe some weeks)... Tesla may be announcing some controversial (possibly negative) things.  I'm not saying the Twitter announcement of selling 10% of his shares is necessarily negative. But this combined with his brother's exit seem ominously strange because I get the hunch (especially from what I hear from some Germans)... That the opening (operating) of the Berlin Giga is likely going to be delayed until January.\n\nSorry if this all sounds bearish...

What prices will we settle down to now that the brothers are exiting at all time highs?\n\nAnd if you were in my position wanting to bulk up (add shares) what would your strategy be this week?  What prices should we expect.  I personally will start buying once we dip below the high 900s and increase on the way down.  I may start with 10 shares, then another and so on from there... Trying to \"catch\" some sort of bottom or get a good deal. \n\nBut who knows how low we go in the coming days, weeks and months. All I know is that when two big whales like Elon and his brother are exiting.... This doesn't smell right at all from my experience.\n\nWhat do you guys think based on your own experiences?

Plus, other rental car companies will see the popularity and multiply this with 10^5 scale orders of their own. \n\nFurthermore, we're likely going to have Tom Brady advertising Teslas during NFL games for the rest of the season. \n\nPlus, Cybertruck is going to begin hitting the streets in the USA starting late next year, which will drive wild curiosity amongst the millions of Americans who have no idea what Tesla's really about. The big shiny triangle truck is impossible to ignore. In American culture, especially in the Midwest, it's socially acceptable to strike up conversations with strangers in some situations. Early Cybertruck owners will not be able to walk across the parking lot without getting questions.\n\nOil price rises and volatility further increase interest in buying EVs.\n\nWith as expensive as shipping and 10% EU import tariffs are, there's obvious cost saving in opening Giga Berlin plus some logistics cost savings from Giga Austin.\n\nAs far as manufacturing cost savings go, Tesla has many innovations queued up that simply need to be scaled as well as more that we don't know about encapsulated in the miscellaneous improvements line of the spreadsheet. This model does not account for any significant 4680 cost savings in 2022.\n\nPlease criticize this model without mercy so it can be less wrong.

{"title": "Why Elon Musk Will Definitely Sell 10% of his stock", "selftext": "[https://medium.com/@jericho.k.roman/why-elon-musk-will-sell-10-of-his-tesla-shares-849e697ef3d6](https://medium.com/@jericho.k.roman/why-elon-musk-will-sell-10-of-his-tesla-shares-849e697ef3d6)\n\nTL;DR. Elon has 14.8 billion dollars of tax due when he exercises his options (which he has to do before August 20th, 2022), he can significantly reduce the tax bill by billions of dollars by dropping the Tesla stock price. Selling 10% of his shares covers all of his taxes and leaves him roughly a billion dollars in cash to play with.  Basically, he's using Twitter to lower his taxes.\n\nPositions: straddles.\n\nEdit: In regards to the question by u/SaladTossgaming on getting puts: I'm thinking about it as well but concerned about IV. Also, the gamma position on Nasdaq is insane, we may be in for a parabolic run. I wouldn't be surprised if Tesla goes to 2k. Would love other's opinions on this.\n\nEdit 2: not bullish or bearish on tesla price. Simply commenting on the selling.\n\nEdit 3: Slightly out of context but pertaining to a question in one of the comments.  There was $450 million of ITM call buying (January 2024 $1000 strikes) in a single day last week.  That's not only a significant dollar amount but also, similar positioning had occurred prior to the SPX inclusion and share split.  Sorry if this causes confusion about what action(s) to take but it's part of the reason why I'm neither bullish nor bearish (see Edit 2). Note - option flow isn't the clearest indicator; for example, a large holder of Tesla may have had to sell their shares due to Tesla becoming too large of a % in their portfolio (required to sell per portfolio risk management), however - since they still want to participate in the upside they may have purchased ITM options to compensate for the sale.", "id": "qorwlq", "created_utc": 1636302254.0, "score": 3900, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 678, "comments": [{"body": "One more thing.

Only a quarter of recent IPOs involved companies currently making a profit.\n\nThe reason investors tolerate this is that there are plenty of examples of companies (Amazon, Facebook) which reinvested all revenues for years in pursuit of increasing market share, and were wildly successful as a result.\n\nThere is another type of company, however. These companies basically operate as a stock scam or, in the case of private companies, attracting larger and larger funding rounds.\n\nPart of the reason companies like Theranos, WeWork and Nikola got as far as they did is because they were free from the need to demonstrate profitability.\n\nZombie companies like Uber and DoorDash are not fraudulent, and actually provide real value to consumers, but only because they are subsidized by shareholders. If their prices rose sufficiently to be profitable, many consumers would stop using their service. Some analysts are convinced that Uber's only hope of consistent profitability is self-driving cars. This technology may or may not become available in time to bail them out. Similarly, DoorDash must eventually move away from human delivery drivers to become profitable.\n\nObviously, some percentage of unprofitable companies will eventually turn a profit.

Well, the value of a brand can change over time. There was a famous billionaire recently who made his own name a brand.  His name was sold over and over, people would pay rent to make use of the brand.  When he went to the bank, the brand had to be assigned a valuation. He would say it was worth billions. The bank valued it differently but still a high value. Then that billionaire made a lot of enemies and many people didn't like his brand anymore.

I'd imagine that a CEO taking a loan against their stock would be similar, that they can take up to a specified percentage of current market value.
