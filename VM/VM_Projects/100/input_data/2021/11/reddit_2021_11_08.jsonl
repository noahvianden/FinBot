Sooner or later you are going to pay the piper for writing calls. Think of it as a known risk. A lot of people seem to assume that diagonals are risk free. You've learned just how wrong that is. You would never earn a premium in the first place if there wasn't a risk of loss, because your loss is the buyer's gain.\n\nWhenever you are confronted with a decision like this, update your [expected value estimate](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result). If your ev is now negative, cut your losses and just close the short leg. If your ev is break-even or positive, continue to hold or, if that is too risky, roll for a credit. If you can't decide on a win probability, lean towards underestimating rather than overestimating.\n\nBTW, you should have defined a [trade plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan) before opening the trade in the first place, which would have included a what-if scenario for this exact situation, so you would have already worked out what to do.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the reply!\n\nI bought the LEAPS for 27.95 and sold the call for 11.63.

If the strategy, like a spread, includes short selling, short selling often has unlimited risk. \"Limited max loss\" is only true under ideal circumstances. In reality, expiration and assignment don't always work out ideally. They can blow up in unexpected ways. For example, if you have a call credit spread on TSLA for 1050/1100, where the 1050 is the short call leg, and you hold to expiration expecting to make max profit on a 1049 TSLA closing price, but TSLA rises after the option market closes and your expiration price is $1051, your short leg is assigned but your long leg expires worthless. So instead of a max loss of $5000, you now have to cover a short position that would cost you over $100k of cash.\n\nGiven the non-zero possibility of that calamity, brokers want the protection of a margin account, so they can come after you with a margin call to make sure you can pay the $100k you owe.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I’m 20 years old and I’ve been trading stocks for around a year and I’m now comfortable with trying options.

You're always helpful.\n\nAs the other poster explains, maybe I misunderstood the profitability because when a stock rises the OTM LEAPS gives a better return **in terms of %**.

It all makes sense now.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "> the higher delta the more the options price moves.\n\nIt's actually the other way around. The more the option price moved, the higher the delta was, for a normalized $1 move of the underlying.\n\n> Then how comes that the ITM Leaps call (high delta) is much less profitable than OTM (low delta) Leaps when the stock price rises ?\n\nIt's because of leverage. ITM LEAPS calls are expensive, so your leverage is low. OTM LEAPS calls are (relatively) cheap, so your leverage is higher. Let's compare two calls, an ITM call that cost $10 and an OTM call that cost $.01. If the ITM call goes up 10 cents, to $10.10, that is a 1% gain. If the OTM call goes up 10 cents, to $.11, that is a 1000% gain.\n\nThat's why the same dollar profit on an OTM call makes huge gain percentages.\n\n> How does IV affect the vertical spreads ? For example, is an increase of IV good or bad for already traded credit bull spread ?\n\nIt depends on net vega. Vega on the long leg is positive, but vega on the short leg is negative. So when you add them together, you might get a very small number or even zero. If net vega is zero, it doesn't matter how much IV changes, the price of the spread won't change just from IV.\n\nSo, in general, narrow spreads are not impacted by IV changes very much, where wide spreads are impacted more.

{"title": "$GGPI Polestar - Global EV Pure Play - DD", "selftext": "Greetings, lads. Elon’s TweetThreats aside, EV stocks are melting faces this month. Consider the following…\n\n* Rivian just upsized its IPO. Share price range: $72-74. Projected $65B market cap.\n* Tesla +120% since May. SP $1,222. Now $1.22T MC.\n* Lucid +90% in two weeks. SP $41.80. Now $67.2B MC.\n\nLike you, SoFi didn’t fill my $RIVN IPO order this week. Nor did I catch the $LCID $15 dip. And sadly, I wasn’t able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two years ago.\n\nBut here’s our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV “pure plays” in the market:\n\nPolestar — Volvo’s EV spinoff brand — estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.\n\nIt’s now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.\n\nPolestar is the only global EV ‘pure play,’ other than Tesla.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygvdc21kkey71.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=672e1bcea882eaa1694dc3b3bf45dfa6edcd2eae\n\n**History**\n\nA little background…\n\n* “Polestar” takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris — not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That’s *Polstjärnan* (literal translation, “Pole Star”) if you’re Swedish.\n* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo’s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.\n* Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk & Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.\n* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being “independent since 2017.”\n* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim SPAC, GGPI.\n\n**Comps**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjhasg7skey71.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a57236ff26ed8ae0b2910d0bbfee3b24ddf0605\n\n**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**\n\n* Applying Tesla’s 2022E multiple (17.2x) to Polestar implies a share price of $27.46. As GGPI is currently trading at $10.70, this yields an increase of 156.64%.\n* Applying Lucid’s 2022E multiple (29.6x) to Polestar implies a share price of $47.27. As GGPI is currently trading at $10.70, this yields an increase of 342.78%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ginl0ciukey71.jpg?width=1297&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=779eef17f69c5acd516425d3d8a0ae10494552a0\n\n**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**\n\n* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.\n* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:\n\n1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).\n2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.\n\n* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.\n* Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.\n* As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kt1miyxkey71.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e771bc7dd377abf7233926b3302c0bc76d57b85\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dv6nu4o0ley71.jpg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed57210e7fd7d962b18952e56d361074f702e832\n\n**Gores SPACs**\n\nFor those new to SPACland, Gores’ track record speaks for itself…\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nuvx0647ley71.jpg?width=1972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7cb66ac0a639c150a9f8845d6eb764a0438fd01d\n\n**The EV Graveyard**\n\nThe EV SPAC battlefield is littered with bodies (RIDE, WKHS, NKLA).\n\nBut Polestar?\n\nThey've been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars.

The cars are sexy AF, and match up well with the Tesla Model 3 on both performance and price. Polestar has 29K cars on the road and $1.5B in revenue in FY21, and still trades at a deep discount to other EV pure plays.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: Long $GGPI, 40k shares + options + warrants.", "id": "qpid81", "created_utc": 1636392229.0, "score": 362, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "Join the r/smallstreetbets official Discord here - https://discord.gg/E27dUNUwfx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

As exciting as companies like Lucid and Rivian are (I'm bullish on both), Polestar is probably the most solid EV company out there in my opinion aside from TSLA. They're delivering cars and making money today, and they're backed by established auto manufacturers which allows them to take advantage of their established infrastructure, making them one of the safest bets in the EV space. With everything EV popping this week on the back of the infrastructure hype, I can see GGPI really taking off.\n\nOne thing I want to point out though is that aside from Polestar's fundamentals, GGPI also has a pretty interesting technical setup. Since it's a SPAC, it's been subject to arbitration traders who have kept the price pinned down by selling tons of covered calls. For anyone unfamiliar, arbitration traders buy up SPAC shares hand over fist when they're trading under the $10 NAV price before the SPAC announces their acquisition target with the intent to either sell these shares later for a higher price (duh), or in the worst case scenario they redeem the shares for the $10 NAV when the SPAC is getting ready to close the merger. Since SPACs have a \"floor\" at the NAV price (typically $10) it's essentially a no-risk trade.\n\nDespite GGPI trading well over $10 for a while now, arbitration traders likely still hold their shares because the merger is still a ways away and in the meantime they can make bank selling covered calls on those shares. Once again, it's a win/win situation for them. If those calls expire ITM then they get those shares called away for $10 - $12.50 (depending on the strike price of the calls they sell) which is higher than they bought them at <$10, plus they get to keep the premium they received from the calls they sold.\n\nWhat's interesting about this is that selling all of those covered calls leads to the option chain being loaded with negative delta/charm, which means that option dealers (who bought the calls from arbitration traders) hedge those calls by shorting shares. The result of this is a lot of downward pressure on the share price until those options expire or are counteracted by increased buying of long calls. When calls are bought from option dealers, they either offload the calls they bought from the arbitration traders or they use the calls they sold to hedge the calls they bought from arbitration traders, meaning they don't need short shares in order to remain delta neutral.\n\nWhen option dealers ease up on shorting, downward pressure on share price eases up as well and share price tends to melt up, which I think that's what we're seeing with GGPI right now. This has the potential to be explosive if there's enough buying/selling pressure built up but counteracting each other, and then the sell-side suddenly lets up. It's like shaking a bottle of soda and then opening it. It'd be unusual for that type of change to happen suddenly, but with November OPEX coming up on 11/19 we'll likely see a lot of sold-to-open calls expire and  therefore less negative delta/charm on the option chain. I'm thinking (hoping) we could see GGPI pop between now and the week after OPEX as those calls fall off the option chain.\n\nI'm not sure if GGPI has enough buying pressure up to see an explosion, but there are some signs that lead me to believe that the upward trend will continue regardless. First, we know there is a ton of sell-to-open calls in the option chain. There's a lot of call OI right now (180k calls between Nov, Dec, and Jan), calls have generally traded at bid much more than at ask (implying more calls being sold-to-open than bought-to-open), and IV has been suppressed for the $10 and $12 strikes. Despite this, we've seen the share price trend steadily upward over the last couple of weeks (since Oct. 21), with a solid 5.8% jump today. We also know that IV for the $10 and $12 strikes for Nov/Jan have been increasing over the past few days, and calls trading at the ask have started to outnumber the calls traded at bid. All of this points to the conclusion that the short side of this trade is easing up and the longs are gaining ground, which makes me confident that there will be some solid green days ahead for GGPI.\n\nAnother effect of all of the calls that have been sold by arbitration traders, which I alluded to but think is worth explicitly pointing out, is that they cause distortion in the IV of the call strikes/expirations that they are selling, meaning that IV is much lower and call prices are cheaper than they should be. In the case of GGPI you can see this in the $10c and $12c for 11/19/21 and 01/21/22, though it's a little less pronounced now than it was in previous weeks.\n\nTLDR - Arbitration traders have kept GGPI pinned down for a while now by selling tons of covered calls, but it looks like the downward pressure from those calls is dissipating and will likely continue to do so until OPEX on Nov. 19th. Between those headwinds easing up and the tailwinds coming from the infrastructure bill hype we may see some green days ahead for GGPI. If you're bullish on GGPI, the $10 and $12 calls for 11/19/21 and 01/21/22 are priced fairly cheap due to IV distortion from sold-to-open covered calls", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

They'd only do this if they were guaranteed to profit more by rolling over those calls, but I'm not sure they can bank on that (I'd have to crunch some numbers to figure that out I guess).\n\nThere's also the slim chance that GGPI closes over $12.50 at Nov OPEX, in which case all bets are off because the vast majority of STO calls for Nov will be ITM.\n\nThat said, I definitely agree that it's possible and so I wouldn't bet on it rallying in the short  term.

If I were in your position I would invest 10-20% of your net take home pay each paycheck and throw it into a brokerage account (this is on top of any 401k plans you may be participating in). I’d want to first build up some savings in case something happens. I try to keep 6 months of regular spending in savings at all times. Once that point is reached, that’s when I’d dump most of my earnings into stocks.\n\nAs for which stocks - Start with ETFs first. SPY, SMH, BRK (similar to SPY, but with a Buffett twist) with the remainder going into stocks you truly believe in. Avoid penny stocks like the plague. If you want to play around with random stocks, allocate 5-10% of your brokerage balance as “play money”. \n\nTarget date funds IMO are good if you’re older in your career. We’re young. We can take risks. If stocks were to suddenly drop 50% tomorrow I’d still be in the green.\n\nIgnore loans unless they’re greater than 4%. If they’re under 4%, pay the minimum due. If over, pay them off as fast as possible. I say this because you’re better off investing the money you would have paid off the loan because the returns are much greater than the interest owed. \n\nI don’t have a home yet either.

{"title": "Deep Biontech (BNTX) analysis and why i think a rally could start after Q3 earnings tomorrow", "selftext": "* **Forecast for this week** (see full details on financials further down)\n\nThis week BNTX will shine; Q3 ER on Tuesday and oncology congress 10-14 November (see pipeline below). Moderna missed earning last week and reduced the guidance for 2021; this reduction was not driven by lack of demand, it was driven by delays in manufacturing. BNTX-PFE jumped in and took over the demand Moderna failed to serve. The current drop is still an overreaction of the market to the Pfizer anti-viral which cause a lot of Stop/Loss drops and liquidation of call options.\n\nPfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be $13 Bn, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from $33 Bn to $36 Bn. Consensus estimate is $12.27 EPS Q3. We estimate a somewhat better result, $12.75 at minimum, driven by a/o higher sales volume and improved financing result. Similar to what happened to this stock for Q4 2020 earning on March 31st 2021, the most likely scenario is a rally starting directly after the Q3 earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Market manipulation**\n\nBiontech is a fairly new stock on the Nasdaq and due to its small freefloat of approx. 240m shares, it got highly manipulated by market makers the recent year.\n\nIt seems like big money and algos are trading Biontech and Moderna as only one mRNA-Stock. Both stocks are glued together, although they should have a contrary movement. (i.g. Biontech gets its FDA approval, Moderna goes up; Pfizer reporting a surpass of the quarterly estimates, Moderna goes up). Neglecting some more money flow to Moderna, their movement is sync by seconds on a daily basis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Biontech vs Moderna](https://preview.redd.it/jzdnlgw8vdy71.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31f7184894a27c173037ce47f5e9923f54a6daf5)\n\nBiontech vs Moderna\n\n* **Market share**\n\nPlain and simple Comirnaty is dominating the vaccine race in western world and now rapidly expanding to takeover Sputnik and the Chinese vaccines in Latam and other regions that relied on those vaccines at the start of the pandemic\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yq3r2q1cvdy71.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=d08eb6888077a96c5e8817a944a41a5e6ea7be6d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/34dszcucvdy71.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d4c5244f5180ffe235a7b0fa7b347fe081bf70d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Proof of concept**\n\nBiontech was the first company in the world with a real vaccine for corona. Uğur Şahin was standing beside Donald Trump in front of the White House while announcing this news.\n\nOther companies tried to follow suit, but the most of them failed (i.e. Curevac). Only Moderna could produce another working mRNA vaccine.\n\nThis proof of concept can be extrapolated to all other vaccines in their pipeline and Biontech has the highest likelihood for a good outcome.\n\n• **Safety**\n\nComparing all vaccines available on the market, Comirnaty has the lowest side effects of all.\n\nAstraZeneca had a lot of issues and is no longer used in the European Union, never got authorized in the US. Moderna has also a higher risk of heart inflammations and it’s use got stopped in countries like Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland for males under 30 years old. The FDA recently authorized under EUA the use of Comirnaty for children over 5 years old. In contrast, Moderna’s authorization for children above 12 got delayed to at least January. The Biden administration has purchased enough pediatric doses to vaccinate 100% of children between 5 and 11 years old. This gives Biontech a monopoly for children vaccination.\n\n• **Capacity**\n\nThe demand for COVID vaccines is huge and the biggest bottleneck has been and continues to be production capacity and where vaccine manufacturers have struggled. This is where Biontech in partnership with Pfizer have done a stellar job ramping up manufacturing capacity from original 2021 estimate of 1Bn to 3Bn doses for 2021, followed by 4bn doses in 2022 and beyond. To reach this goal they have already a new production building in Marburg Germany with a capacity of 1bn doses a year.\n\nBiontech is also expanding their production all over the world. In 2022, they will start a production building in Singapur and also in Africa with a cooperation with Ruanda and Senegal, in cooperation with the national governments and co-funded by international donors. In addition they have entered in a joint venture with the Chinese company Fosun, plans for and are building another plant with a capacity of 1 bn doses for the Chinese Asian market have been announced.\n\n• **COVID outlook, from pandemic to endemic**\n\nNo matter which vaccine you’ll take, the protection efficacy is waning. The coronavirus is also mutating constantly to new variants, just like the flu. You don’t need an accurate forecast to realize that the virus is here to stay. All over the world, the governments are starting the 3rd booster jab. Talks about a 4th booster are already taking place. An annual vaccination will be the rule, once again think about the flu, exact same but for a much more deadly and infectious virus. We’ll see a constant cashflow. While most analysts are just too afraid to announce this in public still ignore this, BoFA has been estimating an annual booster demand at the size of flu vaccination demand, 58% of population in industrialised countries. The EU has secured 450m booster doses for each of 2022 and 2023, with an option for doubling should two booster shots per year become necessary. Booster prices have been raised by some 25% or more in most industrialized countries, including EU, USA, and the UK over 2021 prices, with Pfizer seeing further room for increase when comparing with other vaccines, e.g. against Shingles or Streptococces.\n\n• **Cancer pipeline**\n\nBiontech has a long-lasting experience in cancer research. They are the technical pinnacle with the mRNA cancer treatment currently and way ahead of all other companies in the world. They have four cancer studies in their 2nd phase which are extremely promising. For instance, they cured cancer of 17 mice out of 20 completely. The other 3 mice shrunk their tumors dramatically. A real cure for cancer is ahead of us! There is an upcoming (11/10-11/14) oncology conference called SITC where Biontech has 7 abstract and a late-breaking presentation. The pipeline includes two PD-L1 antibody combination therapies, developed in cooperation with Genmab, which initial reports call \"very promising\". The PD-(L)1 antibody market was some 27 bn USD in 2020, with expected annual growth rates of up to 35%, and includes blockbusters such as Keytruda (Merck). Another presentation will be on BioNTech's novel CAR-T-Cell approach using mRNA, which addresses a potential 10 bn USD market by 2024.\n\n· **Social responsibility**\n\nBiontech and Pfizer are donating 1Bn doses at cost to the US government to be donated free of charge to the 90 poorest countries. They have pledged they will donate additional 1Bn doses to the poorest countries.\n\n• **Pipeline**\n\nBesides Corona and cancer, they are also working on various vaccines. Their flu vaccine developed for Pfizer has entered Phase 1 clinical trial in September. If successful, BioNTech shall be entitled to some 10% royalty on revenue, plus singificant sales-based milestone payments. Other vaccines under development include for Flu, Malaria, HIV, Tuberculosis, as well as a number yet undisclosed diseases.\n\n• **Financials**\n\nPfizer and BioNTech split Comirnaty gross margins 50/50 worldwide except for China (incl. Taiwan), where BioNTech works in a similar arrangement w. Fosun.\n\n1. **Q3** : Pfizer has recently announced Q3 revenue from Comirnaty to be 13 bn USD, and raised the 2021 FY forecast from 33 bn USD to 36 bn. However, the Pfizer business quarters/ years outside the US are December to November, with a June to August Q3. As such, non US-revenues for September 21 are still missing from their Q3 figures, the same applies to Dec. 21 in their annual guidance. Based on a tally of individual contracts that have been reported publicly, Q3 Comirnaty revenue for calendar Q3 is estimated at some $14.15 bn USD (including $190 m via Fosun), and for 2021 at around $45.6 bn (including $615m via Fosun).\n2. **Q4**: There are still a handful question marks, including the COVAX absorption of US donations. There are more than 100m doses that the US has announced to make available to COVAX in Q4 2021, but which COVAX has so far not allocated and/or assigned a delivery date to. Secondly, there is uncertainty whether monthly delivery of 37.5m booster/Kid vaccine doses to the EU will start in December 21 (Pfizer statement during Q2 ER), or Jan. 22 (EU announcement this summer). Q4 revenue in question is some 850m USD, depending also on the USD/EUR exchange rate.\n3. **Annual 2021:** The $45.6 bn 2021 revenue forecast represents the optimistic scenario. OTOH, contracts with a number of high-income countries, most notably the Gulf States, Israel and Singapore, have hardly been published. Israel has certainly purchased further boosters and kid vaccines for delivery already in 2021, and the same may be assumed for Saudi Arabia, which has already authorized Comirnaty boosters, and shots for 5-11yos, and are preparing for kid vaccination to still start in 2021. Especially Saudi-Arabia, with a population of 34 million, and exclusively relying on Comirnaty boosters and kid vaccines, could be sizeable in this respect. All in all, there might be an upside potential of some good $500M additional revenue 2021 from yet unpublished / unrecorded booster & kids vaccines contracts. Furthermore, should there be delivery delays to COVAX, it may be assumed that some of the supply will be assigned to Taiwan, possibly bringing in another $210M in revenue in December 21 from there, which is currently assumed to only occur in Q1/22.\n4. **Annual 2022:** PFE has pre-announced at minimum sales of 1.7 bn doses Comirnaty, for a total revenue of $29 Bn. Note that this forecast only includes contracts signed by Oct. 15, 2021. I.e., recent contracts announced afterwards as e.g. the US purchasing an additional 50m doses of kids vaccines for 2022, S. Korea buying 30m more doses, the Uruguayan purchase of 3.7m doses, and the 3.5m doses to Costa Rica, shall come on top, as shall be major booster contracts still under negotiation such as 150m doses for Brazil, 55m doses for the Phillipines, 50m doses for Vietnam, and a undisclosed quantity for Malaysia. Moreover, the Pfizer forecast will in all likelihood again relate to the \"Pfizer Year\" outside the US, i.e. 12/21 - 11/22. Importantly, the Pfizer 2022 outlook yields an average price per dose of 17.1 USD. When deducting 800m doses to be supplied as US donation to COVAX at 7 USD/dose, the price on the remainder goes up to even 31.6 USD/dose. This is far higher than the announced booster prices for the US ($24) and the EU ($23), suggesting that most of the other booster contracts already signed, including with Japan, Australia, S. Korea and the UK, should be at prices of 30 USD/dose or above. It also serves as further strong indication of already signed sizeable, and highly priced contracts with several Gulf States, Israel and Singapore.\"\n\nIf a rally starts or not, in the worst case you support a company that saved the world and is working towards curing cancer.\n\n**This is not a not financial advise!**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Position](https://preview.redd.it/ql9t6f9x1ey71.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8bfa3d98d4812fbfb577b60c156c17a3aec54f9)\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "qpf3dx", "created_utc": 1636382655.0, "score": 446, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 238, "comments": [{"body": "I've got thousands of shares as well as 100 option contracts, so if this is right I'll be posting some gain porn tomorrow.

{"title": "Why Lucid Group will be a huge success NO MATTER WHAT.", "selftext": "For those that are unaware because they are blinded by their love for video game and movie stocks, but Electric Vehicles are just now beginning their race. Tesla and Elon Musk are undoubtedly the common EV manufacturer. I doubt anything will change Tesla's position as the bulk EV manufacturer for quite some time.\n\nLucid just put their cars on the road for the first time a week ago. Let's compare Lucid's top model to Tesla's to get an understanding of what this company has to offer the consumer.\n\n________________\n\nTesla Model S Plaid: \n\n396 mile range, 0-60mph in 1.99 seconds, 200mph top speed, 1020 hp.\n\nPrice: $124,490.\n\n_________________\n\nLucid Dream Edition R:\n\n520 mile range, 0-60 in 2.5 seconds, 933 hp, 168 mph.\n\nPrice: $168,000\n\n________________\n\nFor anyone with half witted sense of reality, what this means is that Lucid's top vehicle out ranges Tesla's by over 100 miles! The range EVs can go before needing juice is the BIGGEST drawback to EVs!\n\nLucid also has a base model. The Air Pure. It is $77,000 and has a range of 406 miles.\n\nWhich brings me to my major point.\n\nLet's say, hypothetically, that Rawlinson and his team can't make cars for shit.\n\nThey're absolutely incompetent and their cars suck. This of course ISN'T the case. Reviews of the first order of cars is that they are fantastic vehicles.\n\nThese guys already make a better BATTERY than Tesla!\n\nAnd its so important that we as consumers understand that the better battery ALONE will lead Lucid to success. Efficiency is key. Energy, how its generated, and the efficiency at which it outputs energy is becoming more and more important because gasoline becomes more scarce every day.\n\nThese new EV manufacturers can, and probably already are, in the business of energy storage. These batteries could power our homes and everything else too. Which is what makes these companies great. The technology can be used outside of vehicles to power our world in a more efficient manner.\n\nAnd right now, Lucid and their unmatched batteries just gained the lead in that department.\n\nSo watch. As Lucid vehicles drive down every street in America within the next 2 years. Because nothing makes a car popular other than itself. Driving down roads. For all the world to see.\n\nLucid's stock price of roughly $40 will haunt you compared to what it IS worth because its going nowhere but up.\n\nAlso, the damn cars look EXTREMELY NICE. Huge Porsche vibes in quality and design. But definitely its own look.\n\nBuy Lucid Group stock while you still can for profit. Its competing with Tesla at 1200 a share when it is at 40.\n\nAlso, buy me a Lucid Air.

For me, if there is an option available for me to buy farther out at a cheap price I’d sell my current call now, and buy a new one farther out in expiration (roll the call); if there’s no cheap buy option like that available, I’ll hold the current longer to reap more profits.
