You'll always be exposed to *some* upside, and you'll also have a semi-fixed cash income stream.\n\nIf/when you have extra cash then the simple Wheel Strategy can also be extended with:\n\n- saving up the extra cash & utilizing it at suspected bottoms to buy more shares,\n- or to write cash covered puts at (suspected ... [1]) bottoms to earn premium from bears too. ([1] Make sure it's cash covered, not margin covered, in case the bottom is just an intermediary price on the way to the true bottom ...) \n- instead of buying back on Mondays you can also write puts with aggressive strikes that makes it very likely that you will be assigned your shares again.
