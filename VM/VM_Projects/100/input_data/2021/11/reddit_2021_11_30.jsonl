{"title": "Fed Chairman Jerome Powell warns Congress that inflation may keep rising next year", "selftext": "[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-covid-omicron-variant-covid-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-congress/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-covid-omicron-variant-covid-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-congress/)\n\n\"\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Congress that while the Federal Reserve continues to expect inflation will move down \"significantly\" over the next year, it \"now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year.\"\n\nThe new COVID-19 variant Omicron could have a negative impact on employment and inflation, Powell told Congress Tuesday in his prepared remarks.\n\n\"The recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation. Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people's willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions,\" Powell said. He was appearing at a hearing before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs to testify about the economic recovery from the pandemic.¬†\n\nThe World Health Organization flagged Omicron as a COVID variant of concern on Friday: it appears to spread quickly, and it's not yet known how effective existing vaccines are against it. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, it'll be about two weeks before more is known about its transmissibility, severity and other characteristics.\n\nThe Biden administration acted quickly to try and slow the spread of the new variant in the U.S., imposing travel restrictions on eight countries in Southern Africa. Officials are also urging Americans to get vaccinated or booster shots. On Monday, President Biden sought to calm Americans, characterizing the variant as cause for concern, but not panic.\n\nWhile Powell acknowledged that the economy is continuing to strengthen and conditions in the labor market are still improving, he also reminded senators that over the summer, the rapidly spreading Delta variant slowed the economic recovery and intensified supply chain disruptions.\n\nAt the same time, Americans have been slammed by higher than anticipated prices as the U.S. struggles to reopen. Last month's Consumer Price Index showed inflation had risen at its fastest annual rate in more than 30 years at 6.2%.\n\n\"Pandemic-related supply and demand imbalances have contributed to notable price increases in some areas. Supply chain problems have made it difficult for producers to meet strong demand, particularly for goods. Increases in energy prices and rents are also pushing inflation upward,\" Powell said during his remarks.\n\nThe remarks about inflation echo past statements by Powell that it could persist into the third quarter of 2022.\n\n\"We understand that high inflation imposes significant burdens, especially on those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation,\" Powell said. \"We are committed to our price-stability goal. We will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen also testified before senators on the state of the economic recovery from the pandemic Tuesday. Yellen has said if the U.S. wants to bring inflation down, it needs to make progress with the pandemic and when it succeeds, she anticipates prices will go return to normal some time in the second half of next year.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. continues to make progress in bringing down unemployment. On Friday, the Labor Department will release the jobs report for November. Last month, the economy added a higher than anticipated 531,000 jobs and revised the two prior reports upwards, after disappointing September and August numbers. The unemployment rate last month fell to 4.6%.\"", "id": "r5qj2h", "created_utc": 1638288318.0, "score": 3019, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 795, "comments": [{"body": "Well there goes my PayPal calls", "score": 461, "replies": [{"body": "Strike and expire date?", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Jan 21 $220", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "I have the March 18 210", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I think if PayPal doesn‚Äôt rebound by then, we‚Äôll have bigger problems to worry about", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "I mean it's at 48 p/e. would it really be shocking if it doesn't rebound?", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "That sounds catchy, you should put that in a song or something.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I‚Äôm trying to work it into a rap somehow", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I just need to find something that rhymes well with spaghetti", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "SQ is much higher PE for a similar company", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Doesn‚Äôt mean PayPal isn‚Äôt overvalued as well", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Doesnt mean everything isn‚Äôt overvalued.

If anything, spending money into the economy now, while we're in dire need of proper support, will illicit deflation, as we have some resources, but ln other areas that are lacking, such as the production not being able to meet the demand... that causes economical bind up, which then causes inflation.\n\nAnd, no...the government doesn't go broke.

This results in an increase in prices for goods and services since manufacturers pass their price increases along to consumers. With cost-push inflation, prices are \"pushed\" up by rising production costs.\n\n>Demand-pull inflation happens when supply is limited compared to demand. Demand can go up due to a strong economy, a natural disaster, or an oversupply of money. In these instances, demand outpaces supply and \"pulls\" prices higher.4\n\n>Causes of Hyperinflation  \n>The two primary causes of hyperinflation are (1) an increase in money supply not supported by economic growth, which increases inflation, and (2) a demand-pull inflation, in which demand outstrips supply.

SPECIAL EMPHASIS on NO BUYERS\n2. Point 2... your problem was never institutional investors. They didnt have anywhere near enough money to make any impact in the financial crisis. You can argue they are a problem today but I dont think so and we can argue that in another thread. But impact on the financial crisis? Not even in Mickeys imagination could you make that work. They were never your competition. We were overflowing with properties and they were sitting a very long time to the tune of years.\n   1. And no these were not bad properties. The bad ones were actually sold off fast as fixers because banks were willing to discount. These were mostly a result of people stealing fixtures and destroying the house in the process and banks didnt want the hassle.\n   2. So what was really happening? The problem in that time was corrupt agents and brokers especially the ones who got the bank listings. What they would do is sit on listings and not reply to anyone or worse, they would claim its already sold and wont show it to you. They were outright lying. They would then sell the properties to friends and family at steep discounts after sitting on the listing for months to years. You can argue these guys are \"institutional\" but thats pushing it. Most of these guys were not pooling or anything like that. They were just committing fraud and there are a lot of them... this still happens today but they have to be more careful today.\n      1. How did they get away with it? At that time >> **absolutely no one was regulating anything** << It was absolute chaos. Laws were being flaunted by everyone from sellers (who were unhappy) to banker (who colluded with..) to intermediaries. You can file all the complaints you want to the Board of Realtors but they were so flooded that they were rendered impotent. You would have to file a lawsuit and good luck with that. You would need to prove they are lying and you would need to pay for the suit. Have any idea how frequently this fraud was happening? Id say 1/2 of listings were being siphoned by fraudsters. Possibly more I cant say for sure.\n      2. Last and ill stop here. There was A LOT of cash by 2010. I was rolling in it after a huge 2009 in stocks. I had no problem finding high end properties. Yes half were being blocked but half of 2000 listings is still 1000 to choose from. No one was even competing with me on those short sales even though they were accepting any offer till a certain point... some took a month or two to clear but no one ever even submitted any offers to compete with me. So why couldnt anyone else do this? By 2012 or so loans came back and there were still tons of excellent properties to be had. I got my friends into RE at that point and they all made off like bandits too. Literally turned 3 of them into near millionaires today and 2 of them got FHA 3% loans (lol). So even without much money you could have gotten a steal by 2012 and 2013 if you just had a job and were not an idiot and destroyed your credit prior. Those who were idiots and overpaid stil had recourse too. As long as they had a job, we had ways to waive their loan fees or reduce them greatly so they did ok too.
