Of course this being the case, you will loose confidence once some troubles seams to appear.\n\nI would recommend you to try to obtain some basic knowledge about fundamental analysis, and to put some more effort in understanding the business and financial aspects of a company before buying the stock. You need first to be convinced yourself that the company which stands besides the ticker symbol deserves your trust, and only after to buy it. This will for sure bring you good gains on medium or long term(if you will keep your conviction stocks for better or for worse). It could also bring gains for short term but that is not guaranteed at all. Of course if something important changes in the fundamentals of the company you can also sell the stocks. But the change must be in the fundamentals not in the stock price or in the way in which the company is seen by the media or in a Reddit sub\n\nFor short term gains the better way to obtain them will be day trading or swing trading.

Its an entirely different thing when the guy in office has no respect for the electoral process whatsoever. That means if we don't like him it doesn't matter, we may never be rid of him and *thats* the difference. \n\nI'll take a guy I don't like for 4 years as long as Im confident we can remove him after we see what he's all about. but no one should ever support a guy who thinks he can be president for life.
