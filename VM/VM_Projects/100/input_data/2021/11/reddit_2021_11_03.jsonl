There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec’20.\n\nThe summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/olsk3rzidbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c47c6be534d65f806fab70470f13713b59a34fd)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAhh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it’s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.\n\nSo what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \\[2\\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.\n\nConsidering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next\n\na. One Week\n\nb. One Month\n\nc. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)\n\nThe benchmark for comparison is SPY\\[3\\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9cp7di0jdbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef05f68121dccb6283f09ac092aba516553baacc)\n\n**Results**\n\nBefore we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/qlsbb9/video/n6jlnnvldbx71/player\n\n *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/) \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/w1jcf78ndbx71.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d8eee4682395fc617c7e3eda74fd410fced8b9)\n\nWe would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \\[4\\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)\n\nBut, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \\[5\\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it’s definitely not for safe plays).\n\nSo, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bfkgenaodbx71.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=f14db831e6397c79913bfe18e9d4db5958b65347)\n\nWould you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.\n\nBut keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ye4hbj8pdbx71.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=90e5171c0279ba9428d889dd46d8a0bbab33da15)\n\nGME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \\[6\\].\n\nNow that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/faw73z8qdbx71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e01686c9740202b0a86f0c7e7bbd0a9d4d193d8\n\nUnsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3tu6gfqrdbx71.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f3923e9917d26c772af234ce7c31a32882a2ca5)\n\nFor every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.\n\nBut what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n95yi6lsdbx71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=f795b4404f8277bad99a57624f158a6a0594d7b0\n\nUnsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \\[7\\]. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/03em191jdbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=257e458829fb1f4b661e3b5e2a6672816359e01f)\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThere are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of\n\n* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it’s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.\n* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks\n* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.\n* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works — stay tuned! \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pufwh52jdbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd8c84adf4cc75b03e0893e50aee2072beb18b9)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBefore starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with\n\n>The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!\n\nI was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.\n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***\n\nEither it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).\n\nWhatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!\n\nIf you liked reading this one, you will love\n\n* How to [consistently make returns](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/crypto-dca) from the Crypto market!\n* [Should you follow insider transactions](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/insider-purchase) while investing?\n\nUntil next week…\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rkizc03jdbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b96fef618966a52c54718763ea7207382feb159)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.\n\n\\[2\\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.\n\n\\[3\\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.\n\n\\[4\\] It’s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.\n\n\\[5\\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).\n\n\\[6\\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it’s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns is [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).\n\n\\[7\\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally.

I'll pasted the details that I deemed most important for everyone if they haven't seen it. \n\nAs follows\n\n \nIn July 2021, the Company issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior convertible promissory notes due July 23, 2026 (“2021 Convertible Notes”) in a private offering. The 2021 Convertible Notes mature on July 23, 2026 and accrue interest quarterly at a rate of (i) zero percent (0%) from the date of issuance to, and including, June 30, 2022 and (ii) five percent (5%) after June 30, 2022. The 2021 Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s equity under various circumstances, including upon an Initial Public Offering and a Change of Control of the Company (as such terms are defined in the 2021 Convertible Notes Purchase Agreement). Upon an Initial Public Offering, the 2021 Convertible Notes automatically convert into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of: (i) $71.03, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, recapitalization or any other similar transaction, and (ii) the product of (x) the Initial Public Offering price per share multiplied by (y) the applicable discount rate determined by reference to the time of conversion (0.85 until December 31, 2021).\n\nOn October 8, 2021, the Company issued $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) to certain investors of the Company. Proceeds received net of a $25 million original issue discount may be used for general corporate purposes. The 2026 Notes mature five years from the date of issuance, or earlier at 90 days before the maturity of the 2021 Convertible Notes if they remain outstanding (refer to Note 6 “Debt”). The 2026 Notes bear interest at (x) LIBOR, subject to a 1.00% floor, plus (y) 6.00% per annum, subject to downward adjustment upon certain events. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid in cash semi-annually in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of each year. The Company has the option to redeem the notes at any time at 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes, plus any applicable premium. The 2026 Notes contain a number of customary covenants similar to the covenants under the ABL Facility (refer to Note 6 “Debt”) and a minimum liquidity covenant. The 2026 Notes are secured by a second priority security interest in the same assets in which the ABL Facility has a first priority security interest and are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company.\n\nFrom July 2021 through October 31, 2021, the Company granted less than 1 million stock options at a weighted-average exercise price of $39.58 per share and 12 million RSUs. The stock options require a service period to vest and require a Change in Control to become exercisable. The RSUs require a service period and an Initial Public Offering (as defined in the Plan) to vest. Similar to the Company’s existing options and RSUs, the performance based vesting conditions are not deemed to be probable until such events occur. The issuance of these options and RSUs has resulted in an incremental $496 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation.\n\nDuring October 2021, the Company modified the service-based vesting terms of approximately 6 million options. As the modified options contain a performance condition that is satisfied upon a Change of Control, the fair value of the options was remeasured on the date of modification which resulted in an increase in unrecognized compensation cost of approximately $265 million.\n\nIn October 2021, the Company approved the funding of Forever by Rivian, Inc. (the Company’s social welfare organization) with shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, subject to the completion of its initial public offering. The approved amount is equal to 1% of the Company’s outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis immediately before the completion of the initial public offering. As a result of this donation, the Company will recognize a one-time, non-cash expense, the amount of which is dependent upon the ultimate price per share recognized at the time of the offering (e.g., the expense would be approximately $495 million if the initial public offering price were $59.50 per share, which is currently the midpoint of the estimated initial public offering price range)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Are you still going to buy even though they changed the price to $72?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So I already committed to 100 shares.

Just off the top of my head:\n\n* Rivian doesn't have a working assembly line to mass produce their vehicles. Just last week multiple articles came out that said they were producing only 1 vehicle a day.\n\n* If history has shown us anything, Rivian is going to go through production hell getting an assembly line working to up that number to something reasonable. Take a look back at all the complaints and criticism levied at Tesla back then, most of it is probably going to be said about Rivian in the coming months.\n\n* Rivian's order from Amazon actually puts them in a not so good position right now due to their customer concentration. Rivian wants to attract regular consumers to their brand, but Rivian has to take time away from that to focus on producing Amazon vans to keep Amazon happy. And Jeff Bezos has made clear he's not willing to wait around for those vans given how he's tweeted \"Now RJ, where are our vans?!\". If you read what's in the contract with Amazon you'll see that there's farther time pressures on Rivian to get the Amazon vans made, because Amazon has the option to buy from someone else if Rivian can't do it in a timely manner.\n\nBesides those immediate issues, I see other potential red flags with Rivian that don't sit right with me.\n\n* Rivian hyped up their tank turn a while ago, only to quietly remove it as a feature because of issues with it (issues that essentially come down to the laws of physics making a safe and controlled tank turn very difficult to pull off, especially on certain types of surfaces). Based on insider reports Rivian did very little work on this before abandoning it, making it clear the whole point of it was just to counter the Cybertruck excitement at the time. If you take a closer look at the Rivian tank turn footage you'll notice a LOT of tire treads, implying they tried it A LOT to get just the right footage where it worked correctly. Hyping up a feature as a PR stunt only to abandon it after getting the footage they want makes me wary of trusting Rivian.\n\n* In my opinion Rivian moves way too slow to be successful long term. Rivian is 12 years old, and only just brought a vehicle to the market. Maybe that would have been ok in the past, but things are moving quickly in the EV space now that most automakers are taking it seriously.

{"title": "$BGFV - A fundamentally undervalued, technically bullish GME-like dark horse primed for a huge ramp up by 11/17", "selftext": "*^(To the mods of r/)* ^(Stocks)*^(, $BGFV meets the definition to not be a penny stock as defined by)* [*^(Rule 7)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/pennystocks) *^(despite being small cap. To users reading this, do not interpret this as advice to trade, do your own individual research and due diligence as with any stock mentioned on the internet.)*\n\nIf your time is short, below are my talking points on why I believe $BGFV is about to explode upwards, explained later in this DD.\n\n1. Strong Balance Sheet\n2. Stock Buybacks\n3. Special Dividends\n4. Positive EPS\n5. Low PE ratio\n6. Undervalued at face value\n7. All fundamental metrics favorable\n8. Operational strategic advantage regarding supply chain and political conditions\n9. Potential acquisition target if market cap continues to be low\n10. Massive short interest presenting GME like technicals\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Strong balance sheet:** Their recent quarterly earning reports that their balance sheet had $114m in cash / cash equivalents on hand with zero debt. This presents a $36m improvement on cash since the start of the year despite their stellar record of stock buybacks and issuance of dividends.\n2. **Stock buybacks:** BGFV has repurchased 100,498 shares over the course of the 3rd quarter.\n3. **Special dividend on top of regular dividend:** Announcement of a $1.00 special dividend payable on 12/01/2021, to shareholders of record as of 11/17/2021; $0.25 regular dividend payable on 12/15/2021 to shareholders of record as of 12/01/2021\n4. **Positive EPS:** Diluted EPS for the 39 weeks ending in 10/03 is $3.81/share. 4th quarter guidance for the final quarter of 2021 is $0.55 - $0.70, so the forward EPS for the 2021 year is approx $4.36 - $4.51 EPS.\n5. **Low forward PE ratio:** With a stock price of $31 / share and a forward EPS guidance of $4.44 / share, forward PE ratio is approx 6.9. Compare this to the the industry average at 21.15, and SP500 at 29.36, this presents nearly a 310% discount compared to peers. (to put in perspective, for BGFV to be trading fairly among peers would price it at $93 / share. Another perspective, Walmart's PE ratio is 23.72)\n6. **Undervalued at face value**: For a company with over 430 stores spread across over 11 states (3 planned to open within the coming quarter), positive operating cash flow, and free shareholder equity of 280m; with the stock trading at 31/share, it is valued at merely $620.8M.\n7. **Valuation involving profitability, dividend, growth rates, operating effectiveness, and financial strength/ stability metrics are all favorable:** As mentioned earlier, PE ratio is low, presenting a 310% discount compared to peers. It also pays dividends, which is impressive since most companies in the sector don't even pay a dividend. The dividend is also sustainable and don't impact the company's bottom line despite being a massive 3.6% yield. BGFV's returns on asset, return on equity, revenue per employee are 15.18%, 47.94%, and $142,187 respectively, which is among the leaders of the sector. As mentioned earlier, BGFV uses little to no debt and have very little financial risk. In regards with profitability, BGFV's net profit margin is 9.02%, when the industry is -10.76%\n8. **Strategically advantageous supply chain management and operating environment**: During a time when supply chain management mattered most, BGFV's supply chain is strategically placing stores within range of their distribution centers, the west coast, with California being the state with the largest sum of stores. This focus on California another strategic advantage, especially for ammo purchases, since California requires brick and mortar stores to complete ammo sales; [at a time when new gun ownership have rocketed to unseen heights.](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view) To bring another catalyst to this, BGFV has retained it's firearm and ammunition business when other big box retailers such as Walmart and Dicks Sporting goods have begin to wind down their firearms segment. Further exacerbating the catalyst is the democratic president elected (which historically always increase ammo/firearm purchases compared to republican presidents in power).\n9. **Potential target for acquisition with the appointment of Lily Chang to the board**: Lily Chang is the Chief portfolio officer of LGP which is coincidentally the same company that took BGFV public back in 2002. This is entirely speculation, but with the market cap as low as 600m, this is potentially foreboding a takeover in the near future.\n10. **And finally, despite everything said and done, the stock is the 3rd most shorted stock on US exchanges, and like GME, presents a huge opportunity for a short-squeze like event:** Short squeezes are events where certain catalysts need to be present. The stock must have high percentage of public shares shorted; the cost to borrow must be high; the shares available to short must be low; a dividend, share buyback, or other catalyst must be present; and it must have high trading volume. A couple weeks ago, not all of these were present. The stock is over 43% of float shorted as of the date of this post (8,480,000 shares), the shares avail to short is 150k (which is moderately low), cost to borrow was around 2% (which is very low), and no dividend was announced.. until now. The upcoming 11/17 ex-dividend is the catalyst we've been looking for. The last time the stock did a dividend, it drained shares avail to borrow, spiked cost to borrow, and spiked the stock price from $23 to $32 over a couple days. [That time, the % of shares sold short was less than 38%](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bgfv/comments/pq9gsi/1y_chart_cross_referencing_stock_price_shares/). It has never been as high as it has been now, and I am predicting that the price movement on or before 11/17 when the dividend is 2.8% yield will violently margin call anyone who is short BGFV. If this occurs when the stock price is trading at $35 (now), it presents a 41% upside. This only gets worst for people with bear positions as the stock trades higher.

Then you depreciate 100k/354mths = $282 less of taxes a month (-$3,389/year) for every $100k in building value.  You can work numbers to give you a tax break too but this is basically what I was referring too.\n\nFurthermore, if you have rental income this is taken directly against that.  So I might have a rental with $2100 in rent, -$1100 a month in mortgage, and -$500 in expenses, so +$600 \\* 12 = $7200 a year in gains.\n\nBut that's for like $200k of building value so I could deduct 282\\*24 = $6768 each year against its income.  This shows income of $7,200 - $6,768 = $432 a year.  Which is basically nothing.\n\nAt the same time the mortgage principle is being paid down like $400 a month, so that adds $4800 a year to my net worth (increasing over time as pay down increases).\n\nThen you have appreciation.  In a good market you can see 8% pretty regular (west coast city areas for example).  So another 16K in net worth gains a year.\n\nBest part is this is leveraged.  So return on your downpayment is 5x-10x the rate you see in here.\n\nSo yeah for the above example, Taxable income is $432 a year, but net worth grows by $28,000 a year.  And the down playment at 20% is only $40k.  Not including closing cost, miantance, and vacancies, that's 70% return on investment during that year.  140% if you only put 10% down.

You close the put or let it expire for a profit or loss: Regardless of how long you held it, it will be a short term capital gain or loss. The gain or loss is recognized on the date you close it or let it expire.\n2. If the put is ITM, and it is exercised, then you subtract the cost basis of the shares by the premium you received. E.g., if you sold TSLA 1200P for 50 dollar premium, and you are assigned because the share price fell below 1200, then your cost basis will be 1200 - 50 = 1150. The assignment is not a taxable event, only the cost basis changes.\n\nThe only way to convert a put into long term cap gain is to let it get assigned and then holding the lot of shares for more than a year.

It’s unfortunate, so you’d need an additional hardware to do that. But yeah, in the future, all versions of our vehicles will be able to at least do bi-directional power flow for the purposes of energy market participation. But even for that, it’s important to remember that your car is in plugged in 24/7, so it’s kind of an unpredictable resource for the grid. It’ll have a value, but it’s not the same as a stationary battery pack.\n\nElon Musk: (03:03:49)\nYeah. Honestly, a vehicle to grid sounds good, but I think actually has a much lower utility than people think. I think very few people would actually use vehicle to grid. With the original roadster, we had vehicle to grid capabilities, nobody used it.\n\n~Literally Elon Musk says the Original Roadster which one could buy in North America had V2G capability which means that is a vehicle that could had a connector capable of doing it.\n\nDisingenuously dismissing Wallbox Quasar which allowed DC (7.2kW)at home charging and V2H for Nissan Leaf via CHAdeMO connector and ignored J3068 (basically same as Europe Type 2 connector) used for North American medium/heavy-duty vehicles like the School buses being used for V2G applications from Nuvve.\n\nDismissing other V2G technology and players in the North American market was similar to Legacy ICE studies that show Gas is cheaper than Electric.\n(Moves that are done to discourage shopping a competitor and made matter-of-factly to showcase they are the better choice.)*", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry for rant wall of text...was having a conversation on same subject when talking to someone IRL.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Look we don't give two shits about how technology works, all we care about is getting fucking rich!", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yeah you don't understand the partnership.\n\nThats fine.

That means every quarter your parents will receive $1000, or $4000 a year.\n\nI think dividends are much more lucrative in the long term because you’re essentially earning “free shares” over time. Dividend yield takes the amount of shares you own, and gives you a percentage for free. So say yield is 2% and I own 200 shares. In one year, I will be given an additional 4 shares. This can compound over time obviously as the longer I hold, the more stock I hold, the more dividend payout I receive.\n\nBut as many people here will testify to: this doesn’t really matter unless you have a) a lot of time or b) a lot of money.

Just park the money and run.\n\nBut the question is, what else can you do with $500k? Honestly, I would not put it in SPY. Reason being, in my market, I could buy five homes outright in cash.

And at the of appreciation for most homes, i would certainly have over $2million in equity in 30 years.\n\nNothing is perfect though.

There's lots of companies with difficult problems to solve (how do we  make this phone $1 cheaper to build, or how do we design this engine to pass emissions standards when it gets tested) and there's companies with interesting problems to solve, but they typically don't actually let their engineers solve them. Most modern companies are strangled by layers and layers of middle management and everything either has to be designed by committee or signed off on by one \"visionary\" at the top. Anything you design and build will take years to see production and will get watered down and destroyed by cost cutting along the way.\n\nI had a friend who went to work for a \"big 3\" automaker out of college, and he designed a seat rail for a car. Which is actually interesting because it's a really important safety part, but he spent almost all his time in meetings or waiting for approvals from management or having to redesign stuff because some other group made a change that screwed something up. He said that's what it was like for all the new hirers in his department, just toiling away on something that had seemed completely pointless. He actually got a job at Tesla after 2 years and loved it even though he ended up working 60 hours weeks a lot of times because he was spending all that time doing interesting stuff. When he left for Tesla, that one part he'd spent 100% of his time working on, still hadn't made it in to a single production car.\n\nAnd it's the same story at SpaceX. Both companies are attracting lots of very talented engineers, to work on interesting and complex problems. And then when they figure out the problem, they get to see it in production immediately. Often times you'll see very junior people, even interns, get to be responsible for actually making real changes and taking charge of projects if they're the ones that have the most hands on experience with it. Or if you're working on something and a supplier is dragging their heels or overcharging or just jerking you around, then they bring it in house and do it better themselves.\n\nYou get to avoid like 95% of the soul crushing bullshit that makes most engineers hate their jobs. So Tesla and SpaceX attract talented people, who are willing to work hard and they let them work hard to solve important problems. And what's the result?

Because I don’t think that’s true. \n\nAnd it seems really unlikely that your friend’s seat rail would be held up by committee bullshit, the launch date for new models is decided years before they go on sale, have regulatory implications if they miss that year, and typically only get held up from launching on time because of things like updated safety tests that come along and require redesign to meet.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think your information about the design cycles at tesla is wildly inaccurate.\n\nThe Model S just launched an entirely new version. But even before that, it basically wasn't the same car from the first year it launched to last year. Or look at the changes they made to the model Y design over a couple years between initial launch to the launch in China to the version that's being made now, to the ones that are going to come out of Berlin and Austin. Each version has significant improvements in almost every area, right down to the structure.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The model S has had significant changes just about every year, but almost none of them have been structural.\n\nAnd in any case, no one’s seat rail design is held up by meetings.

And maybe my friend was exaggerating in the stories, but it's not like traditional automakers are known for being nimble.\n\nAnd yeah, if we take just one model (the S) and we ignore the most recent redesign (when they launch the Plaid option) and we focus on just the structural aspects (since nearly everything else has gone through many obvious changes) and we limit ourselves to known changes, then we can say \"the last version of the Model S had no obvious structural changes during its life\". But that might not even be useful because it absolutely could have had important structural changes and we just don't know about it. It's not like Tesla refuses to do structural improvements and it's not like they publish every change they make in some obvious way.\n\nBut if we don't put those kind of ridiculous constraints on ourselves, then we're free to look at examples like the most recent new Model (the Y) where they've made lots of structural changes in a very short amount of time.\n\nTesla is continually making changes and updates to their cars that include structural improvements, design changes, interior change, software changes, safety improvements, electrical changes, etc.\n\nIf you're going to argue that Tesla isn't more agile and doesn't make more improvements and upgrades, I think you're going to have to have a more compelling case than \"this is what's typical in the industry\" or \"if we limit ourselves by only looking at X, Y and Z, then there haven't been any significant changes in a few years\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "My point is that Tesla is not updating its cars with any more frequency than other automakers. They update more like software, with a relatively minor revision or two every year. Other automakers do major changes to the entire vehicle every 4-7 years. \n\nThese might be different approaches but it leads to roughly the same amount of new engineering.\n\nAnd as for your friend, surely you realize you can’t compare the timelines for developing a new component for 1 car that is getting updated vs designing a component for a wide platform change? There would be more meetings for that, but that’s not an apples to apples comparison. \n\nThere are more meetings when changing something on a federal level than there are when changing something at a municipal level. The scale is completely different.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> My point is that Tesla is not updating its cars with any more frequency than other automakers.\n\nIf that's your point, then I think you've gone about showing it in a pretty backwards way.\n\nLike, take the Model S for example, it was an outstanding car when it was first released, and it went through lots of regular changes during the initial model's lifespan. It was definitely still an excellent choice before the new version came out. Things like safety, software, range, seats and interior, all improved steadily and there really wasn't any competitor from the large automakers that made significant progress in either catching up to it (if they were behind) or exceeding it (if they were roughly competitive). So, by that measure Tesla's iterative approach was at least as good as a traditional method of doing a major refresh or new model every 4-7 years (and I think there'd be lots of people that argue that it was better in a lot of ways). And then Tesla came out with the new Model S and Plaid that jumped way ahead of where they were with the prior model and made significant upgrades in every category. Obviously no other automaker has had a model that's been keeping up with the Model S's iterative improvements and also matched the improvements made in the Plaid. It seems like Tesla is willing to do both kinds of redesigns - continual improvements, and then major redesigns as well.\n\nAnd again, we can see the same thing in the Model Y. It's made lots of small improvements in its relatively short life, and has also had a couple of major redesigns of structural elements within a couple years. Those are the kinds of changes other automakers make every 5+ years at best.\n\n> These might be different approaches but it leads to roughly the same amount of new engineering.\n\nIf that's the claim, then I think you should show some evidence for it? For example, if Teslas were roughly competitive with similar models when they launched, and then got better with iterative improvements, and then when other automakers launched major redesigns they were roughly competitive (or at least equally far ahead/behind). Then I think there'd be a case to be made that the pace of innovation is roughly similar.\n\nBut instead what we seem to be seeing is that Teslas are very popular at their price point when launched. And then demand has been increasing as they increase production and make iterative changes, even while they're also increasing pricing. It seems like Teslas are becoming more desirable, compared to the competition, over time. Not that they seeing brief period of superior engineering in between major refreshes from the competition.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "He and Kanye need to drop an album and a car design together.

Bear with me because I’m trying to work this out for myself on the fly.\n\nClearly, there is huge retail interest in “betting on Musk”. And TSLA is currently the only way to do that (barring having enormous piles of capital to buy into other endeavors privately).\n\nSo basically, TSLA (the stock) serves a dual purpose: Going long on Tesla Inc., but also going long on Musk. The former is fine — it’s how this whole thing is supposed to work, right?\n\nBut the latter implies that if there were other ways to bet “directly” on Musk, a whole lot of retail dollars would exit TSLA for that vehicle, right?\n\nSay, for example, Musk blows everyone’s minds by creating an ETH-based token that pays holders dividends based on the collective performance of all his endeavors. And for the sake of this wacky thought experiment, let’s assume (big assumption, I know) the tokenomics are rock solid. In other words, it 100% does what it says on the label: Musk makes money = so do you. No doubt it works.\n\nAnd for the fuck of it, let’s say ELONSMAGICMUSKCOIN is also somehow immediately available to get through your IRA account, Robinhood, etc.\n\nObviously, such a magical coin would skyrocket in value (because Cult of Musk), but what I want to know is: \n\n1.\t**How bad would TSLA tank, if at all?** Seems to me that a _lot_ of people would exit TSLA in order to do what they really wanted to do all along: Bet on Musk.\n2.\tHow much should this thought experiment scare someone who thinks they’re betting on Musk by buying TSLA?

Super revolutionary? Not really.\n\n> Tesla has a massive head start on software\n\n Yeah, I think this is a major point- Tesla's FSD is still way better than everybody else's (Google might be better), but unless they actually license this tech to everyone else, it's a differentiator that only matters when people buy Teslas. So this only scales as well as their production capacity and ability to sell more. And if Google starts licensing their FSD (they will), this advantage goes to everyone else.\n\n> Tesla is also supply limited.\n\nSure, but that's because they have low production capacity. We're acting like a car company being unable to produce cars is a good thing. Until they're able to produce at a fast enough rate to meet demand, it feels like a marketing strategy to say \"look, we're in such high demand that we can't keep up\".\n\n> Tesla can get a car to market extremely quickly\n\nI wonder how much of this will change as they try to make more cars.

If the margins on powerbanks are too high, I don't see why increased competition from Shell/Chevron who have existing infrastructure wouldn't drive those margins down.\n\n>  Current waymo cars require huge sensor arrays that no consumer would want on their car\n\nYeah, those things are super ugly, but Waymo isn't going for half-self driving. I can see Waymo cars drive around in the city- Tesla self driving simply doesn't work in SF. So we're not really comparing apples to apples here. We're saying that something that looks pretty and half works is better than something that looks stupid but works a lot better. Waymo can pull money from Alphabet, so it doesn't have the same pressure to look pretty, but I'd imagine they'll eventually start caring.

They won't be able to put batteries in the cars.  There's plenty of other stuff there, but that's a killer right there.

Here are the results.", "selftext": ">Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal \n\nA community that defines itself like this is not a confidence-inspiring place to get stock picks to YOLO your next paycheck into. I think, being the only place where losses are celebrated as much as the wins should make you seriously question the incentive of folks who are making the recommendations!  \n\nWhether it’s for the insane YOLOs posted every day, or breaking Robinghood with infinite leverage plays, or the legendary short-squeeze involving GME, here is where the action goes down!\n\nBut what I am interested in is to see if **we can beat the** **market** **by using the stock picks made on wallstreetbets!** After all,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0cedr2igbx71.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=3080567a78e82b0344ec4a65788d2b4f794159e9\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/1qtf5iajgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd15b08ff9426c655ac161995f22ea16865cc90e)\n\n**Data**\n\nReddit’s PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec’20.\n\nThe summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gpp85mcjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a9916acb77466874f188e0061692d05129a058a)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nAhh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it’s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.\n\nSo what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \\[2\\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.\n\nConsidering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next\n\na. One Week\n\nb. One Month\n\nc. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)\n\nThe benchmark for comparison is SPY\\[3\\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/pu8irxajgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=441bf1657bd1109e57189f76e35b3115af4ba627)\n\n**Results**\n\nBefore we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/qlscp1/video/t2ii3hjlgbx71/player\n\n *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/) \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/abx4tcqmgbx71.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1d7aec4f26c6f7714a343ff7dd4670c679ae238)\n\nWe would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \\[4\\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)\n\nBut, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \\[5\\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it’s definitely not for safe plays).\n\nSo, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/d4hwo3kngbx71.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a3ef5cbe1cf152ae89981ea81c82ad035daf66)\n\nWould you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.\n\nBut keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9k19tq9ogbx71.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e3401b02342b1880922e094911dcdf1c75d00c3)\n\nGME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \\[6\\].\n\nNow that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1zt22jpgbx71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c2fd19ce44a58f79c92473a5cab4a1908c1d0f8\n\nUnsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/szf7uirqgbx71.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf59305c3719d840617a4fc81fc94938313497b3)\n\nFor every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.\n\nBut what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1qn01irgbx71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=02933cb4b8f3039b4088c98da4923ef049099aab\n\nUnsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \\[7\\].  \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n2mtnnbjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=50e4f09865adc8c40f285c7eec6e24243ff2954b)\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThere are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of\n\n* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it’s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.\n* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks\n* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.\n* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works — stay tuned!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6kh47fcjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ed5f0169321aba78fbc8f48d247e1cb98a373d)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBefore starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with\n\n>The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!\n\nI was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.\n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***\n\nEither it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).\n\nWhatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zieahxcjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fe14d84efb06c5c3397f588064eade2e1aa9bb7)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.\n\n\\[2\\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.\n\n\\[3\\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.\n\n\\[4\\] It’s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.\n\n\\[5\\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).\n\n\\[6\\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it’s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns are [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).\n\n\\[7\\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*", "id": "qlscp1", "created_utc": 1635938713.0, "score": 963, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 145, "comments": [{"body": "TL;DR:\n\nYes.

{"title": "80k Fastly ($FSLY) earnings bet (bear spread)", "selftext": " Now that Fastly is skyrocketing following Akamai's earnings, it seemed like a good time for me to enter with a bearish play. Be careful: this is not a full DD, expectations for Fastly are quite low and it has been beaten down a lot already, so going bearish can be very risky. Doubly so if you simply buy puts, which have very high IV for Fastly. I'm only using house money on this play. Enter at your own risk and limit your exposure.\n\n**Reasons for play**\n\n1. Trends in their employee base I [posted about here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qjw4pq/fastly_fsly_seems_to_be_losing_lots_of_employees/)\n2. Almost all of their large customers seem to be losing significant traffic in Q3 compared to last quarter: Kickstarter, Guardian, Yelp, Github, WikiHow, Wayfair, Lonely Planet, Imgur. Amazon and Shopify also reported tepid earnings. However, some like Ticketmaster or Foursquare are doing well. As Fastly works with a usage-based business model, this could immediately affect their numbers\n3. Following on point 2, all covid stock have been getting clobbered this week in earnings, while plays on \"real life\" like Lyft, Marriott, AMC are doing quite well.\n\nGood luck to anyone playing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zr7to8t0iex71.png?width=463&format=png&auto=webp&s=d32115fb4b618bc93382be307bec1211e752ace4", "id": "qlx7tx", "created_utc": 1635954171.0, "score": 114, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 212, "comments": [{"body": "Shoutout to the other guy who posted about the Pager app in the Zillow thread", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Glad it can help!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Im hoping i set it up correctly lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "just got this.

They also make great money on the repairs they charge the home owner for, this might actually be the big money maker for them, like it is for property management companies. There is value in what OPEN does, quick guaranteed close, so people will still want it, but it won't ever take more than a 4-5% market share.  A person's home is typically their largest investment and to think the majority of home owners would leave an extra 10-15% on the table isn't realistic.  Also, I'm starting to do marketing next month where I guarantee I'll sell your house for 5k more than your opendoor offer or I'll pay you 5k.  Other brokers probably will too, but this won't hurt OPEN numbers anytime soon, but might long term.\n\nFor OPEN to succeed they need their customers to fail.
