This is why you don't invest in shit you know nothing about, there's personally some companies which I'm told are rather solid, investing in big pharma when COVID hit was kind of a no brainer, but I'm not into that field so I'm not touching that. Now people before the dotcom pop were investing billions in what was basically shady websites and prototypes without any solid future plans, then they were surprised when it all failed.\n\nThe 2008 crisis had a different origin and the 2018 is the one that worries me the most because I'm pretty ignorant about it.\n\nFast-forward about 20 years the market is already established and the biggest stocks are not scams, they're a core part of how the world runs (which is... quite worrisome). Sure, some of them might go down for a while, but the market is so big now and so dominated by just a few companies that I *really* don't see how it could go wrong **without any of us seeing it come**.\n\nJust a few examples, lets pick Microsoft, Google and Apple. Between those three you basically own, if you go to the basics, all relevant OS systems for both desktop and mobile. Most software you use runs based on their platform, they literally own the stores you buy your mobile apps from, they own lots of software used at all possible levels, most of us are *used* to their stuff and it takes a pretty big deal of effort to switch because why bother? I'm straight up ignoring all the particular services they provide, developments when it comes to AI, hardware, data centers, etc.\n\nYou can then switch to hardware and on each field you'll find there's like 2 or 3 relevant companies, *sometimes* 4 and that's all there is to it, they've also been at it for ages and the amount of money you need to even get into the game is so massive that it's just not worth the risk.

{"title": "I Analyzed $NVDA So You Don't Have To", "selftext": "Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. I also have done analysis for other companies as well. Feel free to check them out on my profile! For those that don’t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!\n\nDuring the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they’re doing which I’m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.\n\nNow let's talk about their evaluation…\n\n1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia’s multiples are leading more than any other company.\n2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants “Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU” While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU’s.\n3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It’s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.\n\nI hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company.

You understood me perfectly and appreciate your sticking up for me\n\nMy goal as a small timer (a bit late to the Tesla investing game as I should have been in Tesla a decade ago to at far lower prices)... Is to try and improve my family's financial situation (in particular my father.)  He's a senior citizen who will be retiring in a few years and I want him to have a healthy nest egg.\n\nSo staring in January of this year, I really pressed him on getting invested all in on Tesla.  I had been doing a very small amount of investing with my own account in 2020, but unfortunately I missed a big run during the S&P 500 because some idiot I trusted told me to play it safe and get out a week before the inclusion so as to minimize my risks.   The jackass is a multimillionaire himself and this was his way to screw me over\n\nSo I learned my hard lesson and made a Vow to become a long term investor and not sell a single share no matter what.  In January my family invested in quite a few shares of Tesla at super high prices back then of $860s.  Then we hit $900 but then missed the Q4 (2020) earnings... And this caused the stock to drop from 900 all the way back to 540s in March.  I stayed resilient and even added some stares in the $690s (which in hind sight was a great move longer term).   Then once I had 127 shares with an average price of $816... Recently I added 33 shares after the 12% price drop on Elon sales (and got in at $1029).\n\nSo my average now on those 160 shares is around $861.   I have about 66k left to invest, but I am reluctant at current all time highs... Fearing that once again in January 2022 (after the Q4 2021 earnings)... We may see another huge correction or sell off and the stock tanks from say $1400 - $ 1500s,  all the way down to current $1100s again and just sits there doing nothing (meandering for months on end... Even dropping) before second half starting to rally.\n\nSo I realize even if that happens, none of it matters long term... But I'm trying to decide if buying 40 or 45 shares at today's $1100 prices is a bit too pricey and I can do better (get a of price).   The problem with Tesla a lot of times (especially this time of year) is that FOMO sets in and many investors end up. Chasing higher and higher prices and buy at all time highs of not only this year... But next as well.\n\nSo I'm super torn on what to do because on one hand I like my average price of 861.  But even if I added another 40 shares, my average cost would be around $1000 which is not too bad.  Plus we may be in for a split announcement on 12/9... And the last Time a split occurred, the stock ran up 80% over a short period of time!\n\nSo I don't want to miss out and I am extremely close to pulling the trigger on another 40 shares but I don't know if I'm buying at the worst time possible with my hard earned money.

If you sell. That's why we come in to reassure people during their first couple of dips.\n\nI talked my best friend into Tesla shares back in September 2020. I believed in this company with all of my heart, and it was shooting up. He bought 80 shares at $500, what was supposed to be money for a down payment on the house. He had about half of what he needed... And I convinced him that this would get him the rest of the way faster... As his goal was to get the rest by 2026.\n\n... Well... Catastrophe hit, a large manipulation bank in Japan sold off and the stock hit $350. He had FOLM (fear of losing more) and sold the stock. He lost about $12,000 in in a week. I tried to convince him to hang on, but he was pissed at me. But I kept talking to him, and when it began to rise he bought in at $404, taking his losses to about $4040. \n\nHe messaged me when we just hit $1200, just 14 months later, his stock was worth over $65,000. AND he has invested more in the company, so he's sitting around $45,000 right now. He thanked me again for convincing him to buy the stock... Even though he bought in at $500, and then lost $50 a share. He's not mad that he didn't wait until the perfect $350 strike point... Because none of us could have predicted that. He was mad at me for a few months for pushing Tesla on him... And ever since then he's just mad at himself that he sold. And lost a few shares. \n\nThis is why we tell new investors who post \"Just put my house down payment into Tesla at $1100 and it dipped to $1000, bleeping bleep\" not to worry about it. That it's not a big deal. Because when the stock hits $1500... $2000.... $3000 etc, you'll be high in the green either way.

At that point, you're just glad you bought the correct stock. \n\nI appreciate again you writing back. I don't agree with your opinion of long term investing not being correct... But that's okay. I love to hear the opinions of others with different ideas, and more importantly why they have those ideas.

Not the math, just you saying that fees shouldn't be taken into account. I checked into it, and there is an industry standard for fractional shares at 5 percent, that goes up to 10. I could not find a single firm that offered lower... That would cut your 14 down to 7.

That's 7 percent if you have a crystal ball and could accurately pick the perfect dip point on a month and that every month had 10 percent volitility.\n\nSay we hit $1100 tomorrow.. and you have no crystal ball. Do you invest at $1100? Do you not because you want that 7 percent that $1000 gets you.... Or do you lose 7 percent because the stock goes up to $1200 before you decide that it won't go to $1000? That's why we say it doesn't matter. We are investors, and all of us buying in at 1000-1200 will be happy when we see 1500.

I always initiate the first trade for a credit. If I can close with the short call expiring worthless then the long call is paid for. You can then sell weekly calls against it. \n\nDon’t use stocks that’s pay dividends and if you do make sure you’re not short contracts when ex dividend comes up. You’ll be at increased risk of being assigned. Also, don’t let you short call be assigned, make sure you pick a strike far out enough, it’s unlikely. If in doubt, roll it out. Best case scenario, you roll to a higher strike than your long call. If this happens your long call for sure will be ITM. \n\nWhy do PMNC? It’s a shit load cheaper than PMCCs. Period. Best stocks to do this on are stocks that have a decent IV and have great growth potential. Alternatively you could do a PMCC and buy a protective put but you need to work on the mechanics of the contract dates so that it’s worth it to you in the end. Good luck. \n\nI’ve been playing NVDA, PYPL, ROKU and TSLA. If you have 20k you can play 300-400 stocks, your spread width just needs to be within 200 points i.e. long 500c short 300c = 20k minus credit from the 300c is max risk. The upside to this is if the stocks drops, your OTM call won’t suffer so much because it’s cheap like a budgie. But you’re always at risk of assignment. Personally, on a 20k account, maybe do a 100 point wide spread and leave 10k cash. That way if you’re assigned, you can take the shares and sell CC’s on them too.\n\nIf you did 20k worth and maxed your account, I’d you were assigned, you’d be a a significant loss. That’s the downside. Hence 100 point spreads instead or buy a protective put to limit your downside to single digits.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "PLTR FUBO SOFI are constantly trading in a range.

(I am a space enthusiast and knew of SpaceX first and learned about Tesla later) Once that all clicked in place I also became aware of the option to change my traditional Roth into a Brokerage account.  Presto changeo I was able to liquidate my standard mutual funds and buy TSLA with the entire amount.  Yes, this was cleared by the significant other after confirming that even if we lost the entire amount we would not be in the poor house in retirement.

This group has a feeling of such exclusivity I don't know where to begin haha\r  \n\r  \nMy introduction - I'm a Tesla investor from New Zealand, I work in psychiatry and you could call actually me an old school petrolhead. Loved cars from a young age and knew about Tesla ever since the first roadster came out. Didn't pay much attention to it since it seemed like a Lotus Elise but heavier and more expensive. But gradually over the years, I saw the case for electric grow. If you love your cars it actually represents quite a challenge to your entire world view. Some deny and become angry, however for me, it felt as though a switch in my mind flipped one day. I'm one of those weirdos that still enjoys the tactile sensation of manual gear changes, but acknowledge I am in the extreme minority and even now, I cannot see anything close from legacy auto that can challenge the Tesla. From reading car magazines since before the internet to still trying to keep up to date with car news, there is no competition...\r  \n\r  \nBeing in NZ, the access to stock trading platforms are limited and I only got in after the COVID Crash.

{"title": "$AUR: Automating Your Portfolio with Self-driving Tech DeSPAC Play🔥", "selftext": "Alrighty degenerates I got a play that will drive itself to profits. I’ve been on the lookout for amazing deSPAC plays that have potential and this one takes the cake, pie, and pretty much all the goods you will ever purchase in the future into your hands. It's a self-driving vehicle technology business that's going to revolutionize the way we travel and move goods. They’ve partnered with all the big names like Uber, Fedex, Volvo, Denso, Toyota and trucking industry giant Paccar. To bring us everything from self driving taxis, cars to fully autonomous trucking industry that will define the future. And it's all being led by individuals that have made amazing advancements to self driving technology and now   have joined together to revolutionize the industry.\n\nThe DeSpac trend continues with recent deSpacs plays getting hyped and shit on daily. But they all tend to do one thing and it's one thing we can count on. And that’s moving up in price once the information about the company is made aware to the masses. This isn’t a low float play as far as I can tell. But that won’t stop it from running and with the potential of this company that's a sure thing.\n\n**Aurora Driver** \\-designed to enable any vehicle from Class 8 trucks to regular cars to become autonomous and move safely and efficiently with human drivers which makes roads and the rides much safer without the possibility of human error.\n\n**Aurora Connect**\\- Driverless  Ride Hailing Service that will replace drivers for companies like Uber. Aurora Acquired Uber’s self-driving unit, Advanced Technologies Group last year in order to get market share in the robotaxi marketspace.\n\n**Aurora Horizon** \\-Bringing autonomous driving to the trucking industry which will make it cheaper and more efficient to transport goods and cheaper as well without the need to pay for a driver which currently is around 50% about transporting costs. Which is going to make it more lucrative for the shipping industry. It's already on the road and making test runs that serving the needs of Fedex and more companies in the future will follow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Market Share Aurora has due partnerships ](https://preview.redd.it/cf0vb3ol5d081.png?width=1517&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a26a9433682c4db6697710229bcd24bddf5fa4)\n\nAurora is being led by the best Autonomous Driver Technology Innovators of the decade. Chris Urmson, previously head of the Google Self-Driving Car project, formed Aurora in 2017 with Sterling Anderson, who led Tesla’s Autopilot program, and Drew Bagnell, a Carnegie Mellon University computer scientist and former member of Uber’s autonomous vehicle team, Uber ATG. These are the best people that the industry has to offer and they're all working together to take us to the future of Driverless Vehicles.\n\nNow with this being a recently formed deSpac most of the float is under a lock-up agreement. And with share redemptions and other stuff that make a deSpac plays so enticing the float you see is not the actual float. If you don't know what that means, well, you're shit out of luck. I'm not going to explain how SPACs have huge floats and are allowed to have options traded on them, but then when they go through with a merger a lot of that float vanishes due to redemptions. Now I don’t know the number of shares actually being traded because I'm not a lawyer and can only understand so much of 8-k filings before it goes over my head. But I’m confident that the actual number of shares being traded is way less than stated.\n\nMy positions are 2500 shares, 100 15c Dec 17, 50 12.5c Dec 15c and 25 20c Mar 22. Now if you have big balls and want to go in on Nov 19 options that could work out aswell. I’ll be buying some on open. Just bought 100 12.5c Nov 19 there cheap as fuck right now.\n\n**Edit:** **The recent Apple news has me even more bullish of the AI driving Sector and of Aurora because of their top of there class team working on making it happen. Its always possible that Apple could use Aurora software in there cars in the future!

I was having fun just moving shares around and making small amounts of money. Then a few weeks ago I decided to try options. I bought an apple call that went up a couple hundred bucks. I was amazed at how easy it was to make money with options. Then I decided to put a bunch of money into Delta Airlines calls expiring in January and February. Initially they went up, and I was making more money than ever before. But then they started to go down. As I'm writing this, my weekly chart is down almost 20%. This is all the money I had in my saving account. I'm not sure when I will crack, but at this rate it will be sometime soon. I'm still holding, but I can't focus on school or anything else because all I can think about is how much money I'm losing.\n\nMy question is, how do you guys deal with waking up in the morning and seeing huge losses? How do you keep going?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the great advice guys! So many responses!

If your trade puts more at risk than just your trade (your sleep, your tuition, your food), that's too much money.\n* Also, as others have said, there is some degree to becoming numb to it.

When trading options, *you must have an exit strategy for when things go to hell* AND *for when things go well.*  With stocks, if you never sell, you can still do well.  With options, you only make money when you sell.  There might be times when you buy a call option then exercise that, but we'll consider that playing the stock game for now.  \nAs you have seen, winning options trades turn into losing ones very quickly.

Just be ready to live without that premium.  \nCutting losses at 50% is also popular, but with inexpensive options, you might hit that point almost immediately after placing the trade due to the size of the spread.  \nWith winners, I like to roll them up.  I give up delta, but I put money back in my pocket.  \ne.g. On 8/17, I bought a QQQ 21Jan22 365 call for $19.40.  QQQ was trading \\~$366.  On 9/7, it was trading \\~$382, so I sold the call for $28.45 and bought 21Jan22 380 call for $18.55.  On 11/5, QQQ was trading \\~$398, so I sold the 380 call for $27.80 and bought a 400 call for $14.10.  \nAt this point, my cash is: -$19.40 + $28.45 - $18.55 + $27.80 - $14.10 = $4.2 *AND* the 400 call option, which is worth $13.50.  i.e. I have more money than I started with and an essentially free call option.  (The 360 call is $44.75, so I have traded $7.65 for a guaranteed profit.  Naturally, how you play this is up to you.)  Remember, we're (mostly) here to make money, so you have to put it back in your pocket.\n* Paper trade.  You can use thinkorswim's actual platform with imaginary money.  The hard part with fake money is treating it like it's real.  i.e. if you make a mistake with your entry or exit, no undoing or adjusting your account to correct your mistake.  Own it.  Also, if you make a bad decision, do not think, \"That's okay.  It's just fake money.\"  React as if it's real, because one day, it will be, and having practiced handling bad situations makes it easier to handle in real life.\n* Stick with your strategy.  There are always good streaks and bad streaks.  If you have a plan that you believe will win in the long run, then give it time to work.  If you switch every time that things turn against you, you could end up in a really long losing streak.  If you have confidence in your strategy, the ebbs and flows don't bother you.  \nIf you don't have a strategy, find one.  If you treat this like a lottery, it will reward you like one.  The way to win is by being the casino.  Get a small edge, and repeat that until your small pile becomes a big one.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

As an example you have a stock worth 4,2S$, and you buy calls with strike 3,5$ and a premium of 0,8, meaning you're losing 10$ every call you're getting.\n\nIf you had 10.000$ to invest you'd be able to get 125 calls.Had you alternatively bought shares you'd have 2380 shares.\n\nWhich means in a short team play, if the stock were to raise 50% to 6,3$, you'd be making 125 \\* 1,8$ \\* 100 = 22500$ in profits. If low on cash, or if you find it hard selling the calls which is normal, you sell a few calls, and then you start exercising the calls 1 by 1, and sell the stock right away, to free up money to lock in the entire trade as profit.\n\nHad you bought normal stock you'd be looking at 5000$ in profit.\n\nAnd the really neat part here, is if you're at a point where the price is declining or you're trading sideways and losing money to the theta eating away at your calls, you simply exercise the calls, and sell the stock right away. ultimately only costing you the 10$ per option traded.\n\nThis way you'll guarantee yourself a max loss of 125 \\* 10$ = 1250$, not 25%, 50% or 100% of your 10.000$.\n\nGive it a go, and thank me later :-)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's not a loss unless you sell.

That money is being used to finance Business loans, mortgage loans, car loans, credit card debt, etc. That was the entire purpose of the fed's stimulus. Businesses and inviduals would need to borrow a lot to stay afloat during the pandemic, so the fed provided unprecedented liquidity.\n\nThat money absolutely makes it ways to consumers eventually. That $500,000 mortgage you got from the bank? That's either going to the person that sold you the house. That car loan? The dealer got commission, and the company that made the car is paying workers, and for parts/materials, etc. Business gets a loan? They're using that to pay workers.\n\n>So what we have right now: if rates are hiked, banks would take baton and create more money; if rates are not hiked, government goes on perpetual fiscal spend and hikes minimum wages and so on (M2 growth)\n\nLabor shortages can absolutely be the result of fed actions. The liquidity they provided enabled businesses to borrow money, which in turn creates or retains jobs. Low interest rates are exactly what is leading to so many IPOs attracting outrageous valuations. This raising of capital creates jobs, contributing to the labor shortage as demand for workers increases.", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I always though Joe Biden was the dumbest motherfucker to hold elected office.

This is so stupid - there have been rumors about Apple car going on and off since about 2010. The closest thing we have got is CarPlay, and at most there is an upgraded more integrated version of CarPlay coming in the next couple of years, but I just don't see Apple making their own branded car anytime at least in the next decade or so. It's just not their business model. \n\nWhat I do think they are working on next is a VR headset/hologlass type thing. They have been slowly investing more and more into AR stuff for the iPhones, and I think that's an indication that a full fledged VR headset is next. As usual, when Apple does introduce a VR headset, it won't be just an Occulus competitor or whatever, but will come with its own full suite of ecosystem and spark further innovation in that whole space, much like the iPad did for tablets and iPhones for smartphones, etc. The other thing is the VR/AR space is nascent technology and Google/Microsoft/Facebook have all tried and still trying to do things with that tech, but none have been really able to get into the hands of mainstream consumers, and that's primarily because mainstream users don't have any real use for VR/AR. Apple will figure out who to make it usable, and then launch a headset with its own ecosystem and that will become their new cash cow. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing Apple can gain by trying to build their own car. The car business is way too capital intensive, not to mention competitive with already too many players in it. Maybe they'll surprise everyone and really do announce their intention to build cars, but logically it doesn't make sense if you have followed Apple for a long time.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Will you have to relearn to drive it every time it updates? icramba", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
