The broker is just using the mark of the bid/ask and it's just a rough estimate. Any price above your opening price is not great, but don't panic just because your broker's estimate says -89%. BTW, the same applies on the profit side. Just because your broker quotes +89% in the green doesn't necessarily mean you'll get that profit.\n\nIf you accept assignment, you keep 100% of the credit, but you'll also pay the strike price for 100 shares per contract. **That's** where your loss comes in. If TQQQ stays around 150 and you have to pay 171, that's a hefty $21/share loss on assignment. That's a much bigger concern than your -89% in the red on your option trade.

I'm looking for the premiums and understanding that I could be assigned or called. I'm not looking for huge profits on each weekly but something good over time.  \nI usually target a 5-7% share price movement with a stock when looking at strike prices.

Ideally, at the end of the week, I would roll down/up and out IF the price resulted in possible assignment.  I'd then write the other side of the strangle the following week, always for a credit.  I'd be collecting premiums each week regardless of movement as long as something drastic doesnt happen, which is a risk in owning any stock.  \nMy question for the group is, what additional risks am I missing with this strategy?

Upon moving back to my parents, I was quickly hired by a contracting firm to work at Wachovia due to the  AG Edward's merger.

The attitude of \"I believe it’s crucial to study the history of the markets to have better judgment about the future of the stock market\" can be dangerous. I'm not saying your are wrong, but this kind of thinking can easily make you not to invest, because you think crash is near. I know many people who never invested because they always worry that the next crash is near, and losing a lot of potential gains because of that. This idea that \"because current asset prices are high, there must be a crash coming soon\" is very naïve in my opinion.\n\nFirst, market conditions are always different --- for example, in the last real estate market crash, the way banks were giving loans was crazy (stated income without verifying any actual paperwork for example). These days banks are much stricter with loan underwriting. Also, housing supply is very different.\n\nAlso, while it is plausible that you can predict how market will behave when an event like covid happens given the assumption that other factors such as government behavior stay the same, those factors never stay the same in the future. For example, you will never be able to predict how other people and agencies will react to the event --- the policy maker's reaction to the event can be different from the past because they learned from previous experience (see what the fed did when we got Covid - they reacted much faster and stronger than before). I know people who assumed that fed will behave similarly to the previous crash, and predicted that the stock price will stay low for longer and missed out the huge gain we had after March 2020 crash.\n\nAgain, in sum, it is a fool's game to try to predict how market will behave in the future.

{"title": "Hedge-fund investor who made $2.6 billion on pandemic trades says omicron could be bullish for stock market", "selftext": "Hedge-fund luminary Bill Ackman over the weekend said the new omicron variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 could be bullish for stocks if it proves to result in mild to moderate symptoms for those who contract it. The discovery of the variant resulted in one of the worst Black Friday trading sessions in recent memory, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, 0.98%, the S&P 500 index SPX, 1.62% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, 2.08% all tumbling by at least 2%, but Ackman’s comments suggest that investors’ knee-jerk response may have been an overreaction.\n\nBond yields on Friday also fell as prices for government debt saw a rush to the perceived safety of Treasurys on the back of fresh concerns about new restrictions that could result from a strain of COVID that the World Health Organization on Friday designated a variant of concern. However, stocks were bouncing back on Monday and the 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.528% was up 8 basis points at 1.56%. Prices for Treasurys fall as yields rise. \n\nAckman, who runs Pershing Square Capital, is known for his lucrative COVID wager. The Financial Times reported back in 2020 that the investor cashed out on bet that netted him a $2.6 billion profit on a $27 million at risk, on the premise that insurance premiums would soar during the height of the 2020 COVID pandemic as economies locked down. He also later in 2020 said that he placed bearish bets on corporate credit on the day that Pfizer PFE, -0.64%  and BioNTech BNTX, 3.65% released positive trial data on their COVID-19 vaccine, which triggered a whipsaw rally in stocks.\n\nAckman was wagering that the vaccines would lead to mask-wearing complacency. However, that bet presumably turned out wrong as markets continued to surge in the aftermath of those vaccines. The danger posed by the omicron variant isn’t yet fully understood, even though governments in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and the Americas immediately restricted travel from southern Africa. Vaccine manufacturers have said that they are examining the variant closely and note that the current batch of remedies might still prove effective against the strain and new vaccines could be readied in early 2022 if needed.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hedge-fund-investor-who-made-2-6-billion-on-pandemic-trades-says-omicron-could-be-bullish-for-stock-market-11638198173?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/hedge-fund-investor-who-made-2-6-billion-on-pandemic-trades-says-omicron-could-be-bullish-for-stock-market-11638198173?mod=home-page)", "id": "r517w5", "created_utc": 1638207913.0, "score": 461, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "Certain ppl you never take advice from: Chamath Palihapitya & Bill Ackman.

{"title": "Is AAPL a good buy right now?", "selftext": "Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my second analysis for AAPL, the last one was from May. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.\n\nToday we will look through the basics of Apple´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple´s stock using discounted free cashflow.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.\n\nFirst let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**.\n\nFor the valuation:\n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of **$99 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple´s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$94 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that.\n\nWith Apple´s price being at **$160** **per share** right now, it´s a little too high. That´s why I don´t think buying heavily is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\n**Where I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$293 per share** which is higher than what it is now. Almost double. That´s why you have to be careful with this analysis. Always do your own due diligence.\n\n**What I´ll do.** I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. Even if they don´t double in 5 years, I´m rather bullish on this company.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.", "id": "r576vm", "created_utc": 1638224128.0, "score": 212, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 220, "comments": [{"body": "AAPL is always a good buy", "score": 520, "replies": [{"body": "Came here to say this.

Just remember there are a lot of people waiting on the sidelines for any possible big dip to buy into companies like Tesla. Look what happened on Friday 3 days ago and compare it today.

If there’s a crash do you think companies like legacy auto or Rivian or Lucid have a good chance of surviving? Not likely. A crash would position Tesla to be one of the few survivors.

The US ports, especially the West Coast ones, seem to be the primary source of the supply shortage in the USA. If goods can start flowing freely again it will do a lot to reduce inflation. This is based on the assumption that the 'inflation' was caused by the supply chain shortages rather than QE (which I agree with).\n\nI think one major component that a lot of the 'Twitter geniuses' are missing is that people respond to shortages by overordering, thereby exacerbating the shortages. Just look at COVID-19 and people's hoarding of toilet paper. You get a massive surge in demand right as the shortages become widespread knowledge. Logically you would get a massive spike in pricing. The consequence of this price spike is that it sends a message to the market to bring on more supply. Demand eventually falls from its elevated 'hoarding' level to below the prior average and at the same time supply has increased from its previous average. This results in the fall in prices being more dramatic than the initial increase because you don't only have the reversion to the mean of purchasing but a net increase in supply that wasn't there before.\n\nThese supply-based price shocks are actually healthy for the economy because they force cost savings which are not automatically given back after prices go back down.

{"title": "If you would like to make a risky play and have exposure to the booming EV market, but every company seems to have either an insane market cap or a high chance of being a scam, then Canoo (GOEV) might be for you.", "selftext": "The EV industry stock's performance nowadays, shows a lot of similarities to the dot-com bubble. Everyone and their mum knows that the future is coming fast and wants a piece of the pie, but that leads to almost every publicly traded company having a crazy valuation, even fraudulent ones( I am looking at you, NKLA) . Some might argue that the insanity is even bigger, cuz the automotive industry is famous for its competitiveness and low margins. However, no one knows how long the bubble will last, especially given the fact that the adoption of EV vehicles is growing rapidly and if you have a higher risk tolerance there is still time to make a bunch of money.  My personal favourite is Canoo, a company that despite all of the hype in the space, might still be a bit undervalued if it manages to deliver and has limitless upward potential if its competitors continue to trade at such  high valuations and the EV sector continues to be the \"hot chick\" of the stock market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCanoo is a young company that was founded by former Faraday and BMW employees. They both have left the company and one of them is now supposedly being in charge of the development of the Apple car.  The current CEO is Tony Aquilla, a serial enterpreneur. Aquilla has founded and sold numerous companies and all of them were directly connected  to the automotive industry.  In short, he mostly managed companies that sold workflow software for the vehicle's collision and insurance industries, but he also used to import automotive refinishing products. Also, unlike other executives of EV companies who \"cashed out\" at IPO, he recently bought 35.3 million shares of GOEV ( at a discounted price) and he plans to buy an additional 18.3 million, having a significant part of his network tied to the company. Well, this guy definitely inspires trust. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, the CEO is good, any other reason to buy Canoo?  I think that there are many. First of all, Canoo is not just another EV company that has its exterior design as the possible main competitive advantage. They actually want to revolutionise the way that EV cars are made. The basic shape of a car hasn’t really changed over a century, with space for an engine, space for passengers, and space for luggage, all arranged in basically the same configuration. But because powerful electric motors and batteries are smaller than a standard powertrain, the whole shape of the vehicle could transform, if car designers were feeling creative. Canoo designed what it calls a “skateboard,” a thin platform that holds the battery cells, powertrain, and suspension, leaving more room for passengers with less footprint. Furthermore, they would use their \"skateboard\" as the de facto chasis for all of their models and that means faster production with less production costs. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre they gonna really make a vehicle, or what you are saying has not gotten past a powerpoint presentation? Yes, they will as soon as the end of 2022. The company plans to build  a 400-acre campus including a full commercialization facility with a workshop, general assembly plant and another low-volume industrialization facility in Oklahoma. Canoo expects the plant to employ approximately 2000 people. Furthermore, the state has commited 300 million in financial iniatives for them. They are also planning to build a research facility in Arkansas and moved their headquarters there( of course, they have made a deal with the state that guarantees them more financial iniatives) . All in all, their mission is to transform  the U.S. Route 412 corridor from Oklahoma through Arkansas into a center of electric vehicle research, development and manufacturing power. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, let's take a look at their financials. Canoo as expected is a loss-generating company as they have zero revenue. However, their \"current ratio\" is over 3, which means that there is an extremely low chance for them to have liquidity problems at least in the near term. They also have preorders that are worth 303 million and expect at least 100 million from universities and institutions in the states that they are operating in. They also upped their sales estimates and now expect to sell 30000 units in 2023.\n\nCan I make a lot of money from investing in Canoo in a short amount of time?  I never invest in companies for this reason, but nearly 40 percent of Canoo's float is shorted and if the shorts start to cover, the share price might get \"artificially\" inflated fast. There are also some near term catalysts like potential Apple and Walmart partnerships, but I won't dive deep into them, cuz they are pure speculation. There are a lot of DD' s on reddit about this topic, if you want to know more. Last but not least, Cannoo's current market cap is way lower than some of its competitors, which also have zero revenue. It is nearly 40 x lower than Lucid's and Rivian's , 2x lower than Fisker's, and 1.2x lower than Nikola's.
