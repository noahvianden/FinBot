{"title": "Tired of Robinhood selling your options one hour before close? DO THIS", "selftext": "So to all you options traders out there who use Robinhood as your main investing platform, you know how annoying it is when you get a notification that your option was sold at an average price of (insert lowball price here) and by the time you check the underlying it is +5-10%!!!! This happens pretty often because the increased volume at the end of the day. Anyway, here‚Äôs how to combat it.\n\nI had the last two trading days off and bought a TSLA call that expired same day. (Judge me all you will). It was a brutal, but 3:02pm (EST) I was given the notification that my order to sell the option was cancelled. Phone in hand, I immediately replaced the order. I noticed that RH has a system where they will re-trigger an automatic cancellation of the option every 10 min, on the 10th min. After that my order was cancelled 3:10, 3:20, 3:30, etc. I sold at 3:54.\n\nIf you are sweating the last day of your option, and still have hope, you have to place an order to sell all contracts at a price that will not execute. EX- underlying $50/share, your strike $51, place an order for $9/contract. Then, you will receive a notification your order is canceled. Now immediately replace the order, because RH will trigger a market order of the option next, but you will have time. Repeat this process until it‚Äôs time you want to sell your options, and just press ‚Äúreplace order‚Äù and quickly sell it.\n\nHope this helped somebody else, like it helped me! It was a very expensive lesson!\n\nEDIT: Yes, I know, RH has a bad reputation and I am going to be closing my account and switching to Schwab before the year is over.

{"title": "Are Covered Calls really the fastest and safest way to generate wealth long term?", "selftext": "Lets assume AAL (American Airlines) reliable stays at or above $19 a share indefinitely. If you deposit $100k into your brokerage account each year, use up every bit of margin given to you (2.3x), buy shares at $19, and sell say the 20c weekly for $20 profit without getting assigned the whole year, wouldn't that increase your portfolio 6-10x by like year 3-4 and keep increasing it with minimum risk? US Airlines, Autos, and banks are incredibly safe and the price stays fairly constant. Basically cyclical companies. This is all pre-tax. You should also be able to be able to cover half the amount of margin your using by week 30-40 or so which leaves you 5-20 weeks to build up a buffer with interest, depending on how much premium your able to collect weekly.\n\nAcknowledgement: AAL stock has been trending down for the past 5 years. It was trading for around $40-50 a share 5 years ago, pre-covid in 2019/2020 it traded around $25, and during the depths of Covid bottomed around $11 so there definitely is risk. The biggest factor being a margin call prior to the projected 30 week breakeven margin wise, or low premiums, or the stock shoots up and you get exercised and have to wait weeks for it to dip back down. I think this play might work even better for dividend stocks like KO (Coca Cola) which barely move, and should reduce the breakeven time by about 2-5 weeks depending on dividend size.

They would have to accept major losses consistently if they wanted to compete with ULA or other senior defense players at this time. Federal contracts and resupply missions are the obvious ticket to win in this industry as they are in the hundreds of millions and happen quite often. According to the current awarded Space Force contracts, a falcon heavy launch costs twice as much as a ULA (Boeing and Lockheed) launch at around $340M. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean that these rockets and their respective launch requirements are equivalent. That big number also includes upgrades to the payload fairing, launch sites and a new integration facility for reconnaissance specific missions. It‚Äôs also safe to assume that companies know that once Space X‚Äôs Falcon 9 program gets in the black, the price will be dramatically lower than anyone else‚Äôs if they don‚Äôt follow suit. So I‚Äôm sure we will see more reusable rockets from other companies being tested within the next 5 and in use within the next 10. Space X just has the obvious upper hand and they want to keep that because unlike Tesla, which has publicly published their patents and open sourced them. Space X keeps that information internal and proprietary, which basically means you have to be in the company to even have the opportunity to have the ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù. This is much safer than a patent because the typical consequence of leaking anything DoD contract related is 10 years in prison under the espionage act, not really sure what specific information you could leak out of space x that would qualify under that but it definitely reduces the risk any of spillage in the first place. \n\nTLDR: \n\nFalcon heavy contracts cost twice as much as the current competition.

{"title": "My DD on How Dutch Bros Coffee Will Be Heading to $120", "selftext": "2 Updates: Check bottom for a rumor and the amount of shares currently locked up! üëèüèº\n\nHey guys, this will be a DD report compiled of technicals, fundamentals, and random ass sentiment on why I think Dutch Bros ($BROS) will grow to become a $20 billion dollar company within 6 months. \n\nThe first starts with growth from their latest earnings report last week. Dutch Bros earned 23 cents per share. That was above FactSet estimates for six cents per share.\n\nRevenue rose 49.8% to $129.8 million, also above estimates for $125.2 million. Same-store sales gained 7.3%, above expectations for a 5% increase.\n\nDutch Bros also forecasts next quarter (Q4) revenue of between $125 million and $128 million. That was above Wall Street estimates for $121.4 million. Despite all this growth, little money was spent on advertising. Most came from word of mouth from the younger generation and their parents who drive them. Looking much further ahead, Dutch Bros plans on expanding to 4,000 stores within 10 years - an aggressive 800% increase from today. \n\nTheir decision to grow company operated stores instead of franchise is why I think their revenue growth will continue to grow exponentially. Here‚Äôs an excerpt from the 10-Q:\n\n‚ÄúCompany-operated Shop Revenue\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2021, company-operated shop revenue grew 62.9% to $108.7 million, as compared\nto $66.7 million in the corresponding prior year period or an increase of $42.0 million. Company-operated shops in the comparable shop base contributed $3.0 million to this increase (4.7% same shop sales), while new company-operated shops\nopened during 2020 and 2021 contributed $39.0 million to this increase. For purposes of calculating company-operated same\nshop revenue growth, company-operated shop revenue for 145 shops was included in the comparable shop base. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, company-operated shop revenue grew 64.7% to $289.5 million, as compared\nto $175.8 million in the corresponding prior year period or an increase of $113.8 million. Company-operated shops in the comparable shop base contributed $11.7 million to this increase (8.3% same shop sales), while new company-operated shops\nopened during 2020 and 2021 contributed $102.1 million to this increase. For purposes of calculating company-operated same\nshop revenue growth, company-operated shop revenue for 120 shops was included in the comparable shop base.‚Äù\n\nNow let‚Äôs transition into the fundamentals. Combining all of the information above with the fact that Starbucks missed on revenue for 3 out of the last 4 quarters tells us in a broader sense that the younger generation is gravitating towards Dutch Bros. It has a much different business model with no inside dining, two separate drive thru windows, outdoor dining that optimizes empty space between the building and drive thru, and you‚Äôre greeted by a ‚Äúbroista‚Äù who approaches your vehicle rather than the alternative of pulling up to a speaker. Customer service and promotions have customers coming back - but most come back simply because the coffee tastes better with more variety than competitors. Dutch Bros doesn‚Äôt have to spend money on the overhead of a larger building and their outside dining is popular among kids after school. They target rural areas similar to what Walmart did. They need the parking lot space when the lines get too long (this space they are not paying for btw). They do have a walk up window option, which I could see working in the future at airports or malls if they decided to go that route without the use of dine-in. Their app just launched within the year and already has over 2 million users. Coffee only represents 30% of their sales. This shows us how much variety their menu has, which also includes their Rebel energy drinks, whipped shakes, and muffins.\n\n[Dutch Bros 10-Q](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001866581/421f82fc-4a31-45bc-b5e1-68d50b41d667.pdf) \n\nDivide the market cap by 500 stores and you get about $20M per store. Starbucks is about $4M per store but they are a much more established company, missing revenue expectations nearly every quarter, and also have higher overhead for dine-in. $20M per store is expensive but it‚Äôs a growth company. Ask Elon if he looks at Market Cap. If you factor in the lock-up period and the shares actually available on the market rn, their market cap is actually $4B. See EDIT#2 below for more info.\n\nRevenue is about 500 million a year and that number \nwill double next year.\n\nEDIT: Rumor from a distributor in SoCal says Dutch Bros plans on building 800 new locations down in the PSW area. Meetings to be held next month. \n\nEDIT #2: According to their 10-Q, the cofounder owns 74% of class A,B,C, and D stock. He‚Äôs also under a lockup period‚Ä¶which means he can‚Äôt sell for 180 days after the IPO date. If he can‚Äôt sell, then share price will appreciate in value due to less stock in circulation. If this isn‚Äôt bullish to you, idk what is. There‚Äôs only 163M outstanding shares and most of them are locked-up!! If we can move BB 500% with 568M shares, or AMC over 2,600% with 493M shares, then we can move a stock with 163M while most of them are currently locked-up. In most cases, 80% of their shares are locked up for 180 days. This is why Palantir had their spike. This would put us at only about 66,504,000 outstanding shares in circulation currently with roughly 96,496,000 locked up until May 2022!! üöÄ \n\nTLDR: Dutch Bros could become the next Starbucks. They are attacking rural/suburban areas similar to how Wal-Mart succeeded early on. If you have visited and tasted their coffee before, you know it‚Äôs possible due to next generation‚Äôs preferences and the taste. 66.5M shares in circulation due to the lock-up could send this to the moon if WSB gets behind it. Cramer likes it so maybe we could troll him by making it a meme stock. üòÇ \n\nNot sure if anyone will actually read this but thanks for your time and let me know if you think my DD is accurate or if there are flaws.

SBUX is a fine-tuned machine with scale and they clock in around 13.5-14.0% depending on the quarter. So ... project out Revenue, take 12%-13% of that, and you've got actual earnings, not some manufactured b.s. \"Adjusted\" nonsense like \"Earnings excluding a bunch of our actual expenses\".  Then slap a P/E multiple on it that yields your targeted ROIC, and you've got a price target. For example, if you target $600M Revenue in 2022, then project 30% growth (25% unit store growth + 5% same store sales), you arrive at roughly $1B Rev in 2024, with normalized earnings power of roughly $125M. If you think that deserves a 30 multiple, then you target a $3.75B market cap in 2024, which, assuming they don't issue a ton of new shares for their comp program, nets a share price of roughly $75/shr in 2024.  If you think a 35 multiple is justified, then that bumps to $4.375B cap and $87/shr.  A 40 multiple yields $5B and $100/shr in 2024.  Discount based on the return you require, and that tells you what your buy price today is.  If you thought 30 was the right multiple, and you demanded a 15% annual ROIC, then your current buy price would be ‚âà $50/shr.  If you think the market will award it a 35x multiple, on a required 15% ROIC, your buy price would be ‚âà $57.  In other words, if you're buying at the current price, it's one of three things: either you believe the company is lying and will grow much faster than they have guided, you believe the market will be handing out premium multiples in 2024, or you're willing to accept a very small return on your risk capital.

Go back and see how McDonalds, Yum!

Especially with businesses that are not yet mature, it's useful to find similar businesses that have reached at least midlife, so you can see what normalized earning power and cash flow look like. Typically very young businesses are much harder to value b/c the traditional metrics are wonky. If you're non profitable yet, no P/E. Debt/Equity and most other traditional benchmark measures are useless, except for relative comparison.

Their goal is to absorb liability risk and isolate software liability (by paying off litigants) until the other insurance companies achieve FOMO about missing out on that market (spoiler alert:  insurance companies aren't going to trust risk data from a single company).
