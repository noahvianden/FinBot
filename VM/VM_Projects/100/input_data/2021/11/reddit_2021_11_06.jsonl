{"title": "$BGFV - The Ultimate Dark Horse that hedge funds don't want you to know about", "selftext": "^(This post is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment or trade advice. Please do your own research and due diligence.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ke5o58svv2y71.png?width=483&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a5a375f8872aa6c6cfacd81f10f70fa873aa30f\n\n# Part 1: The Squeeze\n\n1,255% of BGFV's 30 day average volume was traded yesterday. The price moved up 10 points and gave it all back at the end of the day, and this all happened without a short squeeze triggering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2ssm851fvx71.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bc94e78d997c37d0defc71287d163e43d558a46\n\nHow do I know? See for yourself [here](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/bgfv). iBorrowDesk updates every 15 minutes with the amount of shares available at a leading prime brokerage along with data on the cost to borrow. Had there been a squeeze (like there had been in September 1), we would have seen shares avail to borrow diminish to near zero, cost to borrow spike up dramatically simultaneously, and then an inverse reaction following it; freeing up shares to borrow and returning cost to borrow\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjma34h2fvx71.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bae54653a3ebe35120b2404f63a4e6576183c85\n\n# Part 2: The Dividend Catalyst\n\nYou may be wondering, what the fuck happened on September 9 to raise the price from $20 to $30? Here's the same graph, cross referencing the close, short interest % of float, and special events.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n9y9rr83fvx71.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0319cbdd0b732013a4d5b0dba57d9c7f3e0a681\n\nThat's right, a measly 25 cent dividend was the catalyst that spiked cost to borrow, drained shares avail to short, and spike the price of the stock 50% in one week. That all happened on September 9, and at that time, the short interest available at that time was less than 40%. Did some shorts cover? Sure. Did all of them cover? [No](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=bgfv).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4w6hft44fvx71.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=d21cc74e22d73947e844576be985f01a674e566b\n\nSince then, the amount of shares short and outstanding has ballooned to almost 8.5m, or 43.09% of the public float, and [the board of BGFV have announced a special dividend of $1.00 on record date 11/17 and a regular dividend of $0.25 on record date 12/01.](https://www.big5sportinggoods.com/store/company/investorrelations)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ipuq63z4fvx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=c334555400a7eb789f7ce0d5c465bb3f4f499c49\n\nWith a tiny public float of around 20m shares, Shares avail to borrow diminishing, cost to borrow rising, utilization rising, days to cover falling, while short interest staying the same,[it's certain the dividend is the catalyst needed to instigate a squeeze.](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042215/if-investor-short-dividendpaying-stock-record-date-are-they-entitled-dividend.asp)\n\n[Case in point: RKT when they declared a $1.11 dividend when the stock wash shorted over 30%](https://imgur.com/a/3y9bnxX)\n\n# Part 3: The Delta Squeeze\n\nNow here is where things get interesting. The $1 dividend's record date was placed on a peculiar day, on the same week as when November's option expiration expire- November 19. Hedge funds and dark pools bearish on stocks will normally do naked short call options. Hedging does not occur if the stock is far away from the strike as it is now, but they will be forced to hedge if the stock gets closer to becoming in the money and closer to expiration.\n\nLook at the current open interest on the strikes $30, $35, $40, $45 compared to the open interest currently on in the money call options. That's more than 25,000 call options out of the money that's not hedged, and less than 4,000 call options in the money that are most likely hedged. **That unhedged portion accounts for 2.5m shares, or 12.7% of total public float**. As the previous 2 catalysts line up and take their shots, assuming it's enough to break through those strikes to go in the money, this presents a huge risk for dark pools as a massive delta ramp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ko3pxam6fvx71.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=d62b6c33af8649d4ca1df1e67c5578a9fc3b9e9f\n\n# Part 4: The Gamma Squeeze\n\nAdd more salt to the dark pool's wounds, take a look now at BGFV's implied volatility. It's currently less than 140%. This compared to other memeshit is considered low all things considered (short squeeze, catalyst, delta squeeze). This presents the impending gamma squeeze, where volatility will also act to force dark pools to hedge their short positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qnq14c7fvx71.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1d7da3c7715e171ee98dc72f267db20fc5a370a\n\n# Part 5 (NEW): The CTB Burn\n\nWell look what happened today (11/05) after hours. Cost to borrow went up. It has maintained an average of 2% as a baseline for months and [has popped 8% up to 10.2%.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/bgfv) When the CTB was at 2%, margin rates exceeded the cost to short, so it wasn't a factor. With the rate now at 10%, it's now another catalyst short sellers will need to deal with. 10% is by no means high, but the fact it has started to rise is telling that the squeeze has begun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5p6sfud8fvx71.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=d145bb35b9e186bd441e399b4a5f7467f0060b50\n\nNow let's add these variables together.\n\n* If a 40% price movement yesterday was possible without a short squeeze, what would the price movement be if a short squeeze were to actually occur?\n* If a $0.25 dividend catalyst and 40% short interest had the ability to spike the stock up 50% (233m total), what can a $1.25 dividend catalyst and 43% short interest do?\n* What would a Delta Squeeze do?\n* What would a gamma squeeze do?\n* How will shorts manage to hold their positions when cost to borrow rises and avoid getting margin called by the risk of undefined losses?\n\nDo I have your attention?\n\nTL;DR: BGFV actually stands for big fucking value, or 5 billies club\n\nThere are other reasons what makes BGFV an attractive play, mainly because of fundamentals (It's not some overhyped pennyshit spac that's losing money on an operating basis; it's a 66 year old company that makes money and pays dividends and is genuinely undervalued compared to peers), you can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qm7t59/bgfv_a_fundamentally_undervalued_technically/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l78lh9vbfvx71.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ca6c8ae3af89e91b3954d290f47b1868028a909\n\nPositions:\n\n1500 shares\n\n13 long calls\n\n2 short puts\n\nTotal delta: 2611 (Extremely bullish)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bkh7v2gefvx71.png?width=2350&format=png&auto=webp&s=f25a54002f56a04cd21cd4c9d587ce910d800e36\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit/ for anyone looking for a fundamental price floor for a fair exit strategy\n\nPrice is trading at around 31. Management has 2021 EPS guidance set at $4.36 - $4.51 EPS.\n\n31 / 4.43 = 6.99 Forward PE ratio\n\nWalmart's PE ratio: 23.72\n\nDKS PE Ratio: 10.81\n\nASO PE Ratio: 8.3\n\nGME PE Ratio: - 806.81\n\nS&P 500 PE ratio: 29.59\n\nFor BGFV to be on the same level of its peers, multiply the target PE ratio by BGFV's forward EPS (4.43)\n\nBelow are the results if BGFV were valued the same as:\n\nWalmart: $105.08\n\nDicks Sporting Goods: $47.89\n\nAcademy Sports: $36.78\n\nGamestop:  $3,638.71 (Impossible to actually calculate because GME has a negative EPS)\n\nS&P 500: $131.08\n\nThis  is only using PE ratio though. If you look at BGFV's other fundamental  metrics, such as dividend yield, cash on hand, current ratio,  profitability, operating effectiveness, financial stability/strength,  you will soon realize that BGFV is all strongly favorable. You also have  to take into account that ASO may also be undervalued, SPY may be  overvalued etc. Also DKS and ASO don't have 43% of it's float shorted.\n\nDon't take my word for it though; you're encouraged to do your own independent research and verify this all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVideo Essay:\n\n[https://youtu.be/5v\\_CBJdEB2w](https://youtu.be/5v_CBJdEB2w)", "id": "qnoteq", "created_utc": 1636159140.0, "score": 334, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 109, "comments": [{"body": "Join the r/smallstreetbets official Discord here - https://discord.gg/E27dUNUwfx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Amazon stock crashed more than 90% after the dotcom bubble...", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">Why the downvotes?\n\nBecause people don’t know their history. Amazon got slammed during the mid-2000s. It peaked at $55 in September of 03’ and slowly tumbled to $26 in June of 06’. Nearly three straight years of losses for investors. Anyone who had the balls to hold through this period and into the future made out very very well, but you’d be hard pressed to find them. The truth is that Amazon wasn’t a particularly worthy investment at that time. They were little more than an online book and media store and didn’t have a particularly great balance sheet. They weren’t worth the $55 they traded for in 03’. They were hyped to an unrealistic share price and investors eventually wised-up. It was the expansion of AWS in 06’ coupled with the start of Amazon Fulfillment around the same time that propelled it to success. Not coincidentally, it wasn’t long after that Amazon’s value began to take off and hasn’t stopped since. \n\nIt took expansion into a completely unrelated space for Amazon to become what it is today. No one would have predicted in 03’ that Amazon would become a cloud computing superpower. No one even knew what “the cloud” was. Tesla faces a very similar situation. They command an incomprehensible valuation that simply cannot be justified by anything they are currently doing. Even if they are wildly successful in their current ventures, the valuation still does not make sense. It will take an expansion into something entirely unseen for them to justify their price. In the meantime, it is entirely possible that they could see the same kind of pullback that Amazon did in the mid-2000’s. \n\nI’m not saying Tesla is a bad investment, but I’m not saying it’s a good one either. It’s a very risky investment with a long-term payoff that’s predicated on Musk doing something that no one has thought of yet. Just as Amazon was in 03’.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "What you are describing with Amazon is that they had underappreciated poorly understood technology that had extraordinary capabilities.

They were still largely an e-retailer, but they were getting really good at it. By that time, they decided they were going to do more than just books and CDs. They wanted to sell everything. They realized that product diversity was important to boost traffic and that allowing 3rd party sellers was a far cheaper way to do that. They decided that logistics was going to be a core-competency - something that would become very important later. They adopted some of Costco’s core business strategies. In particular they realized that offering ultra-competitive prices drove traffic and traffic drove additional sellers, which boosted product diversity, which drove more traffic, which significantly offset fixed costs. At this point, they were only just starting to tinker with algorithmic product recommendations, which were previously made by actual people. Like I said, they were getting really good at, basically, taking a Costco and putting it on the internet. But they weren’t doing much more than that. They weren’t really doing much that brick and mortar stores weren’t already doing, they were just doing it on the internet. And that was what drove a lot of the hype; the fact that it was on the internet. People’s expectations of what the internet could do where out-sizing reality. \n\nBy 03’, they’re doing well, but they aren’t living up to their valuation - which wasn’t reasonable in the first place - and investors were growing increasingly worried about competition. The stock tumbled for three years. \n\nIt wasn’t that people didn’t understand the business or the technology, it simply didn’t exist yet. The real shift didn’t start until 05’-06’. This was a monumental period for Amazon and marks a really pivotal moment for the business where they transition from an online version of a brick and mortar business to something completely different. In this period, they introduce Amazon Prime with free two-day shipping. This is a continuation of their lessons learned from Costco and the idea that they can eat costs on the front end and make up for it with higher traffic volumes and product diversity. This boosts their existing e-commerce business. They also introduced Amazon Fulfillment, which is effectively a logistics-as-a-service business, and AWS Elastic Compute, S3, and RDS, all of which are hardware/software-as-a-service platforms. This demarcation in 2006 marks the point where Amazon pivoted from being an e-commerce business to being a service oriented tech company. They took all of the things they developed to run their own business and started selling them to everyone else. This is the Amazon we know today. \n\nIt’s an often promulgated myth that Amazon was this hidden gem that people just didn’t understand. That isn’t at all true.

Posted a summary of why I'm bullish elsewhere but I'll paste it here:\n\nI like picking companies that operate in trends with a long growth runway ahead of them. $TTCF operates in the plant-based food tailwind/trend. \"The plant-based food market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.9% from 2020 to 2027 to reach $74.2 billion by 2027.\" Growth is being predominantly driven by millennial and Gen Z age groups combined with the need for sustainable alternatives to meat give this trend staying power for years to come.\n\nI think there are quite a few companies that will benefit from this trend but why do I think $TTCF is the best play? A few factors \n\n1. the company is vertically integrated. They design, grow, and manufacturer all of their products themselves which helps them bring products from idea to market much quicker (~1 month) than their competitors and helps insulate them from cost increases on produce. \n\n2. Full-year revenue guidance for 2021 will see revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million. This would at minimum be a near 60% year-over-year increase from fiscal 2020. \n\n3. Their absolutely insane store expansion. At the end of 2020 their branded products were in nearly 4,300 stores and had 23,000 points of distribution. From last earnings transcript \"We have grown this to 8,355 stores at the end of Q2 with 48,070 points of distribution exceeding our previous projections. As you may also recall, our guidance for the full year was 10,000 stores with 65,000 points of distribution. With the additional retailer commitments our sales team has secured, which I will cover in a few moments, I'm proud to announce that by the end of the third quarter, we'll be in over 12,000 stores with 79,402 points of distribution.” \n\n4. Their frozen product launch in Target was the best ever debut (in terms of sales) of a frozen product in Target ever. Like, in the history of Target. Target has gone from having 2 sku's on their shelves to now carrying 25 sku's in less than a year.\n\n5. Acquired foods of New Mexico for $37 mil which, besides giving them more manufacturing capacity, will assist in their expansion out of just frozen foods into ambient dried goods and snacks. CEO expects this acquisition to yield $200 million in annual revenue by 2023/2024. They also recently acquired Belmont Confections in an $18 mil deal which the CEO expects to return another $100 mil in annual revenue in the next 2 to 3 years. These acquisitions assist with their push into ambient products to add to their refrigerated skus.\n\nThe company has beat their own revenue guidance which they listed on their investor slides upon being taken public via SPAC which had them projected at $1 billion in revenue in 2026. I foresee them being well over that revenue target based on the current growth trend.\n\nThere are, of course, risks. As there were with Amazon, Tesla, Apple, etc. in the early days. $TTCF is currently experiencing supply chain headwinds which is cutting into profit margin. I'm expecting this next earnings to not be ideal for that reason. There are a ton of competitors in the space - Amy's, Sweet Earth, etc. A good portion of their sales come through the Walmart & Sam's club channel which compresses margins, although this has been decreasing over time as a percent of total sales volume. And some others.\n\nDespite all this the company leadership and history in the food industry, massive store expansion, intelligent/accretive acquisitions, positive reviews from consumers, and ability to rapidly innovate new skus and come to market quickly due to their vertical integration are why I'm bullish.

{"title": "Roku on a discount. It’s not a covid stock. I am long term bullish an here is why", "selftext": "This is a quick overview of [$ROKU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24ROKU&src=cashtag_click) and will cover why I am bullish on the stock and why I think it has the potential to be a 5X multi-bagger (or even beyond that) over the next 3-5 years (even at a current market cap of 60b$). ...(continued in this thread)\n\nRoku themselves isn’t a big threat to Netflix [$NFLX](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24NFLX&src=cashtag_click) or Disney, [$DIS](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24DIS&src=cashtag_click) at least for now. Roku does produce some small series, but they don’t compete directly with other streaming services. In fact, they compete with a totally different group of companies.\n\nThey compete with other operating systems for TVs like AppleTV, ChromeOS, FireTV. ROKU is a unique Platform/OS just focused on TVs. Own the platform, and you control everything.\n\nThink of them as an advertising platform like Facebook or YouTube but with the power of AppleOS and the App Store.\n\nThink about where most ad revenue is placed. Normally Facebook & Google capture most of the Revenue. However, things got more difficult since advertisers must deal with the new Apple privacy regulations when the ad is placed within the Apple ecosystem.\n\nHere Roku presents its unique possibility for massive adoption among advertisers. Roku offers a unique OS for TVs enabling Roku to sell targeted, personalized ads to advertisers.\n\nPrimarily Roku makes money on their displayed ads, which are shown on their 20,000 Roku Channels. Developers can create channels on Roku for free, making it easy to grow to the number of channels available. Once a channel gets enough traction, it will be monetized.\n\nSecondly, Roku knows their customers and enables a more unique possibility for advertisers to show personalized targeted ads, compared to traditional TV where the customer is mostly unknown.\n\nThirdly, Roku gets a cut on every subscription placed over the RokuOS. Just like Apple gets a cut from every app you pay for… Own the platform, and you control everything.\n\nRoku recently acquired Quibi for a fraction of a price. Roku paid less than $100 million for global rights to 75-plus Quibi shows. It’s a super successful acquisition for Roku, having a wide library and a unique selling point. You can watch those shows for free by the way.\n\nHow fast is Roku growing? The annual percent growth rate of Roku users grew from Q1 2017 to Q1 2021 is at an impressive rate of 92.48% per year. (Source Statista ) \n\nThe Worldwide, demand for free TV content is massive. [$ROKU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24ROKU&src=cashtag_click) is aggressively expanding internationally and is being integrated into more TV's globally as we speak. Roku captures a unique opportunity for the global go-to Operating System on TVs.\n\nAs the No. 1 TV streaming platform in the U.S. (based on hours streamed) I am excited about the road ahead. I feel [$ROKU](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24ROKU&src=cashtag_click) has a bright future ahead, given the enormous opportunity it unfolds as the go-to OS for TVs.\n\nThis is not financial advice, please do your own due diligence.

The hardware itself is probably zero sum if not a loss leader.  \n\nThe problem is most people dont use the Roku the way you describe (the free chans). My family has a ton of Rokus and no one uses their channels. The primary use for Roku's is access to the big streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, Prime and Plex. Roku doesnt make a penny from any of those unless you do the sub right there in the Roku but most dont do that. Most will sub on their phone or their computer and most have had their sub for years before they got a Roku. The Roku was purchased as a convenience after the fact.\n\nThe ad thing wont work with the major streaming apps like the ones mentioned above. They simply will pull their app from Roku if they even tried it because it would be disastrous for their user experience. None of them will allow it. \n\nI would also venture that Google will pull any YouTube channel from Roku as well if they started putting ads on youtube content which is probably 50% of your Roku channels (and I am probably being conservative with 50%)... I suppose Twitch has also made a lot of headway but you will run into the same issue with them (Amazon).\n\nYou state that Roku lets you make a chan for free, but you forget to mention that Roku is not a streaming host. You still need to host your content somewhere and that somewhere will either cost money or will have rules (like Youtube and Twitch) that Roku cannot bypass. What needs to happen is Roku needs to create a internet hosing site like the aforementioned two to compete for content. But this will not be cheap. Hosting for that kind of traffic is expensive.\n\nAnyway, like I said. I love my Roku but I am not an investor for a reason.

I don't see them even existing in 10 years.\n\nYour post seems to center on two points: TV OS and content.\n\nSo to the first point, how good of an OS is it that guarantees people will not just override it? I know a couple of people that own Roku TVs, they immediately switch to HDMI1 and then use their Fire from there. The actual TV remote is nowhere to be seen. The TV being a Roku is actually a nuisance.\n\nSo, first question, what does Roku offer me to justify not using the Fire TV over it? \n\nSecond, content. How much quality content do they actually have that would make me use a Roku? I know of no content that would make me even be curious of getting a Roku. This might be because 1) there is none, or 2) they don't advertise properly. Both are bad for Roku\n\nThird, let's say there is indeed some interesting content. What's their retention strategy? They don't produce the content themselves, they leech off advertising on other people's content. How difficult have they made it, for example, for YouTube or Twitch simply to poach that content offering better deals?\n\nFourth, they are vulnerable to the actual big content providers. What if Amazon/Disney just don't provide the Roku App anymore? What if they want Roku to take a smaller cut OR ELSE? They are in no position to negotiate, ever. They bring almost nothing to the table, while for a user it is trivial to override them and, next time, buy a non Roku device. And whatever they DO bring to the table (if anything) it would be almost trivial for Amazon or Google to replicate on their end.\nIn some ways you could say this is also true for Apple TV, Amazon Fire etc. They also can be extorted to having their content out of a competing platform. Big difference: for neither Amazon or Apple is the streaming platform their only source of revenue.\n\nYou say \"Own the platform and you own everything\" ... Well no, unless they prevent me from plugging a HDMI stick in. And if they ever do that, they are obviously dead. Hell, I have a couple gamer friends that never get the TV off the PS5 and that platform already offers everything. Roku has absolutely no moat, not even in their own devices.\n\nNew user acquisition : where do they come from? If my TV breaks down and I already have an OS stick, any TV is good for me.
