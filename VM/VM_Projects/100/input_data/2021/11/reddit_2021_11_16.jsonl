JPM then unilaterally decided these defaulted and exercised early termination of the warrants. \n\nJPM then went to the open market to purchase 228,775 shares @ $709 to close out its corresponding short hedge position and are seeking this amount back (228,775 x $709 = $162.2 mil). The basis of claim is that the loss is an early termination amount (defined as covering losses incurred as a result of the termination, including related hedges), which JPM alleges is owed under the contract. \n\nThis isn't something as simple as defaulting on a loan and it's going to come down to a number of different issues. While the tweets do come into play, they are not the basis of the claim. \n\nI think it's very likely they will end up settling out of court for an undisclosed sum.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Right, those numbers are \"the calculation.\"\n\nThey JP Morgan says Tesla has not disagreed with the adjustments, they've just made general statements about disliking that adjustments happened, followed by defaulting. Did they raise specific, detailed concerns with the adjustments? No. And they can't. Their contract says that by announcing the offer to go private, they must accept the adjustments by the Calculating Agent. They even complained that the adjustments were swift! How absurd. The contract says the adjustments are to be made ***on or after*** the date of the related event. As they point out in the complaint, they could have done the adjustment on the same day and it would have benefited them even more than waiting the week that they did, in fact, wait.\n\nAnd the biggest adjustment is from the split, which Tesla can't argue against at all. That is totally mechanical.\n\nThey can't just whine about the market volatility benefiting JP Morgan and hurting themselves. It was in their contract that that would happen, and the market volatility was needlessly manufactured by Elon Musk, an act that he paid a $20m fine to resolve.\n\nI doubt they'll settle for an undisclosed sum, I think JP Morgan not only wants the money, they want future parties to know they enforce their contracts. I think they'll tell Tesla, just pay up and it goes away. Otherwise, they win a motion for summary judgement and get the full amount, because there don't appear to be any disputable facts to argue over, as the SEC action already determined many of the facts. Note that the contract sticks Tesla with JP Morgan's entire legal fees. So why do they need to settle?\n\nBecause of the way the contract was written, with JP Morgan as the Calculating Agent, with sole authority to make the calculations, if Tesla though wanted to dispute the amount in court they needed to pay it, and then sue to get it back.

The application of Metaverse based platforms is immense and beyond gaming and virtually every aspect of our lives. Here are some of the potential companies to benefit from:\n\n1. Unity Software: Virtually all applications will be developed either on Unity or Unreal Engine.\n\n2. Autodesk: They own 3D Max and Maya which again might be used to develop VR/AR applications. Plus they have various Building Information Modelling tools like Revit and Navisworks which might be useful in creating Metaverse beyond gaming.\n\n3. Matterport: 3D scanning \n\n4. Trimble: Again they have Sketchup and various 3D scanning tools\n\n5. Shopify and Amazon: They might be the first ones to create virtual stores.\n\n6.

It's a tiny screen, and you have to stare at it. The interface of swiping etc are limited, and typing on it sucks.

For non-stationary experiences, VR requires a large clear area to enjoy, which most people don't have space for. Otherwise your options are:\n\n1. Use a control stick to move around, which feels more like the world is moving around you than you moving in the world. Very disorienting and causes motion sickness for many.\n\n2. Use \"teleport\" to move, which honestly limits the experience and hurts immersion as you are constantly reminded that you are using artificial controls to move.\n\nAll of the workarounds I've seen like Omni treadmills are janky and expensive.\n\nAlso, once the novelty wears off, VR doesn't really feel like a virtual world. It feels like you're looking through binoculars into a 3D display. But audio and visual are the only senses it addresses.

Near zero interest rates means companies can borrow money for less, consumers can as well, and there’s generally more money in the system (ie higher corporate earnings as a result). Additionally abs most importantly, QE drastically diminishes bond yields. With inflation being high and yields being low, it doesn’t make much sense to buy bonds as the real rate of return is negative when adjusted for inflation.

At the time, to make a car that was high volume and relatively affordable, there just wasn't anywhere to get the batteries at scale to make it work. Legacy automakers could buy small volumes of expensive batteries and subsidize their losses with their legacy business. But to make a profitable, high volume, EV Tesla needed more batteries than they could possibly buy.\n\nAnd no battery company was willing to make the investment in a huge new battery factory by themselves, just to supply one \"niche\" EV maker in california. Especially since no other automakers seemed interested in making EVs in high volume.\n\nSo, Telsa built the battery factory, and leased the cell manufacturing area to Panasonic, with an agreement to buy 100% of their production. But that factory could really only make packs for the new Model 3, so they needed to get the Model 3 lines ramped up in Freemont to absorb that production. But they also needed to make sure that Gigafactory 1 ramped up to produce enough packs for the Model 3 lines. Both of those things were huge investments, with lots of fixed cost, operation costs, depreciation, etc.\n\nIf there was a delay in either one that was too long, it could've easily bankrupted the company. And there were delays, and it really pushed Tesla to the limits of the capital they had on hand to keep things running.\n\nThese days, everyone wants to make EVs, everyone's begging for batteries, lots of companies are investing in their own battery factories or making deals with battery companies. And there's lots of companies just planning to expand production with the assumption that there'll be demand for it.\n\nAll these new EV startups have things *much* easier. They're not going to face that risky chicken/egg problem because every big battery company on Earth is scaling production because they know they can always sell any extra to Tesla.

They can just raise billions on a whim like Tesla the last year, but they are not even like tesla 10 years ago.

HOWEVER, scaling M3 would have been MUUCH more expensive because they would have run longer with existing errors before they had to fix them. Now, Tesla is forged in vulcano fire like no other company was. The efficiency and scalability of Tesla is BECAUSE they almost went bankrupt and BECAUSE they had to get this efficient in order to survive. None of the other new entrances have that problem. They dont have an elon musk and they are not driven by shear will power to unbelievable execution efficiency.\n\nThe newcomers are patted in sugar by investors that are looking for the new Tesla because they missed the train.

There's lots of investors that wish they would've bought Tesla at any point in the last 10 years, or maybe even wish they hadn't lost all that money shorting Tesla. And now they're just hoping on the next big thing. Which just shows that they don't understand the fundamentals that are, and have been, driving Telsa's valuation. And they still think EVs are something \"anyone can do\".\n\nEven if things are much easier now, and it's possible for new EV companies to ramp up twice as fast as Tesla (which I believe was/is the fastest growing auto company of all time? Even outpacing Ford when it launched the Model T), that would still leave a pretty big runway to get to 87 billion valuation like Lucid has right now. Tesla didn't hit that kind of market cap, until late 2019/early 2020, about 12 years after they delivered their first car. So I could see that kind of valuation if Lucid can cut that in half, get to some kind of volume deliveries, and profitability, within 6 years?\n\nI mean, I can see the writing on the wall. Petrol cars are going away, we're going to be at the point where a majority of all new cars are EVs much sooner than most people expect. And having a startup that's making and delivering anything puts them way ahead of competitors. Arguably even ahead of legacy automakers.

The beanbag chairs lay empty. The kitchen whiteboard, above where the keg used to live, displayed in fading marker “Beers on Tap” from a happy hour in March 2020.\r  \n\r  \nBut on a recent weekday, over in the common area was a sign of life — fresh bagels.\r  \n\r  \nAs employees at the financial technology start-up CommonBond got Covid vaccines, and grew stir-crazy in their apartments, they started trickling back into the office.\r  \n\r  \n“We call it Work From Work Wednesday,” said Keryn Koch, who runs human resources at the company, which has 15,000 square feet of sunlit SoHo real estate.\r  \n\r  \nAt one point, autumn had been billed across corporate America as the Great Office Reopening. The Delta variant intervened, and mandatory return-to-office plans turned optional. Still, many people chose to report back to their desks: The share of employed people who worked remotely at some point during the month because of Covid, which had peaked in May 2020 at 35 percent, dropped in October to 11 percent, the lowest point since the pandemic began, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A closer look at the New York work force, from a November survey of 188 major employers, showed that 8 percent of Manhattan office workers are back in the office full time, 54 percent are fully remote and everyone else — nearly 40 percent — is hybrid.\r  \n\r  \nFew are finding it a smooth transition period. Some companies used their tentative R.T.O. dates as an unwitting excuse to avoid questions about how to balance the needs of their remote and in-person employees, according to Edward Sullivan, an executive coach. That has resulted in a mushy middle ground: video calls where remote workers have trouble hearing, a sense that people at home are missing out on perks (teammates), while those in the office are, too (pajamas). And the stakes aren’t just who is getting talked over in meetings. It’s whether flexibility is sustainable, even with all the benefits it confers.\r  \n\r  \n“We’re going to see a lot of companies get this wrong,” said Chris Herd, an entrepreneur and expert on hybrid work.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nImage\r  \n“Work From Work Wednesday” at CommonBond, a student loan start-up with 105 people on staff.\r  \n“Work From Work Wednesday” at CommonBond, a student loan start-up with 105 people on staff.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times\r  \nRecently Brett Hautop, head of workplace at LinkedIn, sat in a conference room listening to a pitch from a global vendor. The firm wanted to sell its services to LinkedIn to help facilitate effective hybrid work. But the people making that pitch had turned their back to the video camera, so the LinkedIn employees joining by videoconference couldn’t see them.\r  \n\r  \n“As they’re talking about how hard it is for people who are remote to keep up with conversations, they’re covering the camera,” Mr. Hautop said, adding: “People on my team were pinging me saying, ‘I can’t believe they’re doing this.’ And I was apologizing, saying, ‘Hey, guys, I’m sorry this is happening, they’re apparently not aware.’”", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Last summer, LinkedIn told its 16,000 employees worldwide that its return-to-office plan announced in October 2020 had been scrapped, and that individual departments would decide where their people could work, becoming one of more than 60 major companies that have promised some permanent form of flexibility. Mr. Hautop and his team took stock of the difficulties bred by that approach. They upgraded audiovisual equipment in conference rooms and considered distributing ring lights to in-person workers at their desks so their faces wouldn’t be awkwardly lit on calls. They planned “on-site off-sites,” so employees could remember what it was they loved about the office.\r  \n\r  \nDaily business updates  The latest coverage of business, markets and the economy, sent by email each weekday. Get it sent to your inbox.\r  \n“Hybrid is most definitely tougher than completely in person or completely remote,” Mr. Hautop said. “It takes a lot more forethought, and none of us, or anybody else at any company, has figured out exactly how it’s going to work.”\r  \n\r  \nIf hybrid is a challenge for even the people of LinkedIn — the gurus of connectivity, the maestros of professional networking — where’s the hope for everyone else?\r  \n\r  \nAsana, which makes collaboration software, recently gathered its executives for a discussion planning for the office’s official reopening. Half the participants were at the San Francisco headquarters, and the other half joined by videoconference. The remote workers, including the company’s chief executive, started to lose patience as people in the room talked over one another and made side comments.\r  \n\r  \n“We were joking that if we didn’t like what somebody was saying on the screen, we could just mute them,” said Anna Binder, the company’s head of people.\r  \n\r  \nBusiness & Economy: Latest Updates\r  \nUpdated \r  \nNov. 16, 2021, 9:00 a.m. ET31 minutes ago\r  \n31 minutes ago\r  \nMarket watchers say that companies are citing supply chain issues as an excuse for other problems.\r  \nGermany suspends approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, sending gas prices soaring.\r  \nRetail sales jumped in October in a third straight month of gains.\r  \n“We all had such a terrible experience that we made a decision at the end of that meeting that all executive meetings going forward will be in person,” she continued. “Or they will be fully remote.

Many executives said employees with care-taking responsibilities were more likely to work remotely when given the option. A survey from the jobs platform FlexJobs found that 68 percent of women preferred their jobs to stay remote long term, compared with 57 percent of men. Another study, from Qualtrics and theBoardlist, found that 34 percent of men with children had received promotions while working remotely, compared with just 9 percent of women with children.\r  \n\r  \n“If you give people full choice about what they do and where they work,” Ms. Binder said, “women are more likely to take advantage of that work-from-home flexibility. Which means they, in turn, are going to be less in the room where it happens.”\r  \n\r  \nIt’s not hard to imagine all of the ways remote workers might be undercut: muted in a heated discussion, shut out of lunchtime bonding. But Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford professor who has surveyed hundreds of hybrid companies, said that at many workplaces the in-person employees felt just as neglected.\r  \n\r  \n“It’s the American-in-Europe rule,” Mr. Bloom said. “When an American is traveling abroad, you look around the room and everyone is speaking English for your benefit. If there’s one person working from home, everyone in the office dials into the meeting.”\r  \n\r  \nThat’s the case at Zillow, the real estate website currently facing a wave of losses and layoffs, where a quarter of people are hybrid workers and nearly two-thirds are working fully remote. The company’s “One Zoom All Zoom” rule stipulates that if even one person is participating in a meeting virtually, everyone in the office is required to join on separate laptops. Zillow went so far as to take audiovisual equipment off the conference room walls.\r  \n\r  \nThe Zoom rule is in keeping with Zillow’s broad attitude toward remote work, which has included an announcement that its headquarters moved from Seattle to the cloud.\r  \n\r  \n“I go into the office every day,” said Meghan Reibstein, vice president for product management and flexible work, who moved to Asheville, N.C., during the pandemic. “It just happens to be in the attic of my house.”", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Image\r  \nMany companies used tentative R.T.O. dates as an excuse to dodge questions about whether to prioritize remote or in-person workers.\r  \nMany companies used tentative R.T.O. dates as an excuse to dodge questions about whether to prioritize remote or in-person workers.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times\r  \n\r  \nImage\r  \nExperts helping companies navigate this period are hopeful that the pains of hybrid work aren’t permanent.\r  \nExperts helping companies navigate this period are hopeful that the pains of hybrid work aren’t permanent.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times\r  \n\r  \nImage\r  \nA dying plant at CommonBond’s SoHo office.\r  \nA dying plant at CommonBond’s SoHo office.Credit...Jeenah Moon for The New York Times\r  \nBut when the attic becomes the office, and the office becomes a site for weekly bagels and banter, executives are left to answer: What’s the point of paying rent? For many employers, luxe spaces occupied by just a handful of office stalwarts have come to stand as reminders of the real costs associated with the ambiguity of hybrid work.\r  \n\r  \nCourt Cunningham felt that sense of unease recently as he toured New York buildings to lease a new office for his online home-buying company, Orchard: If just 15 percent of his employees were working from the office, was the rent worth 2 percent of revenue? He went back and forth. Then he signed a new lease in October, making a bet on some future where people will want to be in the office.\r  \n\r  \n“In two years this is either going to be a genius move where we locked in a long-term rate in the depths of Covid, or the world is going to go completely remote and we’re going to have this millstone hanging on us,” Mr. Cunningham said.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, the experts helping companies navigate this period are hopeful that the pains of hybrid work aren’t permanent. Or at least that they might be manageable: Some advise their clients to be explicit with their staff about whether to prioritize the needs of office workers or remote ones, especially when it comes to facilitating meetings.\r  \n\r  \n“Back in Vietnam the prisoners of war who accepted that they had no idea when they would be saved were the ones who survived,” said Mr. Sullivan, chief executive of the coaching firm Velocity Group, reaching for a reference — what’s known as the Stockdale Paradox — far from the circumstances of the office water cooler. “The companies that accepted that this is going to be difficult and communicated that clearly to their teams, they’re going to thrive. There’s no more hoping for Christmas, hoping for Easter. Let’s just accept that this will be hard.”\r  \n\r  \nAnd after acceptance comes decision-making. So Asana chose to label itself “office-centric hybrid,” with bosses articulating that at some point most people will be expected back at their desks. CommonBond calls itself “remote first,” with its chief executive farther from the Manhattan office than the junior workers who come in on Wednesdays. (“Our center of gravity is the Zoomisphere,” said David Klein, the C.E.O.) Both companies rejected the choose-your-own-adventure approach, where people have no sense of where their managers want them to be.\r  \n\r  \n“Imagine people could choose whether they drive on the left side of the road or the right side,” said Mr. Bloom, the Stanford professor. “There’d be accidents all the time.

And it's something that will probably be absolutely necessary as things get more and more automated.\n\nBeing able to specialize in something and trade is amazing. But if we take that idea too far without putting in any kind of controls, then we end up with a system where you need to earn a decent amount just to survive (ie. not starve or freeze to death on the street) and without some basic progressive policies there'll be some part of the population that can't earn enough. There'll certainly be a part of the population that can't earn enough to live a life with basic dignity.\n\nBy making sure everyone gets enough from the system to continue to be part of the system without dying and/or being abused, it actually makes everyone much better off. In fact, I'm kind of surprised that billionaires aren't pushing harder for this, but that's probably because most billionaires are just as short sighted as everyone else.\n\nBut if you have enough to survive, you can absolutely choose not to work, this has a *ton* of advantages:\n\n* The work you would've done is now available for other people.

All the politicians know that they're not the best or the smartest or the hardest working. They're just the best candidates from the tiny pool or people who can afford to run for office. If that pool got much bigger because the barriers to affording to run for office got much lower, then tons and tons of smart, talented, hard working and capable people would be running for office. The incumbents who are used to running unopposed or having one poorly funded challenger, would suddenly be met with a tidal wave of competition that would sweep them right out of office.\n\nMost of the politicians in this country would much rather fuck the entire system up, if it means they can keep their jobs, then fix anything.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "And if the Tesla bot becomes a real product, that starts doing all those tedious, crappy, low paying jobs.

Look at their current iPhones, how many apps do you use that are of Apple and how many apps do you use that are from any other company? Sure, Apple has some but that's it. In the metaverse, I believe Apple will take a similar approach, which makes Apple mostly a vertically integrated hardware company.\n\nVertically integrated hardware company: hardware + OS + basic apps + ecosystem\n\nThere is definitely competition with Oculus on the hardware side. However, Meta Platforms is a social media company first and foremost and are therefore mostly existing on the software layer. This is the room that Apple leaves to other companies, so there is no competition there. Since there will be competition with Oculus, it means that Meta Platforms will be able to create premium software for AR/VR on the metaverse.\n\nWhat I think will happen:\n\n* Oculus will compete with Apple on the hardware side. This could produce two possible outcomes (IMO). One outcome that won't happen: there's no way Apple will lose. So the other two outcomes are:\n   * Oculus will lose and Apple takes all\n   * Oculus will be its own ecosystem and Apple will be its own ecosystem\n* The rest of Meta Platforms has virtually no competition on the software side from Apple, besides some utility apps, but Meta Platforms has socially generated content + apps. So Meta Platforms will expand on this and take the cake there.\n\nIt may be that Apple royally fucks up though, I do feel that since Jobs died they lost a bit of their magic touch. They're still mostly coasting on Job's awesomeness. I know it wasn't only Jobs, which is why a lot of their magic still remains there, but some of it is lost.\n\nThis is also assuming that the metaverse and AR/VR gets big. It may get big, but it also may be a 100 years from now that it gets big since it depends on AI as well, and AI is a finicky beast with all the black box neural nets going on that you can't debug.

It’s the 12th largest listing ever for an IPO. The shares made a 37% listing gain and the stock has rallied since the listing and is now trading at \\~$145 ($125 Billion valuation) which makes it more valuable than both Ford and General Motors.\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss Rivian’s performance as yet another stock that is caught up in the current EV hype train led by Tesla. But in this week’s analysis, let’s deep dive into the history of Rivian, what made them so successful, is the current valuation justified and finally, whether it’s the right time to invest in the company \\[1\\].\n\n**The Company**\n\nRivian started way back in 2009 and before pivoting to trucks and SUVs, Rivian was also following the Tesla model with its first car [intended to be a sports car.](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uhCAQxp9muWkAEXYPHHrpaxCE0SWrYGG0tU9fXG-dTOZP8k2-yc9ZhCnlQyMUJGsqaPBYQUf4LjMgQiZbgWyC18RrqrhTAwnFjBlgsWHWZN2GOTiLIcVT1SlGJSNP7WTXi5668U6tEJRRIb1iMDrgo6CPx2VmNx8gOtCwQz5SBDLrJ-Jabt3HjX_WDLEED7CX1qWl7udntfWd6gWvQw57sLEpa8pYGmdzExM28OPmzYOvAhI0p5zVkIwz2j9a3krmhLoz4UcmBOeyxa8n3ukv3ARdJtaWbSho3ev0JFkvNr8AC0QMSy3tHPZTOZ0E3pIKwdS-bDHgYSDaYQavMW9A8EL7pmUmiJArcm8saiY7RaWQkjKpLhwV4MlKcElJ_cGnehX_2_8BlnyTSg)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xki818ndqyz71.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=bca3091591d7957a9ae412371e4b70cb0dd99ee7\n\nIt was only in Dec’17 that the company announced its shift to an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV.

Rivan expects to make a whopping $67,900 per customer over ten years in additional revenue from products and services. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ein3o7hhqyz71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5eb3436a206853965a301490eb5bf49992a067d\n\n **Products** \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/82cpmqpiqyz71.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc69cbdf107ba0b3cd4ae1007fe098c59c302c45)\n\nRivian’s product line is very straightforward as of now.

Rivian has raised more than $11 Billion till the IPO which has been led by marquee investors such as Blackstone, BlackRock, Amazon, Ford, etc.\n\nThey have been using the raised money to build most of their research and production technology in-house which they can monetize down the line by licensing their products to other companies. The funding has accelerated since they have shown the prototype, which makes sense as it needs enormous investment to build an automobile at scale.\n\nOne of the biggest drivers for the current valuation is the deal with Amazon where Amazon agreed to [purchase 100,000 delivery vehicles](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkc2OhCAMx59muGkoMjgeOOxlX8MgViUL6ELVzDz94sxtm6Yfyb9p86s1hPOanpowE9vWTD09N9QRz-yRCBPbM6bejZqNmrfCtgNzuZ8SYjDOa7btg3fWkFvjpWpa4ArYomWHk5gkTDBOsusM3ocGTdc1Qlg0oD7LzD46jBY1Hpiea0Tm9UK05VvzdRPfxc_zrG0cbG3XUFrBoSuJX-FdmWBea6xcrrY92cVkF-cK-GVVcoczsUKPlpKz1WFirhcKnjktuIBiCgTwe1eLWoGV7QPkOIGUQqiafhd68BfeJA8z1HkfMhn7cx3Ckg4m_SBljORCCbV3x6WcLypvSQHTlxz26OjZYzSDx1FT2pHRB_ebYD9jxFTeMPaGNKim5UoqxUG1H0QFqpQcpFCclRvGtUzF_-v_ABBnmZc) from Rivian by the end of 2025 with the pilot starting as soon as the end of 2021.

One important thing to note is that it does not make sense to use legacy automakers’ valuation to evaluate EV startups such as Rivian as it does not have steady earnings.\n\nWhat we can do is to compare the stock with its peers (Tesla and Lucid) on projected revenue multiple. In the current valuation,\n\n>Lucid is trading 27x projected 2022 revenue, 10.8x projected 2023 revenue, and 4.3x projected 2025 revenue  \nTesla is trading at 16x estimated 2022 revenue and 13x estimated 2023 revenue\n\nEven if we estimate their production to be 50,000 vehicles per year at an avg price of $70k per vehicle (both at higher ends), **Rivian is trading at 35x of estimated 2023 revenue.** For the current valuation of $125 Billion to be comparable to that of Tesla, the company has to roughly deliver \\~130k vehicles in 2023 and \\~400k vehicles in 2025.\n\nGranted that a lot of things can change in the next ten years - Rivan can partner up with another big player, introduce new and lower-priced models, or effectively scale their production much better than analyst's estimates, but at the end of the day, they have some lofty production challenges to overcome.\n\nThis brings us to..\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/4php6nghqyz71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=86f236a335caa396c1644bec97facf96e30c8f60)\n\n**Delivery goals & Challenges**\n\n>Rivian says it will produce 20,000 to 40,000 vehicles in 2021, its first full year of production — [New York Times (](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uwyAMxp-m3IbMn0J74LDLXiMi4KasCcnAaZQ9_Uh7m2XZlvVZn_ULnnCYy-4IK7FlrtTRvqDLuNURibCwtWLpUnQsOrAy2J6l2t0K4uTT6Niy9mMKntKcD5WyAoxgd9erG6qoNSgVwfZGnaMCEwzEqIXXl7eZX2PCHNDhE8s-Z2SjuxMt9aQ-T_Kr5bZtPO-UJqw8zFPbSBDX1sAeRbbSrzVlrLWN5fujBl9SHvCjpGfymd9pGllyEqRoYYQUcL5yyY0I2l6EjjehtZSG08-dLvCLJw3TIHhd-0o-PA5XVtzkywOpYj5eycTH9DyUw0HhJWkgutanNSfaO8y-HzE6KisyeuN9EesGzFga9th5csIoC0YbA8LYN5IGsVETWhpg7Yc4t6v83_4PXAaUGA)[**July 2019**](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uwyAMxp-m3IbMn0J74LDLXiMi4KasCcnAaZQ9_Uh7m2XZlvVZn_ULnnCYy-4IK7FlrtTRvqDLuNURibCwtWLpUnQsOrAy2J6l2t0K4uTT6Niy9mMKntKcD5WyAoxgd9erG6qoNSgVwfZGnaMCEwzEqIXXl7eZX2PCHNDhE8s-Z2SjuxMt9aQ-T_Kr5bZtPO-UJqw8zFPbSBDX1sAeRbbSrzVlrLWN5fujBl9SHvCjpGfymd9pGllyEqRoYYQUcL5yyY0I2l6EjjehtZSG08-dLvCLJw3TIHhd-0o-PA5XVtzkywOpYj5eycTH9DyUw0HhJWkgutanNSfaO8y-HzE6KisyeuN9EesGzFga9th5csIoC0YbA8LYN5IGsVETWhpg7Yc4t6v83_4PXAaUGA)[)](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkM9uwyAMxp-m3IbMn0J74LDLXiMi4KasCcnAaZQ9_Uh7m2XZlvVZn_ULnnCYy-4IK7FlrtTRvqDLuNURibCwtWLpUnQsOrAy2J6l2t0K4uTT6Niy9mMKntKcD5WyAoxgd9erG6qoNSgVwfZGnaMCEwzEqIXXl7eZX2PCHNDhE8s-Z2SjuxMt9aQ-T_Kr5bZtPO-UJqw8zFPbSBDX1sAeRbbSrzVlrLWN5fujBl9SHvCjpGfymd9pGllyEqRoYYQUcL5yyY0I2l6EjjehtZSG08-dLvCLJw3TIHhd-0o-PA5XVtzkywOpYj5eycTH9DyUw0HhJWkgutanNSfaO8y-HzE6KisyeuN9EesGzFga9th5csIoC0YbA8LYN5IGsVETWhpg7Yc4t6v83_4PXAaUGA)\n\nThe actual production numbers for 2021 are \\~200 vehicles till now and even after the S-1 amendment, Rivian is expecting to deliver only 1,025 vehicles by the end of this year. This is a far cry from the promised 20-40K vehicles.\n\nEven though the pandemic was the major driver behind the delivery delays, it shows that everything has to go right for Rivian to achieve its proposed production plan by 2025.\n\nRivian currently has 55,000 preorders for its non-van EVs and 100,000 preorders from Amazon for its delivery vans (while not directly comparable, Ford’s F-150 lightning has 160,000 preorders). The problem with considering pre-orders for valuation purposes is that pre-orders are far from money in the bank.\n\nThe pre-orders for Rivian Vehicles are cancelable and fully refundable. Adding to this we have to keep in mind that [Amazon has the ability to modify](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdkMFuhCAQhp9muWkAZ0EPHHrpaxiEYZdU0cJoY5--uHsrmUCY_JNv8jlL-FjzaQgLsW0tNNK5oUn4U2Ykwsz2gnmM3jBvuJZOTyyWMWTExcbZsG2f5ugsxTVdqU4LrgR7mnAH65SfhqHzYGXQd4FT5wc9cGWxgzfM7j5icmjwwHyuCdlsnkRbuXUfN_lZK6ajrrbm0uZ4RJtaty61XagiXRPijKV-hZYefA9NUCE0YL1reudtE4KdtO8rWACLRnIp6lFCCn4fWtkq4UD3AnwQAFKqlr6f1PNfvAFfHqIt-1RJ7uuismwWm7-QCiaKS73aOR5X8nGpeEWqjbG-y54inSMmO83oDeUdGb0dv7SND0yYq3s_WjJCdZorUIoLpd9eqkkALkAqzuoOfq1T6T_-Dzualjg) its number of orders.

It’s the brainchild of RJ Scaringe who had a singular vision of creating a car company. They also put money where their mouth is by contributing [1% of equity into high-impact climate initiatives](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUMuOwyAM_JpyjDAlkB447GV_A_FwUtSEpOB0lf36Je1tLcuWpbHHM8ERTms5DGEltq2VLB0bmow_dUYiLGyvWGyKhkXDtQjas1TtWBAXl2bDtt3PKThKaz5RVw1cAbubIY4cPA433fcxRuG97nmvuA-jDujhQ-b2mDAHNPjCcqwZ2WzuRFu9XL8u4rtlSa_kchfWpQ3jWk4gS0ZwAS0UCOD9rROdgiD1ADKOIKUQqqPnnQb-ixfJlwm6uvtKLjzOS6yYxZUHUsVMaWmlm9PrRE6nqDek6bKtL3tOdFjMzs8YDZUdGX3cehtgJ8xYmovROjKgrporqRQHpT8KmydScpBCcdZ-iGvbyv_p_wBNzYVt). I don’t think even if they wanted to, they could have chosen a better time to IPO \\[5\\].\n\nEven if you are sold on the company’s vision and its ability to successfully ramp up its production targets, at the current valuation, even a perfect execution up to 2025 would still make the company a premium compared to the already hyped Tesla stock.\n\nIf you are still interested in buying and holding the stock for the long term, [as we saw in my analysis last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/), waiting a week or even a month won’t substantially change your returns at the same time allowing the stock price to settle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0smv5nqqyz71.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=594dd733b4a7ac471e2cfab856f887d54990930c\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/2290v22sqyz71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=24477cd96d2002d0b4b4bcb4c6a1a652cab15831)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] Disclaimer: This is not investment advice.

As you may know, Panasonic supplies batteries to Tesla. When Panasonic picks partners, they don't just pick anyone.

Most drug companies will start by screening millions and millions of molecules followed by an intensive drug optimization campaign to mitigate liabilities like hepato- and renal-tox, ion channel inhibition, protein binding, bioavailability, etc. You often wind up (after spending ~$50 million dollars) with thousands of different chemicals from which you are lucky to get one.

{"title": "Canoo is about to burn the shorts 🔥🚀🩳🥵 GOEV / Walmart deal?", "selftext": "As some of you might know I'm one of the H-Cock Bang Bus ancient crew so please allow me to shed some light on Canoo's situation - the smooth version. First let's address the basic stuff and then the **well-kept secrets.**\n\n**basic**\n\nLast night ser Tony CEO/Chairman/mini-Elon dropped some updates - the key points:\n\n* manufacturing production in the US to begin before Q4 2022 (vs early 2023) ➡️ sooner than exp.\n* $100 million in additional non-dilutive financial incentives ➡️ more cash\n* targeting $100 million in vehicle orders with the states and universities ➡️ would be juicy when set in stone\n* cash left $414.9 million as of Sep 30, 2021\n\n**the bigger picture**\n\n* Canoo HQ is moving to **Bentonville** \\- a city most **famously connected with Walmart.** Tony: “This is an advanced manufacturing facility that will allow us to produce vehicles for unique use cases as well as accelerate our testing into gamma. We’re looking for ways to take down the traditional go-to-market way and this will produce vehicles that we will sell, as well.” Then during the call Canoo played a video demonstrating the progress of its gamma build, **hinting at a specific unnamed partner for which the company is producing vehicles in the US**. Canoo expects to build 120 to 150 of those vehicles, and “some of them **will be** in the hands of potential **partners**\". [Read TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/canoo-is-setting-up-headquarters-in-walmarts-hometown-picks-panasonic-as-battery-supplier/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALpMekhyzJoLaqvSyFMsBQ7sVoiVZZaqAdFyR2OxdEvGaz6boCqNRiQL3KYZtw_JKMlNlukcf5RkXfXVPbszJtU6Gnlx7xWdBclv1jPzA-goRnQny_1X0kuYlRBY3Sz-wg39pbL1d2irsUNh587CWwtUMTDPl158Kv4pq9s0Qd86) for more details and nice global recap.\n* **The short interest is unsustainable.** Depending on which provider you get the SI numbers you will find between **25% and 35% SI** on GOEV. The days to cover based on [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) are **15.5**([meaning](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/daystocover.asp)). The market cap is only **$2.3bn.** Just for context LCID is $83bn and RIVN $138bn. Among the smaller EV US players Canoo has achieved the most beta testing and Apple wanted to buy them out before they went public to use their skateboard and IP as the basis for Project Titan aka the Apple Car. Shorts are cornered but they are also very strong on this ticker and will do anything to keep the price action contained.\n* Today's price action is very indicative of the long/short story. GOEV opened at 8.50 just +0.05 from previous close. Then mini-mooned at 9.00 and 9.50 milestones. Obviously 10.00+ is the nightmare scenario for shorts going onto OpEx week. They will throw absolutely everything they have to keep it below $10.00 on Friday's expiry. On 1st attempt the stock managed to touch 10.01 then ladder down. On 2nd try 10.05 and ladder down. 10CALL 19-Nov has 18K open interest and almost 10K daily volume as I write. No other strike has a comparable activity.\n\n**quick outro**\n\nBtw not financial advice or whatever. I'm long stocks, warrants, and random calls - all ITM. I'd rather accumulate into one of the strongest IP and business plan at $2.3bn valuation and be on-board of the next moon mission rather than chase $80bn+ FOMOs near fully priced in.\n\n**Bonus watch this** [cool video](https://78449.themediaframe.com/incomm/canoo111521_v2.mp4)\n\n**Edit:** *I posted the OP when GOEV was at its 2nd try to consolidate above $10.00 (trading around $9.65). It took 5 intraday attempts to break free of all these $10.00 walls. And as I *luckily* predicted the pain started after that for the shorts with the stock running into day high at close.
