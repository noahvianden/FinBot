For every dollar a share price moves the value of the option moves the amount of the Greek and the Greek increases by the gamma and the option decreases in value every day by the amount of the theta. Right? \n\nI keep buying deep OTM longish dated calls on high priced stocks like NVDA, TLSA, FB etc with super low deltas thinking over time the deltas will increase and I'll eventually make money. And I keep killing it. \n\nThey shoot up in price so fast and I end up closing them early for great profits. I know I'm getting very lucky and that won't always happen but I dont understand how they are making so much money with such low deltas. \n\nReal time example: last week when TSLA was trading at $1000 I bought the TSLA $2475 strike exp March 22. The Delta today is .07. Theta is .28. Im at $700 profit and the TSLA share price has only moved $200. According to delta I should only have made like $14 dollars or something.

Gamma and theta are also greeks.\n\nKeeping in mind that the greeks are theoretical, because they only hold true if all other variables remain the same, which they never do, and the greeks themselves change, delta is the change in *per-share price,* the way options are actually quoted.  Thus you multiply by 100, just like you do with the price itself.\n\nIf a call option has a delta of 0.07, and its quoted premium is 10.00, if you buy it, you will pay $1000.  If then the underlying moves up by 200, (keeping in mind this will not actually be the exact real-world result, because multiple other variables will be changing the whole time, but theoretically,) the premium of the option will increase by 0.07 x 200 = 14, to 24.00, and thus if you sold you would have a $1400 profit.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "So basically multiply it by 100?

Delta describes what already happened, not what will happen next.\n\nEven that's not really right. It's closer to take the current value of the call and all the other known inputs, like time to expiration and price of the underlying, and fit the model to that current price.

I'll just assume you've decided that a long call strategy is the best way to go after the forecast opportunity.\n\nEssentially, there are two decisions to make at open: How much you want to pay and how long you'll hold the contract.\n\nHow much to pay is proportional to delta. The more delta you want, the more you will have to pay. ITM is more delta, OTM is less delta, thus OTM calls are cheaper than ITM calls.\n\nHow much to pay is also proportional to how long you want to hold the contract, which is limited by the expiration date. The further out the expiration date is at open, the more expensive the contract will be.\n\nHow long to hold isn't necessarily a single number, like \"30 days\". Your forecast is a pop in the underlying sometime in the \"next few months\". Beginners take a straightforward approach and set expiration equal to forecast time. I do not recommend that, particularly if there is uncertainty about the forecast, like it could be anything from 1 to 180 days from now. I also don't recommend opening option trades with more than 60 days to expiration (DTE) either.\n\nSo what to do when the forecast is up to 6 months out? Set up your trade with a rolling schedule. You can open 60 DTE calls and roll them every 30 days. That means in a single order close the old call at 30 DTE and open a new one at 60 DTE. Rolling allows you to adjust the strike (your capital at risk) as market conditions change. Downside is that rolling forces you to take losses or gains at the roll period, which could create tax drag (or tax loss harvesting).\n\nThat covers the how long to hold decision. All that is left is how much to pay. You decide that by making an estimate of [expected value](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result). For a long call your potential loss is from 0% to 100% of the initial debit paid. You can pick the % and manage your loss to that number (more or less). Your potential gain is also a % you pick. The higher the %, the longer you  may have to wait and the lower the probability you will achieve that gain, so don't just pick 8000%. Personally, I use 10% gain and 20% loss, but you can scale that up to 25% and 50% loss. If you push the gain higher or the loss lower, you'll need a higher win rate to be profitable. Just plug your managed loss level, your managed profit level, and your desired win rate into the expected value formula and adjust until the EV result is positive.\n\nIf you've followed this so far, the decision of how much to pay has a direct impact on your expected value. The more you pay, the more you stand to lose, but the higher your probability of expiring ITM, so it's a complex  trade-off. I advise picking one of the numbers and allow the other two to adjust to fit. For example, if you want to make a 100% gain and the amount you paid suggests a 50% win rate (.50 delta if held to expiration), your loss should be set to 100% for break-even EV.\n\nBut even after all that, you may find that the contract at that price and expiration has terrible liquidity. The bid/ask spread may be wide enough to sail an oil tanker through and volume may be 0, both of which are to be avoided.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Could you ever be stuck with a profitable illiquid option until expiration? \n\nI recently had one run up 300% but couldn’t get rid of it until it dropped back down to its previous levels.

Buying puts should consume cash buying power, not \"free it up\".\n\nLet's ignore the CSPs for a minute, since you are basically betting against yourself with a vertical spread. A protective put on stock needs to cost less than the probability weighted average loss based on your estimated size of loss and probability of loss. For example, say you think there is a 30% chance of a $100 loss and a 20% chance of a $200 loss. The other 50% are all profits, so we will ignore that.\n\nExpected loss = (.30 x $100) + (.20. x $200) = $70\n\nSo you shouldn't pay more than $70 for insurance. Then you have to add the cost of the put to the cost basis of the shares and recalculate your gains. If you paid $20/share for 100 shares of that stock, you'd have to increase that basis to $20.70 and recalculate your gains. The point being, insurance is a drag on your profit for the thing you are trying to protect.\n\nFor the CSPs, I don't know how to calculate that, particularly if you are thinking of a single long put doing double-duty as stock protection and hedge for a CSP -- I would not advise doing that.

We don't know ahead of time that it was going to stay $100, but it just works out that way. You have an ITM call at $75 with $5 of intrinsic value some days before expiration. As you approach expiration, the intrinsic value of the call must rise from $5 to parity, which is stock price - strike price. Since we fixed the price of the stock at $100, parity would be $25, so the call has to gain $20 in value by the time it expires. This means the sum of all delta contributions over several days have to add up to $20.\n\nAs it turns out, delta **must increase** in order to turn $5 into $25 of intrinsic value. So how does it increase? For now, let's set delta aside and assume that our call today has some probability to expire ITM, called P, and currently P is less than 100%. P must be 100% for a $75 strike when the stock is $100 at expiration, right? So somehow P must increase from it's current value to 100% by expiration.\n\nSo lets sum up what we have inferred:\n\n* ITM call intrinsic value must rise to parity by expiration.\n\n* Delta must increase from it's current value to add enough value to the call to be parity at expiration.\n\n* P must increase from it's current value to 100% at expiration.\n\nSee the pattern? If delta must increase to reach parity value and P must increase to reach 100% at expiration, is it possible that there is a link between those two things? The answer is yes. \n\nTo truly understand how the probability P is linked to the increase in delta, you have to use bell curves (log-normal distributions).\n\nWatch this explainer video, which uses bell curves to explain delta, and if you still have questions, come back with a reply: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca7oC70BnTg&list=PLhKnvfWKsu41G6LYhTv2kJmDYpgOSuNOi&index=11", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hi,\n\nI am just getting around to this now (quite late I know).

Some percentage of outcomes will be $101, some lower percentage will be $102, some even lower percentage will be $103, and so on, until the number of outcomes approaches zero, like at $200. The same applies for $99, $98, $97, etc., down to zero outcomes at say $1.\n\nThen, just take it on faith that the same log-normal distribution is baked into the formula that calculates delta. That's why delta can be used to approximate probability of ITM at expiration. \n\nIntuitively, it should be clear why 50 delta is 50%, because 50% of future outcomes will be higher than the current price, on average for a log-normal distribution (right half of a bell curve centered on $100). And then the reason some OTM strike is calculated to be 30 delta is precisely because, according to the log-normal distribution baked into the calculation, 30% of outcomes will be higher than that OTM strike.

They don't want to hold a smaller coin that might see 2000% increases in price because they don't actually buy the coin when you buy crypto through them.

Stability is a huge hindrance to the actual use case for crypto on a consumer level. Up to this point, the locations that have seen the highest consumer use case for crypto are areas where inflation has created more instability than using crypto.\n\nI personally think major/global crypto adoption for consumer use will first come through pre-existing companies which would bode well for PayPal.

In essence, they must buy a large sum of X crypto in order to offer it on their platform and thus they (at time of listing) saw them as the lowest risk.\n\nThere are a number of inherent delimmas for them to act as an exchange. At what point does the price increase of a crypto meet with their assessed risk of listing that crypto. If they wait too long, it's going to cost them more to list that token.

(V, MA, SHOP, AMZN etc). some of their competitors have 1 key edge over pypl which is an integrated business model. this wld mean online platforms will begin to stray away from paypal as they start to use their own payment services to cut down on costs. furthermore, there are multiple (over 20k) bad reviews on paypal, which is sizeable considering the good reviews are like 5-6k. this made me less bullish so i had to factor that into my growth model. as such, i used a more modest financial analysis. a 10% growth rate till 2026 and a 14% discount rate gives me a fair value of $124 for 2021. perhaps i should have given a higher growth rate or a lower discount rate because the longer tjme goes on the lower my fair value will be since discount rate>growth rate. i just cannot increase my growth expecrarion since i beliece that pypl will lose market share although it is in a growing industry", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "One point to consider though (I don't own PayPal shares nor consider it), I am pretty sure people are more likely to write a bad review than a good one.

{"title": "Biden picks Jerome Powell to lead the Fed for a second term as the U.S. battles Covid and inflation", "selftext": "Jerome Powell, who guided the Federal Reserve and the nation’s economy through the staggering and sudden Covid-19 recession by implementing unprecedented monetary stimulus, has been nominated for a second term as chairman of the U.S. central bank.\n\nPresident Joe Biden made the announcement Monday morning following weeks of speculation that a push from progressives might see Fed Governor Lael Brainard get the spot.\n\nBrainard instead will be vice chair of the board of governors; she had been widely expected to get a separate vice chair for supervision post, which oversees the nation’s banking system. As vice chair, she would succeed Richard Clarida, whose term expires Jan. 31, 2022.\n\n“As I’ve said before, we can’t just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I’m confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard’s focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy stronger than ever before,” Biden said in a statement.\n\nThe nominations next head to the Senate for confirmation.\n\nIn making the decision, Biden praised the Powell Fed for its “decisive” action in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nThe Fed rolled out an unprecedented array of lending programs while also cutting interest rates back to near zero and instituting a monthly bond-buying program that would increase the central bank’s holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities by more than $4 trillion.\n\n“Chair Powell has provided steady leadership during an unprecedently challenging period, including the biggest economic downturn in modern history and attacks on the independence of the Federal Reserve,” a White House statement said. “During that time, Lael Brainard – one of our country’s leading macroeconomists – has played a key leadership role at the Federal Reserve, working with Powell to help power our country’s robust economic recovery.”\n\nThough Powell carried the day, it was not without controversy.\n\nThe Fed has been under fire lately following an ethics scandal in which multiple officials engaged in trading stocks at a time when the institution was implementing policies aimed at boosting markets. Powell disclosed that he owned municipal bonds, which the Fed also was buying, and he also bought and sold funds tied to the broad stock market indexes.\n\nAt the same time, the Fed has been hit with inflation running faster than it had anticipated – in fact, at the sharpest pace in 30 years. Official Fed policy since September 2020 has been to let inflation run somewhat hotter than the standard 2% target if it allows for full and inclusive employment, but prices have been rising well above that level.\n\nPowell has held to the line that inflation will cool off once factors associated with the pandemic return to normal. But the recent readings have raised questions about the so-called average inflation targeting that signaled a historic turn in central bank monetary policy.\n\nThe inflation also has come with a rapid economic recovery and a decline in the unemployment rate from a pandemic peak of 14.8% to its current 4.6%.\n\nThe White House statement said the recovery is “a testament to the success of the President’s economic agenda, and it is a testament to decisive action by Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve to cushion the impact of the pandemic and get America’s economy back on track.”\n\nBrainard emerged as a key force in the race over who would carry the Fed through the next four years. She has taken point on several issues important to the Biden administration, particularly the need for the Fed to brace the banking system against disruptive climate change events.\n\nA former undersecretary of the Treasury during the Obama administration, Brainard also has been a strong proponent of a digital dollar.\n\nThe White House statement stressed the importance of progressive for the Fed in the years to come.\n\nBiden said that Powell and Brainard “also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system.”\n\n“Fundamentally, if we want to continue to build on the economic success of this year we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve – and I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the strong leadership our country needs,” he added.\n\nPolitical pressure, and a Covid struggle\nPresident Donald Trump appointed Powell to the position in 2018 in somewhat of a surprise. Trump chose to pass over then-Chair Janet Yellen, an unusual move in that Fed leaders are rarely removed after just one term. Former President Barack Obama initially appointed Powell to a 14-year term as governor in 2014.\n\nThough Trump nominated Powell, he later fired withering criticism at the Fed chief when the central bank raised interest rates seven times in 2017 and 2018. The former president went as far as to call the Fed policymakers “boneheads” for trying to normalize policy as the economy recovered.\n\nAs for Brainard, she is now widely expected to be named vice chair of supervision, a key Fed post to oversee the nation’s banking system.\n\nThe Fed is empowered by Congress to fulfill two mandates: Maximize U.S. employment and keep inflation stable. Its leaders, known as governors, are nominated by the president and vote on how to adjust interest rates, regulate the nation’s largest banks and monitor the health of the economy.\n\nTo combat the spike in unemployment and recession that began in the spring of 2020, the central bank slashed interest rates and began buying some $120 billion in Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities every month. It also instituted a variety of lending programs aimed at keeping fixed income markets functioning after they endured significant stress at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nEconomists credit that quick and sizable response for stabilizing financial markets and later repressing long-term interest rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for corporations to take on loans to build new factories, or for individuals to buy homes or cars. \n\n“Under Powell the Fed has placed more emphasis on having the economy operate at maximum employment,” Mike Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan, said via email.\n\n“This is a goal progressive economists have long advocated and a goal which is presumably consistent with Biden’s agenda.”  \n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen, one of Biden’s top economic advisors and a counselor on his Fed nominations, told CNBC earlier this month that she is happy with the Fed chief’s work. Yellen was the first woman to serve as the Fed’s chair and is the country’s first female Treasury secretary. \n\n“I talked to him about candidates and advised him to pick somebody who is experienced and credible,” Yellen said. “I think that Chair Powell has certainly done a good job.” \n\nPowell is also popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have praised his leadership and amiability since he took over for Yellen in February 2018. \n\nThe news is likely a disappointment to progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who said in September that the Fed’s role in relaxing banking regulations in recent years makes Powell a “dangerous man” and that she would oppose his renomination.", "id": "qzm7ni", "created_utc": 1637590124.0, "score": 2036, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 397, "comments": [{"body": "A reminder to everyone, please focus on how this is going to affect a specific stock or the stock market in general.\n\nIf your comment is pushing political agendas, memes, insults, trolling, etc then your comment is going to get removed and/or get you banned.\n\nIf you *have* to discuss just the politics, then post this topic to r/PoliticalDiscussion without linking back to r/stocks, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

On CPU side AMD was on top until few weeks ago when Intel came out with Alder lake CPUs.  Now everyone's eyes are on AMD's  upcoming CPUs.  If their new CPUs are able to one up Intel,  their stocks will stay strong in a positive  trajectory  for sure. \n\nIf they fail to do so...... That may cause possibilities of them to loose the steam. One thing is for sure that if there is a drop... It may not be sudden for sure....

{"title": "Cathie Wood’s Genomics Fund Is Down 27% and Outflows Are Growing", "selftext": "Bloomberg) -- Investors appear to be losing patience with Ark Investment Management’s genomics fund.\n\nThe Ark Genomic Revolution ETF (ticker ARKG) has seen roughly $520 million of outflows in November amid sinking returns. The fund is down 27% year-to-date as investors shun health-care stocks in favor for more cyclical names that perform well during an economic recovery. Even so, the ETF is faring far worse than the broader biotech sector, with the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index up 10.49% this year.\n\nARKG is currently trading at $66.38 a share, lower than its level a year ago, before a steep rally that crested early in 2021. The genomics fund has also seen the largest outflows among Ark’s ETFs this year.\n\n“It’s interesting that typically loyal Ark investors have been bailing on the ETF,” said Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, an advisory firm. “The fund’s assets have been chopped in half since February. While I don’t believe the ETF is experiencing some of sort of ‘doom loop,’ clearly the outflows are putting downward price pressure on the underlying holdings and testing the will of remaining fund owners.”\n\nThe ETF’s two top holdings, Teladoc Health Inc. and Exact Sciences Corp., have weighed on its performance, with drops of some 45% and 37% this year, respectively.\n\nThe recent outflows may be due to investors looking for shorter-term opportunities into the year-end and freeing up cash, said Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer at Defiance ETFs.\n\nArk Chief Executive Officer Cathie Wood is well-known for prioritizing longer term investments over short-term gains.\n\n“This is a 5-10 year hold. AI in health care is going to change the way that we can predict, treat and manage the most difficult diseases like cancer, and the Ark fund gives investors access to the companies who are on the cutting edge of that research,” said Jablonski.\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cathie-wood-s-genomics-fund-is-down-27-and-outflows-are-growing-1.1685602", "id": "qzqye4", "created_utc": 1637602779.0, "score": 618, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 242, "comments": [{"body": "Ark invested in Tesla and made money, later on she invested Zillow and Robinhood", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "Lately I've been feeling like she puts money in every new IPO.

Also valuation is entirely made up based on some astronomical projection. Most VCs have no idea how the new tech or business works. You can tell the VCs have no interest in the longterm profitability of the company because they want patents. Patents are always a net negative to a tech startup, which takes a little but to explain why.   \n3)tech startups launches MVP.   \n4) the product gains traction, but like all startups the projection shows no profitability until a certain scale is reached. This is the most important. You cannot have a tech startup that is profitable on day 1 or no VCs will be interested.   \n5)the next round is a huge round, 10's of millions in cash or more. The point of this one on paper is to give the startup what it needs to do a market share grab.

They are expecting a couple more large VC rounds that will increase the company valuation.  \n7) here is where the gambling comes in. At a certain point, when the company is profitable,  there are a bunch of standard models based on revenue and margin for evaluating the company. The valuation of the company pre-profit ultimately is a guessing game. With each round the VCs know that the company is over valued, and whoever is left holding the stock will be the looser. Up until then each VC gets to take some profit on the next VC.   \n8) what this results in, is VCs influencing these startups to make poor and beauracratic business decisions to avoid being profitable to not be the one left holding bad stock..    \n\nIt's easy to identify these companies, like you just did.

Every other company has been building the same vehicle over and over again, Tesla had the bright idea to add batteries but changed nothing else except adding a frunk. EV's offer the opportunity to rethink this design, however Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, Fisker, Lordstown, you name it, have opted to manufacture the same damn thing.\n\nCanoo has rethought this formula, and is creating vehicles with more space and less of a footprint. Want a minivan interior with a compact car exterior? Want a truck with a longer bed and more storage space than an F250 in half the footprint? Only Canoo is offering these things, and my bet is that the age of supersized unnecessary vehicles is closing, and the age of efficiency and proper utilization of space is near.\n\nI've been in this company since pre-SPAC and it continues to quietly and thoughtfully move forward. It's signed a deal with one contract manufacturer in Europe (VDL NEDCAR) and has signed an agreement with Oklahoma to build its own facility. Canoo just bumped up it's manufacturing timeline to late 2022 and, just for fun, Apple was in negotiations with this company early on, and if you believe the rumors, they offered to buy it and they were rejected by the leadership team.\n\nAnd just to be as honest as possible, I've owned both the stock and warrants for the last 18 months and it currently takes up about 33% of my brokerage account (it was 8 percent not that long ago but it's gone up and I couldn't help but buy more). Tesla at 1.2B, Rivian at 100B, Lucid at 90B, Fisker at 6.5B....Canoo at 2.5B.
