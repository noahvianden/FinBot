That’s why, since opening our first Superchargers in 2012, we have been committed to rapid expansion of the network. Today, we have more than 25,000 Superchargers worldwide.\n\nWith this pilot, 10 stations are now accessible to Dutch Non-Tesla EV drivers via the Tesla app (version 4.2.3 or higher). Tesla drivers can continue to use these stations as they always have, and we will be closely monitoring each site for congestion and listening to customers about their experiences.\n\nIt’s always been our ambition to open the Supercharger network to Non-Tesla EVs, and by doing so, encourage more drivers to go electric. This move directly supports our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.\n\nMore customers using the Supercharger network enables faster expansion. Our goal is to learn and iterate quickly, while continuing to aggressively expand the network, so we can eventually welcome both Tesla and Non-Tesla drivers at every Supercharger worldwide.\n\n**Which Supercharger sites are open to Non-Tesla owners?**\n\nNon-Tesla owners based in the Netherlands can currently charge at 10 Supercharger sites across the country:\n\n>Sassenheim  \n>  \n>Apeldoorn Oost  \n>  \n>Meerkerk  \n>  \n>Hengelo  \n>  \n>Tilburg  \n>  \n>Duiven  \n>  \n>Breukelen  \n>  \n>Naarden  \n>  \n>Eemnes  \n>  \n>Zwolle\n\n**Can I Supercharge if I am visiting the Netherlands?**\n\nThe Non-Tesla Supercharger pilot is currently limited to EV drivers who live in the Netherlands. We will be expanding to additional markets shortly. Tesla drivers from any country can charge as they normally would at these sites.\n\n**Will more sites open to Non-Tesla vehicles?**\n\nWe’re starting with a select number of sites so that we can review the experience, monitor congestion and assess feedback before expanding. Future sites will only be opened to Non-Tesla vehicles if there is available capacity.\n\n**Can Tesla drivers still access these sites?**\n\nYes. The Supercharger experience will remain unchanged for Tesla drivers.\n\n**I am a Tesla driver, what additional benefits do I get compared to other electric vehicles?**\n\nAs a Tesla driver you benefit from the seamless integration of charge post and vehicle, optimized route planning and battery pre-conditioning. With your Tesla, you’ll also have access to the lowest Supercharger pricing.\n\n**How do I charge if I don't drive a Tesla?**\n\nDownload the Tesla app (version 4.2.3 or higher) for iOS or Android and create a Tesla Account.\n\nSelect 'Charge Your Non-Tesla' and find your Supercharger site.\n\nAdd your payment method, plug-in your car, select a stall and tap 'Start Charging.'\n\nSelect 'Stop Charging' to complete your session.\n\n**How do I know which Supercharger post to select in the Tesla app?**\n\nEach Supercharger post has a label with a unique identifier at its base. If you are taking the cable from post 4A, simply select post 4A in the Tesla app to begin charging. Please note that if you don't plug in within two minutes of selecting a post, your session will time out and you'll need to start over.\n\n**Will Tesla drivers see Supercharging for Non-Tesla vehicles in the app so they can charge other EVs and access their Tesla products from one account?**\n\nYes. All Tesla products and services can be accessed via the Tesla app. Tesla owners can use their existing account to charge Non-Tesla vehicles.\n\n**Can I see site availability and service information in the app?**\n\nYes. You can view Supercharger site availability information in the Tesla app.\n\n**Will Supercharger pricing change for Tesla drivers?**\n\nTesla drivers can continue to charge for the same price.\n\n**How much does charging cost for Non-Tesla vehicles?**\n\nPricing for Non-Tesla drivers reflects additional costs incurred to support charging a broad range of vehicles and adjustments to our sites to accommodate these vehicles. Rates vary by site, and you can view charging prices in the Tesla app. The per kWh price to charge can be lowered with a charging membership.\n\n**Do idle fees apply to Non-Tesla vehicles?**\n\nYes. The same logic and fee structure applies to both Tesla and Non-Tesla EVs to help ensure stalls are open for everyone to charge. Learn more about how idle fees work.\n\n**Does the Supercharger cable reach all EVs?**\n\nCertain Supercharger site layouts may not be suitable for some cars. Please do not obstruct other cars by parking over the lines if the cable cannot comfortably reach your car.\n\n**Do Supercharger posts support all connector types?**\n\nThis pilot is only accessible for CCS-enabled vehicles. If a Supercharger post has two cables, Non-Tesla cars can only charge with the CCS connector. If the connector does not fit your car, please report it to Tesla Customer Support.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Great to see this confirmed officially!

A year passed and Tesla was making a lot more money, so clearly the P/E wasn't completely unjustified, and the P/E has adjusted down as a result. It's highest P/E was something like 1000, which is like 50 times anything reasonable for a mature corp. P/E is still like 200. The fact the P/E was reduced by roughly the proportion profits increased indicates that investors think Tesla will mature to the same market position they thought it would a year ago, maybe a bit more. Absolutely insane growth for the foreseeable future is priced in. They'd have to grow at their current rate for the next 8 years to get to a P/E of around 25.\n\nAnother way of quantifying it, if Tesla were to grow at their current rate for 8 years, their quarterly automative sales would be roughly 4-5 times bigger than they currently are without dropping margins. Seeing as they've started with their high end models and are working their way down, I can only imagine their ASP is gonna drop (maybe to around 2/3rds of what it currently is), so realistically they'll need to be selling like 7 times as many cars. They are currently about 1.5% of the automotive industry in the US. Do you think they could end up with 10% of the US automotive sales in less than 10 years?\n\nI think 10% of automotive sales is just about possible. I don't think they could do much more. Their efforts to diversify haven't been particularly fruitful. Equally, I don't think they would swing in much below 10% either. There will be a sea change to EVs, current competitors just aren't quite as good and they will take time to catch up, and Tesla have the benefit of their charging infrastructure. All in all, I don't think Tesla is massively overpriced, but I think it is priced forward to a silly degree. I think if the market was rational we'd see a lot of sideways movement for the forseeable future. The market isn't rational, so I think we'll actually see Tesla stock price continue to grow, and then pull back a lot when it struggles to meet expectations of that stock price and other companies actually start to challenge them.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Don’t forget Berlin as well, plus tax credit", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "**Original Post/play:** (Part 1) ✅  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qiid53/1\\_million\\_dollar\\_tesla\\_short\\_tsla/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "score": 34, "replies": []}, {"body": "watching this one closely", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "BuT hEdGe FuNdS aRe ThE eViL oNeS sHoRtInG", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4887)", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "What if this is the reincarnation of u/deepfuckingvalue", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "That would be deepfuckingnice!", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Blue balls are going golden on Monday!!!", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "I shorted a call spread 1190/1225 expiring this week and instant regret the way Tesla closed today.

{"title": "$PYPL Due Diligence", "selftext": "Current Price $231.50 \nMarket Cap $271 B\n52 Week High $310.16\n52 Week Low $174.81\n\nPayPal is trying to be Coinbase, Robinhood and Charles Schwab all together. I think it will put pressure on these other companies in the long term.\nPayPal is growing a comprehensive platform to power the global digital economy. PayPal is constantly improving its product to meet the needs of their customers. The app was updated in September with a plethora of new features with the hopes of turning it into a super app. Venmo is now offering goods and service payment, and cry.pto currency is now available for you to buy/sell. The fees are even cheaper than Coinbase on a $150 or less purchase. \n\nPositive things about PayPal \n\n1. Updated App in September\n2. Venmo revenue growing every quarter \n3. Buy Now Pay Later option added\n4. Venmo is now offering goods and services option \n5. Honey acquisition is now being utilized on Venmo “DEALS” feature. \n6. Aquired Paidy in September which is a Japanese Unicorn. This was a great acquisition. They are a Japanese leader and this will increase market share. \n7. PayPal savings account are coming soon. Earn interest and watch your money grow. No minimum amount needed. \n8. Cry.pto part of their business has taken off. PayPal/Venmo has 2x as many active users than Coinbase. And it’s only been around since April. \n9. Owns 5% of $MELI (Mercado Libre) the Amazon of Latin America. \n10. 403 Million active accounts. Apple Pay has around 40Million to put it in perspective. \n11. 30Million merchant accounts. \n12. Venmo had 58% growth in volume last quarter. \n13. Venmo is 20% of PayPal and continues to hum along. \n14. 25 NEW features added to the app in september.\n15. Super app will increase retention, and give Paypal more revenue streams.\n16. Goods and services fee has increased from 3% to 3.5% (15% increase. G&S is 15% of their business)\n17. 89% conversion vs 50-55% credit cards on check out.\n18. Can now use paypal on GofundMe\n19. You'll be able to pay for purchases with Venmo on Amazon in 2022 ***\n20. WALMART NOW PRESENTS PAYPAL AS A CHECKOUT OPTION FOR BOTH GROCERY AND MARKETPLACE\n\nI feel the cry.pto part of their business has been overlooked. Bit.coin is at all time high, and I’m sure the ability to buy it on PayPal/Venmo has only helped it get there. \n\nLook for PayPal to use some of its cash reserves 11-12B to acquire companies over the next 12 months OR aggressively buy back shares. \n\nPayPal is revolutionizing how we do business/finance online. If you own a small business (like I do) and you sell a product/service online you most likely get paid in paypal. It’s the king. Millennials prefer to use Venmo, and boomers use paypal. By getting involved in the buy now pay later space they are taking advantage of one of the hottest markets to be in. \n\n\nThe Pinterest news caused an initial drop in stock price, and then PayPals denial of the purchase of Pinterest brought it down even more. This is an incredible opportunity to buy the dip. No bad news has came out about PayPal. I know it’s not the next Tesla, or some sexy small cap EV company. But, this is a FANTASTIC company with LOADS of potential over the next 12 months. The king of online payments. Building a super app. Earnings are next Monday. I am super excited to see the results. I expect them to MURDER earnings. \n\nThis is not financial advise. I’m just a dumb ape. 🦧[Pictures of some DD. ](https://gyazo.com/4128aa1775f917ad990cee26da474882)", "id": "qkqv6q", "created_utc": 1635809490.0, "score": 142, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "PYPL is a great business with tons of cash to invest in their future, i'm a long term holder up around 6x but am not selling yet", "score": 42, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for the confirmation bias as my calls have been bleeding", "score": 35, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’m a PYPL fan!
