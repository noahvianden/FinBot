Remember, a covered call is a *short term slight bullish/neutral/slight bearish strategy*. That is, you're buying the stock, but you think there is a very high chance it will stick around its same price for the time period in which you're buying it, not moving by more than say a few %. If it so happens to move more than that, and you can collect 5-10% on a covered call assignment in like a month, then that's *good*, because the stock usually doesn't move more than 1-2%. You were still able to capture some of the outlier move, but you certainly weren't expecting it, and the return (5-10% for a single month) is still a stellar one to receive for the time spent on the position. Meanwhile, if it didn't move at all (no assignment), you still would have made, say, 1-3% on the call itself expiring (or managing at 50%, let's say).\n\nThat being said, if you *do* have a position in a stock you think could make an explosive move, *don't* sell a PMCC! Just buy a call and wait for the explosion (or implosion, as the case may be)! It is for this reason highly short term \"trendy\" stocks generally have high opportunity cost when selling premium, because you're going to make much more off of the price movement (delta), rather than the time decay (theta). Basically, when you look at a stock, decide if it's a theta stock or a delta stock, and play it accordingly.

This is very clearly a collaboration by the hedge funds to earn back their lost money from shorting GME/AMC/BB/(insert any other ticker here) right?**\n\n**A:**  Institutional ownership =/= shorts.\n\nInstitutions decide if they are shorting a position or holding for the long haul. CLOV isn't just a meme stock, they are a disruptor in the Medicare advantage field with promising and improving results quarter after quarter. They were added to the MSCI index in May**^(1)** and are being added to the Russell 3000 index on June 25th at market close**^(2)**.\n\nCLOV has had a high short interest for months**^(3)** driving the price down from $17 in December 2020 to bottoms of $6 making this a prime long pick for non-shorting institutions in the intermediary time between then and now. Citadel isn't even in the top ten for institutional ownership**^(4)**. Do you know who is in the top ten? Vanguard and Blackrock, both very well-known for investing in to companies most likely to be successful.\n\nNumber one in institutional CLOV holdings? Greenoaks Capital. \"***Greenoaks Capital believes a small handful of high-quality technology companies define each generation. Their mission is to identify those companies early in their life cycle and partner with them for decades.***\" **^(5)**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Q:** **Citadel owns 500,000 shares of CLOV, this must be a distraction scheme to cover their positions for AMC/GME/BB/(insert any other ticker here) right?**\n\n**A:** Citadel DID indeed own 500,000 shares of CLOV as of 03-31**^(6)**— Citadel also happens to have been holding over 700,000 shares of AMC as of the same date**^(7)**. Citadel owns approximately 0.45% of the entire existing non-shorted float of CLOV. Shorting Institutions often hold long and short positions at the same time. This is a normal occurrence.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Q:** **Clover Health only has 4 employees according to Robinhood! Why is this company worth anything AT ALL?**\n\n**A:** Clover Health has over 450 employees listed on LinkedIn**^(8)** and they operate in 8 states nationwide (Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas)**^(9)** **and they even have an office in Hong Kong** **^(10)**.

I am one of those late-comers with a limited budget--bought CLOV this week, am not stoked to see how much it's dropped already, but I'm willing to hold out for at least a couple of weeks and see where it goes and accept that I lost a bet big-time if it never rebounds. Still a huge learning experience along the way.\n\nThis current focus on AMC/GME being the only way to go, ever, is a short-term play at best, and what are people going to do once those have finally played out (however that happens)? It makes so much more sense to harness the power that has been demonstrated with those two and come up with a way for it to be repeated over and over with other low-cost stocks, at least until the institutions and other big-time players figure out how to counter it (if it can be made consistently effective and repeatable). That's what some people are trying to do with the other \"meme\" stocks like CLOV and CLNE and I don't even know what others. Of course there are a lot of clueless people looking to make millionz in two days who are going to panic the second their holdings lose 5%, but there are a lot more people who know better and just need some reassurance for what everyone who's been at this any time at all knows can be a bumpy and unnerving ride, and support from those who have the cash to jump in and make it happen when something new shows potential.\n\nInstead we have people freaking out and attacking one another, on top of what would appear to be a lot of intentional sowing of discord and doubt by those whose interests are to take advantage of this new \"phenomenon\" of retail investors having some leverage and using that to make a ton more money at the expense of everyone else.

{"title": "Borrow rate for CLOV is now 116% !! 🚀🚀🤑🤑", "selftext": "https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CLOV\n\nHoly shit, it now costs 116% to short CLOV. For those that don’t know, CLOV is a healthcare company with limited shares available to trade because insiders can’t sell until the stock trades at $30 for a 90 day period. What’s interesting is that short sellers shorted the stock >40% and now they have to fight with retail for the remaining stock to cover their shorts. But here’s the problem, they haven’t covered their shorts yet, the stock is up 100% and as you can see from the borrow fee, some are probably close to a margin call. They are scared shitless because this thing can go parabolic. I’m talking $50-100 a share! \n\nSo what are shorts doing today? They predictably tried to crash the stock in the morning by shorting (selling borrowed shares) and that coincided with day traders taking profit. A pretty predictable tactic that is designed to scare retail into selling. Don’t let them fool you. This stock still has plenty of gas left, with an option chain up to $43 now!\n\nLETS FUCKING GOOOOO\n\nPositions: $11 calls , $12 calls , $13 calls and $35 calls\n\nEdit: Fuck off with the 🤡🤡🤡 posts, it won’t save your favourite ticket and/or it won’t help you with your short position.\n\nAfter market update: \n\nWell today was wild. What we saw was a combination of short sellers fighting back, probably some profit taking and perhaps a gamma ramp down. But the facts of the stock still remain the same. The stock is:\n\n- Shorted by more than 40%\n- More than 15% of the float is locked up with insiders WHO cannot sell\n- Shorts are now even more underwater with crazy high borrow rates on their new shorted shares \n\nWhen people talk about the VW squeeze. There’s always a period before the spike where the stock dips. That dip was today. Now it remains on longs to keep pushing and we’re going to really benefit from a bigger option chain and another gamma ramp upwards. Here is a link to someone who did some analysis on another potential [gamma ramp.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLOV/comments/nw9qd1/massive_gamma_squeeze_incoming/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)", "id": "nw2har", "created_utc": 1623262595.0, "score": 1140, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 506, "comments": [{"body": "I just bought the dip at @ 19.20. \n\nDespite their efforts, short sellers only managed to bring price down 12% after two days with +30% and +85% gains.

Gun stocks would be another retarded play if you were betting that CPI numbers will lead to raiding of stores, as people become desperate for supplies. However, most of the shit on it is \"bUY sHorT SqUeezE IncOmINg!!1!\" when the reality is that they want the price pumped up because now they have their position opened so they can make a quick buck. The amount of scrapers running over this reddit is so crazy that I could probably say \"Buy PLTR shares, short squeeze incoming\", and scrapers would be bought in within seconds, even if PLTR had 0% short interest.\n\nThus, I petition a temp ban of the word \"Squeeze\" in discussion, except for exceptional cases, where short interest is at 80%+ (This number can be negotiated). My bet is that DD quality will skyrocket, and if I could buy calls on it, I would be YOLOing on OTM ones, as far out as they go, because right now, DD is at an all-time low, so much so that I just skip the post.", "id": "nw2up1", "created_utc": 1623263564.0, "score": 21844, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 1865, "comments": [{"body": "Sure", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Love the mod posts I’m seeing today.", "score": 466, "replies": [{"body": "Zjz is the fucking best, he might single handedly save this sub what a dude", "score": 386, "replies": [{"body": "We always held out hope for him.
