This is probably very elementary stuff, and I’m sure there are technical terms that I am unaware of.\n\nWhen I say scoop, I mean a stock that ramped up at some point then quickly dropped back down. After that, stocks seem to stay low and keep dropping but at a slower and slower rate. Eventually it evens out and starts to climb back up, usually to about 75% of its previous peak.\n\nSo my goal has been to find stocks that just finished leveling out and are starting to “scoop” back up to that 75%.\n\nI have been viewing this trend in 3m, 6m, 1yr, and 5yr ranges because I don’t have an interest in day trading, and I prefer a slower, safer climb.\n\nSo I have a few questions:\n\n1. Is this a decent approach?\n\n2. Does it have a name?\n\n3. Are there other good companies out there showing a similar mid-to-long-term trends that I should look into?\n\nOf course, I’m not asking for or giving financial advice.

Other ICE auto companies are cannibalizing their own ICE sales trying to get EV's. That huge shift won't come without a cost. I think GM's Chevy Bolt was losing $4-8k per vehicle and the CEO came out years ago saying that they won't be profitable until early 2020's. I'm not sure if they are profitable now but I doubt it... CEO's tend to overstate the ability to generate a profit and GM is offering huge discounts on their Bolt's as we speak. Probably trying to get rid of them for the next model but that also speaks of the demand for their Bolt. Getting into EV's won't be as smooth of a transition for others. Haters will point to the regulation credits. The fact that regulation credit revenue continues growing as a source of revenue for Tesla shows that other ICE companies aren't taking the EV push or aren't as prepared as they should be which can only mean that Tesla still has a margin of safety in terms of an advantage.\n\nTheir Q1 sales is what? 50% growth yoy? The issue Tesla seems to have will be the supply chain and adoption of more charging. It's not feasible to own a Tesla in many parts of the world and I understand why some are likely very hesitant to switch because of that reason. I can't trust that there will be a supercharger when I'm traveling. Yes, I can install a charger at my home but it's not feasible for the masses to do so, e.g. living in an apartment or rental unit. Supply chain is a huge problem particularly because Tesla's growth depends on it. Not having the chips or a lagging battery production will be problematic but I'm very bullish on their new Berlin factory.\n\nRight now, Tesla is doing fantastic despite having no federal tax credits. If politicians approve the federal tax credit at the range of $7,500 - 12,500, get ready for a mass adoption of new Tesla vehicles particularly if Tesla somehow manages to release their $25,000 'Model 2' edition in time. That vehicle would be a gamechanger. Personally, I'm not sure how to feel about the cybertruck and whether F-150 buyers would switch. I know the new electric F-150 will be more expensive and have a lower performance but I'm not familiar with how pickup truck buyers feel about the cybertruck.\n\nAll-in-all, you gotta be really foolish to think Tesla won't be dominant in the future. Everything is pointing towards it. Their margins on vehicle sold is over 25% so they can be more profitable in the future.

That huge shift won't come without a cost. \n\nI feel like this is something that the Tesla bears who are hyping up F & GM and other automakers just don't understand.\n\nThe other automakers won't become more profitable by switching entire lineup to EVs, which is why they've dragged their feet on it for so long. If anything the other automakers will become **LESS** profitable even if they sell the same number of EVs as they are ICE vehicles today,  simply because EV's require less maintenance then ICE vehicles, making them cheaper to own after the initial purchase. This is why dealerships (who make their money on maintenance) don't want to sell EVs either.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning other challenges they're likely to face to, including:\n\n* A lot of them have unionized workers who aren't stupid. They know that EVs will require less workers (because there's less moving parts in them, and they're just simpler), which is going to cause issues between them and management.\n\n* When EVs begin catch on with the public the re-sale value of ICE vehicles is going to drop. This will make new ICE vehicles less desirable since people will know that they'll lose resale value faster. The drop in resale value might even put some car loans underwater (i.e. the loan is worth more then the car itself), which is the problem for the bank or loan holder if the borrower defaults on it.\n\n* Once EV's reach price parity in initial purchase price without any government subsidies who in their right mind would buy an ICE vehicle anymore if they're in the market for a brand new vehicle? You'd be paying more money for an inferior product that costs more to refuel and maintain. Unless you have some niche case where EV's still aren't good enough (i.e. certain business cases involving the towing of heavy amounts of cargo) it just doesn't make sense. And if it doesn't make sense what do you think will happen to the sales of new ICE vehicles the automakers are still producing?\n\nThe last point is why I think it's inevitable that some of the automakers are going bankrupt if they move too slow at shifting to EVs.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Feel free to list them out.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I agree with you", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Wall St appreciates your donation", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "You're welcome.

Tesla bulls get blown off with “they aren’t profitable” “competitors will catch them” “stock is overvalued” but these aren’t based on facts, it’s FUD and speculation and not reasons why the company won’t continue to win. \n\nThe only thing I’ve speculated on is that it is the best investment Long term, and that they will be the largest company by revenue. Which I backed up with reasoning that is based on current information available to everyone. \n\nTo comment on your first point, if all those things were true then how would they not be leading in revenue? The top companies by revenue are in energy, oil and gas, and automotive (other than retail), if Tesla is leading in all these sectors and continue to post insane profit margins they would be leading in revenue.\n\nTesla is also about to turn insurance on its head and will have the best possible rates due to large pools of data that their cars collect for them for free. If they solve FSD their robotaxis will be free money, they have all the keys to solving it and are the only company actually attempting this. Waymo is limited to level 4 autonomy and is not able to profitably compete at scale because of the amount of effort it takes to render and update their maps which are needed for the cars to work, unlike Tesla who’s cars actually understand what they are doing and have been doing this safely for millions of uninterrupted miles. \n\nThere is so much to be bullish about and so little to be bearish about.

I'd be amazed if we're not at a run rate of 20 million in the 2030-2032 range. With Tesla going up stream to secure the supply stream, I think 20million is a done deal. The real question is what a robo-taxi future will look like, it could be limited to certain cities and have competition bringing profits down, but it could equally be global and monopolistic in nature. If autonomy requires a fleet of millions of cars to capture the data required to feed the NN, as Karpathy recently stated, then a Tesla monopoly looks more likely. It will get to a point where it is far easier and cheaper for competitors to license the autonomy software from Tesla than to start over with their own fleet learning approach al-la Tesla.

{"title": "Russell Reconstitution and why I believe $RIDE is the best play to capture gains", "selftext": "TL;DR: 🚀🚀 from forced ETF purchases.  If you don’t care about supply and demand economics, just stop reading, buy some fucking $RIDE and buckle up.  It’s about to get wild. \n\n\n1. Russell reconstitution will cause $75 - $115M in forced purchases by ETF’s that follow Russell indexes.  This will happen Friday - next week. \n\n\n2. Few other stocks have been as beaten down by media / short sellers over the last 6 months.  Granted $RIDE has had its fair share of hiccups, but GM owns 7.5% of the company, WKHS owns 10%, they have a 6 million sq foot production facility, manufacturing equipment, and vehicles. (List goes on and on) \n\n\n3. $RIDE has had a complete whirlwind the last 12 months, SPAC, 🚀 to $30, down to $13, 🚀 back to $30, down to $7, and here we are today at $11.  Anybody that is left holding today has no incentive to sell to the index. People continuing to hold at this point have been through the ringer, and they’re 3 months out from production.  Why would they sell now?  Aside from CEO and forward progress with vehicles, nothing fundamentally has changed since when it was hitting 20’s and 30’s earlier this year and late 2020. In fact they’re closer to production, with Betas and crash test rating approvals.  Again, why sell now?  When ETF’s are forced to purchase to follow the index, they have to buy those shares from someone willing to sell.  If nobody wants to sell and wants to see this through, we’re going to see fireworks. 🚀🚀\n\n\n4. Undervalued compared to other EV companies that are not nearly as far along. NKLA $6B? Canoo $2B no facility? Rivian $70B pre revenue?… if $Ride captures a 10% valuation of Rivian, we’re looking at an SP of $40 \n\n\n5. High valuation going into the index ranking day ~ $1.8B.  This is a decently new phenomenon with large companies getting added to the index as opposed to growing up into the index (I.e. WKHS).  This is because SPAC’s aren’t included in the index until they have completed their mergers. \n\nOther SPAC’s are also getting added in, also at high valuations, but out of all the others, $RIDE seems to be most undervalued with the strongest base of support.  Why sell now?… \n\nSome others that are getting rolled in, and why they may not see as strong of results: \n\nRIOT / MARA: heavily tied to the price of “alt currencies”.  If the index throws this out of whack compared to “alt currency” price, people will sell \n\nCLOV: $34M of revenue & $4B valuation.  Short squeeze possible, WSB loves this stock, why not get both? \n\nSKLZ: Has anyone used this platform to make money?  It preys on low income gambling addictions. \n\nGOEV: facility?… production…? \n\nNikola: overvalued…? Production?… facility / timeline?\n\n\nLong story short, this slingshot seemed primed and ready to rocket back up to $30. Throw short interest on top of all this, and we can have a very exciting next couple of weeks ahead of us.

There's the $28m that GM was ordered to pay the state of Ohio which GM might get RIDE to pay. The second issue is the on-going taxes for a plant of that size, that's not needed. There's perpetual expenses for an oversized facility, instead of a right-sized facility. This is a huge problem for a company with an on-going concern of meeting their capital needs.\n\nYour bread and butter, the hub motor, is owned by someone else? That doesn't make RIDE valuable, instead, it makes Elaphe valuable. Any modifications in design to Elaphe's motors will require extensive testing which could costs hundreds of millions. You don't buy something to modify it, you buy something that's been perfected and validated so you don't have to do it yourself.\n\nAs far as the W-15 platform, it was designed as an hybrid, not a fully electric vehicle. The issue with any electromodded vehicle is that they never perform as well as one where it's design was intended for it. Case in point, the W-15's initial plan was a 60kWh battery, whereas the Endurance has a 109 kWh battery. The additional batteries throws off weight distribution, handling, adds additional stress to a chassis not designed for it and etc. Not paying attention to deal and rushing a product to production will be the downfall for Lordstown; resulting from massive recalls or lawsuits from negligence.\n\nEdit: Don't get me started on WKHS. Total failure of a company. Some of us made more money at our day jobs, than Workhorse generated in revenue in past years. They're no longer a start-up; they've had 10+ years to prove themselves.

{"title": "I analyzed the last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!", "selftext": "We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”\n\nAt the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was\n\n**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**\n\n**Analysis**\n\nFor this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you\n\na. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year\n\nb. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year\n\nc. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year\n\nd. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \\[1\\]  \n\nFor analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side, never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&P500 \\[2\\]. For investment amount, consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and increased your investments by 5% for every subsequent year. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  \n\n**Results**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztcgzxk6k5771.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=898ee9f2905abbb849b6a3197dfaf7e96c7e1ff4\n\nThe analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.\n\nThe most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \\[3\\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      \n\nIf you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.\n\nOut of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.\n\nWhile this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are\n\na. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.\n\nb. Identifying a crash itself is very hard\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ocz775l9k5771.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=171f31da53107b2847e9fe1229492c903313c62b\n\nAs we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.\n\nFor e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.   \n\nIt is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \\[4\\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.\n\nIf you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.\n\n*Data used in the analysis:* [*here*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LT3qazGZXHT3qnnBS7oWAZU8n8DH1gv-JsCixN2mdPM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I have considered the [following crashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_market_crashes_and_bear_markets) for the analysis: Dotcom crash (2000), Sep 11 (2001), market downturn 2002, Housing market crash (2008), 2011 stock market fall, 2015–16 stock market selloff, 2018 \\*\\*\\*\\*\\* currency crash, Corona Virus crash (2020) \n\n\\[2\\] The data for the adjusted close for S&P 500 from 1993 to 2021 was obtained from [Yahoo Finance API](https://rapidapi.com/blog/how-to-use-the-yahoo-finance-api/).

{"title": "$PSFE Power up your wallet", "selftext": "# PAYSAFE - PAYMENT SOLUTIONS TO POWER UP YOUR TENDIES\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***What is Paysafe?***\n\n**Paysafe Group** previously known as **Optimal Payments PLC** is a multinational online payments company. The company offers services both under the *Paysafe* brand and subsidiary brands that have become part of the group through several mergers and acquisitions, most notably Neteller, Skrill and paysafecard. **Paysafe** was sold to the Blackstone Group & CVC Partner Capitals making it the **largest private equity** backed takeover of a London listed company since 2007-2008 crisis.\n\nIn December 2020, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to merge with **SPAC** company known as **Foley Trasimene Acquisition Corp**, in a **US$9 billion transaction.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***What products do they offer and what do they sell?***\n\nThe company helps businesses and consumers to connect and transact seamlessly through capabilities in payment processing, digital wallet, and other online money transfer solutions.\n\n* Cash online - Accepts cash payments online\n* Direct Debit - Accepts instant, secured bank payments direct from consumers.\n* Digital Wallets - Accepts payment from digital wallets\n* Integrated Payments - They customise and integrate payments for businesses\n* Online Payments - They provide secure & simplified e-commerce solutions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hedge-funds are extremely bullish on $PSFE**\n\nAs we all know, hedge funds deliver the best returns compared to S&P500. Many hedge fund companies showed tremendous growth and performed excellent even during pandemic and post pandemic.\n\nBased on the insidermonkey article, the number of long hedge fund bets on ***Paysafe*** rose by 41, however, please note that PSFE isn't included in the 30 most popular stocks amongst hedgefunds . The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in PSFE over the last 23 quarters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9vxh3ydm9771.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=a929586f1ae33c1d374f11185f8010296e0551ea\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let's have a look at the top institutional owners for ***Paysafe.*** As you can see from the image below, majority of these companies are hedge funds & private equity firms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1bu07noem9771.png?width=2014&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e940758cc3e33ce9f0cd913aed0f3e1acb38c51\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Price targets as per Wall Street Analysts -**\n\n7 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for Paysafe in the last 12 months. Their average **twelve-month price target is $17.29**, predicting that the stock has a possible **upside of 54.75%**. The high price target for **PSFE is $19.00** and the **low price target for PSFE is $15.00**.\n\nEven if the company is able to hit a price target of 15$ in the coming weeks, that's a possible of upside of at least **35.13%** based on the current stock price at the time of this DD **($11.10).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i001qrxfm9771.png?width=2618&format=png&auto=webp&s=eebb759ff8a4ef7a5021691f9ccd2170e720aca4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If company is so good, why did it fall 23% in the last 6 months?**\n\nAs all of you may know, the SPAC's were hot and trending back in early 2021 and most of the companies were overpriced. If you look at the price history of all the SPAC's post merger, then you'll notice that most of them fell quite significantly. ***Paysafe*** was one of the top companies that went public through SPAC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why paysafe is a good stock to invests in?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ***Paysafe*** has been delivering what many SPAC's have failed to deliver i.e **Revenues & Profits.** Despite the numbers being good after Q1, the stock still fell by 21%. Paysafe got hit by \"Post merger SPAC effect'.\n* The drop in price due to \"Post Merger SPAC effect\" is a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock and hold it for long term.\n* Paysafe has an amazing opportunity to establish it's monopoly in the iGaming space. Their biggest competitors PayPal & Square are staying out of iGaming space and focusing more on Fintech space. Paysafe currently has agreements with few big companies such as DraftKings, Roblox, Twitch, Caesar's entertainment and many more.\n* When it comes to iGaming space, the risks are relatively small because the disputes are very unlikely. People depositing money into their roblox accounts or draft kings are not entitled to refunds and same applies to twitch donations.\n* As per nasdaq.com, the company is expected to **exceed $103 billion in transactions** this year and the company forecasts that iGaming in the United States will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **52% through 2025.**\n* The company’s products are currently not as widely accepted as PayPal or Square, however, they plan on expanding in the coming years.\n* As per nasdaq.com, The U.S. online gambling industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.4% between last year and fiscal year 2025 and ***Paysafe*** has relationship with almost all top online gambling operators in the U.S.\n* The company has expanded partnership with **Coinbase** and the company’s payment solution is in about 27  sites and exchanges. As investing and trading activity grows in the near future, Paysafe is well positioned to benefit.\n* If you look at the Q1, the fundamentals were quite strong, company reported revenue of $377.4 million, which was higher by 5% on a year-on-year basis. The company's adjusted EBITDA was $113.2 million, which implies an EBITDA margin of 30%.\n* The company absolutely destroyed the expectations when it comes to e-cash solutions segment, adjusted EBITDA for that segment was 110% higher and reported $48.1 million. The company reported revenue growth of 63% \\~ $112.9 million.\n* As per nasdaq.com, the e-cash segment has an EBITDA margin of 42.6% as compared to the company level EBITDA margin of 30%. With strong growth in the e-cash segment, it’s likely that EBITDA margin will expand in the coming quarters. As a matter of fact, Paysafe has guided for an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32% for FY2021\n* Between FY2020 and FY2023, the company is targeting annual growth revenue of about \\~10%. Ecash segment is the margin driver for this company and the guidance seems realistic because of potential growth in the U.S online gambling sector.\n* If there is a synergy, Paysafe could also merge with other online payment companies in order to grow. The company is currently sitting at $274 million in cash and $225 million in un-drawn credit facility.\n* According to nasdaq.com, Paysafe reported operating cash flow of $48.7 million in Q1. This would imply an annualized OCF of $195 million. With likely EBITDA margin expansion in the coming years, the company is positioned for healthy cash flow growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is the future of iGaming and online transactions?**\n\nThere is no brainer in this question. The iGaming space and etransactions will keep exceeding in the near future. Many countries currently use cash for transactions, but as technology advances, third world countries are expected to go cashless and follow digital payments. As per the article from Juniper Research Ltd, the digital world is projected to exceed $10 Trillion in 2025. This is an 83% increase from 2020. The research also found that contactless and e-commerce payments will increase to 50% of total wallet spend in 2025 from less than 36% in 2020. More than 34% of mobile handsets are also seen to use contactless payments in 2025, up from 11% in 2020. Even a 2 year old baby would know that Paysafe is expected to benefit from this growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStock price during after the merger,\n\nAs you can see from the graph below, the Paysafe stock rocketed right after the merger announcement and shot up to as high as 20$/piece. What happened next should not shock the world because most of the SPAC's fell off post merger. BUT what makes this SPAC unique is the fact that they've been able to pull off revenues and profits and were able to provide better guidance for the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3mhhphihm9771.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cf8bdfae532f25cde8d25d6d0451e619677c434\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Now, let's talk about Financials of Q1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkld8lqhm9771.png?width=2192&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7f2180d3bf36f1910b1c8444c294e0ec7326803\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $377.4 million, an increase of 5%, compared to $359.7 million in the prior year.

The company mentioned in the presentation that Net loss included interest expense of $58.5 million, an increase of 53% compared to the prior year, reflecting the expense of capitalized debt fees as a result of debt repayment on March 31, 2021. Net loss also included share-based compensation of $72.4 million, compared to none in the prior year due to shares vested on completion of the Transaction.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $113.2 million, compared to $112.8 million in the prior year.

However, you would not expect them all to randomly decide to sink their teeth into said random ticker for the first time, all at the exact same time, every time... which they do. \n\nThey all bought these tickers for the first time Q1 2021. And if they happened to own it before Q1 2021, just check the \"Changes in Shares\" category along with 13F filing date, and you'll see they're all, in their latest 13F filing, adding to their long position substantially.\n\nThe PnD couldn't be any more obvious and who's manufacturing it.\n\nThere's other names you'll typically find buying in at the same exact time (they just don't participate in each PnD) but since they don't get mentioned often I'd rather they not get the spotlight turned on them yet.\n\nCheers, and know your gut sense isn't wrong.\n\n*edit: well, a name I wasn't going to bring up yet in any of my comment 'hot takes ᕕ༼ ຈل͜ຈ༽ ᕗ' because I wasn't sure if they were shitty or not (maybe they were just continuously in the wrong place at the wrong time, like me in high school when I was continuously at the wrong place at wrong time... doing something illegal) just got dropped in Robinhood's [S-1 Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm), along with Citadel, Susquehhana & the very interesting group Jump Trading (look at the reference for Tai Mo Shan Limited), which is Wolverine. Since their name starts with W, if they are holding a security, they are almost always on the very last page of holders on whalewisdom due to default sorting. Also a memorable name.\n\nHere's a couple of notes from Jump Trading's Wiki (emphesis all mine):\n\n* Jump Trading was founded in 1999 by two former pit traders, Paul Gurinas and Bill Disomma (DiSomma), who met in the Deutsche Mark pit at the [*Chicago Mercantile Exchange*](https://a-teaminsight.com/cme-group-and-citadel-investment-group-unveil-cds-clearing-platform-plans/?brand=dmi) ([CME](https://www.cmegroup.com/company/center-for-innovation/files/cme-2019-melamed-arditti-innovation-award.pdf))\n* Following the 2010 flash crash, Disomma, Gurinas, and COO Matt Schrecengost met with CFTC chairman *Gary Gensler* to discuss the definition of spoofing as a disruptive trade practice as well as transparency and access to SEFs. This meeting contributed to regulatory efforts to implement new market rules stemming from the Dodd-Frank Act\n* In April 2014, Jump was one of six high-speed trading firms subpoenaed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman regarding their trading strategies, as well as the *special arrangements they may have with exchanges and dark pools*\n* In May 2018, Jump was fined $250,000 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) due to a *malfunction in one of its trading algorithms leading to the accidental accumulation of a short position worth hundreds of millions* of dollars\n\nI'm just using this as my journal at this point...\n\nFun notes: \n\n* Jane Street, was founded by Susquehhana alumns. \n* Susquehhana was founded by 6 fellas, 5 of whose prior jobs were at PHLX and are alumni of State University of New York at Binghamton (none on the uni's wiki page under the Notable People/Alumni section). \n* Jeff Yass' (one of the SUNY boys and 'professional gambler' prior to options trading) dad helped to start Sus and their first office was actually in the PHLX. His father still works for Sus and is named Gerald Yass.\n\nSublimation at its grossest. \n\nAnd Jeff Yass' donation list alone is enough to put him in prison for the rest of his days.\n\nAnd damn these software malfunctions which happen to Citadel & Jump Trading, man. They end up creating huge short positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, or [resend filled orders that cause atypical short-term volume increase which then affects the security's price](https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/lookups/advisories/disciplinary/CME-13-9526-BC-CITADEL-SECURITIES-LLC.html)... what a drag. \n\nJust unlucky if you ask me, but hey, ask one of these bad cats about luck; they'll tell you it doesn't exist and one creates their own luck.\n\nSpeaking of luck, to think, a human noticed the effects of the software malfunction on Citadel's server, determined it was indeed a software malfunction on their server, and Citadel were able to identify the exact cause of the malfunction and resolve it, all under a minute (you saw where CME said \"during an approximately one-minute period on June 3, 2013\" right?).

{"title": "AMD: The DD that will make you rethink why you bother reading anything on this sub", "selftext": "I am halfway through an 18 hour shift, currently stationed in Turkey, its hot as fuck, idk why I’m here, I’m 2,000mg deep in caffeine, getting drunk as soon as I get off, getting off as soon as I get off, my wife is back home cheating, my daughter calls another man dad, *cracks knuckles* lets do this. \n\nOverview\n\n\tAMD is a global semiconductor company offering x86 microprocessors as standalone or integrated (CPU’s, GPU’s, server systems, Etc…) and intellectual property/ services.\n\nProducts\n\n\tAMD’s primary products consist of CPU’s and GPU’s which are on par or out performing NVIDIA GPU’s and Intel’s CPU’s. While these other two giants have dominated the market for sometime, AMD’s recent move has evolved from a slow creep to a brisk jog. \n\nCompetition \n\n\tAMD’s largest competitors are Intel (CPU’s) and NVIDIA (GPU’s). With the release of AMD’s Ryzen processors in 2017, AMD has been steadily over taking Intel’s dominance over market share. AMD’s current market share (over all CPU’s) currently sits at 44%, levels it has not seen since 2005. AMD took 20% of the market share in past 2 years with a significant jump in 2019. Since the release of Ryzen, AMD is now on par or out performing Intel chips and has gained a significant amount of sentiment over the soy boys at intel. AMD is on track to overtake the majority of CPU market share within the next year based on current projections.\n\n\tNow NVIDIA is a whole other beast who currently has a significant advantage over the dGPU market. Nvidia at the end of Q4 2020, held roughly 82% of the market share which was a increase of 9% from the previous year. AMD’s high end GPU’s do not come close to Nvidia’s high end models, UNTIL AMD’s Radeon 6000 series, which are now on par with Nvidia’s cards, either outperforming or underperforming in various tests. AMD catching up to Nvidia is the same move that AMD made against Intel in 2017, 4 years later they are on the verge of overtaking market share. While Nvidia is a monster of a company, I believe that AMD will begin taking more market share from Nvidia and establish a decent foothold over the next few years. AMD has already taken the game console market, console plebs.\n\n\tAMD has already proved they are able to take back significant market share with there current and future products, Lisa Su is a genius and I believe she’ll lead the company to Valhalla. What does AMD have that Nvidia does not? Aside from many differences, I think the fact that AMD has an ecosystem will play a significant role in catching up. Now that AMD can evenly compete with both of their rivals, AMD plans on leveraging the fact that they produce CPU’s and GPU’s. There are already incentives to using AMD’s CPU with their GPU rather than an AMD CPU with a Nvidia GPU. With AMD taking the CPU market, retail users will be more likely to stick with the ecosystem, and I’m a big fan of companies producing an ecosystem (laughs in apple). \n\n\tA new player enters the battle. Intel has been working on their own dGPU and will surely be releasing in the next few years, but I believe this will be comparable to Sony vs Microsoft with Nintendo enjoying their best life staring at butterfly’s, covered in drool in the corner lol.\n\nThe Merger\n\n\tNvidia set to acquire ARM, AMD set to acquire Xilinx. What are they and how are they expected to impact the company?\n\nARM - Create and dominate the mobile processor market, covering TV’s, phones, tablets, and other similar products as well as some software applications. I will not be covering much more of ARM in this DD.\n\nXilinx - Designs and develops programmable logic products. As far as I can tell this is some big brain shit that I’m sure some booger nosed, mothers basement living, neck beard having, nerd will easily explain in the comments cuz Wikipedia ain’t cutting it.  \n\n\tIf AMD completes the purchase, which is likely and expected to happen by the end of 2021, Xilinx shares will become worth 1.723 shares of AMD. AMD is currently trading at 86.10$, meaning that shares of Xilinx will be worth 148.35$ if the deal were to go through right now. Xilinx is currently worth 133.71$, I’m betting heavily that AMD will continue to pump prior to this deal as well.\n\n\tARM will be huge for Nvidia, but this is running into some major road blocks and is likely some ways off or will fall through.\n\nFinancials and projections (I had pictures but I’m reddit dumb)\n\nNet Revenue\n$9.8B(2020), $6.7B(2019), $6.5B(2018), $5.2B(2017)\nNet Incum \n$2.5B(2020), $341M(2019), $337M(2018), $(33)M(2017)\n\t\n\tI like your growth G\n\n\tAMD decreased their debt to 338 million from 568 million.\n\t\n\t$1.6 billion in cash ($9 billion in total assets, I find cash on hand more important)\n\n\tGPU/CPU sales accounted for $6.5 billion while enterprise accounted for $3.3 billion, GPU/CPU sales saw a 37% increase over 2019 while enterprise saw a 65% increase in 2020. 2021 is set to continue this trend of growth.\n\n\tAMD has a high price target of $169.70, median $107.00, and an average of $103.92. I just read 100’s of pages of 8k’s and 10’ks, plus I’m super attracted to the ole doc Su Bae so I’m betting that it will get a target price upgrade, regardless $103 will make me rich. There is a lot more we could dive into on financials but idk what the fuck I’m doing so nah.\n\nRisks\n\n\tI like to plan for more than 1 risk occurring at a time so keep that in mind. Ive highlighted the risks that I find most impactful/ probable. Also keep in mind of global shortages for damn near every company, especially with chips.\n\n\t- Intel/ Nvidia’s market share dominance (mostly Nvidia)\n\t- Seasonal sales can make for shit earnings in Q1/Q2\n\t- Reliance on third parties for manufacturing/ distributors\n\t- Xilinx deal falls through\n\t- Jim Cramer also likes this stock\n\n\tThat’s enough risks, what am I, a gay bear?\n\nTLDR\n\nAMD will moon, Lisa Su is my mommy and is cooking up some tendies, AMD GPU’s are now in Teslas,  obligatory rockets (insert rocket emojis here), lots of words just buy it.\n\nPOS\n150 shares @ 78.50\nJan22 $100/$105C\nLooking for entry into Xilinx cuz I dumb", "id": "o7bb1e", "created_utc": 1624576449.0, "score": 336, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 160, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|25|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3k2ot/drunk_mans_dd_of_spce/) \n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/TheTendilorian, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "ALWAYS ON MY BACK, will when I get off in 6 hrs.

Ergo, doing reconfigurable computing makes sense, so that when you do play games, voila, we can instantiate a GPU for you on the programmable side of the SoC.\n\nEdit: thank you kind stranger for my first ever reward!\n\n I've been patiently collecting karma to be able to have 100 to comment on WSB.

Expensive ($100+ of M to $1B+)  to develop and slow deploy.\n\nGeneral purpose CPUs that Intel and AMD develop aim to do everything, but at the cost of **not** being application specific and slow at those tasks. This is why co-processors, such as floating point units (FPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) were developed first off-chip, and nowadays as we are able to pack more transistors per chip, on-chip. \n\nFPGAs allow for reconfigurable on-demand computing, which ASICs never will. They allow the flexibility to make the general purpose CPU morph, when needed, to a time-bound (albeit \\~10x slower) ASIC of a sort. They are also very energy efficient, and can increase the CPU processing speed of certain tasks by 100x to 1000x (still slower than ASIC, but not bad overall). This is their edge that general purpose future CPUs/SoCs will exploit to increase performance and power efficiency. \n\nThe third, and probably most important, benefit is that they are reconfigurable by software updates; deploying the hardware first while incrementally adding value to the consumer via  updates is why they makes sense business-wise.

You use a hardware descriptor language (HDL such as Verilog or VHDL).

Then take a few of these and design it such that opcode 1 dumps the output in a custom register that opcode 2 needs and so on. Then realize you don't even need to explicitly call each of them individually if you always want to run them in that order.\n\nThat said an FPGA won't out perform an ASIC in tasks the ASIC was designed for, so it's more for operations for which the ASIC wasn't explicitly designed.  The real nifty bit is you can reconfigure them in a few seconds and if companies really wanted to make them as application specific coprocessors then they'd need to implement something like a stack push/pop process for the configuration so that it could be switched in coordination to the scheduler swapping processes.\n\nSo the final answer is that in theory someone could write a library that reconfigured the FPGA to perform custom functions for that library when you call it from your application.
