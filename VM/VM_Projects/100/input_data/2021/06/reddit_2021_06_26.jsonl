Dividend stocks CAN go under and they CAN stop paying dividends.\n\nSafest option would probably be bonds if they ever get up to 4% to 5% interest again. This is actually one important reason why past stock market crashes happened - because there was a reasonable alternative to putting more money into a market that was obviously irrational.\n\nNot the case today, so unfortunately, you'll have to utilize the market.\n\nBut the real risk with options - and with buy and hold - comes from over exposure to market volatility. This happens because most people think investing all of their money into the market is \"safe\" as long as they're only doing \"cash secured puts\" and \"covered calls\" on solid stocks and funds. \n\nThis is, of course, ridiculous. Even if all you own are blue chips and the index funds, a whole market crash will still destroy you. It's better, if you're after income, to have most of your money as cash or bonds, and then to use a relatively small % of it to achieve your income goals with reasonable risk vs. reward. \n\nFor instance, if you can get 50% a year from doing the wheel, aim for 5% instead with 10% of your money and keep the rest as cash. Remember: when relying on stocks for income, you're not trying to beat the market, you're just trying to get reliable interest on cash.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Won‚Äôt inflation crush your cash holdings?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "This is reddit advice, what do you expect?", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Losing 50% of your portfolio in a crash will also crush your net worth, inflation or no inflation.\n\nIf you're worried about inflation, there are a number of options.\n\nFirst, you can hold inflation adjusted bonds instead of cash. There are down sides to this play but its lack of correlation with the market will be welcome in a portfolio that is primarily designed for income and capital preservation, rather than growth.\n\nSecond, you can just adjust your % target returns up to account for inflation. For instance, if you want 5% income, and you want to adjust for an inflation of 2%, then you'll want to target 7% over all for returns. The practical effect is that you'll have to adjust your market exposure up to get 7%, but in the above scenario, it'd be the equivalent of exposing 15% of your portfolio instead of 10%. You can live with losing 70% of 15% in a crash, especially if you then take advantage of the crash with the rest of your portfolio using bear strategies.\n\nEverybody realizes that inflation sucks for cash, but that doesn't mean you need 100% market exposure, all the time. Cash is king during market crashes. If you had 90% of your portfolio sitting in cash during the 2008 crash, and bought into an index like QQQ around that time, guess what, you'd be rich.\n\nUltimately, there's two ways to manage your market risk: you can either play strategies that get totally crushed during crashes with a small % of your portfolio, or you can play strategies that are much more conservative, but with a larger % of your portfolio. Either is fine as long as it meets your target, but the latter is generally harder to do because the market is highly correlated, so exposure will compound losses during a crash in ways that you might not even expect.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Your top dividend super cap stocks aren‚Äôt going under.

People here are talking about getting dividend returns in the range of 4% to 5%.

He was basically like whatever she wants, I have an opinion but this is hers, final decision is hers. The rep walked them through a Y, wife asked about the X but they didn't have any at the store. Rep explained how the buying process works.\n\nThe rep did say they're building cars as fast as they can and there arent enough to satisfy demand. That their biggest selling point is safety. She said they get stories weekly of people who say \"my Tesla saved my life, get me another\" or alternatively- wont drive anything else.\n\nThe wife kept asking questions about the X and husband didnt  seem bothered by the fact that the X was roughly an 80-100% increase in price. I'd be shocked if they didn't buy, but have no idea if it would be a Y or an X.\n\nThe rep took us out by some of the cars opened doors and showed us the interior, frunk and cargo area but none of the vehicles were available to drive. There were about a dozen cars out in the pick up area, I estimate with just a glance around that there were about 50 cars but no vehicle was available to drive or get in as they were all sold.

I sell music and books, primarily, and use PayPal checkout. Today PayPal just sent out their new price increases for August 2nd, and the number hikes are unnecessary and much higher than Square, their main competitor. \n\nFor example, a credit card payment with Square carries fees of $0.10 plus 2.6% of the transaction amount. The online fee is $0.30 plus 2.9%. If you manually key in a credit card, it jumps to $0.15 plus 3.5%, which feels dumb until you consider why a card might not scan, and this is insurance on those transactions.\n\nPayPal was competitive at $0.30 plus 2.9% per transaction, regardless if keyed in or run. \n\nPayPal is now increasing their cut to $0.49 plus 3.49% per transaction, a 0.5% plus $0.19 hike. That may not sound like much, but over thousands of transactions, that's a ton of money I'm losing on fees. So I have to spend the weekend dropping new codes into purchase buttons...and those buttons will lead to Square.\n\nAs an investor, you might think more fees means more money for PayPal, but I promise you that in talking with other small business owners, we're acutely aware of that bottom line, and I've had many discussions on the merits of PayPal vs Square at major book and music conferences each year. Think about every small-time online retailer...they're going to vote with their pocketbook.\n\nSo there you have it.

Yeah moon shot. Obviously the Russel 1000 and S&P are two very different as far as the resulting institutional buying, but PLTR and SKLZ in particular have much smaller market caps. Either way, institutions are going to be forced to add these two. Both of these have great technical set ups and are breaking through major resistances, and thus with the additional volume they should sky rocket. SKLZ has a ton of short interest as well, which means it could get some squeeze action. Both had a ton of call flow this past week, and the open interests are huge. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Skillz i'm looking for a minimum of a move to $25 THIS WEEK, which would be a 5 bagger, yes ladies and gents 500%. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Palantir i'm looking for a move to $30 this week.
