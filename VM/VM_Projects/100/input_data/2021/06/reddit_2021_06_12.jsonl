{"title": "Honest discussion about Lordstown Motors (RIDE)", "selftext": "While big media has been relentlessly attacking the stock, I continue to be bullish on LMC. Sure they've been burning cash, but that's expected from a an EV startup (during a pandemic nonetheless).\n\nThe recent 10k filing identified the  hypothetical risks (going concern) of the cash burn and the need for more capital to ramp up production. The filing included several \"risks\" and pointed out worse case scenarios using legal terms.\n\nBottom line, they have no debt and many options to raise capital (ATVM, asset backed loan, share offerings, etc). Saying they are near bankruptcy is a huge hyperbole.\n\nThe Endurance truck (flagship vehicle) has almost completed safety crash testing (2 of 3 tests completed) with 5 star rating. On track to being the safest pickup truck ever tested. They are almost done tooling the plant (with 600k vehicle per year capacity) and on track to begin mass production in September.\n\nThey have an open house for investors and fleet managers June 21-25.\n\nThey have actual reservations (and deposits) of roughly 30,000 trucks.\n\nThere are over 35 million shares shorted, why? I genuinely can't see the bear case? \n\nWhy isn't the media talking about all the accomplishments that LTM are making? Why does it seem like everyone wants them to fail? \n\nFull disclosure, I own 10,000 shares of RIDE.\n\nEdit: it baffles me that we can't have an honest discussion about this stock without downvotes, the media has really brainwashed the masses into hating RIDE\n\n\nEdit 2: CEO Burns is gone (resigned) as of today with the CFO, many of you (including myself) were not a fan of Burns.

Every $100 matters when your buying 100+ trucks. \n\nIf GM and Ford beat Lordstown by just $5000 per truck on 100 trucks, that's a $500,000 price difference. Or even $1000. What company is going to go for that from an unproven startup no less? \n\nFleets also negotiate extended warranty and service agreements. Lordstown has no dealerships. They will be paying a third party to honor any of those agreements.\n\nNot sure why they think the fleet business is their focus. It's the lowest margin business available. Yes, you sell/lease 10's of trucks at a time but the margins are smaller and potential ongoing warranty and service contract costs will be higher. \n\nAgain, Toyota has been trying to break into the Fleet truck business for a decade plus with little to no success.

The price for example doesn't include freight and delivery and the Lightning model for fleets doesn't include any of the features in the XLT model (which is standard on the Endurance).

Happy to converse about it because my wife really did seriously look at the car as an option to replace her Accord lease that is coming to an end.\n\nFirst, the “35k” version is a seriously stripped down vehicle, missing basic options you would expect in a low-end 2021 Accord. If you want all wheel drive too, that is an extra option too that reduces range down to 211 miles and costs even more. The two basic option packages you would want if you want to have a nice car costs $2500 each, so add 5k to the price. Assuming you have a good enough income to buy an expensive car, these are all going to be options you WILL want. These all add up to bring the price well above 35k.\n\nSecond, the existing tax credit is nonrefundable. You pay the higher price to Ford and then any effect occurs the next year when you pay your income tax. This means that there are two possibilities. Either when you cut a check to the Feds, you are paying more than $7500 or less than $7500. If you are paying more, then you get to pay $7500 less. If you are paying less than $7500, the amount you pay is reduced to zero. You don’t get a refund for the extra balance to bring the benefit up to $7500. Plenty of people “owe” that much in raw income tax rate, but they often already have other deductions too.\n\nHENCE, there are two options. Either you don’t have a high enough income (and maybe should not be buying an expensive car) and you do not get the “benefit” of a tax deduction. OR, you make enough money to claim the full credit, in which case there is no way you are looking to buy the completely stripped down low range version of the Mach E.\n\nAnd ALL of this is before you consider that you are buying from a dealer, not the company at the MSRP. There is limited supply and a lack of “dealer incentives” to push them (at least right now), so dealer margins will be lower than if they pus you to another vehicle.

Sure there will be people spending more money on a Tesla than normally, but is that also true in the long run or is that just because it is new and scarce?

{"title": "I analyzed 3600+ IPOs over the past two decades to determine if you should buy into an IPO. Here are the results!", "selftext": "Let’s be real here. We all have bought into an IPO that we regretted. We might have been swayed by the Red Herring report, the marketing pitch, or the investment banks' roadshow. I personally have lost money in both the IPOs that I bought into and now avoid IPOs like the plague. However, I wanted to keep my personal experience out of the analysis and wanted to understand\n\n**Whether IPOs in general make or lose money for the average investor?**\n\n**Where is the data from:** iposcoop.com\n\nThis is the first time in any of the analyses that I have done where the data was accessible directly in a usable format. They have documented almost all of the IPOs from 2000. I have cross verified the data with [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/) and have observed coverage of more than 90%. This period covers a wide variety of situations such as the dot-com crash, 2008 financial crisis, market rally following the crisis, etc. which implies that our analysis covers both bear and bull market.,\n\nAll the IPOs and my analysis have been shared on a Google sheet at the end.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8cfa0ni07u471.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc604e1016e7aa4550141751f9904567d7209daf\n\n**Analysis**\n\nBefore we jump into the analysis, there are some things we need to understand about IPOs (if you know the inner workings of an IPO, please feel free to skip to the results). When a company wants to go public, they hire investment bankers to sell the shares. The investment banks are then responsible for creating interest, choosing the optimum time to go public, and make sure the price is right so that there is enough demand. But the banks offer a large share of the allocated stock to institutional investors such as pensions, endowments, or hedge funds. Retail brokerages can end up getting shares, but they may make up only [10% of the total allotment](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/how-to-buy-ipo-stock-at-its-offer-price).\n\nAdding to this, additional factors such as your brokerage account, account balance, the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not. (i.e., Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients). For e.g., in the case of [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html), your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.\n\nI have factored in the above limitations and have calculated the historical performance of the IPOs in two different ways\n\na. You get the IPO allocated at the offer price (the price at which institutional investors are buying)\n\nb. You buy the IPO when the market opens on the listing day (opening price)\n\nFor the above scenarios, I have analyzed the following\n\n* Listing Change (Difference between Opening price and Offer price)\n* One day change - inclusive of listing\n* One day change - exclusive of listing\n\nTo make it simple, let’s take the example of company X. If the offer price of the IPO is $10, the Opening price on the day of the IPO is $12 and the Closing price is $15 then,\n\n* Listing change is +20%\n* One day change inclusive of the listing is +50%\n* One day change exclusive of the listing is +25%\n\n**Results**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vby0prh27u471.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=be6276dde250412988455ba3d78d3b7e37418e24\n\nOn average, IPOs did make money for the investor. But the amount is significantly different if you got allocated the IPO at offer price vs you bought the IPO at market open. The average listing change over the last two decades was 12% and the average one-day gain in the market inclusive of the listing was 13.6%. Adding to this more than 68% of the IPOs ended in green on the listing day.\n\nBut the story is markedly different if you choose to buy at the market open. Only 48% of the IPOs ended at a price higher than the opening price and the average change was a mere 1.3%. Now that it’s out of the way, diving deeper into the data brings interesting insights.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7f5sbp547u471.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=733dc5a1fb88e6c1d49490c2278c0e17d20913f3\n\nAbove is the list of top 10 IPOs having the most amount of gain on listing day. Baidu.com made a whopping 354% on its listing day. Another interesting observation is 6 out of 10 companies in the list were listed in 2000 and were predominantly tech companies (just before the dot com crash). But not all companies had a great experience on the IPO day. Here is a list of the worse performing companies on the day of listing. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/562w2az57u471.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfeeb4dcd44348538c657d3cfc0fb4a3920e6d59\n\nThere are certainly some familiar names on the list. [Funko IPO](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/funko-stock-plunges-in-ipo-shocker/) is considered to have the worst first-day return for an IPO in the last two decades. Sundial Growers also had a rough time in the market on its listing day with the stock losing 35% of the value in one day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c71zm1j77u471.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a5b5009abef9c0e0f90c4166767ef878824a730\n\nI also calculated the IPO returns for each year after 2000. As expected, the year 2000 was the most successful year for an IPO with an average return (inclusive of listing gain) of 35%. The worst year was 2008 (after the financial crisis) with only a 2.3% return. This graph also showcases two important things\n\na. On average the IPOs have made positive returns every year in the last two decades\n\nb. There is a vast difference in your returns based on if you got the stock at offer price vs opening price and the trend holds across the years.\n\nThis brings us to our final question of which investment bank made the most number of IPOs and how was their performance on listing day\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/dxy9xq597u471.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc4dbd6096edbb790669325b91cce48759b4f393)\n\nOut of the top 10 list, only 3 Investment banks had below-average returns. We are not going to draw any conclusion from this as an IPO is usually handled by multiple banks in partnership and the above analysis is done using Fuzzy match (its an approximate match)\n\n**Limitations of the Analysis**\n\nThere are some limitations to the analysis.\n\na.  We don’t have 100% coverage for the IPOs done since 2000. From comparing to other sources, I could observe more than 90% coverage and I feel that this should be representative of the whole.\n\nb.  There is no data showcasing what percentage of each IPO was offered to the retail investor.\n\n**Conclusion:** I have some theories to explain the IPO performance. I think it’s driven mainly by two factors. One being the hype/PR generated by the investment bank about the company and the second is that I think the investment banks slightly price the IPO lower than the market value of the company so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO). Both these factors contribute to the listing as well as the one-day gain that we see across the board.\n\nOverall, this once again seems to a situation where having money makes you more money (institutional investors having easier access to the IPO) but as the analysis shows retail investors can still make significant gains by buying into an IPO!\n\nGoogle Sheet containing all the data: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nHsXW7-2bu0jafuZe_0LmapSE5V5KXYF14Oe0lG2TKA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. If you are planning to invest in an IPO, make sure your brokerage support purchasing IPOs, minimum criteria to participate, and also the historical track record of your brokerage in issuing IPOs. All of this will significantly improve your chances of getting the IPO issued at the offer price.*", "id": "ny6wpp", "created_utc": 1623504948.0, "score": 1851, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 336, "comments": [{"body": "Great data.

{"title": "All crashes are similar, only perceptions change.", "selftext": " Some of you have not spent 10 yrs compensating for your small penis by studying market crashes, and it fucking shows!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's some observations about the market from a paranoid mere fleshy balls. This post will discuss forecasting and trading bear market moves using exclusively technical analysis methods. If you're here to troll, that's probably all you need to know and you can skip to the comments section. For anyone else, let's apply some mathematics and market geometry (We're just going look at some lines, relax).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThrough this post I'll provide some evidence for the following things, which most people think can not be true;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Paradoxical truths about market tops**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* All assets top and drop in a pretty similar fashion\n\nIt's possible to study the charting patterns and market conditions of the Dow Jones through the years 1927 - 1931 and then use the same principles learned from that to apply to a GME crash in 2021. Understanding how the SPX topped and dropped in 2007 can supply you with a model to understand the recent drops in stocks like PLTR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Most topping and bottoming areas in a market can be approximated months/years before they fill\n\nThere were methods to approximate the high point before the Great Depression (1929) from as far back as 1908 - 1918. The level where VIAC made its spectacular high and entered into capitulation could have been defined as early as 2009. Crashes, historically, have always had strong forward looking indicators to hint at them coming, long in advance of them coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Fundamental news compliments technical support and resistance levels / known chart patterns\n\nThis is the one that fucks most people up. Your mind seeks out a logical chain of cause and effect and it therefore stands to reason new causes bring about new effects and these could not be foreseeable using technical analysis. But didn't you see all the bears in 2019? From a technical perspective, the March 2020 drop was one of the most anticipated drops ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short, if you're not using the magic lines you might just have no fucking idea what is going on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know how dumb all of that sounds, so let's move into applying some models to support these big claims. We'll start with having a look at some historical crashes in the SPX and DJI. This is where a lot of these concepts were taken from. Analysis of every drop in the DJI or SPX over the last 100 and something years. Looking for consistencies in these drops, finding forward looking rules that would have forecast them and then designing trading patterns to take advantage of these moves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suppose the first thing one would want to do before seeing if you can apply charting patterns from the Dow in the 1900's to the Dow of the 2000's would be to check how well the Dow or today and then relate to each other. Because there should be no relationship, right? Tech's changed. World's moved on. Etc etc. Should be no obvious matching points in these markets, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start with the two most famous crashes that no one ever remembers because a much more famous one came after. The 1908 and 1918 bears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**1908's Panic Crash**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 1908 there was a 50% drop in the stock market. This was a camel crash. With two crashes happening within close proximity to each other.\n\nBefore both of the crashes here the market sold off, and then made 1.62 expansions into the high.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkaroqksmu471.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d176582f7f4bdefe63fd39ec127421e8674a9b6\n\n \n\nFrom the topping swings the full drop in the respective crashes were into the 1.61 on the left and into the 2.61 on the right.\n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aa14v3nwmu471.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b4adb6d4d19829452131dffe2f1c61cb0c8bd7\n\n \n\nIn both crashes the fall would stop around 76/78% of the last upswing. The second would make a low a tiny bit under the first.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9ztjlazmu471.png?width=1381&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc021bb1660617b3d139239b6c12b808d32aa5ce\n\n \n\nBoth moves would extend about 500% of the little topping move.

One on the busting of the tech bubble in 2000 and the other when investment banks sold time bombs to the market during 2006 and they blew up heading into 2008.

None of this was curve-fitted to the move after. Everything I am posting now I posted at the time.\n\nIt started with the 161 high. Spiking a little above there but then settling under there in the retest and this would mark out the top of the move.

Not only a warning if would drop more, but also told us we should be looking for some sort of harmonic pattern to tell us where we should be looking for the drop to start.

Takes the market down about 50%. And then from that 50% down it entered into a dummy rally / bull trap, which ends up forming as bearish butterfly before the real sell off begins.\n\nAnd after GME dropped pretty much the exact same percentage - the same sequence of swings would happen to set up the same move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sfaeulxqnu471.png?width=1364&format=png&auto=webp&s=965b6c71c5417c9d2508c8fb6b6e1df5253d5e40\n\n \n\nAt which point, this forecast could be made.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anq1ubrsnu471.png?width=1358&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a480db307d0d3e8d62250936489c952dbbf8324\n\n \n\nWhich would be a pretty accurate representation of the GME move that would follow.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h384kzjunu471.png?width=1449&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9f9a4e7cf3be981287148495784f69e9d6322a3\n\n \n\nThese same principles could later be applied to AMC.\n\nMaking a top on the 161.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b5etiuwwnu471.png?width=1460&format=png&auto=webp&s=bafa42120a0ce9d5c37677796f4762ad106914bc\n\n \n\nIt would then drop 50% before entering into a bull trap rally and then settle into this long slow ranging pattern.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxpulvnznu471.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=28cfa52f48b7d507fa24dd69782fefac18b7e4aa\n\n \n\nUsing the basic rules covered so far, this would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucn2qlq1ou471.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=f920e389f0dec9de770cae4cd9e81a4420f77e8e\n\n As with the GME move at the time, this AMC move is read as a bull flag by the AMC buyers.

Analyst coverage breadth is considerable, with most analysts in the 20/share range. WISH got beat up pretty badly at the beginning of the year along with nearly all of growth, but the technicals are pointing to a reversal. MACD is curling back up on the weekly chart, RSI is not overbought on the daily (around 49), we have seen follow through, and sector rotation back into growth is encouraging. Multiple time frames show price action curling back up after finding solid support in the high 7’s, and there is significant room to the upside short term before first fib level around $12. Shares profited % is only 6% and change - which can point to much more room to the upside.
