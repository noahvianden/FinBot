Profit targets and loss prevention.\n\nProfit target: of 50% for one-off bull puts. For rolling strategies I get a little more advanced but let's keep it simple for now and say about 75% and tend to leg-out of the strategy by covering some short legs, leaving some long legs as a hedge when the strategy goes my way early, with plenty of time value remaining and I get to roll the strategy out with basically free protection.\n\nLoss prevention: I don't have a stop-loss, I generally don't enter a trade unless in the first place I were willing to accept exercise/assignment on both legs. I still don't allow that to occur, I will close the trade prior to expiration if both legs ITM at expiration. MOST IMPORTANTLY, if only one leg is ITM at expiration (the short leg), I will exit the strategy to prevent an equity position. If only the short put is assigned, then that equates to fulfilling my **obligation to buy**, and I don't want to tie up my equity in shares. I'd rather just close it out and maybe roll the spread to a lower expiration. Fortunately in the now two year bull market we've enjoyed, this has very rarely occurred. \n\nWhat I have seen is that this **neutral/bullish** strategy is very nice for kangaroo patterns, which we've seen a lot of lately. If I were long stock, it would often end up right back where it started. If long calls, they might expire worthless after a brief pump in premium. But the bull put is great. The best part is when the leftover puts become profitable, and I maybe sell them or leg into a spread on them. \n\nYou are asking all the right questions to make sure you understand the opening/closing criteria, max profit, max risks and realistic profit targets.

The per-contract fees just make it impossible to make money (or at least not enough money to bother) on anything that isn't giving you at least a $1.00 per contract profit, and really more than that. I will confess I'm having some uncharacteristic difficulty grasping how anyone makes money at this. For example:\n\nThis morning I scalped AAPL on 6/25 put options that were going to expire in a couple of hours when the market closed. I took a gamble that the stock was going to continue to drop for the rest of the session, so the put options I was looking at were likely to increase in value a little bit. However, given the short time frame and the risk of them expiring worthless, rather than buying, say, 10 contracts with the expectation that their price goes up by $0.50 or $1 and then selling, I decided I'll buy 50 contracts and sell when price goes up $0.02 per contract, thus netting $100 (less commission) in a very short time. Under the circumstances, it was a really good bet for a fast turnaround of a nice profit, and something I could theoretically do multiple times a day with any number of companies.\n\nSo that's what I did and that's what happened, and I think things are great until I look at my realized gains and 'realize' that I just handed my brokerage 2/3 of that $100 because of the contract fees. And I still have to pay taxes on the full amount (with some adjustment for the fees), so I either didn't make anything or so little that it was total waste of time other than proof of concept for me.\n\nSo this leads me to the question of whether anyone actually makes any money doing these kinds of trades and if so, how? Do people just not do this, unless they're using one of the very few brokerages that don't charge a per-contract fee? I wouldn't use this angle as the only play in my playbook but it's a good one to have, considering how many opportunities there are for this kind of approach, esp. with options that are about to expire. I realize it's a risky trade but the parameters I had set for myself would have kept the risk to loss pretty low, particularly on a stock like AAPL.\n\nThis realization has really put a bee in my bonnet because I feel like now I have to change brokerages to RH (not happening) or Webull, who I don't trust with my money and financial info, in order to have this as a potential play to make, or just abandon it as a tactic.\n\nI'm really curious to hear others' thoughts on this and what people do, if anything, to get around this. I keep thinking about the math of these contract fees and the only way it seems to pan out is if you make a lot of money on a each contract and just open fewer of them, or you only write them, but even then you have to make a significant amount on each one to offset that fee. It looks like the only approach to consistent profit is as with opening or closing as few contracts as possible for as much return as you can, instead of the other way around.

You should know the answer to this question in your sleep before you put any real money at risk in option trading.\n\nDebit trades, which are option trades you buy to open, are all about leverage. Leverage is getting $1 to do the work of $X, where X > 1. Like 10x leverage means $1 is doing the work that would normally require $10 to do. \n\nFor example, suppose shares of XYZ cost $200. So 100 shares would cost $20k. You think XYZ will gain 10% in the next 30 days (go from $200 to $220). On 100 shares that is a profit of $2000. Without leverage, you need to put up $20k in order to make $2000, if you win. But suppose you can buy a call for $20 ($2000) and that call has to potential to have a 100% gain to $40 ($4000). The profit on that call would be the same $2000, but you only had to have $2k at risk, instead of $20k. That means that call had 10x leverage.\n\nIn general, that means that calls with less up front cost vs. shares have higher leverage.\n\nBut, everything in options trading is a trade-off, so higher leverage means you have to give something up, and that something is delta, or the rate of payoff when you win. Lower cost calls tend to have lower delta. In the above example, we had forecast a $20 gain in the underlying. A single share gains in value $1 for every $1 rise in the stock price (equivalent of 100 delta). A low cost call might have a much smaller delta, like 5. That means that a $1 gain in the underlying might only make $0.05 on the call. So even though there is a potential for your call play to get you 10x leverage on your investment dollars, the call has to work 20x harder to make $1 of profit vs. shares.\n\nOnly at the beginning, though. As the value of underlying stock rises, the delta on the call will also rise. So while the first $1 that call makes might need to do 20x the work, the next $1 might only need 15x, and the next only 8x, and so on, until the call is deep ITM and earning close to $1 for every $1 the stock goes up.\n\nSo, the answer to your question should be obvious now.

IF that happens, what will be my net gain/loss on this trade?\n\nAssign, not \"execute\". Basically you never want a short leg to be assigned, because you generally lose money. There's not enough information to give an exact total of gains and losses, but a short call receives cash and delivers shares. So you'd be getting cash at $30/share for shares worth  $31/share, so there's a $1/share loss built into that exercise, offset by the credit received, and you'd be short 100 shares of X that you'd have to buy to cover at some point.\n\nSo for example, let's say by the time you can cover the short, X has risen to $33/share. You have to pay $3300 to cover. You only received $3000 + 278 for the credit, so your net loss is 3000 + 278 - 3300 = -$22.\n\n----------\n\nOkay, now about the PMCC itself. The expiration on the short leg it too long. With such a long rolling interval, you may be stuck with that position for months before it hits your rolling profit target.

I haven't read much about either being ATM, but even with this setup, the 75% isn't fulfilled. The only time this seems to be the case is if the call sold near expiration is sold ITM.\n\nWhat am I missing?

I could look up the delta and tell you how low your probability of profit is.\n\nAs a general rule, don't trade credit for longer than 60 days. Too much can happen by December that could ruin the position. Also, credit trades rely on theta decay to recoup premium. Going so far out means your initial theta decay will be tiny on a daily basis. You'll have to hold the position for months before you can make a decent profit on closing.\n\nYour statement is only true if you hold through expiration. But why would you do that? That's such a long hold for such a small profit.\n\nLet's play out that expiration. Let's say the stock has risen to $18. A short put delivers cash and receives shares. So you'd have to pay $20/share for something that is only worth $18/share, so that's a $2 loss. But you have a $7/share credit. So you net a $5/share gain + you now own 100 shares. Meanwhile, you tied up $2000 in cash as collateral (assuming this is a CSP) for 6 months that could have been put to work on other trades. Maybe those other trades would have netted out to more than $500, maybe not.\n\nAnother thing to consider is what if the shares themselves grow more than your expected net profit? Suppose the shares end up at $35 by December? Since the put will expire OTM, you keep all $7/share in credit, but if you had just bought shares at the time you opened the put, you would have doubled your money (100% gain vs. 35% gain).\n\nYou also might want to ask yourself *why* the market is offering more than 2x parity on that ITM contract?

I've yet to hear a convincing answer to this question.\n\nPeople have Tesla's price up so high not because it's about EVs, but because they're delivering rapid growth year over year. They're expected to continue growing 30 to 40 percent year over year for a number of years as they continue building more gigafactories. I see little chance of established automakers like GM ever putting up those kinds of numbers no matter how successful their transition to EVs is.\n\nGM's best hope for growth quite frankly is if a number of other automakers fail to make the transition to EVs and go bankrupt, allowing the survivors like GM to cannibalize their market share. But there's a problem with making this into your bullish thesis for why GM will grow a bunch from EVs. If a lot of other automakers can't transition to EV's then chances are GM will run into a lot of the same troubles that prevented those automakers from transitioning to EVs. So what's your explanation for how GM will overcome those problems and thrive while other automakers will fail to overcome those problems and collapse?\n\nRealistically I think the best case scenario for GM is their sales numbers stay roughly where they are today after an expensive transition to EVs.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "GM doesn't need to build factories...they already have them. \n\nGM doesn't \"need\" to grow 30-40% a year to be profitable.

(From what I've read/heard, I don't own one.) \n\nTesla also has a few hundred labor violations claims upcoming in court soon.

That's why their cost will be lower than other EV makers while having equal or better performance. A large percentage of EV vehicles will be the cost of batteries. GM is expected to reduce the cost of battery cells to $75 per kilowatt hour by 2025 while Tesla is already targeting a $50 per kilowatt hour by the same timeframe.\n\nYou also need to convert your factories. ICE vehicles cannot be constructed using manufacturing designed for EV's and vice-versa. Tesla is fully EV so there is no conversion process that GM will undoubtedly have to face as a learning curve.\n\nTesla is expected to produce a $25,000 sedan by late 2022. My assumption is mid 2023 is a better estimate. NOTHING GM is expected to produce will beat that value.\n\nYou also completely ignore the beauty of a Tesla... their autopilot system is designed for the future. GM's Cruise is severely underwhelming and unlikely to be anywhere close to what Tesla has. Tesla's autonomous driving already logged 500 million self-driving miles during year 2018. GM only logged 447k miles. GM is way behind in terms of research and development.\n\nYour regulatory credits is a terrible argument. Is it helping Tesla? Sure. But the fact that the regulatory credits continue climbing show that plenty of other auto companies are still lagging behind which means Tesla's lead continues to grow. Companies also plan their spending based on what they expect to receive. If regulatory credits didn't exist, Tesla would change other parts of their business. That regulatory revenue just means Tesla has more money to play with but it doesn't decide the fate of their business. It's just what novices like to point to when they try and discredit the sustainability of Tesla.\n\nThe government rebate, which I believe you are referring to as tax credits, already expired for Tesla years ago during July 2018... The individuals purchasing Tesla's right now are not receiving a federal tax credit. GM also doesn't have any federal tax credits as well. If this isn't what you mean by government rebate, please tell me which one you are specifically referring to.\n\nMy relatives own Teslas. The build quality could be better but Tesla is still relatively new at the mass manufacturing part of constructing vehicles. Could they be better? Definitely. But the build quality isn't 'trash.' And it will improve as they gain more experience. Constructing EV's isn't cheap. That's why GM is planning to spend $35 billion. There will be a learning curve for GM just like there was for Tesla.\n\nAs for the labor claims, many auto companies end up dealing with labor claims. GM has one right now in Mexico. Stop acting as if these labor claims are going to defunct Tesla's business. They will be handled accordingly and your assumption that they will have a 'hard time' shows that you haven't really paid attention to numerous labor claims that have happened for auto companies for many decades now. They aren't new concerns.\n\nAsk yourself why almost every Tesla produced is sold. They have very low inventory which is why they are ramping up factories with the Berlin factory being a huge gamechanger for Tesla vehicles in Europe.

And selling those credits to other industrial facilities is what Tesla actually makes money on. They lose money with every vehicle produced. They can afford to operate that way, because of those credits. \n\nThe labor issues...yes... all manufactures deal with them. The big three are union, and have a way to deal with them.

So if you add 10 m/s over 1 second (1g) for a 2,000 kg ton car, \n\nWhen you're stationary going from 0 to 10 m/s (22mph) that adds 134 hp.\n\nWhen you're at top speed going from 200 mph to 222 mph that adds 2,532 hp.\n\nSo a 1000hp car with cold gas thrusters would be like a 3,532hp car. Also with cold gas thrusters it's ridiculously easy to make even higher power. You literally just get a larger pipe and nozzle from your gas tank. To make 20 kN from a 10,000 psi tank you need a 8 cm diameter nozzle (12 cm long), to make 10g (200 kN) you need a 25.45 cm diameter nozzle (39 cm long). That's still kinda possible if you really wanted. You would be trading a 10 second burn to a 1 second burn, and running a air compressor it would take around 35% battery charge to repressurize the tank.\n\nIf you burn at 10g with a car already moving at 250 mph (roadster top speed), then that's a 43,385 hp cold gas thruster.

You're right about that entire thing really, drag should mean that the peak horsepower you reach is slightly less. It just makes the calculations easier assuming air resistance is negligible. Really the better thing would have been to take the limit.\n\n1/2 \\* m ( (v+a\\*t)\\^2 - v\\^2) / t as t->0\n\nThat just becomes m\\*a\\*v, [https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2000+kg+\\*10+m%2Fs%5E2+\\*200+mph+in+hp](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2000+kg+*10+m%2Fs%5E2+*200+mph+in+hp)\n\nSo instantaneous power would be 2398 hp instead of 2523 hp assuming you stay at 200 mph the entire time (which is a single instant).\n\nI mean, if you do account for the air resistance and take the Model S profile with a air coefficient of 0.23, frontal area of 2.22 m\\^2 then you get that at 200 mph it's 300 hp in air drag. This part would be counteracted by the normal wheels, ideally you would have accelerated to 210 mph, where air drag is 347 hp, so momentaneously at 200 mph the cold gas thrusters add 2398 mph, once you reach 210 mph the power from the thrusters have increased to 2469 hp and they need to counteract extra 47 hp of drag. Accounting for air resistance you would be accelerating at 9.6 m/s\\^2 instead of 9.8 m/s\\^2, which does turn out pretty negligible in this instance.\n\nIn the second example I did with 10g and 250 mph it does start to get more extreme.   The instantaneous power at 250 mph is actually 29400 hp, and the ideal power at the end, at 419 mph (after 1 second), is 49266 hp instead of constant 43,385 hp. At 420 mph the extra air drag to counteract is 2170 hp.

{"title": "Put Selling Backtest Results, 2019 - 2021 - Higher Returns Compared to SPY, Massively greater Drawdown", "selftext": " **Disclaimers:** *I am aware that 2019 - 2021 was a huge bull run (except for the not-so-little dip in 2020) but the point of this was to try to see how these strategies would have performed with the 2020 dip. I am also completely open to scrutiny and will be willing to release the code if you DM me about it so that we can improve on the backtester together.*\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis backtest aims to compared the results of an ATM Put Writing Strategy (with rolling down) and an ATM Put Writing Strategy that Holds the Strike (ATM HTS). The concept of \"Hold-the-Strike\" was proposed on a SeekingAlpha article (dm me for link) and it essentially involves rolling out to the same strike, even if the Put is ITM. This allows you to collect extrinsic premium while waiting for the market to recover.\n\n**Mechanics**\n\n* 1 ATM contract, sold every 7 days (weeklies)\n* No management, all run to 1 day before expiry and then, depending on strategy:  \n\n   * Rolled to the nearest ATM strike (ATM)\n   * Either rolled up to the ATM strike or held at the ITM strike (ATM HTS)\n\n **Results**\n\n||Cumulative Return (%)|Sharpe|Sortino|Max Drawdown (%)|Avg Drawdown Days|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPY (Buy and Hold)|48.48|0.77|1.05|\\-33.72|11|\n|ATM Put|49.56|0.59|0.71|\\-66.07|56|\n|ATM Put (Hold the Strike)|56.74|0.61|1.1|\\-85.61|58|\n\n **Discussion**\n\nFrom the period of 2019 - 2021, we see that ATM Put Writing Strategies beat the market in terms of cumulative returns, with the HTS mechanic appearing to best the standard ATM strategy. As the author of the SeekingAlpha article explains, this is because you don't give up intrinsic value when you roll down. However, two significant points of note are: (1) The drawdowns are significant. The drawdown for the ATM HTS strategy was 85%. Not many people will be able to withstand such a significant drawdown and hence a hedge (such as VXX calls) might be something to compliment it and reduce drawdown. (2) The bounce from the 2020 dip was rapid. This helped the ATM HTS strategy since there was a quick recovery to above the last held ATM strike.\n\nOpen to comments, thoughts, and ideas.

{"title": "Risk Management Advice from a Former Professional... Gambler (aka Practice Discipline)", "selftext": "Hey gang, ex poker player here. Made quite some coin playing poker that I reinvested into successful businesses after the poker boom fell out of favor. The rest of my money, I promptly YOLOed into the market (well before the days of WSB) because I wanted to retire early and figured I would hit my lotto ticket or keep working. Learned the hard lessons, stayed focused on business and slowly built up trading (not gambling) experience.\n\nSo why on Earth would you listen to me?  Precisely because I've been a dumbass in all my dealings (poker, business, stocks) but have stuck each one through long enough to learn from my silly mistakes. I feel that Thetagang has given me much more tools in the quiver and want to pay it forward by helping those with... ahem, degenerate tendencies, and even those without, to understand some proper risk management. So on with the show.\n\n**Rule #1: Always Assume the Worst Case CAN Happen**\n\nLady luck loves nothing better to take her big dick and deflower your naive optimism at every opportunity. Have a bet that you think is a sure thing?  Great, can you \"define\" what a sure thing is in numbers?  Cause if you can't, it's undefined risk and that means you have no idea what you are dealing with. Selling naked call / put options is an undefined risk (unlimited loss). Selling vertical / calendars is a DEFINED risk (you know what you can lose/gain). \n\nI know what you're saying, \"Hey granto, XYZ will *NEVER* hit that strike or ABC could never go bankrupt, it's impossible!\". And of course, I'll say, it's impossible like the chance of a country defaulting on their bonds right?  Like Russia in 90s which blew apart LTCM, one of the fastest rising stars in the hedge fund world with the smartest dudes around?  \n\nSee the thing is, once you start thinking \"It can't happen\" or \"The chance is so small..\" then that's when you're fucked because you're replacing analysis with hope (or worse, ego). See the thing is, 99% isn't impossible. And 90% sure as HELL isn't impossible. And if you can't understand how your trade can go sideways, you are not the smart shark that you think you are. You are the fish. That's why any veteran trader (and I hardly call myself one) rolls their eyes at someone saying they make 1% a week selling FDs. \n\n\n**Rule #2: Size Your Bets Accordingly (SEE Rule #1)**\n\nIf you think you've got a 60% winning bet, do you go all-in?  Fuck no. 80%? Nope. 90%?  Still no!\n\nThis is where Kelly's criterion comes in ([good Reddit thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/mn14jc/kellys_criterion_for_gamblers_one_of_the_most/). In a nutshell, even when you are at a high probability of success, if you make that same bet multiple times with a outsized portion of your assets, you will go broke due to the law of large numbers. \n\nExample: You sell 1 standard deviation SPY call options (approx 30 delta) which assumes your contact expires worthless 68% of the time. Well since you're smarto pants here, you realize 68% isn't *THAT* safe, but two standard deviations (~95% win rate) would be very safe. So you sell 7 delta calls each week jacked to the tits. You're playing it safe, right?\n\nWell, math comes out that your 95% trade over 13 trades  (0.95^13) comes out to a 51% trade. That means if you max your bets for a mere 3 months, you're a coin flip chance of having an assignment. This is why they call it \"picking up pennies before a bulldozer\" and why everyone says *\"It works, until it doesn't\"*. \n\nSo how much should you bet?  Most people say never more than 5-10% of your portfolio on any one position; and I mean that any one position should only have risk exposure of said 5-10%. If you short GME/AMC/MEME using 10% of your margin, then god bless and pray to not meet your maker because your risk is once again, undefined (unlimited). The reason the 5-10% exists is because you need to assume that your position can/will move against you AGAINST ALL ODDS and you need to limit your damage and exposure.\n\nThere are MANY, MANY smart players out there that have gone bust simply because of poor bankroll management. Once you're wiped out, you're gone. No more bets, no more opportunities. Even a 50% loss sets you back YEARS. When the game is based around compounding numbers, any significant portfolio losses is incredibly damaging to your ability to play the game.\n\n\n**Rule #3: Set Loss Boundaries and Know When To Exit**\n\nThis is really important. Unlike the top two, which are based on hedging against the unknown, Rule #3 is hedging against your dumb ass self. Why? Because every gambler has that moment when he says: *\"Fuck this, I'm doubling down!\"* \n\nThat's a GREAT sign?  Why?  Because it's your own personal stop loss indicator, so that you know you are no longer able to trade rationally. Once you're angry, bitter or trying to win back a loss, now you're in gambling territory my friend. Emotions are high, you want to prove to yourself, Mr. Market, your wife who rolls her eyes that \"No no no, I am toooootally right!\". Sure thing bud, but let's cool off first and exit your trade and put down your phone before someone gets hurt\".\n\nCreating pre-defined exit boundaries are a requirement because it takes the decision making process out of the equation when you are least capable of making a decision. Otherwise, when your short on AMC is going to the moon and your face is melting off, you're not screaming at the invisible buy-side action telling them how right you are and that you'll hold until your account implodes. \n\nClosing gains from 50-80% seems pretty common here. Selling insurance means that losses can quickly escalate far beyond your basis so it's important to put in your stops before it gets away. Where is your own risk tolerance, but mine is is variable depending on the volatility and delta, but as a general rule, if you set your losses to match your gains or even at double, you've at least defined an exit point.\n\nThe all too common theme at a poker table is the solid player who loses a big hand that he should have won, then proceeds to go on tilt and proceeds to take a single loss into a whirlwind of loses trying to make ever riskier plays. So of course our next rule is...\n\n\n**Rule #4: Don't Risk What You Can't Afford**\n\nI know I'm going to get hell for this, but trading on margin (without well defined risk params) is an invitation for the reaper. Again, if you don't understand how your trade can go south, trading on margin is NOT FOR YOU. If you're hedged with delta all which ways with tight stops, then play big league ball all you want. If your thesis is that SPX goes up 7% per year annualized, margin interest is 4% and your bright play is piling into nothing but high beta SPX plays because you think a 3% arb somehow equates to risk free long term gains... then please god re-read rule #2. \n\nI'm sure I'm clear on this already, but if you don't understand or have conviction in the bet you are making, then don't make the bet or make it manageable (small). Most disciplined investors either throw an allocation into a \"safe\" asset such as an indexed ETF or mutual fund, then put the rest aside for gambling and fun times. That way, if you get caught in the worse way, you're not panicking or on a bender trying to recover. There were dudes in here yelling the end was nigh with a 3% correction a few months ago and if they rode the major crashes like '08, I can't even imagine how jacked they would be. If you're going to gamble, do it responsibly.\n\nWhen I was young, the worst thing that happened was getting a fuck ton of margin, having a big ego and making a rash of successful plays early. Idiots success is a hell of a drug. A margin call is a hell of a morning wake up. **LUCKILY** even my dumbass was smart enough to stash away a pile of money to protect it from myself. Which leads me to...\n\n\n**Rule #5: You're Not That Smart, So Don't Bet 100% On Yourself**\n\nThe rule we all hate. I hate it with a passion. I *really* enjoy being smart. I'm great at a lot of things. I am not, however, smarter than the market. But, after much hard lessons, I do have enough self reflection to realize that I enjoy options exactly because of it's gambling like nature. And if I keep telling myself that my bets are because I am smart, I may eventually begin to delude myself into thinking so and not question my dumb ass decisions. \n\nLet's face it, we all know (or SHOULD KNOW) that the majority of hedge funds don't beat the market. Holding index funds will beat just about any other strategy time and time again. Yet why do we do this?  Because it's fun... and because we all think just *mayyybe* we'll continue to beat the market, because maybe you currently do or think you can. \n\nSo don't get ahead of yourself. You're not the next Buffet. A YOLO play with 2000% returns does not make you a smart investor. Getting away with selling insurance in a bull market doesn't make you an smart investor. It doesn't make you stupid either. But over 20 years, let's see how you do. And if you're a billionaire, fucking kudos to you and your big dick. To everyone else, stay humble, donate to your local ETF.\n\n\n**Rule #6: Don't Force Opportunities, Be Patient for High Probability Scenarios**\n\nI've often sat down at a game and realized that it's just not a good game for whatever reason (slow pace, grumpy players, bad cards, etc). The wrong thing is to sit down and try to grind out when there's nothing to be gained. This is where the Bogle / Buffet type investors have it right, because they just jam their meat into SPY and let it slow cook for a few decades while they enjoy the sunlight, outdoors and get shit done.\n\nThetagang is thetagang for a reason... it's great to just sit and let your thesis play out and hopefully take your winnings. But sometimes I've invested a lot of time into my current plays and just don't have a good one out there that I have conviction of. So I won't force it or concentrate my bet. I *always* know it's time to chill out when I think \"Hmm... this is going slow, maybe I'll just sell a few more CSPs on the same ticker on another date/strike\". Because when I do, that violates Rule #2 for bet sizing. \n\nEach player/trader has their own set of signals they they go by. If I'm not getting most of my signals, then I'm just not going to play, because otherwise I'm gambling. It's like shorting/buying AMC. Do I have long term thesis that I'm willing to stick to?  Or am I just hoping to run in and scalp?  If I believe it will collapse, then I'm at least going to look for a number of entry point indicators to go in vs just willy nilly jumping in. \n\n\n**Rule #7: Never Forget You Are Trading Against a Headwind aka The House Always Wins**\n\nThis isn't exactly risk, but don't ever forget this rule, especially since we're all trading options here. The bid/ask spreads will murder you if you are going in and out of them frequently. Many spreads hover around 10%. The terrible ones are over 20%. Plus you've got your brokerage commissions on top. If you're round tripping 200 options on a vertical call with a 10% spread, that's 20% + $260 (@ 0.65 per trade). That is a HUGE headwind. Now obviously as thetagang, the hope here is the value decreases so that you're closing the call at a much lower value so the spread at close is a much smaller % vs your basis. \n\nThat said, being a monkey trader that is maxing out margin, being forced to close trades when you don't want to, or playing too many highly volatile stocks that stop you out of a trade before your desired point is a big win for the house. Say your monkey thesis is that ZIM is going on a bull run, you sell a put, only to have it turn against you the next week, you're now in a difficult position of accepting your thesis is wrong and closing out, waiting it out until you hit your safety eject number, or stubbornly hold until the cows and margin call comes home.\n\n\n**Rule #8: Be Aware That You Have Blind Spots**\n\nI should probably call this \"Beware of Black Swans\" or improbable events that are outside of what you think is probable. This concept was made famous by Nassim Taleb, an options trader who made hundreds of millions by \"exploiting\" the Black-Scholes options pricing model, which Taleb claims does not price options correctly (too cheap on the edges, too expensive near the money, due to the gaussian curve not representing risk properly... but I am not a mathematician, so please don't skewer me for my ad hoc summary). In English, this is rule #1 on steroids - it's not just the worst situation YOU can think of, but what's the worst case situation you CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO THINK OF?\n\nMany people think this is like a futile exercise because how can you hedge against say, an asteroid or nuke from North Korea that falls into \"acts of god\" realms of probability. But as we saw with BTC, China is moving against BTC in a major way and miners are moving to the US. Will the US ban Bitcoin?  Obviously, **I don't know** but the probability *exists*. How you trade that is beyond my pay grade. But, if you aren't even cognizant to the fact that *BTC could be banned* then you are trading with a blind spot.\n\nSo, this goes closely with Rule #5. You're just not that smart or reflective enough to see your own shortcomings. \n\n.. Anyhow, my dumbass thought this would be a pay it forward for those who may be on the path to making the same mistakes I once did. Thank you to everyone here that contributes and continues to have patience. I am still learning and appreciate you all.\n\nTLDR: Risk is overrated. Concentration makes you rich.

Then I bought 700 shares of SQ at $11.39. That is when it took off. Took about 2 years to hit $100k. Then bounced around a lot because SQ sold off and sort of went sideways for a year and I figured I'd just hold it forever. In early August 2019, I was already back down to like $85k, and then SQ dropped like 20% in a couple days, and I panic sold... sat on the cash for months waiting for a lower re-entry, but never found it.

Putting memes aside, not only is the company overvalued, but there's really nothing set in store for the future (IMO). Many traders took his advice and bought it shortly before their recent earnings report.  I'm sad to report they took the bait and lost over 30% of their investment. If I had to take a guess, those invested in GME probably lost over $100K. What also grinds my gears is that he keeps saying there's going to be a rebound very soon as they hope for the best. At one point, I asked him how much did he invest in GME. He told me to GTFO threatened to call the police if I didn't leave. Makes me wonder if he's intentionally giving false advise to ruin others' financial lives.\n\nOn another sidenote, IMO, I believe that GME was also the mastermind in the rise of meme stocks. Please note that I don't have any evidence supporting my claim and is clearly speculation. I ask myself, why was it GME that was shorted and not some other company with similar financial settings? Short squeezing is nothing new to the markets. My belief is that GME intentionally inflated the markets so that they can sell their own stock at those inflated prices. Granted, it appears they haven't sold any yet based from SEC guidelines, but it may be their ultimate goal in the longer run. GME is a morally bankrupt company when it comes to ethics, and this wouldn't surprise me based on their controversies from the past. I believe they're doing whatever it takes to take another quick buck to keep the business alive, even at the expense of their employees and customers.\n\ntldr; Don't let your feelings get the best of you in the markets.

{"title": "Why inflation is here, and how to actually make money on it (hint: it’s not shorting indexes)", "selftext": "It’s no real secret that inflation is here. And it’s not “transitory.” Especially once wages start increasing, as those are extremely difficult if not impossible to bring back down.\n\nCurrently there are shortages in everything. Homes, cars, services, computer chips, even my local BBQ place ran out of brisket. Why is this? It’s not because every single thing has happened to have a shortage at the same time, it’s because everything is under priced from it’s fair value. The supply/demand curve that we all learn in high school economics, where it meets in the middle and that creates your price, is currently not in the middle. Places are charging prices that are way too cheap, because they haven’t gotten on board yet / are phasing it slowly to not cause negative PR. In capitalism things should never be out of supply, that means they’re not priced correctly.\n\nHow to make money on this\n\nSo you understand that inflation = bad. You also understand indexes going down = bad. So you figure, since both are bad they are correlated. And puts on indexes is the play. If you think this you’re not alone, many hedge funds and large institutions believe this. You all have something in common though, you’re all retarded.\n\nInflation is nuanced. It’s horrible, but there is one good thing to inflation, and the reason the government causes it. It makes stock prices go uppies \n\nSo if you understand inflation is coming, what do you do? A bull may just begin buying calls on all the indexes, which will most likely pay off. But if you want to maximize profits. You should do the following.\n\nCalls on $Commodities \n\nCommodities do the best under inflation, as they are the first step in a supply chain, and so the first thing that raises prices. Steel, livestock, these are all exceptionally good plays. Stay away from precious metals, they’re just pure speculation \n\nPuts on $TLT\n\nWhen inflation happens, after the initial retard panic selling we saw last week, investors quickly realize they need to be in something (like stocks) to preserve their wealth, and that cash is useless. Bond yields shoot up, and puts on bonds can make a fortune \n\nThese 2 plays hedge you perfectly for any inflation fears. The worse inflation gets, the more these 2 plays are guaranteed to print. Not all other inflation hedges can say that\n\nEdit: positions: 410 CLF 23 calls august 20 expiration, 275 TLT 139 puts September 17th expiration.

{"title": "$WISH Fundamentals and Highlights", "selftext": "\\-Wish is a market place that functions as a two-sided marketplace with over 100M monthly active users in 100+ countries. These users are met with nearly 500k merchants with 50k established physical Wish Local locations and offer over 150 million products. There are very few marketplaces of this scale in the world today\n\n\\-Something that really excite me about Wish is the fact that CEO rejected the acquisition offer from Amazon and Alibaba FOR USD 10BILLIONS IN 2015! And we are in 2021 with the e-commerce revolution (boosted by quarantine) at only 8 Billion with the price of today\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/wish-rumored-to-reject-acquisition-offers-from-amazon-and-alibaba-2015-11](https://www.businessinsider.com/wish-rumored-to-reject-acquisition-offers-from-amazon-and-alibaba-2015-11) \n\n\\-Wish is a marketplace developed to offer Value and Discovery products. It means that you can find rare products and/or cheap products. Its sounds obviously but not all the e-commerce have the same focus. For example, Home Depot has the home improvement nich, Saks Fith Avenue has the luxury nich, and etc... So, you need to know where Wish is focusing to understand the company. You can see the average income of a Wish user is $50k-55k while the Amazon prime is $69k\n\nAnd it's being very popular\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8pzsd0jpo671.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4968ba122f99ded2918763eba9ab3de2096d7df\n\n\\-Ratios are good, taking into account the peers\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hhozlh2hqo671.png?width=415&format=png&auto=webp&s=f421ba57ae420fdfd75b85879b87aaccedeee0ba\n\nAnd has the best revenue per employee in the marketplaces \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4totkrhso671.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&s=60f6b5a9d4e3b6ec8db3fa115a6140ca65dffe92\n\n\\-Wish dont process payments FOR NOW... But I think they will develop that area as AMZN and EBAY did. There is a big bussines there. You can see how MercadoLibre increased his earnings when he launched MercadoPago\n\n\\- Wish is building out what we call a decentralized fulfillment model. Where they look to connect logistics rather than own logistics. By building out an asset light network they can quickly adapt to demand. Wish Local is a critical component as it becomes the last mile warehousing at essentially no marginal cost. To be critical, there are growing pains in this model as Wish becomes dependent on a hyper localized merchant base that is turning into the “face” of the company \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7tq04w7so671.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f3f105d7ed8308d9c074e92b2f5b4921824cb00\n\n\\-Bad Things? There are a lot customers complaints about delivery problems, but I think they can solve it easy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I think this is the most important things about the company. I will not post any technical analysis and before you ask me: NO, IT'S NOT HEAVILY SHORTED. It only has an 5,84% short interest\n\nLong here with 7500 shares, I see USD 30 by the end of year", "id": "o565qc", "created_utc": 1624311162.0, "score": 648, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|17|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o4zo8j/wish_analysis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o565qc/wish_fundamentals_and_highlights/) \n**Account Age**|4 months ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey OP, **positions or ban.**", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No position?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just saw a penis pump on wish for 14 dollars you son of a bitch I’m in", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": " Send me link so I can purchase….to help their numbers, and my wife’s boyfriend of\nCourse", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is actually a secret message telling share holders we're about to pump past 14$ or.... you're on my page, if thats the case.. its used.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fr.. link us", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "$30 by end of year?
