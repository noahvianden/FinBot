If the stock does not go above the $30 (well the break even for the buyer will be slightly above that), then the contract will not be executed, it will expire worthless and I keep my shares.\n\nNow if the stock does go above the break even price, it will more then likely executed, which then I sell the 100 shares per contract sold to the holder of the contract, for $30 a share. \n\nIf this is all correct, my risk is my shares, but since the strike prices is a price I would be happy with selling them, the risk is low.

The ATM bid/ask should be no wider than 10% of the bid. Further from ATM in either direction I'll go as high as 20% of the bid at that strike. For example, if the ATM bid/ask is $1.20/$1.50, the width is $.30 and 10% of $1.20 is $0.12, so it's too wide and I would not trade that option chain.\n\n\nThat said, I do look for ATM volume over 100 after at least 1 hour of trading (more than 1 hour since the open) and I'll go down to 10 volume further from ATM, but again, the bid/ask takes precedent. I'll happily trade an 8% spread that has 0 volume.\n\nOI is literally yesterday's news, so I don't use it for trading decisions.\n\nUsing your 480 example, the bid/ask is 21.71/23.50 on only 2 volume. The width is $1.79 and 20% of 21.71 is $4.34, so even though the volume is only 2, the strike is liquid enough for me to consider trading it.\n\n----------------\n\nNow, all that said, I never trade expirations that are greater than 60 days (with a few specialized exceptions, like a synthetic stock).

We want you to understand the characteristics and heightened risks of leveraged and inverse exchange-traded products (ETPs) before proceeding with thinkorswim (\"TOS\"). You acknowledge that if you choose to trade these products now or in the future, you are an experienced trader and have a high-risk tolerance. We are requiring all clients who use TOS to review and complete the attestation at the bottom of this page even if you do not currently hold or intend to trade any leveraged and inverse ETPs.  RISKS OF INVESTING IN LEVERAGED AND INVERSE ETPs Investing in leveraged and inverse ETPs involves heightened risks and is not appropriate for most investors. - Leveraged and inverse ETPs seek to deliver multiples of the short-term performance (or the opposite of the performance) of the index or benchmark they track. - For most of these products, the amount of leveraged or inverse exposure resets each day. - The daily resetting has a compounding effect that can cause these securities to perform worse than their multiple would suggest over any period longer than one day. This effect can be magnified in volatile markets. - It is important to remember that most of these securities are designed for daily use only and are not intended to be held overnight or long term.  ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION For additional information, please see the Securities and Exchange Commission's Investor Alert Leveraged and Inverse ETFs: Specialized Products with Extra Risks for Buy-and-Hold Investors (Link Here: https://sec.gov/investor/pubs/leveragedetfs-alert.htm ) and review the information that follows below. \"You can also learn more about trading these products by reviewing the \"Leveraged, Inverse and Commodity ETPs Disclaimers\" document. Link here: https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en\\_us/resources/pdf/TDA101509.pdf  Leveraged products are mutual funds, ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and ETNs (exchange-traded notes) which typically use derivatives to attempt to multiply the returns of the underlying index. Both leveraged and inverse products mark returns based on the daily (or in a few cases, monthly) performance of the underlying index. These securities perform differently than other products. They are likely to be more volatile and are inherently riskier than their non-leveraged, non-inverse counterparts. It is important to remember that these products are generally designed for daily use only and are not intended to be held for multiple days. These are not appropriate for most investors.  How to identify leveraged and inverse products Leveraged products often have a multiplier in their name, such as 2x or 3x, or have a word such as \"ultra\" or \"daily\" in front of their name. These products attempt to deliver some multiple of an index's daily returns (positive or negative). Please consider the implications of multipliers to both the upside and the downside. While it may seem that a 2x multiplier is a benefit in an up-market cycle, it is important to remember that the same multiplier applies when the market moves against the product. This could potentially result in significant losses, and highlights the additional risk associated with leveraged products.  Consider the following example: A 2x leveraged SP 500 fund would seek to double the daily return of the SP 500. Therefore, if the SP 500 closed up 10 percent, the fund would seek to return 20 percent. Conversely, if the SP 500 were to close down 10 percent, the value of the fund could decrease by 20 percent.  Inverse products often have either a negative number like -1x or -2x or a term like 'short' or 'inverse' in their names. These products attempt to move in the opposite direction of an index each day, sometimes twice as much or three times as much in the opposite direction. A 2x inverse SP 500 fund would seek to return twice the inverse of the SP 500 for that day.  In this case, if the SP 500 were down 10 percent, the fund would seek to increase by about 20 percent. Conversely, if the SP 500 were up 10 percent, the value of the fund would decrease by about 20 percent.  Other risks associated with trading leveraged and inverse products While leveraged and inverse products have documented risks associated with the use of leverage or shorting, a less-appreciated risk is the effect of compounding on your returns over periods longer than a day. Since these products seek to deliver some multiple of an index�s returns on a daily basis, they must reset the amount of leveraged or inverse exposure they have each day.  This daily reset means that the products will not always deliver their expected multiple. As the markets generally display volatility to the upside as well as the downside, the daily resetting of these products will cause the products to perform worse than their multiple would suggest over any period longer than one day.   Simply stated, there is a compounding effect associated with the daily resets which makes the performance unpredictable if the product is held longer than one day. However, sometimes this daily reset means that the products will do better than their multiple would suggest if markets trend steadily in one direction without reversals, but this is the exception.  Ultimately, while there may be occasions where a leveraged or inverse product may be useful for some types of trading strategies for advanced/professional traders, it is extremely important to understand that when holding for longer than a day, these products may not give you the returns you may be expecting. As with all investments, it is important to read the prospectus and fully understand the product�s investment objectives, investment strategies, risks and costs.

At the same time Tesla stressed that they're focused on creating a new supply chain to account for the increase in raw materials they'll need. \n\nOnce they can reliably produce these batteries they'll be an entire generation ahead of the competition like they were ~5 years ago.

Don't be like the Amazon bears who were making the same statements before Amazon hit scale and started reaping the benefits of their investments during their major growth phase. You're horizon is too short, Longterm TSLA is still undervalued if they continue to hit their targets. Their forward P/E is much much lower as they begin to capture more of the value of all the massive investments they've been making in recent years. This is why you see many price targets in excess of 1k.\n\nAlso you're not considering a lot of factors. Tesla captures more value in the value chain given they're more vertically integrated, so for instance they deliver direct to customers capturing the value dealerships take from traditional auto, you can buy auto insurance from Tesla (still expanding to new states/markets), you pay for charging at Tesla superchargers, Software options and the tremendous margins that come with them that no other traditional auto has currently. Tesla's value captured per vehicle sale is something other auto manufactures can only dream of.\n\nAdditionally look at the long term debt obligations of the traditional Autos compared to Tesla and traditional auto aren't growing, while they're losing their profitable ICE business to attempt to completely change their business plan to electric which isn't profitable for them and may never be.

And I really understand this value because we don't have such businesses of the future that are listed so that the general public can invest, the basket is way small. So don't fomo.

It can be cheaper than buying the stock itself, and if the price skyrockets you can then turn around and sell that option to someone else and pocket the premium. The most you can lose is the $100, but just like stocks the gains are theoretically unlimited.\n\nI typically buy ATM (at the money, which are options that have a strike price around the current price of the stock), or slightly ITM (in the money, meaning it is at or below the current stock price) options, so as long as the stock price goes up and doesn’t go sideways/down before the expiry date you can turn a profit.

{"title": "WORKHORSE FOR THE WORKFORCE: WKHS YOLO + NEWS", "selftext": "**Our Apes, who art in rocket ships, hallowed by thy Workhorse tendies, thy moon will come; thy will be done on WKHS as it is in GME. Give us this day our daily mooning; and forgive us our short selling as we forgive those who short sell against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the hedgies. Amen.**\n\nMy dearest Apes, I speak to you again:\n\nAs you've seen from my previous posts, WKHS is legally battling with Oskosh (OSK) and the USPS over the unlawful recipient of the contract award. Well, here are some more important updates:\n\n[https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0.pdf](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.28.0.pdf)\n\n**I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU THOUROUGHLY READ THE ENTIRETY OF THIS FILING\\^ (IT IS LOADED WITH INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE UNLAWFUL USPS AWARDING)**\n\nThe document has been redacted (presumably due to NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) between the parties.\n\n*\"The USPS’s unreasonable actions directly harm Plaintiff... Had the USPS conducted the procurement in accordance with applicable law, the Solicitation requirements, and fundamental fairness, Workhorse would have been awarded the contract\"*\n\n*The USPS evidently decided early in the NGDV Program that Workhorse would not be the awardee, but it chose not to inform Workhorse of this fact, instead allowing and even encouraging Workhorse to continue to pursue the contract.*\n\n*In the meantime, the USPS put its thumb on the scale against Workhorse. It falsely blamed Workhorse’s prototype vehicle for a “safety incident” that was clearly the result of the USPS driver’s error. It engaged in discussions with Workhorse that improperly failed to meaningfully notify Workhorse of perceived deficiencies in its proposal and that misled Workhorse as to the areas Workhorse needed to address in its updated proposal. And it unfairly evaluated the merits of Workhorse’s proposal, treating Workhorse far more harshly and holding it to far stricter standards, than it did the other offerors.*\n\n*As was the USPS’s design all along, these improper actions left Workhorse with a technical score that ensured it had no fair chance of a contract award.*\n\n***None of this was known to Workhorse.*** \"\n\nAnd the coup de gras:\n\n*\"Workhorse respectfully requests this Court to enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and to provide the following relief:*\n\n*1. Entry of judgment in favor of Plaintiff and against the United States;*\n\n*2. Entry of a declaratory judgment that the award to Oshkosh was unlawful and improper and an injunction directing that the award be terminated;*\n\n*3. Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to reevaluate the offerors’ proposals in accordance with the terms of the Solicitation, applicable laws, and regulations;*\n\n*4. Entry of an injunction directing the USPS to conduct a new best value determination; and*\n\n*5. Such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper\"*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WKHS YOLO:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9kqbhmq92871.png?width=611&format=png&auto=webp&s=c080efa211cf3ce3ad7f9723bd90995ec478092a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1su05rwa2871.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=4899ab513666382e4639aad796efec41bd295752\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkmq7lmxa2871.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=5026e0805ed29faec6ec1417949ef4d496d7057b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vy7pxqeya2871.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b8a57e0fe7323a503d41ab3f010378f79c26373\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i680ke7za2871.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=af42a163d8326270ea6f5d7d0c1edf82a8d4a133\n\n**Now once again, I will reiterate briefly:**\n\n* The contract was awarded to Oshkosh, who cannot confirm neither deny that the company submitted an EV model for durability testing. Nor did they say whether they have performed a powertrain transition swap, swapping out an internal combustion engine transmission for electric counterparts, as the contract stated. (See below)\n* The fact that our favorite hedgies are back at it again, (See their WKHS short position below) is once again short against a company that is purposely being driven down with the help of our Post Master General for his own personal gain.\n\nAs you can tell, the horse community is growing, media mentions are brewing, the short interest is steady, oscillating between 40-60+% depending on who your source are. Currently, we will use ORTEX, although not always 100% accurate:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dqvvo7d1b2871.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=89bbb41d7977fffb99ad654902e86517b612adaf\n\n**OPTION ANAYLSIS:**\n\n[7\\/2 Expiry Option Chain](https://preview.redd.it/650o4h88b2871.png?width=3012&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf252638d3a9784eda0fbb6c19bd7546f683fe7c)\n\n* Above, you can see that I coded shares outstanding as a percentage of WKHS shares tied into calls (meaning they are short). From the image above, you can see that more than 1.65% of shares outstanding sit at the 18 strike. Also, 1.47% shares outstanding are short at the 30 strike. Not to mention, Open Interest Updates the following trading day, so this means that WKHS was short to these percentages as of Friday's trading day close. So, let us take a closer look at the volume.\n* At the 18 Strike there is currently over 37k volume and 20k volume at the 20 strike. This is massive, considering the open interest at the 18 strike currently resides at 22,065. And the 20 OI being 2,863.\n\nHowever, we need to be smart apes. We are competing against the hedgies, let us remember that. So, let us look at the put side. Where is Citadel trying to press us down to?\n\nFrom the looks of it, 15. Which Today, there was 13k volume in the 15 strike with only 4k OI. Presumably, a lot more puts were written today implying downward pressure.\n\n**HERE'S THE KICKER:**\n\nThe float is roughly 135,000,000. Half is short sold (\\~67 Million shares) Todays volume is 44 million+ and climbing while I write this. LOL!!!!! Do the math people. **(44/67, that is nearly 2/3's.)** We are pretty much nearing the point where if majority of the float is swallowed up and everyone sits on their hands and HODLs, you know the outcome **(GME, AMC)**. The pressure is on the hedgies my dearest Apes, we just simply buy and HODL and let those greedy bastards overleveraged themselves into bankruptcy.\n\nOH AND LASTLY, DID I MENTION SHITADEL HOLDS A SHORT POSITION TOO? ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2k06n84jb2871.png?width=2507&format=png&auto=webp&s=e30d7dc67e0b11cbfed5312adde0491e2cd66d34\n\n**MORE INFO ON INSIDER TRADING FROM OSHKOSH AND POST MASTER GENERAL LOUIS DEJOY:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1bewgy0n8871.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b2d6af3a94577752877e5e75428519ece6dc2b7\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xavh8zu1n8871.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&s=bba4fd3cac9e3a7429d17ebb40d7c1a1cb2119d3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wcau88r6n8871.png?width=1513&format=png&auto=webp&s=4708e90d888148f5a94fb608375ccba1c5e66738", "id": "o9ry37", "created_utc": 1624909885.0, "score": 1603, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 417, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|36|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|59|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvfyjl/fellow_apes_behodl_the_trojan_workhorse_workhorse/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvxus8/fellow_apes_behodl_the_trojan_horse_wkhs_short/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/nt7pu4) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvfust/fellow_apes_behodl_the_trojan_workhorse_whorse/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwrowj/wkhs_squeeze_thesis_most_probable_squeeze_on_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxe40h/wkhs_trade_updated_targeting_611625_thesis_61021/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxdnat/wkhs_trade_updated_targeting_611625_thesis_61021/) [x](https://i.redd.it/mjmeh4uoxw371.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxdkl0/wkhs_trade_updated_targeting_611625_thesis_61021/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxe0i6/wkhs_trade_updated_targeting_611625_thesis_61021/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nyxkvc/fellow_ape_brothers_and_sisters_we_must_act_upon/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/shouldabeenalawyer69, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It’s literally included in my post…", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "It’s automated.\n\nI’ll need you to edit this post and remove all “war” and “army” related words.", "score": -16, "replies": [{"body": "Just edited all of the \"war\" and \"army\" words", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "buy more WKHS", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Its in his post lol stop finding reason to remove wkhs post", "score": 27, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thanks for info.wkhs", "score": 211, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wkhs 🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍", "score": 204, "replies": []}, {"body": "Flawlessly made, see you all at 50 and beyond, lets fucking take this horse to the moon!", "score": 187, "replies": [{"body": "your 50th upvote for $50 share price :)", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "Your 13th upvote for the 13 lambos you will own", "score": 52, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This week would be lovely….", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "WKHS mooning this week! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "score": 183, "replies": []}, {"body": "Actually put your money where your mouth is that’s what I like", "score": 182, "replies": [{"body": "Why wouldn't a pumper be invested?", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "They're usually sitting on a few hundred thousand when it bottoms (insider trading).

Please see below my thoughts on Krispy Kreme, which will be listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker DNUT later this week:\n\n1. Unprofitable for the last three years\n2. Saddled with over $1B of debt from being taken private in 2016\n3. The list price will be between $21-$24 a share, giving the company a nearly $4B valuation. This is a 4x return for the Private Equity owners that took it private for $1B. 400% return in 5 years? What is this, a tech company?\n4. Most of the \\~$500M of IPO proceeds will be used up to extinguish debt and compensate executives. In fact, executives are in line to receive about $50M, or 10% of the proceeds. The company will buy shares off the executives and also pay their taxes on vested stock grants. Does that sound like a company with a lot of growth ahead?\n5. The Private Equity holding company will own 84.4% of shares after the IPO. They plan to distribute over two thirds of those shares to existing minority investors. Sounds like a pump and dump\n6. Cash flow is negligible when it is not negative\n7. Only has $50M in cash but the most recent annual loss was $60M\n8. We are in the middle of a historic bull market that is popularly mischaracterized as being driven by a meme stock retail trader frenzy. Companies will naturally try to take advantage of this\n9.

If the place is unprofitable, the owner takes the hit not DD. \n-Actual owners are stingy with everything to save money. The one closest to me will give you zero napkins with your donuts unless you specifically ask. If you ask they give you like 2-3.
