But let's get into it shall we.\n\n> reported vote count can't be higher than the float\n\nWrong. Gamestop's [own filing](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18846/html) shows that over 70 million shares were entitled to vote - much more than the public float. The number of shares in the public float is largely unrelated to the number of share entitled to vote.\n\nNow let's talk about what would have happened if there was an overvote that was trimmed. Gamestop's transfer agent, Computershare, offers 6 different options for trimming an overvote. You can read them [here](https://www.computershare.com/ca/en/Documents/CPU_OVER_VOTING_OPTION_en.pdf). Do you know who chooses which option to use? *Gamestop*. If overvoting happened, and the final vote reported was ~55 million instead of the ~70 million shares, then the only possible option that Gamestop used was option 5. Options 1-4 would trim the vote to exactly the amount entitled to vote, and the reported vote would be ~70 million. That did not happen. Option 6 would discard every single proxy vote, which obviously did not happen.\n\nFor option 5, an overvote resulting ~55 million out of ~70 million votes reported would only be possible if over ~15 million votes came in *on a single day* and were discarded after which the vote stopped. An extremely unlikely scenario, but one that also begs the question - why would Gamestop choose the *only* option that can realistically hide an overvote rather than any of the other 5 options that would immediately raise huge red flags (every single share voted, or no share voted).\n\nOr here's a much simpler explanation. There was no overvote and none of the 6 options were invoked because there were only 55 million votes.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting read for sure!

WeedMaps operates a high-margin marketplace services and never “touches the plant”. \n\nWeedMaps is an essential service for the operation of many retail dispensaries across the US and the many other countries. (including Canada, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland).\n\nFor instance, one dispensary chain owner said: “I remember when they (WeedMaps) raised their rates by 400% one year and we took a month off of our listings in protest. Our new client acquisition went down by 35%. Our monthly revenue went down by over $50,000 per location. Lesson learned.” \n\nAnother owner said: “WeedMaps costs us a fortune, but it is worth every penny. They hit us over the head to be listed on the daily deals page, but that shit flies off the shelf.” \n\nFinancials\n\n- Revenue forecast to grow at an annualized 40%, EBITDA at an annualized 55% through 2023\n- 2020 EBITDA was $43 million\n- WeedMaps generates 1.5 billion in gross merchandise volume alone\n- Stock trades at enterprise value of ≈5x 2022 sales, well below SaaS comps\n\nWeedMaps operates a cloud-based platform, and unlike other cannabis-related businesses, they require minimal physical footprint and are not directly exposed to fluctuations in product input costs. WeedMaps does not require real estate or other significant capital outlays to enter new markets. Their offerings can be customized to new markets to help facilitate expansion, which provides significant flexibility to scale and enter new markets with minimal investment. The capital-efficiency of the WeedMaps business model is evidenced by their robust margin profile and high level of EBITDA converting to free cash flow while achieving their growth. From 2014 to 2020, WM grew revenue at a CAGR of 35%. Over that period of time, WeedMaps has expanded their gross margin rate from 92% to 95%. For 2020, their net income was $39 million and EBITDA was $43 million.\n\nKeep in mind. These financials are still without many states who are bound to legalize or have just recently legalized (NY most notably). As the US cannabis market continues to expand at an exponential rate, WeedMaps will undoubtedly capitalize.\n\nManagement: CEO Chris Beals is an absolute Chad and knows how to regulate a complex cannabis industry with his UPenn law degree and weed expertise. Across the WeedMaps executive team, you have high level experience from Goldman Sachs, InstaCart, Google, Snap Inc, Twitter, Nike, Adobe, among other big time corporations. \n\nYes, there is tons of regulatory complexities in this industry.

I was just going to bed but I will edit this and respond tomorrow.\n\nedit:\n\nThanks for the Intro, It's always good to have some background info OP, I appreciate that kind of transparency.\n\nSo to be fair... I'll also tell you a little bit about me... I'm Canadian (don't hold that against me), I'm an engineer and my education background and work surrounds facilities (the technical term is building sciences). So it's actually quite the coincidence that you decided to talk about the GM plant (in quite detail). To be very specific, I am an electrical engineer with a telecommunications background (and so I'm quite familiar with IIoT and the importance of a connected plant). Without sounding too pompous, I would consider myself a subject matter expert on the above. \n\nI sold my engineering company in my early 30's (I'm now in my late 30s). I have been investing in the stock market for 7 years. I too am by no means an expert investor. My investment strategy has been (generally speaking) very aggressive. But enough about me.\n\n\"old factories aren't the asset that you think they are\"\nThat depends on how you look at it. For a startup (or a foreign automaker wanting a local presence) an existing plant is a great stepping stone. This allows them to get established and become relevant. It's a low cost solution that reduces the \"barrier to entry\" for a new automaker. This is basically why you don't see many new auto makers (aside from Tesla, who had similar problems during their initial alpha/beta phases). LMC got this factory for nothing (financed through GM). So while I agree that an old factory is not ideal for mass producing modern vehicle, I'd counter that the simplicity of the truck (VERY few moving parts) allows the old technology to be leveraged in a clever way (paint, metal stamping, etc.) hasn't changed. They are building a hub motor production line in new over the next few months (building these by hand for now). It's important to note that GM actually invested $300 million in the plant since 2009, [media.gm.com](https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2014/May/502-lordstown-invest.html). So we have to admit that the current building is far from what it was 55 years ago. As I see it, LMC will continue to build and expand on this property. LG Chem Ltd. is building an Ultium battery plant near by (in a joint venture with GM). The proximity and agreements between LMC and GM is no coincidence.\n\nI'd like to reiterate that I work directly with these types of buildings all the time, and perform electrical infrastructure upgrades (upgrade oil filled transformers, load break switches, etc.). old buildings are retrofitted and modernized all the time (this is a huge part of my business). Water and gas pipes in factories and warehouses are typically installed exposed and very easily traced out (and their conditions can be easily assessed) and because they are exposed they can be easily replaced (and inexpensively).\n\nyour argument is assuming the factory was not maintained through the years, but based on the investments that GM have made, I would be inclined to say that the building was adequately maintained. Seeing as [GM is ISO 9001 certified](https://www.theautochannel.com/news/2002/09/05/146907.html), and Metal Fabricating and Powertrain operations are QS-9000 certified. That is also an indication (but not proof) that the plant was managed and maintained at least to an acceptable standard.\n\nthe argument that Ford will beat them to market is false, [LMC announced yesterday](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/lordstown-motors-execs-cite-binding-orders-to-restore-confidence-a-day-after-ceo-cfo-resignations/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAADg_Kcwr-mhpjIjDxSpdNOlqhq_2cwwiNfvnZKVnG7G8W-5sITC7D1qm11yW-q3hiEymn694JFSr7Ig9zBavlfr8jW2rFPbbvtdZ5QpHwAad-oRmo0H7yKLLk5LPiQnSulRisPw5GvO7Tc5_oNKxVVMoY_20jo7gKe8HHIGbveZB#:~:text=Lordstown%20Motors%20has%20enough%20%E2%80%9Cbinding,will%20come%20at%20a%20cost.) that they have funding and (limited) ability to produce at least 20,000 vehicles per year and binding orders for at least two years. Production remains on track for end of September (2021).\n\nFord provided a $40,000 expected price for the Lightning, but the truck doesn't exist yet. Tesla just pulled the same thing with their Model S plaid and [raised the price $10,000](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/11/tesla-model-s-plaid-delivery-event.html). You also need to realize that this $40k price that Ford is touting doesn't include freight, and is a base model truck (2WD, crank windows, etc.) and is not an apples to apples comparison with the Endurance. The Lightning XLT would be a better comparisson, and that truck MSRP's at $68k. That being said, I think Ford will do a great job with this truck, and  I'm looking forward to it. I just think the EV truck market is big enough for both to thrive.\n\nI mostly agree with all of your other points, the only other thing I'd like to talk about is how much the media has been relentlessly attacking LMC. Most of this is due to the Hindenburg report, which is proven false. So I'd like to take this opportunity to reiterate that most of that report was [complete BS](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-results-special-committee-investigation) yet NOBODY, not a single media outlet is talking about this... why.. because this is not click bait enough... people want to see BANKRUPTCY and FRAUD in bold letters... the reality, a lot of these medias are owned by the very same people who shorted the company...

While Steve Burns and their former CFO were awful leadership for this company and one should be happy to see them go, it still represents a huge midterm risk because Steve Burns owns 27% of the company and could trigger a huge selloff if he sells his stake.\n\nAnd while you say the Hindenburg report is false, that’s not entirely true either. Many of the claims were false, but there were some that were true, many plainly admitted by Lordstown.\n\nThe talk of preorders being revealed to be non-binding overall is silly all around. This was publicly known information. It’s always been stated clearly on their website. The reason it was a problem though is that Steve Burns was going around to media outlets and blowing smoke up their asses, talking about these preorders and saying “we have a ton of interest from all these major people” and calling them “very serious preorders.” He wasn’t necessarily lying but he was omitting the fact that these people could cancel at any time so it came back to bite him in the ass when these same press outlets who didn’t dive into the details in the first place didn’t dive into the details the second time around when Hindenburg’s report came out.\n\nThe substantiated claims however from the Hindenburg report were that Lordstown looked into some of the preorderers that the report had followed up on and found them to be less serious than initially thought. They also said there were some problems with the way finances were tracked and had led to some overestimations of their cash on hand (hence the resignation of the CFO as well). These admissions are all directly from Lordstown.\n\nMany of the other claims outside of these main points were found false in the Hindenburg report but it should be noted these are mostly not the claims that made the headlines causing the stock to tank.\n\nLast thing I want to note about your point mentioning LMC stating they have the funding and ability to produce 20k vehicles/year, etc.\n\nLordstown has a strong tendency to overpromise and underdeliver. They’ve done this constantly. While this was especially a problem with Steve Burns, the rest of the leadership currently stating this has not changed. These are the same executives who have been there all along, not an outside new person replacing him.

Can buildings be upgraded? Abso-fucking-lutely. I don't doubt it. But it takes past, present & future capital and my concern is the availability of liquidity to this company. They can't really sell more shares, they can't really take on debt and they can't really sell vehicles at scale. I am very interested to see what their financials look like when they get released in the next couple of weeks.\n\nAs far as your points about GM investing in the plant, I think it's worth pointing out that a lot of this was likely just to avoid backlash from the union. Oh sure, we'll give you a good price on the factory, also we just did some upgrades so have fun with that, etc. etc. I'm not saying the building is a shambles, I'm just saying, with an older facility like that you never really know. But, the more important thing is, it's a massive facility and they are a small company. They could run their operation with a facility like 1/4 the size if not smaller and sometimes having a factory that is of an \"aspirational\" size is a detriment (climate control more expensive, more space to maintain & operate than is needed, higher property taxes, etc.)\n\nUltimately, I think a lot of your bull case for the company is based on the engineering challenges and does not take into account the viability of the business itself. Can those trucks be built? Sure. But it's more a question of will they be built and in particular will they be built by this company. We found out earlier today that they don't actually have any orders. If that's the case, does it even matter if they begin production in September? Do they have any kind of a sales force at all? We know they don't have dealerships selling them, we know customers have only placed preorders, how the heck are they going to start shipping trucks in September?\n\nThis doesn't require a turnaround or a business plan, it requires a miracle. They are basically out of time and it shows in their conduct. Somebody is paying people to leave 5 star reviews for the factory with burner Google accounts that haven't ever reviewed anything else. They are coming out daily with press releases that contradict one another.

Does it need a deposit? Does a pre-order with a deposit mean that it can't be cancelled? If a pre-order doesn't have a deposit, then is that worth anything at all? \n\nAs I understand it, LMC can't legally call any of the orders binding until they are 90 days away from delivering the vehicles.

Since 2020, it has added new divisions in order to be the go-to brand for all products your dog will ever need.\n\n* Barkbox has created a loyal base of 1.8 million subscribers,\n* Low churn rate of 5.4% --- and has expanded into other products to maximize the value of this consumer relationship.\n* Thanks to it’s recent IPO, the stock has a warchest of \\~$427 million to further boost its growth.\n* **Vertically integrated, they make their own stuff which is why gross margins are high**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy thesis is that Barkbox has created a noteworthy sticky brand - and will see substantial growth through it’s multi-pronged approach at monetizing it’s client base.\n\n* Most recently, Barkbox was added to Amazon’s subscription boxes landing page. This is a new development. More info about this can be read [here](https://www.pymnts.com/subscription-commerce/2021/third-party-subscriptions-amazon/) and why it’s so important.\n* With over 50% of the e-commerce market on Amazon, Barkbox’s new inclusion into Amazon subscription will boost it’s existing revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5e90riesej571.jpg?width=358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=107d7fb590e33c9356e4b349c1ceed882f394a3d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Opportunity**\n\n* $36.9 billion is estimated to be spent on food in 2020\n* $19.2 billion is estimated to be spent on supplies/otc medicine\n* $29.3 billion is estimated to be spent on vet care\n\n[During covid, an estimated 11.38 million US households have gotten a new pet.](https://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/pets-appa-survey-covid/)\n\n* Petcare market in the USA is more than $50 billion and will continue to grow.\n* Pet industry is mostly dominated by brick and mortar retailers.\n* The pet market is in the early stages of innovation and is brimming for something new.\n\nAccording to[ PYMNTS.com](https://securecdn.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Subscription-Commerce-Conversion-Index-November-2020.pdf), ¾ of US adults - 182 million consumers, subscribed to at least 1 subscription service since last July.

Most brands exist in their own individual silo, i.e. just food, or toys. Other competitors like Chewy, are marketplaces.\n\n$HIMS is a consumer subscription based model, that seems to be a good peer for comparison purposes. Due $HIMS recurring subscription revenue model, it is a good comparison for discussions. Based on $HIMS valuation, this would support $BARK trading in the $15-20 area.\n\nFor general purposes, I have included a comparison of other pet related brands.\n\nCHWY - Chewy\n\nFRPT - Freshpet\n\nTRUP - Trupanion\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[source: https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/yg35gpfcfj571.jpg?width=1201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d00ac912802f9201dee6bb5e1d5e8d82214844d3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Risks**\n\nNo DD is complete without thinking about the bear case.\n\nMost recently, Chewy, a competitor of $BARK, reported profits but warned of labor shortages and supply disruptions.\n\nEven though $BARK is vertically integrated, it is likely that it will have the same labor and supply disruptions, as all businesses are facing.\n\nShortly before it’s IPO, $BARK was accused of selling a chew stick that killed a pet. There is no evidence the chew stick was responsible.\n\n* Instead of ignoring the allegation, Barkbox immediately addressed it via social media, and said it was working with the manufacturer to look into the death.\n* Barkbox immediately stopped distributing the item.\n* Their emphasis on “doing the right thing,” speaks loudly to their ethos, and means we can trust them to do the right thing and continually expand with their consumer base\n\n**Market Reaction**\n\n* Buy rating, and $16 PT from Cannacord Genuity analyst Maria Ripps.\n* Buy rating, and $14 PT from Jefferies\n* The stock IPO’ed at $10, and has slowly risen and is at $11.35 on 6/15/2021.\n* Fidelity owns 8.3% of $BARK, which is an impressive sign of their confidence in the company. In addition they ANCHORED THE PIPE!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Investment Highlights**\n\nBarkbox is a real company, with real revenues. The team has demonstrated it can execute. As investors, the goal is to find the next big thing. Without a doubt, as Barkbox continues executing in many of it’s new divisions, it will become a highly coveted gem.\n\n* The pet category is big and growing\n* This is a digitally focused brand, which is doing both DTC and collaborating with major brands for increased exposure\n* It uses data, to improve the subscription experience and to personalize the box/product for its clients - STRONG RETENTION!\n* It can continue to accelerate growth by introducing new products, cross selling, and adding more channels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Business Model:** Barkbox will continue to grow it’s subscription services direct to consumers, in addition to distributing its products with retailers like Amazon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Defensibility:** Barkbox has an impressive 1.8 million base of recurring consumers, and is considered one of the biggest subscription services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Capital:** Thanks to it’s recent IPO, it is flush with cash\n\nFor further info: [May 2021 investor presentation by Barkbox](https://s27.q4cdn.com/974260903/files/doc_presentation/2021/05/BARK-Investor-Presentation-May-2021_vF.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Want to thank [https://twitter.com/spacanpanman](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman) for being an amazing source of info!

{"title": "$ASTS - The SpaceX for Mobile Phones - $6MM YOLO with Real DD", "selftext": "Let me start by saying I've invested nearly $6MM in what I believe to be a generational investment opportunity brought about by significant cost disruption in satellite launch costs, innovations in marrying satellite technology to low-earth orbit (\"LEO\") applications, and advances in LTE network architecture.  We are early in the commercialization of LEO and $ASTS is at the vanguard.\n\nInside of SpaceX, most investors rest their hat on the value of Starlink, which will provide FIXED-POINT broadband to customers, albeit at very high costs and with unclear quality.  They value is at $40bn+.  This equates to $200 per share for $ASTS, by way of comparison.  So there \"is a there, there\" in terms of what we are playing for here.\n\nJust like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE**. Starlink cannot translate to mobile unless you intend to haul a trailer behind you with a satellite dish.  See below for an artist rendition of Starlink's mobile solution vs. ASTS' actual mobile solution - your existing handset\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Haha - let's get back to business...read on](https://preview.redd.it/g1qny0og6k571.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6899104fbe13f6bf1e69417ade25940a9aee38b)\n\n$ASTS AST Spacemobile has re-imagined what's possible after the significant cost disruption in satellite launch, which has allowed it to marry two key innovations to provide satellite connectivity to A REGULAR MOBILE DEVICE:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Because launch costs are just a fraction of what they used to be, $ASTS is launching satellites 10x as large as those of traditional satellite phone satellites. This allows the satellite to do the work, not the phone\n2. By innovating with software, $ASTS can make the satellite connection work with existing LTE      networks by only working with the carriers' ground terminals to compensate for the Doppler effect; importantly, ASTS works with any normal phone without requiring any modifications\n\nHere is the overview of the **FACTS**\n\n**PRODUCT:**\n\n• ASTS is building the first-of-a kind and **only** space-based cellular broadband network that is **direct-to-device**; a consumer’s existing handset will work with ASTS’s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service - ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices\n\n• The constellation utilizes low and mid-band frequencies shared with partners on a non-interference basis; ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use\n\n• ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks\n\n• The service will eliminate coverage gaps, is compatible with all phones, provides broadband data speeds, and is accessible via one-click on a user’s device\n\n**MARKET:**\n\n• ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G market, specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure (e.g. towers) is less developed\n\n• ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular trends: i) falling launch costs, ii) high smartphone penetration, iii) broadband demand iv) 5G IoT proliferation\n\n• ASTS cites 3.3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not connected\n\n• Key regional opportunities include India, Africa, and Equatorial regions\n\n• The service is well-suited for low/medium density sites as well as for emergency back-up during natural disasters\n\n**MANAGEMENT:**\n\n• CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications (sold for $550MM in 2016)\n\n• The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm, NASA, and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom are PhDs\n\n**COMPETITION:**\n\n• ASTS competes with high-cost legacy providers, including Iridium • Legacy satellite providers require unique handsets for users to connect\n\n• ASTS also competes with the build-out of standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment • Competitor Lynk advertises a similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to commercial, financial and technical milestones\n\n**OTHER:** Investors include Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung; all of whom recently invested in the Company's latest financing.  The Company's own coverage banker at Barclays QUIT his job to join ASTS.  The dogs are eating the dog food.\n\n**TIMELINE:**\n\n• April 2019 – BW 1 was launched (the test satellite), validating system architecture and proving they could connect a mobile phone to a satellite and connect to an LTE system  • 2H 2021E will launch BW3, which is a scaled version of the constellation satellite • 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage, with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and 168 satellites by YE 2024\n\n**ANALYSIS - THIS IS MY OPINION, AND SUBJECT TO DISCUSSION AND DISAGREEMENT**\n\n• ASTS is an exciting event-driven story stock with open-ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven entrepreneurs, significant industry backing, and *bone fide* strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business\n\n• Management funded the seed capital for the business, highlighting their confidence and ‘skin in the game’\n\n• Targeting mobile 5G is a ‘**big idea**’ that augments that excitement generated by fixed-broadband players such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are likely to be present in developing markets\n\n• The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven, leaving investors free to speculate and discount key assumptions, including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU\n\n• The investment set-up is favorable since a high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets, yet requires the capital available in the SPAC market – the set-up is not a ‘foist’ by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but instead a legitimate capital raising exercise to fully-fund the project and remove financing risk\n\n• With 1-year lock-ups on existing investors and PIPE investors, there will be limited free float in what amounted to a “public Series C” financing\n\n• Given future CAPEX, Wall Street banks will see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company\n\n**RISKS:**\n\n• While the *BlueWalker* satellite provided proof-of-concept, there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed\n\n• Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service, reducing appeal for full tower placement\n\n• Realized user penetration and ARPU remain uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution\n\n• ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is susceptible to potential funding risk\n\n**INVESTMENT CHECKLIST:  Good hygiene to make sure something can make money as an investment**\n\n***BUSINESS MODEL***:  ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT\\&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow\n\n***GO-TO-MARKET:***  In-place binding agreements with carriers provide ASTS with access to >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn) • Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people; subsequent phases expand into Europe and N. America – the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024\n\n***DEFENSIBILITY***: ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage • Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market\n\n***CAPITAL***: ASTS is capital intensive and subject to capital availability to complete its full system • Once the constellation is complete, the Company benefits from extreme operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation\n\n***TRACTION***: ASTS appears to have extraordinary commercial partnership traction, however, it is yet unclear what end-user uptake the usage will be • Technical traction was ‘proved’ by the April 2019 launch of the *Bluewalker 1* test satellite\n\n***FINANCIALS***:  With a market cap of \\~$1.8bn, the company is expected to generate >$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user\n\nBelow are projections:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q78k3rkk6k571.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d03a94e2c9ae9c58e278e62d613cbf19d02dee8\n\nWhen thinking about a hypothetical valuation, I pro-forma the numbers and apply a multiple in-line with the tower companies.  I treat depreciation as a real cash expense\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xp15x4om6k571.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fb6a1526b293fc54c82ed510c351f8288b69a1b\n\n**TECHNOLOGY DETAILS**\n\n***OVERVIEW***: AST & Science (“ASTS”) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct-to-device’ service to normal phones\n\n***BOOMBOX IN SPACE:***  ASTS’ satellites are \\~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a 900-square meter array, the system is a large **“loud”** system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones “listen hard” whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones\n\n***SOFTWARE:***  ASTS’ system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial spectrum and telecom networks. The “magic” of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible\n\n***BACKHAUL***:  Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier’s terrestrial spectrum\n\n***CAPACITY***:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area\n\n***WHAT DO WE KNOW***:  What has ASTS done to prove its system?\n\no *Bluewalker1* proved the RF could close (e.g. the power was sufficient to connect a normal phone) and that an LTE connection was achievable utilizing ASTS’ ‘magic’ software; ASTS launched a handset into space with the satellite on the ground to cost-effectively check an important element of technical diligence. *Bluewalker1* allowed for end-to-end connectivity testing, which has been reviewed over the last 1.5 years\n\no *Bluewalker3* (2H 2021 launch) will be a scaled version of the system, which will de-risk components and demonstrate the full technology. BW3 will allow for software debugging to tune the full system\n\n***RISKS***:  Most of the risks are timing risks. For instance, *Bluewalker3* could spur the need to tune microns, which could delay the system deployment by months. The troubleshooting required will be the beam forming in patterns to maintain a connection while managing handoffs\n\nA launch vehicle delay could delay the testing by 60 to 90 days\n\n***BENT PIPE***:  The satellite itself is not complex – it is bent pipe in the sky; most of the design relates to distributing power. The satellite itself is not involved with processing or routing\n\nDISCLOSURE: I own 500,401 shares of common. Yes, this is a huge position.

The bent-pipe architecture simplifies some types of satellite design (not needing to design inter-satellite links like many have done) but a 900m^2 aperture is never going to be simple. As someone who works in the space industry myself, I wish them all the best in this endeavor, but it's going to be a long hard slog to get a deployable structure that big to work successfully. It will also require some incredible engineering effort. \n\nThe biggest barriers as I see them in the near future for these folks are:\n\n\n1) Licensing - they must get a license to operate this service in each country that they wish to market in. A good thing/bad thing of LEO is that your satellites only spend tens of minutes over an individual country, so you need to launch in many countries to properly capatalize your asset. This provides many potential roadblock opportunities for competition (both space-based and terrestrial) to stop you at each license fight. Additionally, they're looking to use existing spectrum, which means coordination agreements with every single carrier or *a lot* of interference potential. They are partnering with existing carriers to coordinate, which is good, but they still need to get licensed to send those same bands *from space.*\n\n2) Technology - To realize their plans, AST & Science will need to develop the largest space deployable structure in human history, as there is no launch vehicle large enough to directly launch it. The aperture sizes that are proposed are *rumored* to have existed at this size on \"spooky\" national intelligence satellites with price tags in the billions. Far be it from me to say that anything is impossible, that's not my nature, but this will be an extremely difficult development project. For reference, this is a ~17m diameter dish/phased array, which will need to be true to shape within ~1-2 mm to realize sidelobe targets. \n\nAdditionally, they have not detailed how thet plan to do beam-steering from this large aperture size to properly cover a large area on the ground. If they're in LEO with a 900m^2 aperture in the S-band, the spot size on the ground is going to be ~6-10 km in diameter. With ~200 satellites, and one aperture per satellite, they're going to need to either beam-hop like crazy or do more than one beam per aperture somehow to get full coverage. Otherwise, they get about 0.012% of the Earth's surface area at a time. \n\n3) Space Operations Experience - Bluewalker1 is a nanosatellite, with no manuvering capability or attitude control system. This means that as far as the rest of the space community is concerned, this satellite is a \"dumb brick\" which requires no active coordination with the company that launched it (manuverable sats will just have to dodge it). Once they intend to operate a real constellation, they will need to develop propulsion hardware, attitude control and determination hardware and software, autonomous collision avoidance software, and a team of operations staff to fly and manage the constellation and coordinate with other operators. This is a significant undertaking. \n\n4) Total bandwidth per satellite - 1.2MM GB/month sounds good when you say it that way, but that's only ~3.6 gigabits per second per satellite (assuming GB in the post is giga**bytes**, to be charitable). That puts total constellation throughput at ~a single high quality fiber line. Total subscriber density will be low, on the order of 0.004 subscribers/km^2 (assuming satellites are flying polar, 0.5 megabit per second per subscriber, and they're going for global coverage). This means that while it may be easy to talk to their system using existing hardware, very few people will be able to do so at a time.\n\nEDIT: *IF* they can build it, this link budget is technically feasible. You can close a link to a cell phone from this altitude and serve it high bandwidth (to one cell phone at a time...).

The primary question for me is how long the development slog to design a refolding aperture is going to take.

For a 17m system, the active aperture needs to have oragami-style folds in it, which need to pop into really defined spots with a ton of repeatability and low snag risk.

The low frequency spectrum (e.g., between 100 MHz to 2 GHz) is particularly good for eliminating the use of antennas, gateways or VSAT systems between the end user and the HTFS systems in space.

{"title": "An investigation: Hindenburg Research (DKNG)", "selftext": "FIRST, WATCH THIS VIDEO: [Down with Hindenburg](https://streamable.com/1hrde3)\n\nHey retards, I’ve decided to take a break from posting memes and offer a rebuttal to the Hindenburg’s recent [fud article they](https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/) wrote about [DKNG.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njaa8g/why_im_large_and_in_charge_for_dick_kings_dkng/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Before I begin, here’s my track [record](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:TheHappyItalianMan).\n\nIn this post, I will discuss the following: what is Hidenburg Research, who is their CEO, Nathan dick-fuck Anderson, then I'll breakdown the Hidenburg Fud article about DKNG. Their evaluation of DKNG. The connection between DKNG, SBTech and the illegal sportsbook market. Lastly, why Hidenburg wrote this article. And of course- there’s a tl;dr at the bottom. Let’s fucking go nerds.\n\n**What is Hindenburg Research?**\n\n[bad guys](https://preview.redd.it/wx1bmg7btm571.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=33535dfd0e18c69fcf831e66a805ca19720a0d03)\n\nHindenburg Research does exactly what a lot of us do here, they construct DD's and release them onto the public hoping that others will join in on their idea and together make a lot of money. As of lately they've been kind of right, ex: Nikola (was trash we all knew it), Kandi (again trash), Lordstrom Motors (debatable), Clover too (but this one was a flop). Anyway, so HR (Hindenburg Research) looks for heavily  invested-retail stocks, with heavy-bull $$$$, they enter these massive short positions and then they construct these intricate DDs called \"investigations\" on why you should short with them, then the next day, the stock will drill, HR will take profits and the stock either flops or goes back to business in a few months. The big difference maker between our DDs and their DDs is they have fucking money to distribute their idea. I think they were right about the previous companies, but they're definitely stretching with DKNG.\n\n**Who is Nathan Anderson?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9ocr51dtm571.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=76e824801019de73c2cf2ac9738afdb248d24a0f\n\nNathan Anderson is an absolute crook.- the CEO of Hindenburg. This guy literally think's he's God's gift, check out his [twitter](https://twitter.com/ClarityToast?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).\n\nEX:\n\n[But when he manipulates the public it's okay?](https://preview.redd.it/g93yqgweum571.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=774051742d3dffb504455e6bcdfa85d26532abf4)\n\n[Shorted CLOV, then bragged about how his company made money and WSB is insane.](https://preview.redd.it/tgo2woogum571.png?width=490&format=png&auto=webp&s=60c4101b147e687175c2cf9f9b8eb87739282643)\n\nYou can check out his [twitter](https://twitter.com/ClarityToast?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) for your own eyes, but this guy is an absolute dick-wad and he really think's he is better than everyone on WSB/retail bros, just because he's had three successful trades, but I think he turned on the wrong stock with DKNG. So we've established that he's a dick head, but what else about him?  He's also been investigated for pump and dump cases before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Absolute hedgie crook.](https://preview.redd.it/iz7c35dkum571.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=01ad5aae0fdab8693093dd65dfc1707390007e7f)\n\n[Court Filing Link Here](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=qgikmggDYAJeNVM1Gkl1UQ==)\n\nSounds pretty similar to DKNG, doesn't it? Making up information for their own financial gain. You can read more about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weedstocks/comments/a38lsw/hindenburg_research_listed_in_pump_and_dump_court/). Essentially, Anderson was releasing fake sources and articles through an alias of a company that was linked to [HR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSLimited/comments/lthtry/i_did_investigation_for_hindenburg_report_issuers/) Promoting their idea and trying to profit off false information.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/921iqljrum571.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=f29b48c62d7369721e1f78fd6dbfe7de0ebfc561\n\n[He's currently being Investigated by the SEC? - Source](https://www.reddit.com/user/Next_Parfait_1885/comments/nuzu66/nate_anderson_of_hindenburg_being_investigated_by/)\n\nNot sure how accurate this is, but supposedly, he's currently being investigated by the SEC for Misconduct. I guess their website keeps getting taken down by the SEC for investigation. To conclude, Nathan Anderson, is an absolute corporate, pump and dump, shill artist. He doesn't like WSB as you can tell from his tweets and he thinks he's God's gift to drop and article and just instantly make money, regardless of whether it's valid or not. Fuck that Dickhead. This guy, his tweets, his actions should be enough alone to fight against this guy and any company he shorts.\n\n**THE ARTICLE**\n\nThe article is absolute trash, if you haven't seen it yet- [here it is](https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/).\n\nThere's basically two key arguments. The first, DraftKings is tied to illegal revenue streams (poor sources). Second, DraftKings is overvalued (with some weak fundamentals) So I will be discussing these two arguments and talking about why they're dead ass wrong and/or just plain don't matter.\n\nBefore we go in, please watch this CNBC segment from yesterday morning. They explain it very well. TL;DR, SBtech has little to no value for DKNG.  [https://streamable.com/ng95ed](https://streamable.com/ng95ed)\n\n**SBTECH - \"the illegal revenue stream\"**\n\nSbTech may or may not have been involved in some shady business altercation back in 2014-2017. You can be the judge of that, but I can assure you that as of the DKNG acquisition, they are most likely clean.\n\nWhat is [SBTech?](https://www.sbtech.com/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tz910a0xum571.png?width=1239&format=png&auto=webp&s=46213501992f1d2b9a2a4ee67a015eb6a5bc9231\n\nEssentially, SBTech creates the platforms for sportbooks. They are the data analytics. They don't own psychical sportsbooks, rather they create the software for websites to lease out and use for their own branding. HR believe's that SBTech has been leasing their software to illegal sportsbooks in Asian via  a pseudo company, BTI company (kind of ironic right, the man who used pseudo accounts to spew false information- is now accusing another company of using a pseudo name), all because of their locality (their offices are close - they offer a picture of google maps to show this lmao??), they have similar source code (they literally went into google chrome and inspected their website code, you can find similar script comparing source code for ANY website) and their CEO (BTI Company) is friends with the founder of SBTech (people who are in similar business tend to work together). But the factor of the matter is, a quick google search from [Bit Core Tech](http://bitcoretech.com/), and SBTech can tell you that the two companies are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Lastly, they use hypothetical sources, stating that they talked to prior employees of SBTech, saying everything they do is illegal, are you actually going to trust a Hedgie who's manipulated information before, I Know I'm not. Regardless, does it even matter?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jm9edcs4vm571.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=82be3c18abbe64255db6a857f1f6e83dfaef7caa\n\n[Source](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/39376/sbtech-oregon-sports-betting-contract/)\n\nWhat's kind of crazy, is that they (SBTech) have an exclusive deal with the state of Oregon, yet HR thinks that their research team is able to do a better investigation than the state of Oregon, and the Department of Justice.  Not only that, the laws associated with establishing a mobile sports gambling license are insane, to think that state and federal investigations weren't able to find any illegal activity is down right laughable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ia8rgdv8vm571.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd6e9dee68b3cdbcea1d10bb4b6d2dc97c4f8044\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a1gtgsy9vm571.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d78c580ab67f9fb7bfa4e8f30a5e51c1958d358\n\nThey estimate that roughly half of SBTech's 2020 revenue came from unregulated markets, and about 10% of DKNG's B2B revenue comes from SBTech, so what does that mean? That mean's they're creating fud, this is funny, just wait. Let's say that hypothetically speaking they're right, and DKNG is committing to fraudulent revenue streams, how does this affect their current revenue?\n\n[B2B revenue = $31,429,000 \\(SBTech accounts for 10&#37;\\) = $3,142,900 total revenue to DKNG](https://preview.redd.it/6hm3rhjbvm571.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=b96263e1539518c0aaa7d08178051e52989815b2)\n\n[$312,376,000 TOTAL revenue so far in 2021](https://preview.redd.it/6rxoj77dvm571.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f063aa6efa69b2270d87c2ee868cabd562c5f35)\n\nYeah, so worst case scenario, HR is right and DKNG has to remove SbTech from their revenue, damn. Looks like they lost a whopping \\~1% of their current revenue stream. Not a massive hit considering they only have access to 25% of the current U.S. Population.\n\n[Bullet point 2 - 25&#37; of U.S. Population](https://preview.redd.it/fzn2q88fvm571.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=2513a920a090df8dc4f21da061fb65b5be5dbbc9)\n\n[June 2020 to Current](https://preview.redd.it/0f7eqh0hvm571.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3b79c9d752d2b090e717dd8faf4073827009937)\n\nAnother big point for HR was that insiders were selling. Who the fuck cares- when has insider selling ever been a clear bearish since, news flash , it hasn't. You don't even know what they're doing with that money. They could be investing BACK into the company for all well know. Plus, this back tests back to JUNE of 2020, literally a few months after they dropped the SPAC. Who knows if any of these sales are due to SPAC merger. What's way more important is institutional purchases\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[the mouse](https://preview.redd.it/fsl6uqukvm571.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b0deea63114b837863e12c71248786e128aaca)\n\n[BlackRock, Vanguard, JPMorgan? - This list is outdated, you can find the updated list here.

His current allegation against DKNG is just another one of his pump and dump's off fake news. DKNG is undervalued, his false accusations of illegal revenue are irrelevant, SBTech only accounts for 1% of DKNG's** ***current*** **total revenue. In the expanding sports-gambling market, their B2B sales will be completely irrelevant as their Sportbook Sales Revenue will \\~10x in the next few years as more states legalize sports gambling and DKNG is able to reach the remaining 75% of the U.S. population.

{"title": "A Bull's Case for AMC", "selftext": "TL;DR at bottom\n\nI’m extremely bullish on AMC. In fact, more than I was back in late January and early February. The inflation rate, collateral issues, and reverse repos are all factors that lead me to believe that investors are inching ever so closer to creating heavy losses for hedge funds and short sellers. As you may be aware, during the AMC shareholder count that occurred on June 2nd, CEO Adam Aaron stated retail investors comprise 80% of AMC shares with each individual averaging about 120 shares each. As of 9am EST this Wednesday morning, AMC has seen 1.76 million trades, and despite no new huge news, it’s already seeing a gradual decrease from yesterday’s close. So why are so many people selling? That’s the thing. I don’t think we are. Earlier this morning, Jim Cramer commented on AMC’s price action in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1405138423741100033):\n\n“Meme people AMC is down…. I think it’s time to burst in.” Now this is entirely speculation on my part, but I believe that this could be serving as a cover for a short ladder attack, which is something that many GME, AMC, and other tickers are familiar with. That being said, I do expect the rest of today and this trading week to be rather ugly. However, no one said that a ride to the moon would be a smooth one. In the past 5 months alone, retail investors have caused billions of dollars worth of losses to hedge funds and overall people that want to screw over working class people. In fact, this past Monday (the 14th), when AMC surged 15%, it caused over $515 million worth of losses. This is chump change compared to some of the other numbers we’ve seen, but they add up. Another interesting piece of information I learned is that recent reports showed that AMC is the most traded stock on Fidelity and Freetrade, and the 3rd most traded stock on Robinhood. Just take look below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xzxpih2c4q571.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e7a4928f2f2303919c081a0c2a2e43dbd237368\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e0ahgkad4q571.jpg?width=1408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=008bf534d14b00d66c3b58ea0484b12f4242e5e8\n\nI personally dislike the Motely Fool, but it allowed me to view information provided by Robinhood. As you can see, sentiment for AMC remains high across multiple brokerages.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycfdlvpe4q571.png?width=1940&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b334ee6afb8ab8d3ebb4f95c8aec463f1e2a5ea\n\nAs you can see above, ever since June 2nd, AMC has managed to remain above $42.72 and this has continued for two whole weeks! This has resulted in devastating losses for short sellers. It went as far as touching $70 just two weeks ago. And although it is currently in the mid-50’s range, I believe that bullish sentiment from traders will allow it to continue to climb even in the face of short ladder attacks. According to the data on Webull, AMC has seen more large-scale orders recently. This might be due to the amount of options expiring this Friday, the 18th. Down below, I’ve listed the large-scale buy orders placed and executed in the last 5 trading days:\n\n6/09: $1,829,580\n\n6/10: $4,826,810\n\n6/11: $6,961,840\n\n6/14: $5,458,670\n\n6/15: $9,946,860\n\nMind you, this is the net value of all large-scale orders that were placed those days. In other words, it took the difference from all the large-scale buys as well as the large-scale sells. The final numbers for all of those dates came out to a positive number, meaning there were more buys than sells. That doesn’t even take into account people buying from RH, Etrade, Fidelity, etc. Needless to say, buying pressure is immense right now, which may the reason there has been an increase of FUD, shills, and bots trying to direct people away from AMC and into other tickers and ultimately tricking them into losing their money into a pump and dump.\n\nIn terms of good news, AMC is currently poised to become the dominant movie theatre chain in L.A., which would include two shopping mall locations. With both tourists and locals visiting during the summer, and with more and more Americans receiving the vaccine and the desire to return to normal coming along with it, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see significant increases in revenue as time goes on. This change might not be an immediate one, of course, but it does force investors to consider the long-term plays that come with it.\n\nShort sellers can’t hold forever, but investors can. Short interest will slowly eat away at them and one day, as we all know, they’ll be forced to cover. When this happens, it’ll be every man for himself. Seeing as to how many of us control the stock, though, we could, in theory, just not sell, which would cause an unprecedented rise in stock price. It should be common sense by now that we know that this cannot be accomplished by a single individual, hence the phrase: “Apes together strong.”\n\nTL;DR I feel as though bitch boy Cramer and his ass-kissing gay bear friends are working extra hard to get people to paper-hand. He wants our bananas, but I refuse to give it to him. I think there are plenty of catalysts that not only make the current price sustainable, but on the verge of further increasing. As always, I’m not a financial advisor. Do your own research before making any investment decisions. I just like the stock.

(S3 called Jan squeeze a short squeeze, reddit did not).

Maybe 25% of this ends up as AMC's profit. Compare 2021 with 2019 and keep in mind during 2019 AMC still lost money. Now they've got big debt payments to go along with their normal expenses. \n\n2) Cost to borrow AMC shares for shorting has dropped dramatically the last couple of weeks. It's under 3% currently. Also many shorters averaged up their cost basis with the recent price run up so there is much less pressure for them to panic close their positions than there was a week or two ago. Never forget it's only profit when you sell and it's only a loss when they buy to cover.\n\n3) The run up in price has been driven by the very high volume, almost double it's average. That same volume which triggers retail to drive up the price also gives short sellers with lower cost basis (e.g. more underwater) easy ways out of their jamb. The sharp movements also allow them to sell puts against their shorts to profit that way.\n\n4) The problem with AMC's expansion plan in LA is the industry just isn't as profitable as it used to be or those \"premier\" theaters with hefty rent payments would not be for sale. They should be using the money they were gifted by retail shareholders to pay down and reorganize their debt, close lower performing screens, and shrink their way back in to a profitable business model.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "\\#4 all the way brother.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Agree with your analysis", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ctxr", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "retail investors owning 80% of a company that is not doing well on their financial statement is not bull case, buying shares at $50+ on a company that cant offer shares to cover its debt is not a bull case, betting on a feeling of a possible shortsqueeze at these prices is not a bull case.. i dont see a bull case dude..", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buying more, holding more.\n\nGood to see some sense here.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good DD..

Do you think they’re being paid by Lordstown to just pump the stock? Genuinely curious as to what your thoughts are when you see these. I know I can speak for myself and a few other people I know from the sub Reddit, and we actually believe in the company. We’re truly fans of it, so to speak. We’re not trying to push some hopeless pump and dump, we actually want to see the company succeed. I think a lot of us just want to be proven right more than anything lol we’re not trying to get anyone to save us here. I can’t speak for this particular OP but there’s a lot of local people invested in RIDE and they’re no shills. It’s nice to see Lordstown appearing to be headed in the right direction. They’ve almost been shorted into oblivion. I’ve never seen so many news articles mislead and lie about a company like this in my life. And people on here spit out the same lines that I read from these hedge fund funded media outlets. It kind of makes me wonder if some of you haters are the actua shills, but Ill just assume you all just get your info from the articles so that’s why you say the same things. It’s also nice to see RIDE being added to the russel 2000. A lot of money is going to be invested in order to cover the ETFs. I always thought burns was a sleazeball so maybe this can be a fresh start and the media narrative will start to change. I could see people starting to rally behind the American company and shifting it into a “come from behind” story lol. Some news articles already seem to have shifted their tones.
