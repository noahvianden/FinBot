Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite of such buyers in the 17th century.\n\n>This type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they believe the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can produce – it will remain lifeless forever – but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more avidly in the future.\nThe major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other assets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however, has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some industrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of soaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end.\n\n>What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis. As “bandwagon” investors join any party, they create their own truth – for a while.\nOver the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the “proof” delivered by the market, and the pool of buyers – for a time – expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: “What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.”\n\n>Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At$1,750 per ounce – gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.\n\n>Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?\n\n>Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices.\n\n>A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond.\n\n>Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’m confident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.\n\n-Berkshire Hathaway 2011 Annual Shareholder Letter", "score": 14, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "He bought GOLD at a high and sold at a low like a retail FOMO'er", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You need to think about gold differently.

One must understand the Bretton Woods system, generally, why it came about, and what the money masters fear could come next (loss of control).

{"title": "NVDIA DD: Undervalued and why it will continue to run", "selftext": "To start off I do have a position in NVIDIA but nonetheless the reason for this DD is strictly information not persuasive. I truly believe NVIDIA is *undervalued* currently. ***I believe NVDIA will reach 800 pre-split (200 post 4-1 split) with the current momentum going for the stock along with a shift to tech soon.***\n\n If you didn't know already, NVIDIA designs graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units for the mobile computing and automotive market. \n\n*EARNINGS* \n\n**NVIDIA recently had its earnings report in which they reported $3.66 earnings per share for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $3.28 by $0.38.** They recorded revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier and up 13 percent from the previous quarter, with record revenue from the company’s Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization platforms. Gaming revenue of $2.76 billion, up 106 percent from a year earlier. Record Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier. \n\n## Quarterly Earnings Surprise Amount\n\n**Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported | Earnings Per Share\\*| Consensus EPS\\* Forecast | % Surprise**\n\n**Apr 2021.                    05/26/2021                  3.13                                     2.62**                                **19.47%**\n\n**Jan 2021                      02/24/2021                  2.58                                      2.2                                  17.27%**\n\n**Oct 2020                     11/18/2020                   2.41                                     1.92                                25.52%**\n\n**Jul 2020                       08/19/2020                  1.67                                     1.63                                 2.45%**\n\nAs you can see over the past four quarterly earnings NVDIA has beaten each of the projected forecasts easily for the most part. With a gross margin of 64.11% for this quarter, and an average quarterly gross margin of 60.96% over the past 5 years, NVDIA is primed to continue its dominance for the future. Also it is important to note that **NVDIA beats out its main competitors Intel and AMD in gross margins on average over the past 5 years and over the last quarter.** \n\n## NVDIA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 54.74% Jan 2019**\n\n**Maximum 65.06% Apr 2020**\n\n**Average 60.96%**\n\n## AMD Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 4.51% Sep 2016**\n\n**Maximum 46.07% Mar 2021**\n\n**Average 37.34%**\n\n## Intel Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years\n\n**Minimum 53.13% Sep 2020**\n\n**Maximum 64.50% Sep 2018**\n\n**Average 59.65%**\n\nNow onto reasons why I think NVIDIA is a strong buy. \n\n1. **Price targets**\n\nNVDIA is still undervalued with multiple price targets very much higher than the current price of what NVDIA is trading at currently along with multiple buy ratings. One example in specific, **Bank of America recently upgraded NVDIA price target to $900 from $800 and reiterated its Buy rating.** The bank said its takeaway is that \"rising AI adoption, expanding use-cases across cloud, enterprise, edge, telco can help NVDA double its content and triple its data center sales over the next few years.\" Bank of America said it expects NVIDIA's data center business to grow at a 35% compounded rate to become its largest segment by year-end 2025. Other notable price targets include 854- Jefferies, 800- Robert W Baird, 800- Rosenblatt Securities. \n\n1. **Acquisition of ARM**\n\n ARM can’t stay independent for long, even the CEO thinks so. Arm CEO Simon Segars made the case that if it stays independent, Arm wouldn’t be able to keep up with the increasing demands of its customers for more complex chips that can perform a wider variety of functions. The simple solution? Getting acquired by another company. NVIDIA seems to be in the lead to acquire ARM and other rivals are terrified. They have a good reason to be, as NVDIA already a strong leader wants to spend $40 billion to acquire U.K. chip technology provider Arm Holdings. This acquisition will reshape the industry entirely. NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang said the acquisition of ARM is an opportunity to create a company that can generate even more new ideas, and bring more innovation to its customers in the form of intellectual property. A quote in specific, “The benefit to the market, and to the Arm customers will be more IP, better IP, more accelerated road maps and hopefully taking Arm to the far reaches of what is becoming …the diversity of computing that is literally going in every single direction,” Huang said. “You’re covering everything from cloud, to edge, to \\[internet of things\\], to high performance computing, to microprocessors, to accelerated computing—everything.”\n\n2. **Internet currency ( Not allowed to say actual word so replaced it with internet)**\n\nGPU’s can be used for internet currency and its mining purposes. It’s possible to blame the graphic card shortage on these miners but nonetheless, the usage of them is highly prevalent today. NVIDIA's releases of processors specifically used for mining poses a huge boost to its revenue and to the internet currency world. **NVIDIA booked $155 million in revenue from CMP cards in its fiscal first quarter.** While internet money is gaining traction around the world, we can expect NVIDIA to continue its dominance and reliability in mining purposes. \n\n3. **Stock split** \n\nOn May 21st, NVIDIA announced a 4-1 stock split which would take place on July 19th. So for every one share you own, you will own four instead as the stock splits its price valuation by four. On the day of the news, NVIDIA’s stock price closed at $599.67. **Since then, the price of NVIDIA’s stock has gone up around 24% to $743.75**. Not even one month has passed and the stock is up 24%! With one full month until the split **I predict NVDIA to hit $800 or/and above by the time of the official split**. Call options and shares in my opinion are the way to go for the next month as this could be a great opportunity to invest in a fast growth company. \n\n4. **Growth** \n\nNVIDIA has been a great growth tech stock to own recently with the numbers backing this statement up. \n\n**NVIDIA RETURNS** \n\nYTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)\n\n1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)\n\n6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)\n\n1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)\n\nNow for the returns on NVIDIA compared to AMD and INTEL. \n\n**NVIDIA RETURNS** \n\nYTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)\n\n1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)\n\n6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)\n\n1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)\n\n**AMD RETURNS**\n\nYTD: -7.06 (-7.70%)\n\n1 Year: +30.61 (+56.64%)\n\n6 Months: -11.27 (-11.75%)\n\n1 Month: +10.21 (+13.72%)\n\n**INTEL RETURNS**\n\nYTD: +5.85  (+11.74%)\n\n1 Year: -4.41 (-7.34%)\n\n6 Months: +8.21 (+17.30%) \n\n1 Month: +0.83 (+1.51%)\n\n**NVIDIA beats Intel and AMD in every single category growth wise showing complete dominance with its stock price.** \n\nConcluding I believe NVIDIA is a must buy presplit and the risk is minimum. The stock shows solid uptrend with extreme growth to come. NVIDIA is a strong buy in my personal opinion and an amazing company to be invested in. ", "id": "o3pvom", "created_utc": 1624136857.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|504|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3pvom/nvdia_dd_undervalued_and_why_it_will_continue_to/) \n**Account Age**|1 year ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is a good idea.

If   you don't believe it, great, just wait longer.\n\nEDIT: To make sure any newbs understand: all of these are 3X leveraged ETFs, which means they will experience DECAY. So please, if you're not sure what you're doing, either play things very short-term (weeklies or so) or just short SPY if you're desperate to play the game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **$UVXY Calls.**    The VIX (volatility index) jumps the most with market downturns. It's    the fastest, easiest way to make money outside of a 0DTE SPY put.  There   are two options for VIX calls that are easy for the average ape:  $UVXY   and $VIXY. Both of these are VIX ETFs. Having done *too much*    research and comparing between these two, I found UVXY to be the   better  of the two. It responds to the market faster and climbs higher    faster.Buying **$UVXY** call at the **ONSET** of a bear market is the first move.\n2. **$SOXS Calls.** The next best call is for **$SOXS**. SOXS is an ETF bear on semiconductors which I've found hurts the worst at the **ONSET**     of a bear market, but stabilizes after a few weeks or months   (depending on the severity of the fall) due to semis have real assets.   There are a few more options a little further down,  but they don't   react as well to the downturn in the short term.\n3. **$SPXU Calls.**    While SOXS lasts nicely for abou the first 10-15% of a downturn (in    time) the value of the semiconductor stocks levels out due to real    assets. This means the next thing to cash in on is $**SPXU**.    $SPXU is a 3x Bear ETF on the S&P500. It responds better than   $SQQQ  at the outset, so it's better to have at the front end of the   downturn.\n4. **$SQQQ Calls.**    After about a month or two, $SQQQ starts to outperform $SPXU. So if    you're playing this week-by-week, you'll want to switch up from $SPXU  to   $SQQQ. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, it really   ramps  better than $SPXU. It's basically the same thing by a different   name.\n5. **$TWM Calls.**  $TWM is a Russell 2000 3x Bear ETF. Calls basically don't exist, but when the market tanks, these puppies fly.\n6. **$SPY Puts.**   The classic. Best way to make/lose money in a flash. Highly recommend   0dte puts if you're feeling it and the IV is below a ridiculous number.\n\n**Some strategy:**\n\nOK, if you're not sure what you're doing, just buy some LEAPS of **$SPXU** calls. Meaning, buy out to Jan 21 or something. If nothing happens, you lose 10-20% and you can bail...\n\nIf    you're in for this hard-core, add these tickers to your watchlist,  and   buy some 06/25 $UVXY calls ASAP.For those who are risk averse: buy   about  $2 ITM calls. For those who are feeling frisky, buy about $2  OTM  calls.\n\nI have no clue how bad the market will tank, or when. No freaking clue. But it will, and it will big time.\n\nBuy $UVXY calls now, $SOXS calls now, $SPXU calls soon, $SQQQ calls later and play $SPY shorts along the way.\n\nMy  Positions:06/25 $UVXY $28/$30C ($20 was on the money when I bought  it)06/25 $SOXS $8C06/25 $SPXU $20C07/26 $UVXY $36C07/26 $SPXU $2xC01/22  et al\n\nI have more positions than this, but there are to  many to list.
