When the value of the dollar declines, you want to own companies that can pass through higher costs to end consumers fairly easily (pricing power exceeding the rate of inflation).  You’d like to avoid companies that can’t adjust their prices but are dependent upon commodities (earnings compression).

If the price of oil and natural gas goes up, ET for instance (my personal pick for the space) will see higher production volumes which leads to increased earnings.  If the dollar devalues they can easily pass their higher costs onto the users of their infrastructure which simply gets passed down to the end user at the gas pump or on their energy bill.  Positive correlation to rising commodity prices plus dominant pricing power by rote of their industry, combined with a yield that is significantly higher than the rate of inflation as well.

It does hint at inflation (not a direct or great hint), but so far nothing that isn’t manageable and cyclical. In fact, your assertion that it’s at an “accelerating rate” is also false: it’s actually a pretty normal rate.\n\n2 - the USD has been inflating. Undeniably true, but again: is it dangerous? Economists wrestle with the idea, because in order to grow you often have to reinvest (spend).\n\nMy only point is that everything happening right now is actually fairly normal and cyclical. Does that mean it’s good? That’s debatable, but there’s no reason to panic as of right now.\n\nThe gray bars in that graph represent official recessions, so there both are and aren’t direct correlations.\n\nWhat is true is that as of available data right now, the dollar has lost value in the last few years (you’re right on that).

{"title": "I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks!", "selftext": "This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. \n\nOverall, it has been an amazing week for investors in general and all the top growing stocks that [I shared here last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) have ended in green with an average return of 11.7%. So, without further ado, let's dive into this week’s list! \n\n **Most Discussed Stocks of the Week** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/per8x892fn371.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d457b0954852cb8d3abacf10341d7dadd99e3d3\n\nBoth AMC and BB individually generated more discussion than the other 8 put together! This can be attributed to the possibility of the next squeeze and also the rallying stock price. Weed stocks also made a double entry into the top 10 list with SNDL coming in 4th and TLRY 5th (we will discuss why in the next section). Investors were most bullish about Tilray and Nokia’s prospects as reflected by the sentiment! Another interesting observation is that it has been a rough week for Tesla with it being the only stock in the list that ended in the red.\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ov3zes4cfn371.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5d580ccfea58c5659a40b50afec8b78da53666\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. Almost all the stocks increased in chatter due to the rally of meme stocks and not due to any fundamental news\n\n**BlackBerry($BB):** No points for guessing the top growing stock of the week. BlackBerry was also present in the [last week’s list](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) and the stock has been running up almost 80% in the last six weeks. The discussions were predominantly driven around whether BB would be the next short squeeze play. Even though the company has made some significant strides over the last year (Collaboration with AWS being an example), there are no specific news that’s driving the current rally.\n\n**Clean Energy Fuels($CLNE):** There isn’t any new fundamental news out of the company for the current rally but the discussion exploded in Reddit and the stock gained as much as 20% on Thursday. The stock experienced a quadrupling of the average daily volume as Reddit investors piled on to the stock. The company is still trading at a healthy 17.6% increase over last week’s closing price.\n\n**Workhorse Group($WKHS):** Even though the company did not have a good month in May with them disappointing the investors with their first-quarter results (the company only delivered six electric cargo trucks). But the shares of the company have rocketed more than 40% in June. The discussion volume as well as the trading volume has been on a consistent rise over the past week.  \n\n**Nokia($NOK):** Nokia’s current rally is primarily driven by optimism over its back-to-back 5G network deployment wins with multiple telecom operators such as Net4Mobility, DITO Telecommunity Corporation, T-Mobile, and Optus. The company has also resolved a long-drawn patent licensing dispute with Daimler and has been strengthening its financials by generating strong cash flows. Investor sentiment has also been extremely bullish as we can see from the trends.\n\n**Sundial Growers($SNDL):** Weed stocks are mainly moving due to a mix of fundamental news and retail trading interest. SNDL rose almost 30% this week before dropping down. The marijuana industry is consolidating and a spate of deals were announced this week. Adding to this, there has been progress in legalization efforts in the US. Tilray(TLRY) has also been on the run with the stock price increasing 12% and the chatter growing by 300% this week.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:** AMC Entertainment($AMC) chatter grew by 189% (which is massive considering that the stock was already the [most discussed stock last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/noc6r0/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/)) and Clover Health ($CLOV) discussions increased by 255% but were not high enough to make the top 5 list.\n\nThank you for reading! \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*", "id": "ntlyqy", "created_utc": 1622986748.0, "score": 2530, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 397, "comments": [{"body": "Always an interesting read, thank you", "score": 195, "replies": [{"body": "You are welcome :)", "score": 64, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Bit of a shortage of American cannabis companies on the stock exchange currently", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah and MSOS hasn’t been doing great as of late", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "CLRBF, TCNNF 2 great amer.

{"title": "Another good, clean 🚀🌙 DD... Let's review some discussion and thoughts about our wives' newest bf... Mr. $CLNE", "selftext": "Hello again WSB,\n\nAre you enjoying a weekend of recovery from an unfortunate (read: 100% normal) week of buying high and selling low? WELL, same here. Now that I'm awake from that Friday night bender (it's Sunday?), I wanted to take a few minutes to do a couple of things....\n\n1. TL;DR at the bottom, but I do hope you take a second to skim it\n2. Review some analyst predictions and price targets on CLNE\n3. Talk to you about CLNE short activity that has taken place over the last couple of days\n4. Update the room on the status of market conditions surrounding CLNE and just some sentiment\n\nIf you want to learn more about CLNE, I've got a short DD post in my history from last week that you can check out; it's an easy read. Or, recommended, you can search for one of the more in depth DD's done here; all great work.\n\n^(Disclaimers:) \n\n^(1. no images because auto-mod kept screwing me last time.  - 2. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. - 3. 1,000 shares at <$8.25 average dating back to first purchase in 2020.  - 4. Thank you mom for turning my computer on and transcribing my incoherent mumbling into these words.)\n\n# Let's start with a review of analyst price targets... CLNE closed Friday at $9.31\n\n* 5 analysts have offered 12 month price targets on CLNE\n* Low estimate is $11.00 (18.2% gain from Friday close)\n* High estimate is $27.00 (190% gain from Friday close)\n* Median estimate is $20.00 (114.8% gain from Friday close)\n* **Cramer came out in May and said he doesn't like the stock**\n\n\"aNaLyStS aRe DuMb AnD Ur DuMb ToO\" - I know and I know. \"AnD aMaZoN iS GoNnA dIlUtE tHeM sHaReS bRuThUr!\" What? Ok..... **To quote Bill \\[from science videos shown in elementary school class rooms whose last name happens to be the same as a small cap stock ticker\\],** ***consider the following...***\n\n* There's a legitimate case to be made for the stock having an extended-term floor of somewhere near $13.49, thanks to details of their partnership with little-known company called Amazon.\n* As a part of the deal with Bezos Inc, which also supports 46 CLNE fueling stations, Amazon reserved the right to purchase up to 53 million shares on warrants at a strike price of $13.49.\n* *However,* only a quarter of these are exercisable immediately. The rest are only vested after Jeff has made a certain amount of fuel purchases from CLNE. This drastically detracts from the cost of the deal, and the way CLNE runs those sales/revenues will most certainly be pumped back into additional infrastructure investment (see their earnings which are always dead on estimates and near $0.00 EPS)\n* In short, Amazon has a huge stake pending in CLNE, but only after significant additional expenditure and investment. AKA..... *PARTNERSHIP*\n\n# Moving on to the topic of... shorts and activity...\n\nI'm not as fluent on this subject as I am some others like technical mumbo jumbo and early 2000's pop-punk/emo music (IT'S NOT A PHASE MOM), but I think you'll appreciate the information here and at least be able to connect the dots as to how this relates to the other popular stonk plays on this sub.\n\n* Over the last 10 trading days, before Thursday/Friday, daily shares sold short sits at about 10% of volume.\n* On Thursday this rose to 26.8% on the day - on Friday again to 32% on the day\n* So what, 26 or 32% isn't huge, right? Sort of.\n* The significance from the rise in ratio of shares sold short vs volume is the **concurrent spike in volume.... In terms of absolute numbers, shares sold short went from about 500,000 per day to 8.10 million on Thursday and 10.64 million on Friday.**\n* The major short players on this stock have been Citadel and Blackstone.\n* Spoiler alert.... **According to fintel, short shares availability is only 8.6 million as of June 4th.**\n* With an average daily volume of around 5 million (again, before Thursday/Friday), how many days to cover....? You do the math.\n\n# And some final thoughts about market conditions around CLNE and the options landscape...\n\nI'm not here to push any squeeze thesis, just providing information to help you develop your own conclusions about what I believe to be a great stock play (I've been in since 2020). There is short and long term potential here, in my opinion.\n\n* The \\[now famous\\] June 18th $13 strike call OI now sits at 29,544, an increase of about 25% since my last update and representing 2.95 million shares of exercisable calls. This is about 60% of the average daily volume prior to the spike in volume on Thursday/Friday.\n* A reddit user, who I won't name because I haven't asked them, who used to work in IR at CLNE indicated to me during chat/discussion this weekend that the leadership team is aware of the recent uptick in interest/sentiment and are excited that people are not only interested in the company, but also believe in the product.\n* The DD content and general sentiment on here the last couple of days, and months honestly, has been positive. The environmental side of the story is great. Besides needing a decent business case and technicals, never before in history (my opinion) has it been more important to have a good story/mission to make people feel good about what your company is doing. Our society is more social than ever.\n* **🐄💨🚀** 🌙\n\nTL;DR\n\nDo I think this is a one-way ticket to \\[the planet\\] Uranus? No. Do I think this will make me an overnight millionaire? No, especially because my position is relatively small. But, I do think that there is a legitimate shot at some gains both short and long term here. **The company has a product, sales, partnerships, a good story, and now the backing of an army of passionate people (read: apes) who, quite simply, like the stock.**\n\nThanks and take care.\n\n^(EDIT: not sure if reddit notes if I edited my post, but if so, I just edited to fix one extra \"s\" on a word and some formatting oddities.

Its volumetric energy density is estimated at 42% of that Liquefied Natural Gas and 25% of diesel fuel.\n* **L**iquefied **N**atural **G**as like CNG, is a fuel that can be used in place of diesel, gasoline, etc. The main difference relies on the respective applications. LNG takes up 1/600 th the volume of Natural Gas in gaseous states, as it is cooled at -162° C (-260° F). Due to its higher logistic cost, LNG is perfect for the transportation of large quantities of gas in long distances and finds its application for heavy duty mobility (trucks and ships).\n\nOn the emission front, all natural gas fuels perform better than diesel or gasoline:\n\n* **CO2 Emissions**: CNG/LNG engines emit around 20% less CO2 than comparable diesel vehicles; obviously, if RNG or RLNG is used in the process this figure can be even lower on a net emission basis.\n* **SOx Emissions**: sulfur oxides are among the most important polluters in urban areas; being sulphur absent in the CNG / LNG compound, its emitted level is negligible, being 99% less than in a diesel engine. Sulphur is a problem for low-quality fuels in the maritime sector for example, with the IMO 2020 regulation being a step to its reduction;\n* **NOx Emissions**: Natural gas engines emits 80% less nitrogen oxide than diesel. NOx gases are usually produced from the reaction among nitrogen and oxygen during the combustion of fuels. They can penetrate sensitive lung tissue and damage it, worsening respiratory and heart diseases. Three way catalytic converters coated with platinum or other precious metals are required to reduce NOx emission;\n* **Particulate Emissions**: Natural Gas engines emits 95% less particulate than comparable diesel engines. The term fine particles, or particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are 2.5 microns or less in width. Like inches, meters, and miles, a micron is a unit of measurement for distance. There are about 25,000 microns in an inch. The widths of the larger particles in the PM2.5 size range would be about thirty times smaller than that of a human hair. The smaller particles are so small that several thousand of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.\n\nThen you have two different types of engines:\n\n* Spark ignition engines, whose performance if powered by CNG or LNG is worse that diesel equivalents (less torque power)\n* Compressed ignition engines, dual fuel engines that use 10% diesel and 90% LNG, same torque power of diesel engines but with natural gas emissions. For now these are more expensive than SI ones\n\nAmazon bought from CumminsWestport 700-1000 spark ignition ones, but west port separately sells Compressed ignition engines (main client now is VOLVO in Europe)", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Actually only about 25% of the cost of CNG comes from the commodity.

I'm here to show you that BB is still massively undervalued. I **really** like this stock, so below I've consolidated some of my favorite DD, with links at the end if you'd like to read more.\n\n# Products & Customers\n\n* BlackBerry isn't just a phone company any more. They provide best in class cybersecurity.\n* BlackBerry's most notable product is QNX, an RTOS with several applications. [Read here for more.](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le53ol/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n* In December of last year, Amazon announced a multi-year global agreement with BlackBerry QNX and developed IVY, a cloud-connected smart vehicle data platform. IVY allows automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data and create actionable insights from that date. It's possibilities are endless, and I highly recommend reading more on Amazon's initial announcement.\n* OK, so what the fuck does the point above mean? It means that **right now, electric vehicles are a gold rush, and BlackBerry is the one selling picks and shovels.** Through Amazon, IVY is going to become an integral part of the EV process.\n* The market is sucking the dick of EV manufacturers, but EV production is low margin and low scale. **BlackBerry IVY is data monetization, which is high margin and has unlimited scale.** Within a few years, BlackBerry will be making much more than the auto manufacturers they're partnered with.\n* Blackberry QNX is used by 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs.\n* BlackBerry targets more than just EVs though. They also have or are developing products for healthcare, financial services, government markets, energy, gas, oil, and smart grid connected transportation.\n\n# Cybersecurity Leader\n\n* BB offers best-in-class security, safety, and reliability. 18 of the G20 governments are customers, and they are the only software company to attain various security certifications from the US Govt.\n* Ransomware attacks have begun to impact American businesses like never before. Today, the commerce secretary stated ransomware attacks are here to stay, and that businesses should plan accordingly.\n* You know that oil pipeline that was taken out by DarkSide ransomware and caused oil shortages across the southeast U.S? That wouldn't have happened if Colonial Pipeline were using BlackBerry. Something tells me companies won't be making that mistake in the future.\n* According to Frost & Sullivan Research, BlackBerry addresses 96% of cyber threats, and 77% of Fortune 100 financial companies use BlackBerry software.\n\n[Here's a list of BB Certifications obtained in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/qey899yxnp371.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=f51e571ce7afcaf17126b2c168cb3f7a37343c35)\n\n# Some Basics and Fundamentals\n\n* BlackBerry has an \\~$8bn market cap with $1bn+ in yearly revenue and $800m in cash.\n* Since 2016, the number of QNX products has grown from 50 million to 175 million.\n* BB owns \\~38,000 patents worth approximately $450 million.\n* BB recently won a lawsuit against Facebook. I am unable to find the details, but most estimates are for between $1bn - $5bn total, paid over the course of a few years. BlackBerry's current market cap is only $8bn...\n* Blackberry has a strong customer base of critical infrastructure already, and their pivot from hardware to software means continuous subscription revenue.\n* **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as competitor Crowdstrike -** **who it outperforms** **- it would have a stock price of $83.** That's just taking into consideration one aspect of it's business model.\n* [Vanguard has doubled their position since Dec 31/2020.](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lzw0pn/vanguard_is_bullish_on_bb/)\n\n# TL;DR: 🚀🚀🚀 BB is going past the moon and into Alpha Centauri. This company is so much more than a meme stock or a short term squeeze - it's a life changing opportunity.

It's important to understand the risks of investing, and I'm not so in love with this stock that I'm blind, so here's the bear case:**\n\n* A lot of investors have been underwhelmed by revenue so far, and BlackBerry missed their expectations for Q4 2020. But it's worth noting the reason for buying BlackBerry right now is that when IVY revenue starts rolling in these concerns will wash away. It's a longer term play, similar to Palantir.\n* The bull case assumes CEO John Chen's estimate of being able to get roughly $500m for their patents is correct. If they get less than expected for that side of their business, or keep the patents and aren't able to monetize them in a meaningful way, that would be less than ideal.\n* The Facebook settlement could end up being more like 500m than the 2bn+ that's expected.\n* They could be passed in the cybersecurity field before they are able to leverage their current best in class service. This one is really unlikely considering how many other companies have tried to make products equivalent to what BlackBerry has - and failed.\n* EV companies could end up making their own OS and data services to resist IVY adoption. Several are trying (Tesla always comes in this conversation as an example), but from everything I've read none have managed to make as safe and comprehensive a system as BlackBerry.\n\nSo, *if* IVY doesn't get adopted, they're no longer the leading cybersecurity company, their lawsuit is for less money than expected, and their patents are actually worthless - then BlackBerry is only a little undervalued instead of incredibly undervalued.\n\n**Here's the most meaningful bear case right now though, and how the bulls can beat it:**\n\nThere seems to be a lot of upward resistance. Establishments, institutions, etc. are all convinced BB is a failed phone company stock worth $10. When it rises, large financial players short (because they believe they can buy back for $10 or less), buy puts, or just scalp to try and capitalize on the volatility which in turn creates a lot of resistance and breaks momentum.\n\nI don't think there's any conspiracy, I think the big players are just incompetent. These are pretty normal pullbacks and reactions to a stock that's gaining so quickly. The problem is that those big financial players I mentioned (as well as a lot of people on WSB) don't understand *why* this stock is so desirable. They just think it's a meme stock that's being pumped and don't understand the potential of: A) Becoming an essential step of EV manufacturing; B) Being best in class security during an age of ransomware attacks. So instead of getting in and riding the momentum, they create a self fulfilling prophecy of pullbacks.\n\n**The bulls can win the same way we've won in GME and AMC - by buying and holding. Continued days of large volume will completely fuck the bears who started taking huge short positions last week, leading to even bigger price movement. Buying shares or LEAPS and being patient is the way to play it and win big.** The bears win when bulls waste all their capital buying FDs that have no chance of finishing ITM or when they see a dip and paper hand their shares. It's funny to watch people freak out at a $2 dip when they easily could have just hedged that with a deep OTM weekly covered call. **Buy** ➡️ **Hold** ➡️  **Yacht**\n\nRegardless of the resistance that exists at the moment, there will come a day when big finance starts racing to get in on BB - and they'll pretend they were right all along. We've seen it constantly in tech stocks over the past few years. WSB can just expedite the inevitable by getting in on BB while it's still incredibly cheap.", "id": "ntvrr6", "created_utc": 1623013922.0, "score": 1776, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 226, "comments": [{"body": "bb to 25 EOW", "score": 273, "replies": []}, {"body": "Am retarded.

People are rushing to the highest strike available - $42. So much so that the premium on $40 is actually *lower than the premium on $42 right now.*\n* If it opens under $12.50 or falls there, I'll likely be buying a combination of shares and $40 LEAPS.\n* If it opens high and stays high, I'll play $30 weeklies. Just a word of advice though, you'd have to be absolutely crazy to hold these to expiration unless a short squeeze or some massive turnaround actually happens. If you can buy on Monday and sell for a big profit before Wednesday, that's preferable here.\n\nIf there's a big drop down to $10 or so, don't despair and assume the run up isn't happening.

Not only did all three companies go public within the last year, but they are all similar-sized [Direct Contracting Entities](https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/gpdc-model) (DCE) competing for \"lives under management\" *(Note: you'll see companies report this number using the term patients, members, or beneficiaries. They're all equivalent)*. This term simply means Medicare patients that the company is financially +/- clinically responsible for. Medicare pays $850+ per beneficiary per month for these companies to take on the risk of managing their healthcare costs. You can think of it as a lower margin (5-10% EBITDA) Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model that generates stable recurring revenue on a monthly basis for each patient being managed.\n\nCLOV started out as a Medicare Advantage (MA) insurance plan, which is pretty similar to Direct Contracting (DC). That's because [the DC model was designed based on the MA model](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/cms-direct-contracting-model---is-it-still-one-of-the-value-based-models-built-on-fee-for-service-chasis-) by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS launched the DC program in April 2021, and CLOV, OSH, and AGL among the first 53 organizations approved.\n\nOSH does a good job of explaining how the Medicare Advantage market (and now the DC market) works:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t0utrzxkgp371.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=f68cd3b940c33b8c41e51c51cd270e8f7208cd8e\n\nMA Plans are insurance companies that partner with specific healthcare providers to help manage the cost of their patients. The MA plan gets the $850+ monthly payment, and is [required by law to spend at least 85%](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare) of it on medical costs. They usually do this by giving 85% of the $850+ monthly payment to the healthcare provider, and thereby transfer the risk of unexpectedly high costs to the provider caring for the patient. The DC model works the same, except Medicare pays the Direct Contracting Entity (DCE) $850+ monthly. What's interesting about DC is that any type of organization can be a DCE. CLOV is an insurance company (MA plan) that creates networks of healthcare providers for their plan members. AGL is a Management Service Organization (MSO) that provides services to healthcare providers that care for Medicare Advantage patients. And OSH *is* a healthcare provider that operates brick-and-mortar clinics focused on Medicare Advantage patients.\n\nMedicare Advantage represents [26 million Americans](https://www.medicareresources.org/medicare-benefits/medicare-advantage/), accounting for about 36 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries. The DC program was launched by CMS so that Medicare Advantage companies like CLOV, AGL, and OSH could help manage the other 46 million Medicare beneficiaries in order to transition away from fee-for-service healthcare. **It's a huge deal.**\n\nBelow I'll break down the key numbers driving the valuation of these three companies for their Medicare Advantage business. The DC business is obviously new, but I'll predict what the valuations will look like in DC afterward. **The most important thing to understand here is that the valuation for all three of these companies is the number of lives under management multiplied by a dollar amount. The dollar amount is the market saying how much they believe in the company's ability to profitably manage those patients.**\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not saying all three companies should be valued exactly the same. I am arguing that the dollar amount per managed life should be within a much tighter window because the gross margin for managing a Medicare life (MA or DC) will always end up in a very tight window (5-10% of revenue) no matter what model you deploy.\n\n**OSH = $14.3B market cap**\n\nOSH is obviously liked the most by the market based on their valuation. It's partly because they run the clinics so they can keep more of the Medicare dollar (instead of splitting it with the healthcare provider that takes on the risk). Employing clinicians also allows them to theoretically do more to improve health outcomes and control costs. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% off the top, and the rest goes to OSH.\n\n* **OSH gross margin = 6.7%** ([source](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/osh/financials))\n* **75,500 total managed lives growing to 112,000 this year** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))\n* **That's a valuation of $125,000 per patient**\n\n**AGL = $14.3B market cap**\n\nAGL holds the contract with the MA plan and then pays the contracted (not employed) healthcare provider. In this model, the MA Plan takes 15% of the premium off the top, and the rest is split between AGL and the provider practices.\n\n* **AGL gross margin = 7%** ([source](https://capital.com/agilon-health-ipo-will-the-stock-soar-in-2021))\n* **165,300 total risk-based patients growing to 210,000 this year** ([source](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-agilon-health-ipo/healthcare-platform-agilon-valued-at-about-11-billion-in-nyse-debut-idUSKBN2C22D7))\n* **That's a valuation of $66,667 per patient**\n\n**CLOV = $3.65B market cap**\n\nCLOV has historically been just a MA plan, taking the 15% of the premium off the top and paying the rest to cover the patient's costs ([source](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2013/05/23/2013-12156/medicare-program-medical-loss-ratio-requirements-for-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare)). MA plans have an average profit margin of 4.3% after all their admin and sales expenses are accounted for ([source](https://mhk.com/medicare-advantage-is-the-golden-egg-for-health-plans/)).\n\n* **CLOV historical gross margin (before COVID effect) = 2.5-4.1 %** ([source](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213))\n* **132,000 total risk-based patients growing to 160,000 this year** ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))\n* **That's a valuation of $22,800 per patient**\n\n**AGL is a good preview of how the DC market could be valued per Medicare patient, except the DC model could be even better. There is no MA plan taking 15% off the top in between the risk-bearer (Direct Contracting Entity: CLOV, AGL, or OSH) and Medicare. Direct Contracting patients could be valued as high as $76,667 (15% premium over current AGL patients).**\n\nThe CEO of OSH was recently quoted \"**the per-patient economics of that program will potentially be better than the company had initially estimated\"** ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))**.**\n\nHere are the number of Medicare patients enrolled by each DCE (since the program launched in April 2021):\n\n* **OSH: 6,500** managed lives ([source](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/oak-street-health-projects-strong-growth-2021-despite-64m-loss-q1))\n* **AGL**: **50,000** managed lives ([source](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001831097/98fb566d-8f47-4a36-bd48-6bef5745cf56.pdf))\n* **CLOV: 65,000** managed lives ([source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/17/2230595/0/en/Clover-Health-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results.html))\n\nHopefully now those valuation ranges I presented at the top make a little more sense to you.\n\n//\n\n# Here's an outline of how the Clover Assistant (CA) platform improves treatment decisions and risk adjustment for the provider:\n\n* **More informed doctors delivering better treatment and care**\n   * CA will make treatment recommendations using evidence-based guidelines\n   * Primary care providers manage so many different conditions, it's impossible for them to keep up with all the medical literature\n   * CA will present the latest evidence-based guidelines as simple recommendations, so that the primary care provider doesn't have to stay up-to-date on the most advanced treatment pathways for every condition\n* **More accurate documentation for higher Medicare payments (MA and DC)**\n   * The monthly $850+ payment to MA and DC organizations is adjusted based on the patient's risk score (basically how many health conditions they have)\n   * The risk score is calculated using diagnosis codes (ICD-10 codes) that are entered into the electronic health record (EHR) by the doctor and eventually included in the insurance claim that goes to the MA plan (and Medicare)\n   * Providers often forget to include all the codes in the insurance claim, or even sometimes forget to properly document it in the EHR\n   * Providers also forget to re-document codes on an annual basis, because on January 1 all of the diagnosis codes are erased in Medicare's risk score calculation because some diagnoses can change (e.g. cancer remission)\n      * This sounds stupid, but if a diabetic patient has an amputated foot, Medicare acts like it grows back on Jan 1 and the doctor has to document the diagnosis again\n      * Medicare is either too lazy to discern between permanent vs reversible conditions, and/or they like that they get to pay less for an inaccurately lower risk score\n   * When providers forget to include one or more codes, that means the risk score will be lower and the premium received by the MA plan will be lower\n   * CLOV's software analyzes data from the EHR as well as past claims to identify diagnosis codes that are missing from the current claim, and asks the provider if they still have the condition to see if the doctor simply forgot to document the code\n   * CLOV's software also analyzes EHR and claims data to identify potentially missing diagnosis codes and asks the doctor if the patient ever had a certain condition using evidence-based guidelines\n      * Example: blood pressure reading > 140/90 (threshold in hypertension guidelines) but no hypertension diagnosis code documented\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# \n\n# Why is CLOV Undervalued?\n\n**Part 1: Hindenburg Report (February 2021)**\n\n* Hindenburg does research for short hedge funds. The [report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/clover/) revealed a DOJ investigation into CLOV that was previously undisclosed. The day after the report was released, an SEC investigation was initiated into CLOV based on the report. The report had a number of unrelated claims on shady marketing practices, undisclosed business relationships, and \"upcoding\".\n* Probably the most serious accusation of them all is the one about \"upcoding\". If this is true, it's Medicare fraud. The number one rule in the Medicare industry is DON'T OVERBILL MEDICARE. In the case of CLOV, I seriously doubt there is any upcoding going on based on how their software works. The Clover Assistant (CA) software doesn't have the ability to change any codes. It just makes recommendations. The doctor has to manually do it for regulatory *and* patient safety reasons. There are other population health tools out there that do this exact thing. Often times when upcoding is being investigated, it's because the Medicare fee-for-service claims suggest a much lower risk score. However, that's because providers don't document most codes in fee-for-service claims because they don't get paid to spend the extra time. When the patient then enrolls in a MA plan or DC program, all of a sudden [their risk score shoots up](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170519/NEWS/170519815/doj-s-medicare-advantage-lawsuits-investigations-likely-to-change-insurance-culture) because the MA/DC organization and provider get paid based on risk.\n* Regarding the other accusations, [CLOV released a point-by-point response](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521029637/d66346dex991.htm) the day after the report came out. I thought they addressed everything sufficiently. From an investor's perspective, it all comes down to what the DOJ finds. I'd be very surprised if Chamath's counsel and the third-party counsel involved in the SPAC ignored or did not look into illegal practices during due diligence. This was one of Chamath's first SPACs and he knew was launching many more. If you mess up due diligence once, the rest of your SPACs become worthless.\n* **Regarding the BS about the CEO Vivek Garripali**, he bought 3 hospitals in bankruptcy and assumed their debt almost 10 years ago. He quickly found out why they were in so much debt. The health insurance companies offer such limited coverage and almost exclusively to high income neighborhoods. So, if their insuree visited a hospital or clinic or anything outside of their coverage area, the insurance company would refuse to pay the hospitals fees or only agree to paying a small portion. So the medical facility ultimately ends up assuming the debt and this eventually snowballs. Anyways. Vivek began charging these insurance companies high premiums on the accounts he could collect on in an attempt to make up for the losses for patients they wouldn't pay for. This is where they try and paint him as a villain. Long story short. He sold the the hospitals and created Clover Health in order to solve this corrupt problem throughout the health insurance industry. For his time and money invested. He didn't make money as much as he learned from this experience. So a big part of Clover's mission is offering widespread coverage to their insurees. These big insurance companies are hating this. Hence much of the hate for Clover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Part 2: DC Enrollment Numbers (May 2021)**\n\n* CLOV announced their initial Direct Contracting (DC) enrollment numbers in their most recent quarterly report. The 65,000 DC patients were far below the 200,000 that the market was expecting. There was obviously a miscommunication between CLOV and the market. CLOV stated they had *access* to 200,000 Medicare patients through their network of 1,800 providers using their software. Analysts took that as a projection of enrollment. They still have access to all those patients and will enroll them over time. My guess is they were able to do [claims-based alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) for much of the initial 65,000 DC patients, which is automatic. Now they have to market this program to the other $135,000 DC patients to get them enrolled via [voluntary alignment](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/direct-contracting-summary) (i.e. consent). They could also market the MA plan which has more benefits. That's the power of CLOV having a network of providers contracted with its DCE and MA plan.\n* This lower DC patient enrollment has now been priced in with analysts adjusting down to an average price target of [$9.33](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CLOV/research-ratings). These price targets are based on extremely conservative enrollment projections and revenue projections from CLOV for their DC business.\n* They set forecasts at 70,000 to 100,000 by end of 2021. *They already have 65,000 enrolled in April*. They intentionally set expectations extremely low to absorb the negative market reaction upfront and then outperform going forward. They also reported extremely low revenue projections for the DC patients. They're only projecting [$20M - $30M](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results) for the year.\n* I would guess that their **profits** from the DC market this year could be $25M+ (5% margin x 65,000 patients x $850 x 9 months). Revenue should be similar to Medicare Advantage at $850+ per patient per month. That's at least $55M in Medicare payments per month for 65,000 DC patients.\n* They did state that \"[GAAP revenue estimates for Direct Contracting are dependent on the finalization of accounting treatment, which we expect will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2021](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results)\".\n\n**Part 3: Differentiation**\n\n* CLOV does have a virtuous cycle built into its business. It's all based on their relationship with their provider network. When they contract with a healthcare provider, they give them access to the Clover Assistant (CA) for free. CA is a software platform that analyzes electronic health record (EHR) and claims data to provide decision support back to the provider at the point of care.\n* The CA platform is a population health tool. There are competing software solutions in the market. The difference here is that the provider has to pay for access to those tools. CLOV pays the provider to use the CA platform. CLOV pays **$200** per visit, which is much higher than the average [$121.45](https://truecostofhealthcare.org/medicare_part_b/) that other MA plans pay.\n* The reason that CLOV pays the provider to use it is because it improves the top and bottom line for CLOV. CA helps providers make better treatment decisions and document risk scores more accurately, which results in higher Medicare payments (to CLOV and the provider). Higher Medicare payments directly increases the top line revenue. Better treatment decisions lead to lower costs, which allows CLOV (MA plan or DCE) to keep more Medicare dollars. If you're interested in how CA works, I'll include some bulletpoints at the bottom of the post.\n* **Happy providers are key to increasing the number of lives managed long term.** Providers are directly involved in the \"alignment\" process for DC enrollment, and their opinion is highly respected when making a recommendation around which MA plan a patient should choose. As CLOV grows its provider network, it will increase enrollment for both MA and DC. It will also lead to more CA software users, more software users usually leads to better experience and insights, which could reinforce itself and bring more providers onboard.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Risks to CLOV\n\nBelow are the biggest risks I see for CLOV, in order of importance:\n\n**1.** **DOJ Investigation**\n\nAs I mentioned above, I don't think there were illegal practices going on at CLOV that management, Chamath, or the third-party counsel were aware of. It's still possible the DOJ investigation finds something. This happens all the time in the Medicare industry, including to the biggest names ([UnitedHealth, Humana,](https://www.whistleblowerattorneys.com/blog/whistleblower-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud) [Cigna](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/doj-cigna-medicare-advantage-fraud-lawsuit/583023/), etc.).\n\nAll the MA plans learn from each other's missteps. CLOV has been operating an MA plan for over 5 years now. They were [fined $106,095 in 2016](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/cms-fines-clover-health-for-misleading-marketing-tactics) for 'misleading' marketing tactics. *They haven't been fined since*. They have also gone through multiple rounds of funding from top venture capitalists and Google. There's been no shortage of due diligence on this company.\n\nYet, there is always the risk that someone somewhere was doing something illegal this time. If that is the case, it will likely end up in a lawsuit. I've seen many cases get to this stage and then get dismissed by a federal judge ([UnitedHealth 1](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/unitedhealthcare-medicare-advantage-fraud-suit-department-justice), [UnitedHealth 2](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/department-justice-unitedhealth-medicare-advantage-fraud), ). Worst case scenario for the company, there is a settlement. Here are examples of MA plans paying settlements for \"upcoding\" fraud cases:\n\n* UnitedHealth (2017): [$32M](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/antifraud/florida-insurers-pay-32m-to-settle-medicare-advantage-fraud-case)\n* Kaiser Permanente (2020): [$6.3M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-63-million-settle-false-claims-act-allegations)\n* Humana (2021): [$12.5M](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/payer-issues/humana-roche-settle-false-claims-lawsuit-for-12-5m.html)\n\nThe largest settlement ever was [$270M](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/medicare-advantage-provider-pay-270-million-settle-false-claims-act-liabilities) by HealthCare Partners (now part of UnitedHealth) in 2018. This was because the providers themselves were submitting false codes (not the health plan). All of these settlements are for \"upcoding\". Again, among all the accusations, I would be most surprised if CLOV was actually doing this. If anything, the Clover Assistant should result in better documentation around the codes because that's what it's designed to do.\n\nNo matter how cynical a view you want to take on the DOJ investigation, CLOV has no debt and $700M in cash from the SPAC proceeds, so a settlement should not significantly impact them.\n\n**2.** **SEC Investigation**\n\nThe SEC investigation was announced the day after the Hindenburg report came out. The SEC is investigating whether the DOJ inquiries were material enough to require disclosure to the market. The investigation may not be closed until the DOJ inquiries have been resolved. If the SEC determines there should have been a disclosure, there will likely be a fine. I'm not an expert on SEC enforcement. The only thing I could point to would be the $20M fine Elon Musk paid for announcing a fake acquisition at a much higher price at the time. He picked $420 as the fake number, not sure why...\n\n**3. Market Multiple**\n\nValuations based on profitability could be hurt in the short term. Medical costs are higher this year due to delayed care during COVID-19, so all companies in this space will have compressed margins in the short-term. I believe growth is more important than profitability in this market when you're looking at <1% of DC patients enrolled. CLOV has proven to be exceptional at growth and has proven it both in MA and now DC.\n\nThere could also be a general downturn in market sentiment, and these growth stocks with low margins would be affected the most. However, Medicare is a very stable business and these companies will continue to grow independent of economic conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Meme-Stock Correlation, Short Interest, and Gamma Squeeze setup\n\nTo keep this short and sweet - CLOV was originally identified by WSB & Stocktwitters for the short interest being reported over 100% at one point.  This is due to several miscalculations but the idea is true that SI is not being correctly reported.  It is estimated to be over 50% but is reported around 40% on Ortex.  This has been the main area of interest in relation to meme stocks.\n\n# How did CLOV get caught up in all the meme madness?\n\nWell..  if you dont remember, back in January, chamath palihapitiya encouraged retail investors, along with elon musk, to buy and SQUEEZE GME + AMC.\n\n[GME squeezes from 60 to over 150 the next day on this Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/quoosh9nup371.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0b3d8969d37920eee6947d97ac8585eaea345d)\n\n[but this helped too](https://preview.redd.it/qucv5j9tup371.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=88e306406085ab9fc59d787bd3ab2381a52df689)\n\nHe made himself an enemy of hedgefunds who lost on these bets.  So when they doubled down their shorts on gme / amc - they went after chammaths stock, CLOV.  But they fucked up.  They doubled down and shorted it to shit because they lost money because of him.\n\nWith great fundamentals, **the short thesis is based on one thing alone - the HindenTurd report -** and guess what that is?  bullshit.\n\n# \n\n# Did you mention Gamma Squeeze??\n\nyes I did.
