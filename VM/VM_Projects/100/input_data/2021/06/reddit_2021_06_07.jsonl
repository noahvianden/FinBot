Is this correct?\n\nThat is **one way** to delta hedge, but not the only way. MM portfolios are much more complex than you are allowing for.\n\nThere are some good real-world descriptions of how MM delta hedging actually works [here](https://www.quora.com/Exactly-how-do-option-market-making-desks-manage-their-hedges-of-delta-and-other-Greeks-Is-it-different-for-vanilla-options-vs-warrants-CFDs-or-any-leveraged-product). I quote one answer in it's entirety below, because it is the most reflective on how complex delta hedging actually is. Note the bolded portion, that's the crux of the matter.\n\n-------------\n\nShort answer: \"It depends.\"\n\nA typical options MM can wind up weighted towards short positions. While this means their static portfolio gamma can tend to be negative, the goal of dynamic hedging is to produce flatter gamma effects; likewise for the other greeks.\n\nIn an ideal, spherical-cow world, dynamic hedging is a continuous process, with any fill of order A followed immediately by creation of a new order B to hedge one or more of the resulting portfolio greeks -- all of them, not just delta. In that ideal world, MMs also continually and precisely re-hedge in response to new underlying spot and volatility.\n\nIn the real world, you can't do this with infinite precision, due to valuation uncertainties, tick increments, execution costs, and the bid/ask spreads of whatever things you're using as a hedge. Add to this the uncertainty of how many derivative moments you should care about -- are 9th-order moments really worth hedging? Why or why not?\n\n**What you use as a hedge, and when, is where the art (and competitiveness) resides. You might tweak a bid or ask on either the same option or another, you might trade an underlying that you think is correlated and more liquid, or you might weigh the risk versus execution costs and decide to defer the hedge until later. You might tweak one or more greeks before a news event or close, or you might not, depending on your spot or vol directional bias, if any. You're likely to write code to recommend or execute much of this for you, and then depend on your systems infrastructure to keep it all going.**\n\nThat last phrase is key — when you replace static hedges with dynamic, you become dependent on your systems to react quickly and accurately enough to keep you out of trouble. Dynamic hedging converts financial risk into systems risk.\n\nIn the case of a large institutional desk, what they do, and how they do it, depends in large part on their researchers, developers, and sysadmins, how they communicate with each other and their traders, and the resulting reliability, accuracy, and feature set of their systems. Hedging might be real-time, or it might be batched intraday or EOD. In years past, they might have had an overnight batch run such that they get previous-day numbers out of it and then use trader discretion to tweak orders based on new events. The most effective system today is likely a combination -- light analysis with best-effort hedging real-time, batch intraday, deeper analysis overnight, orders automated, and traders on the kill switch.\n\nHow well this all works, and what works best for you, depends entirely on how you run your business.\n\n--------------\n\n\n> I ask because I sold some of the shares that I held for the added leverage of ITM calls, thinking that it would not change the number of shares available to short, but now am wondering if the market maker wouldn't also lend the hedged shares out for someone else to short, for a fee.\n\nMy point in providing the details above is to show you that what you do as a retail trader by yourself isn't going to make a difference to how MMs hedge their end of the trade. Now, if all the WSB warriors band together enough to get the attention of institutional investors, and those institutional investors get involved in the play and move some real money, in units of hundreds of millions, the MMs might be forced to respond.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I figured that I was looking at it too simplisticly, thank you for the detailed response, I appreciate it!

That isn't accurate. You have to maintain your property, you have to carry a liability insurance in case your tenant sues you. You pay property taxes... Like someone in the comments mentioned, it is work. You may also face a tenant who stops paying and won't leave. Not only do you no longer collect rent, you also have to pay attorney fees to evict. Don't expect to retrieve your property in good shape when the sheriff kicks the tenant out. Been there, no fun.\n\nAlso, the argument that you shouldn't sell to avoid paying taxes seems like a weak one too. You won't pay taxes on the same gain twice if you switch to stocks, and you're not going to escape taxes by holding on to those properties. Your goal is to build wealth to improve your lifestyle or build a retirement fund. So you will have to sell eventually because you can't pay your kids' college tuition or buy yourself a boat when you're 50 with a townhouse in Seattle. Besides, if you need to sell your property, you have to do some repair to make your property look good, contact your realtor, list the unit, wait for a buyer, go through inspections, etc... It may take months until you actually receive the funds. On the other hand, you can buy stocks today, sell tomorrow, withdraw the funds the next day. The idea is liquidity.\n\nNow the argument of value. Let's see where you'd be if instead of buying that property, you would've invested the same amount of money in Apple for instance, and not even look at your investment until now. In January 2015, AAPL was $26. It was $44 in January 2018. Today before open, it's $126, i.e. +484% from 2015 and +286% from 2018. You can use a Vanguard ETF like VGT if you prefer: +353% since January 2015, +225% since January 2018. Compare this with your +35% and your rent, deduct your mortgage, insurance, repair, realtor fees, property taxes, taxes on your rent, the time you spent dealing with issues...\n\nThat being said, stocks are a completely different animal. For starters, it's more volatile. Company performance dictates stock price in the long run, but short term price is very unpredictable. So if you think you'll need the money in less than 6-12 months, don't invest in stocks. But if you won't need the money soon, pick a few solid Vanguard ETFs for instance, you can literally buy today, and not look until 2035. You can also generate some income stream for yourself with covered calls. If you pick your stocks well, you'll see that some can be used for that purpose only and generate more money than rent.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This right here.

{"title": "France fines Google $267 million for abusing ‘dominant position’ in online advertising", "selftext": " France’s competition watchdog has fined Google 220 million euros ($267 million) for abusing its market power in the online advertising industry.\n\nThe French Competition Authority said Monday Google had unfairly sent business to its own services, and discriminated against the competition. Google has agreed to pay the fine and end some of its self-preferencing practices, the watchdog said.\n\nThe investigation found that Google gave preferential treatment to its DFP advertising server, which allows publishers of sites and applications to sell their advertising space, and its SSP AdX listing platform, which organizes auction processes and allows publishers to sell their “impressions” or advertising inventory to advertisers. Google’s rivals and publishers suffered as a result, the regulator said.\n\nIsabelle de Silva, president of the French Competition Authority, said in a statement that the decision is the first in the world “to look at the complex algorithmic auction processes by which online advertising ‘display’ operates.”\n\nShe added that the investigation revealed processes by which Google favored itself over its competitors on both advertising servers and supply-side platforms, which are pieces of software used by publishers to manage, sell and optimize ad space on their websites and mobile apps.\n\n“These very serious practices have penalized competition in the emerging online advertising market, and have enabled Google not only to preserve but also to increase its dominant position,” said de Silva.\n\n“This sanction and these commitments will make it possible to re-establish a level playing field for all actors, and the ability of publishers to make the most of their advertising spaces.”\n\nGoogle announced in a blog on Monday that it will be making a series of changes to its advertising technology.\n\n“We recognize the role that ad tech plays in supporting access to content and information and we’re committed to working collaboratively with regulators and investing in new products and technologies that give publishers more choice and better results when using our platforms,” wrote Maria Gomri, legal director of Google France.\n\nThe investigation comes after U.S.-based News Corp, French newspaper Le Figaro and the Belgian press group Rossel filed a complaint against Google.\n\nRegulators across Europe are clamping down on the major U.S. tech giants amid concerns that they wield too much power on the bloc’s 700 million plus citizens.\n\nLast week, Facebook was hit by two antitrust probes from regulators in the U.K. and Europe.\n\nThe European Commission has launched probes into Amazon, Google and Microsoft over the last few years, while the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority has also launched probes into Google and Apple since it became an independent regulator in its own right in January following Britain’s exit from the EU.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/google-fined-by-france-for-abusing-online-advertising-position.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/07/google-fined-by-france-for-abusing-online-advertising-position.html)", "id": "nu950n", "created_utc": 1623061843.0, "score": 3972, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 246, "comments": [{"body": "This is just a modern way of taxing large tech companies, Just fine them every now and again", "score": 478, "replies": [{"body": "\"Taxation is fine\"", "score": 113, "replies": []}, {"body": "Cant think of a better combo than the EU and shaking down American tech.", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "At this point the EU can basically list fines on American tech companies as part of their GDP.", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "handle lock command ancient judicious cagey clumsy worry trees treatment -- mass edited with https://redact.dev/", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "I have no sympathy for these corporations, but to me that sounds like there needs to be a fix to the tax system, not a shake down for money every other month.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "This is not a tax issue, they abused their position.

I'm in IT, so I'm reasonably current on what's going on in the semiconductor world and tech stocks.  It's not like a magic panacea, but it's easier to have convictions about a company when you're familiar with them, their products, public sentiment about them, etc.  My oldest holding (outside 401k stuff) is Google.  They've about doubled annualized market returns since I bought.\n\nAnother one is just being a step ahead of the market...  There's a meta-game there, where you're predicting where money is going to go in the short term and getting there first.  \n\nFor example:  When the market took a dump because Covid in March 2020, you can sit down, think what companies might flourish in this new scenario.  \n\n* Online shopping?  Amazon doubled in 5 months\n\n* Meal delivery? Grubhub doubled in like 5 months\n\n* Online meetings?  Zoom was like 5x in 7 months. (bought at $131, sold at $487 six months later)\n\n* Delivery services?  FedEx almost tripled in six months.  UPS wasn't quite as meteoric, but still almost doubled in 5 months. (Bought FDX and $117, sold half at $240 about 10 months later, still have the rest)\n\n* Online document signing?  Docusign over doubled in 5 months.  \n\n* At the time, there was serious panic about airlines -- I assumed the government isn't going to let the entire industry go bankrupt, bought UA at $21 and sold at $31 in 11 days.  \n\nIn that six month timeframe, you'd have done just fine with the S&P too, with upwards of 50% gains... But I'll take 5x over 1.5x any day.\n\nCovid was obviously a pretty rare scenario, but similar opportunities present themselves if you pay attention.  \n\n* When oil futures went negative during the covid crisis, USL dropped to $10/share, and is currently back at $24/share.  (I bought at $10 and got out at $16 or so 4 months later)\n\n* Able to predict materials shortage and stuff?  Bought CMC at $20, sold at $32 six months later.\n\n* When Peleton announced their recall a month ago, their stock dropped to $80/share.  Peleton owners are cult-like in their devotion.  Currently back to $110 or so.  (I bought at 80.49 and got out at $96 11 days later because it still looked overvalued at $80 to me)\n\n* I ate at a Chipotle in the early days, when they weren't all that common, and I even had the thought \"I should totally buy stock in Chipotle\".  14 years later, I still kick myself for not throwing money at it back then. (like 1500% gains)\n\nCaveats:\n\nObviously there's risk with any of this -- sometimes you might jump the wrong way.  I've lost a bundle on oil stocks pre-covid, underperformed the market with Verisign during Covid, losing money relative to the market with AMZN stock right now, I have some super-boring stock like MRK which is underperforming, etc.  I thought BRK was going to explode since they were sitting on piles of cash and could pick up companies on the cheap during the pandemic, but I underestimated just how fast the market would bounce back.  I still own those shares and they've even beaten the market with them, but man, if I'd only thrown more money at ZM instead...  Then you'll just completely miss things, like I assumed the housing market would be *dead* during the pandemic.  Stupid...\n\nI always take at least rudimentary looks at financials.  I think it's important to look at a risk/reward scenario even if I'm not trying to do my own DCF models.  That's why I'm a scaredy cat with stuff like PTON and UA, both held under 2 weeks.

The government, understanding the plan, said fine, start work on your \"warehouse\", and if you want to change it to a battery factory, here are the steps you have perform for the application.

He has said that before, and also I think words to the effect that factories are one of their products. As a consequence to that point of view, Tesla evolves their factories perhaps almost as fast as their vehicles. A few months ago, Joe Tegtmeyer, who produces drone videos of the Giga Texas site but who also talks with the workers and has inside information sources, said he had been told that at that point, the factory had gone through at least 12 design changes (I've seen some, for example a trench structure along the east side that was later torn up). Apparently Tesla felt that the disruption caused by these design changes would be more than made up by improvements in production or quality. So it could be a recently-developed design approach for making battery cells.\n\nIn addition to their main cell factory in the big building, Giga Texas has at least one other battery-related facility, which may be the \"Bobcat Project\" area east of the big building. It seems to be focused more toward the raw materials side of battery cell production - making things that go into the battery cell. It's possible that Giga Berlin is attempting to include this plus the actual cell production all into one building, perhaps to simplify the permitting process. \n\nOne step in preparing materials to go into the batteries (see the Battery Day presentation) is pulverization, which I imagine would involve heavy equipment and vibration.\n\nTo me, there is a possibility that the huge thick foundation in Giga Berlin is to support pulverizing equipment.

{"title": "RKT's new friend and the Russell Shuffle 1000", "selftext": "This could be pretty huge for the stock. \n\nEdit: To be clear, RKT has always been eligible for Russell 1000 but I never saw the index fund on finra prior to yesterday. I always look for new funds/institutions that add or sell RKT every time reports are due. This is the first time I’ve seen Russell which added 05/31. The best part is lots of growth funds have sold and have been replaced with value funds. This includes Russell 1000 who just increased their position as RKT continues to increase their free float through transfer of class D shares to class A shares. \n\nRussell 1000 index officially began to add RKT. This is good for WSB because mid-cap stocks are higher risk, higher reward. This may be why RKT has been trading different than meme stocks, but also somewhat impacted still since it's included largely in the social sentiment etf. RKT has had a recent increase in volume over the past 2 weeks and I think it's because investors are adding in preparation of Russell 1000 additions . This link will provide pretty much everything you need to know about the Russell Shuffle (I know it's Barron's but it's not a persuasive article, just sited info.)\n\n\"For investors, the run-up to the rebalancing presents an opportunity to get ahead of some of the fund flows into and out of stocks that are joining or leaving the indexes.\n\nRussell will release its preliminary indexes on June 5. They are based on May 8 prices, which allows analysts and investors to approximate the lists ahead of time. The actual rebalancing will take place after the market closes on Friday, June 26. Tens of billions of dollars of shares will be traded in the closing minutes to align with the new indexes.\n\nBank of America Securities anticipates that more than 200 stocks will move in and out of Russell’s indexes, with more shifting between their growth and value subindexes\"\n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-investors-can-play-the-rebalancing-of-the-russell-indexes-51590158778](https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-investors-can-play-the-rebalancing-of-the-russell-indexes-51590158778)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Prior to May RKT was primarily held in growth funds.**\n\nThere are two types of Russell 1000 investments: growth and value.\n\nValue - **An investment strategy that involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic or book value.**\n\n**Growth - An investment strategy with less emphasis on valuation! Hence the undervaluation and more on growth.**\n\n[https://www.investdavenport.com/the-value-vs-growth-debate/](https://www.investdavenport.com/the-value-vs-growth-debate/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's interesting is that growth funds have sold RKT and value funds are picking it up so we can assume Russell has it within their value index as well.  I THINK THIS IS HUGE....maybe a better P/E or just more volume.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFunds that sold (growth pic 1). Funds that just added (value pic 2).\n\nImage source: [https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/CompanyInfo/detail.jsp?query=14:0P0001KFJS](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/CompanyInfo/detail.jsp?query=14:0P0001KFJS)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Growth sold](https://preview.redd.it/ady0u939bx371.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=45bc29526ef78cbacce8158e56b1224288d140a5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the funds that added...Russell is new as you can see and the funds tend to be more value index.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Value added](https://preview.redd.it/zclrykkabx371.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6cf4e09a467faf5b5295e853c3841e7e5a7e16e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: This means we can expect different price action with RKT, possibly less suppression, and possibly enhanced PE ratios.  This also means volume, primarily in the month of June. When you combine volume, a small float, and WSB with an undervalued historically manipulated company - you get moon. Don't be fooled...RKT can sky rocket and can be a dominant company that leads Russel to new highs.
