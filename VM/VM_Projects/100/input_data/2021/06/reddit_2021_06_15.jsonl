With big board stocks that is less frequent but still happens, mostly because the share price is so high already and the company is healthy enough to not be a pennystock. But that doesn't mean a company can't find an outside investor to take them private via a stock purchase, or whatever deal to gain a majority stake. Like Elon threatening to take Tesla private at 420/share for example.\n\nThere are SEC guidelines for what a company is allowed to do and how, but as long as the info is made public before a deal is done then its legit. A company can issue however many shares they want if someone will pay for it, and likewise a controlling stake can be bought if people are selling. That doesn't mean people won't try to sue them or it won't get shot down in a shareholder vote, but however the company wants to operate is up to them (as long as they still own a majority stake of course). It is kinda pointless to think of obscure scenarios like that though because a healthy company wouldn't be entering into some private deal to increase the float 100x or to give away a controlling stake, that is pennystock stuff. \n\nAll of those questions relate to the terms of a deal being made. Any money or shares being exchanged would have a predetermined date for doing so, set amounts and prices, shares, etc. These are all things that are worked out ahead of time, and yes money exchanges hands and whatever risk they are assuming is already accounted for by the purchasing bank or firm.

Netflix doesn't produce evergreen content like it used to", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": ">they mine user data like crazy unlike the disconnect sordid mess that Network research did to find out what people like.\n\nThis is the often forgotten golden goose of Netflix. \n\nWhen it comes to buying, developing, and presenting original content to users, Netflix can dig into a very robust and granular data set that gives them an intimate view of what their users enjoy watching. The mainstream networks and studios don’t have access to that kind of information. The best they have are focus groups, which provide only a handful of very broad metrics, are rather expensive, and not guaranteed to be accurate. Compare that to Netflix, which collects data in real time and in about the most natural way possible with little added cost, and there’s simply no competition. \n\nThat said, saturation of the streaming market does pose a problem for Netflix. With the way things are going, it’s easy to see a future where every major network has their own streaming service and keeps its content exclusive. Popular content from mainstream networks is a big draw for Netflix. It may prove rather difficult - not to mention expensive - to produce enough content, for enough people, with great enough frequency to keep the volume of paying customers that they currently have. That’s not to say that Netflix is doomed, but it certainly puts a squeeze on their potential growth. \n\nThat said, I can see a few available avenues that Netflix can take to compensate for that squeeze. Number one is advertising. It’s practically non-existent in Netflix’s current business model and the aforementioned wealth of data they possess would allow them to charge a premium for highly targeted ad-space. How that could be implemented is another question. I think the most obvious way would be to create an additional discounted service teir that includes advertising, similar to how Hulu operates. Another potential area of growth is live TV. Given Netflix’s popularity with cord cutters, it seems only natural that they take further advantage of that and get into streaming live TV from mainstream networks. This presents not only an added revenue stream from subscription fees, but also the opportunity to sell better and more targeted advertising in a context where consumers already expect to see ads. Further down the road, given entry into live TV, there is also the opportunity for Netflix to partner more closely with the mainstream networks on advertising where they, with all their user data, could act as a sort of broker for live TV ad buys. These closer relationships could also present an avenue for Netflix to better maintain its stock of 3rd party content. \n\nOne glaringly big problem with all of this: Netflix, in its own words, doesn’t want anything to do with it. Going so far as to compare themselves to HBO, they’ve stated clearly that they want content creation to be the driving force behind their business. With HBO being a privately held business, it’s hard to draw comparisons due to a lack of data, but with Netflix having over $25 billion in revenue and HBO having only a fraction of that, it’s a bit unsettling to see Netflix point to them as being an apt comparison for their business model. \n\nLong story short, I think Netflix’s content creation is great, but it can’t be the only thing that sustains them, not with their access to 3rd party content from mainstream networks dwindling. If they try to do that, then they’ll eventually just be another studio pumping out content. That scenario represents a contraction of their business, not growth. There are still plenty of opportunities for Netflix to take advantage of, it’s just a matter of wether or not they do.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I wouldn’t say I’m bearish, they seem fine as a company but personally I just feel their content isn’t what it used to be. \n\nMaybe it’s because it’s new to me but I signed up for Hulu a while back and haven’t hardly touched my Netflix in months.

While other companies have been sleeping and sticking to old models, Netflix steadily grew its own content farm and became a big player in custom content, paying new and buzzing creators big payouts and building a reputation of creative freedom and quality similar to what HBO and AMC networks were able to build. In addition, Netflix has really found out the international game, creating quality custom content for other countries. The custom new content will only grow, with hits such as Stranger Things, Queen's Gambit, Tiger King, and Bridgerton. \n\nNetflix also has superior data tracking, allowing them to find out exactly what you like and gear content creation where the audience is better than any competition other than maybe Disney. Disney is limited by its brand however, and can't stray too far from the Disney principles, similar to how Nintendo can't stray too far from their style of content.   \n\n\nNetflix is still the leader with over 200 million subscribers, Disney with over 100 million and HBO and Huly with only about 40 million. Other services straggle with far less than 40 million subscribers. Killer content like The Office isn't enough to combat this. By being an early player, with superior tech, Netflix is poised to be a market leader for years to come. In addition, other companies will find the costs of getting into the battle too high and they may fold. In order to compete with the established players, they have to offer a competing price point, which means they have a higher price for content per subscriber.   \n\n\nI believe Netflix will continue to be able to produce content that can capture audiences, while the other companies to compete will have deep pockets like Amazon, Disney and Apple, and we may see some companies give up and realize licensing their content is the way to go to be profitable, instead of having to get into the business of technology which is an expensive business to run. Also, it's been shown that users have a higher threshold of acceptance for being subscribed to multiple services. Most people will probably have a combination of Netflix, Hulu, HBO and Disney and find this totally acceptable.

Showroom was fancy and nicely designed in a high end part of town. Looks like they spent a lot of money on the place. \n\nSales team was a little funky they wanted me to pay between $300 and $1000 as a deposit depending on trim level but couldn’t tell me what the full price of the car would be or when delivery would be. I asked if any of them had ridden in it on the road and one guy said he recently got to go for a test ride as a passenger. \n\nBoth sales people kept using the term “luxury” every other word and were asking me about what vehicles I own and if I’m a luxury buyer whatever that means. Seems clear they’re targeting luxury market, guy mentioned they have an SUV in the works once production scales for the sedan whenever that may be. He didn’t have any accurate info on production numbers but the vibe I got is that they’re slowly starting to produce cars and he mentioned some target of 30k vehicles end of year (lol) \n\nI hadn’t started drinking yet so I was polite and didn’t do anything crazy. Keep in mind I’m covered in tattoos and wear crocs everywhere I go. He asked me about work etc and I told him most of my net worth is currently in Tesla LEAPS and he said that sounds risky and that I should consider buying CCIV because they beat Tesla on range.

{"title": "Bezos, Cow Farts, and You: How $AMZN's deal w/ $CLNE is the most confusing in at least 30 seconds; unwinding it so people will stop being so ignorant about it.", "selftext": "Hello, \"Apes\".  it is I...also....ape.  Yes, ape.  Here to bless you with lots of rocket emojis and bananas as I am clearly one of you.  Or something.  We still say on fleek, right? I mean, I totally know, but I'm not sure if you, too, are...you know, fellow ape....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHmm, it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard.  This makes fellow ape very angry, and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this, ape honor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, I've seen an enormous amount of confusion from the, you know, \"non-apes\", about what $CLNE's contract with $AMZN is.  So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don't get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information.  So let's talk about it:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What's the deal:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide.  This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN's warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today's value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don't know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they'll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Now, the part the less intelligent \"non-apes\" don't seem to grasp, but the most important part:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLess discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they've got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it's the part most people don't seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they're paying, which means it's in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as \"gently nudging\" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean \"waterboarding until they comply\".  You're already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why does any of this matter?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, \"fellow ape\", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it's this:  If $AMZN's \"win\" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to \"win\", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE's price should not be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN is paying, that's wrong, and everybody who's been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN's cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn't agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo there the \"non apes\" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn't get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO'd into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn't understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can't.

Battery at 80+% If they get 500 miles per charge they are perfect for companies like Amazon and Walmart who are likely moving the vast number of their loads DC to DC and not cross country.  \n\n\nLoad weight is only an issue if you're carrying heavy items...53\" trailers exist because there are a lot of high cube low weight loads... I'd venture to guess few Amazon trailers are at weight capacity...  Natural gas has been touted for years as an alternative to diesel... T Boon Pickens pushed it  as a means to eliminate oil imports 20 years ago..... It went absolutely nowhere... The only reason this is even in play now is it's an opportunity to impact carbon footprint..  At best it's going to be a bridge....

Comparing the time $CLNE took to the size of the current investment in green hydrogen is even more laughable..

Further, the \"claims\" are irrelevant, because Elon has fallen short on claims on literally every one he's ever made.  Model S range was supposed to be 400 miles.  Mine gets a little over half that - as long as I don't head into the mountains.  Model 3 pricing.  FSD capabiliities.  Municipal battery capacity and rollout.  Roofs.

The guy's entire life has been defined by overpromising and underdelivering.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou talk about load weight only being an issue in some instances, but the fact of the matter is truck purchasers want their trucks to have it and not need it rather than need it and not have it, so they have to be able to pull 80,000 pounds and maintain range.  The truck itself is going to weigh 35,000 in this configuration.  At present technology, the weight of a battery system to get a truck 600 miles would be 36,000 pounds.   Even if they aren't running full, only having 9,000 pounds of weight with an empty truck and trailer isn't going to be enticing to anybody.  To get 300 miles, you're looking at a battery weight of 18,000 pounds.  Add in the 29,000 for the truck itself, and you've only got 33,000 pounds of cargo, which is 14,000 pounds less than an ICE truck.  Maybe the weight there doesn't matter, because you've also only got 29' of trailer space.  Need a reefer configuration?  Hope you like your frozen meats cooked medium well since you've got all your heat created in the trailer itself and limited air control.  Not leaving a lot for carrying, now are you?  Further, you downplay the importance of space, which sh ows you've clearly never done anything with logistics.  It's a game of Tetris, and every inch of that 53' is attempted to be filled.  Every inch taken away is money not earned.  You just gloss over it because it's inconvenient to your argument and you've got this pie in the sky idea of a complete revolution of our entire trnasport sector that will shake the very foundation of our infrastructure to the core taking place in the next 730 days.  Then you go on to talk about nat gas as a push 20 years ago, ignoring that advances in the technology have made up the gap for the fact that the original nat gas rigs didn't have the power necessary to appeal to the industry (you know, while again completely glossing over the weight restrictions placed upon a truck carrying 18 tons of batteries).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen, of course, we go into another pie in the sky argument about setting up water treatment facilities everywhere to create the hydrogen  (not going to happen) and having mechanics on standby to hot swap fuel tanks, which is a workaround solution if I've ever heard one.  Then a completely ludicrous comparison to a mammoth facility being built in Saudi Arabia (which does not have the same infrastructure needs a country the size and scale of the US has) as though it's even salient to this conversation.  And of course, this ignores the biggest problem of all - your claim that these companies are going to pay $300,000 for a truck and another $300,000 for 18 tons of batteries a scant couple of years after paying to either retrofit or acquire new trucks that run on RNG, because these companies always depreciate their assets after a couple of years in your crazy ass scenario.  And of course, all this is ignoring the fact that you're saying these companies will pay a premium for the privilege of less infrastructure and more downtime vs. an equivalent or better solution in terms of functionality that can be refilled and have a driver back on the road in 8 minutes vs. 4 hours.  Again, supposing the giant amp infrastructure to charge batteries that size gets rolled out nationwide, as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour rambling about CLNE's website talking about the ability to turn RNG into hydrogen is just showing the flexibility of the fuel, not trying to make some hedge against future business models, and I think most people understand that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then, of course, you close with a wild supposition and attempt at gaslighting with that whole \"internet\" bit, which is a great Alinsky tactic, but doesn't really work with me.

But sure, we're gonna build all this infrastructure in 2 years, including all the grid hardening that has to take place for a nationwide municipal grid that is well beyond end of life and already stressed.\n\nBut sure, let's go with your argument that, somehow, we're going to completely move away from ICE technology in the next couple of years even though we're 20 some years into the process and haven't even made a dent yet, and most of the technology out there isn't even prototype staging yet.

{"title": "Workhorse [WKHS] Due Diligence", "selftext": "original post removed for a different ticker in the block of text, after about 14 edits I fixed most format issues. sorry for errors.\n\nOriginally posted to my channel --  information should be up to date but may have missed grammatical shorthand errors. All info is post-USPS debacle, and assumes they get ZERO part of the contract in the future.\n\n## Intro\n\nWorkhorse describes itself as a technology company focused on providing sustainable and cost-effective solutions to the commercial transportation sector by creating all-electric delivery trucks and drone systems, including the technology that optimizes the way these mechanisms operate\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Workhorse was founded in 2007 under the name AMP Electric Vehicles\n   * They first experimented with adding battery-electric power to two-seat roadsters\n   * Contracted to complete the 100% electric GM Sky\n   * Additionally, AMP Electric Vehicles were responsible for the creation of electrification packages for the Chevrolet Equinox SUV, the Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Mercedes Benz ML350\n   * Later, AMP Electric Vehicles went public in 2010 trading on the OTC market under the ticker AMPD\n   * Acquired the Workhorse brand and assembly plant in March of 2013\n   * The asset acquisition established them as an Original Equipment manufacturer, or “OEM”\n   * March of 2015 AMP formally changed its name to Workhorse Group Incorporated\n* Workhorse today trades under the ticker WKHS\n   * Market Cap: $1.8 billion (finviz)\n   * Share Price: $15.05\n   * 122.63 million shares outstanding/112.69 million float\n   * Short Interest last reported around 40% for the end of May; Not a chart-boy so no commentary on this.\n\n## Management\n\n* Duane Hughes, CEO\n   * He served as COO for Cumulus Interactive Technologies Group as well Vice President of Sales and Operations for Gannett\n* Robert Willison, COO\n   * Previously held senior management positions at Hughes Aircraft and Texas Instruments as well as being the former Director of Fleet Technology at Sysco\n* Steve Schrader, CFO\n   * Previously worked for a group of utilities that are now part of **Duke Energy** prior to acquisition in 2006\n* Don Wires, Director of R&D\n   * Worked at P&G for 35 years where he was the first Technology Associated Director for Power, Control, & Information Systems\n   * Co-author of several patents on machine automation and safety systems\n* Chris Nordh, VP of Commercial Development\n   * Previously Senior Director of Advanced Vehicle Technology & Energy Products with Ryder System Inc., Nordh joined Workhorse in Feb 2021\n\n## Partnerships\n\n* Duke Energy\n   * Charging Station Infrastructure (Steve Schrader connection)\n* EnerDel\n   * Strategic Supply Agreement (battery)\n* Moog\n   * Horsefly Development & Manufacturing\n* Prefix\n   * C-Series Prototype Partner\n* Ryder\n   * Service & Maintenance Agreement\n* TPI Composites\n   * Strategic Supply Agreement\n* Coulomb Solutions\n   * CATL Battery System (battery)\n* JB Poindexter & Co\n   * Product and offerings\n* UPS\n   * Drone Delivery testing partner\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\n* five pending trademark applications and fourteen issued trademark registration with the intention of seeking more\n* nineteen pending U.S. and foreign patent applications, and eight existing patents, two of which are design patents with the intention of seeking more.\n* Most notably, a patent with 2036 expiration for “Package delivery by means of an automated multicopter UAS/UAV dispatched from a conventional delivery vehicle”\n\n## Delivery Vans\n\n## “BUILT SPECIFICALLY FOR LAST-MILE DELIVERY”\n\n**\"Last mile** is a term used in [supply chain management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_management) and [transportation planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_planning) to describe the last leg of a journey comprising the movement of people and goods from a [transportation hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_hub) to a final destination.\" - Wikipedia, baby.\n\nC-Series Vehicles\n\n* C1000 & C650\n   * 324” vs 247” length\n   * 122” height\n   * 75 mph topspeed\n   * 100-160 mile range\n   * 600 packages vs 450 packages\n   * C-Series Vehicles feature a 100% composite monocoque body eliminating 4,000 lbs. of chassis and body weight compared to a conventional, internal combustion vehicle while carrying the same cargo volume and payload\n   * 40 MPGe fuel efficiency for C-Series vs. 6 MPG for UPS\n   * Reduced operating cost from \\~$1.00/mile to \\~$0.36/mile(1)\n   * Workhorse states based on UPS data, customers would see a positive ROI within just 3 years when factoring in fuel, maintenance, and infrastructure costs.\n\nUPS of course, has been acting as their partner in drone delivery testing for the Horsefly, their custom built, high-efficiency delivery UAV that is fully integrated with their line of electric delivery trucks.\n\n## Horsefly\n\n* Designed with a maximum gross weight of 30 lbs., the Horsefly carries a 10 lb. payload with a maximum air speed of 50 mph, and has the ability to automatically lower packages safely from 50 feet above\n* The HorseFly system is designed to conform to the FAA guidelines for UAV operation in the U.S.\n* The autonomous system is integrated with the C1000 Electric Delivery Vehicles. The truck is the jumping off point for the drone and then the pair will meet after the delivery is complete. The truck features a control center for the driver and auto-landing HorseFly roof with charging capabilities.\n* Recent updates to the drone allow for point-to-point package delivery without the need for a c1000\n* Reduces per package last-mile cost by up to 95% (\\~$0.04 per mile vs. \\~$1.00 for gas vehicle)\n* The recently granted HorseFly™ patent covers any drone utilization integrated with conventional vehicle\n* COVID-19 accelerated e-commerce experimentation and adoption with contactless drone deliveries\n\n## Additional Projects\n\n* Metron:  cloud-based, remote management system to manage and track the performance of all of the vehicle as a real-time solution for fleet managers\n* Aeres Delivery App -  a custom HorseFly user control center. Location, updates, and real-time flight video are just some of the features.\n* W-15, an electric pickup prototype, sold to Lordstown for 10% equity stake\n* Surefly, an electric VTOL, sold to Moog $5million\n* Additionally, they entered a Joint Venture centered around the sharing and advancement of technology and IP related to the development of unmanned aerial systems (UAS).\n\n## Financials\n\nFull Year 2020 (vs 2019)\n\nSales: $1.4m ($377k in 2019)\n\nCost of Goods sold: $13.1m ($5.8m in 2019)\n\nGeneral Expenses: $20.2m ($10.2m in 2019)\n\nR&D Expenses: $9.1m ($8.2m in 2019)\n\nOther Income: $321.1m ($15.8m in 2019) \\*THIS IS DUE TO THEIR EQUITY STAKE IN \\[RIDE\\]\n\nNet Income: $69.8m (-$37.2m in 2019) \\*\\*ONLY POSITIVE DUE TO OTHER INCOME\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditional Info:\n\n* 8,000 vehicle backlog including Pritchard Companies and Pride Group Enterprises. $600m+ in revenue.\n* Cash position of $215 million as of March 1, 2021\n* 10% strategic stake in Lordstown Motor Corp (RIDE) valued at nearly $180 million as of 3/25 that became liquid April 2021. Additionally, Workhorse will receive a royalty fee for each electric pickup truck delivered by Lordstown. (Should they actually make one.)\n* The global Electric Vehicles Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% from 2019 to 2026”.  Per FACTS & FACTORS\n* ARK forecasts that EV sales should increase roughly 20-fold from \\~2.2 million in 2020 to 40 million units in 2025\n* ARK estimates that at some point during the next five years, drones will deliver more than 20% of parcel shipments.\n* ARK believes that drone delivery platforms will generate roughly $275 billion in delivery revenues, $50 billion in hardware sales, and $12 billion in mapping revenue by 2030.\n\n**Who’s In(vested)?**\n\nInstitutional Ownership: 45.81% (Yahoo)\n\n* Blackrock (6.05%)\n* Vanguard (4.29%)\n* Ark Invest (3.24%) \\*\\*\\* Yes Timmy, I know they unloaded their shares.\n* Robeco (3.22%)\n* Invesco (2.38%)\n\n## Comps\n\nIt is Workhorse’s expectation that the non-traditional OEMs will compete head-to-head with the likes of GM, Daimler and Ford in the sub 600 cubic feet class, while the 650 - 1200 cubic feet cargo capacity space is left largely ignored. The main reason being that vehicles over 10000 lbs require a Professional driver and costs associated with increase in skill required.\n\nWorkhorse is focused in BOTH the 650-1200 cubic feet range AND 10000lb+ gvw class.\n\nI found that information **hidden away in a scroll called a \"10-k\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Traditional OEMs\n   * Ford eTransit/GM EV600 both have 600 cubic feet cargo capacity or less. Late 2021 production.\n   * Freightliner has both the ECascadia (class 8) and eM2 (class 6-7)\n   * Mercedez-Benz ESprinter (Only 96 mile charge; Looking for 100+ in North America. Although Mercedez partnered with Matternet for drone optimization, the WKHS’s US patent should impair operations.)\n* Non-Traditional OEMs\n   * Rivian (Amazon contract; 10,000 pounds or less)\n   * Chanje v8100 (650 cubic feet cargo capacity)\n   * Bollinger Deliver-E (Production set to begin 2022; no blue chip names announced)\n\n## SWOT Analysis\n\n* Strengths\n   * Patents/Trademarks\n   * All electric OEM (made in America)\n   * Strong congressional support in OH\n   * Already have actual product\n* Weaknesses\n   * Historically poor production (prior management)\n   * Low staff count (during COVID they didn’t have enough staff to assemble vehicles despite backlog of thousands of vehicles)\n   * Connection to Steve Burns\n* Opportunities\n   * Expected CAGR of both EVs and Drones over the next decade\n   * 10% equity stake in RIDE (+ royalties on any future sales if they occur)\n* Threats\n   * Never mass produced all electric C1000 or C650\n   * EV market does not rapidly expand\n   * Not a cash-positive company from direct operations\n\n## Conclusion + Position\n\n* My Position: 850 shares @ $13.89 average cost per share/$12.30 \"adjusted\" cost basis after selling covered calls Feb-April (message for screenshot if necessary; no problem!)\n* I originally discovered Workhorse digging through daily ARK invest movement emails. I found it interesting to see Cathie grabbing extraordinary amounts of shares in the company so I looked further into them. I was disappointed to see them exit their position but I have added an additional 200 shares to my portfolio since I found out.\n* Workhorse was probably way ahead of itself when it reached $40. That doesn't make it \"Deadhorse\" just because it missed out on one government contract. The government will need electrified fleets; Workhorse might stand a chance, who knows.\n* I miss flying my drone. I crashed it into a darn tree and ever since videos of the Horsefly on youtube have had to fill the void. Not the same, but it's like watching an airplane play Tetris.\n* I did not provide a list of catalysts - use the google machine\n\n## Exit Strategy\n\n* No.\n\nDisclaimer: **I am not a financial advisor**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: format issues\n\nedit2: format issues again\n\nedit3: i think i fixed the format issues", "id": "o027xb", "created_utc": 1623720180.0, "score": 864, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 168, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 118, "replies": []}, {"body": "You forgot the **ORTEX Buy Rating** that was just issued for **WKHS** on the 10th", "score": 99, "replies": [{"body": "I don't have a subscription so I cannot verify.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "https://twitter.com/ortex/status/1403013046335905794?s=21 👍", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "that mean is great time to buy WKHS", "score": 35, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Wkhs to the 🌙 🚀🚀🚀", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "I like drones.

{"title": "Canoo ($GOEV) – The EV Manufacturer that’s ready to take shorts for a ride (healthy balance sheet, 30% short interest, 0.15% float left available to borrow at 24.5% fee, up to 11 days to cover - upcoming investor conference and Russel 3000 inclusion catalysts could send this flying)", "selftext": "Good morning gamblers, \n\n**For a brief overview** - Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 300 employees from leading technology and automotive companies. [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/) Their unique selling point is a modular platform purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. This ‘skateboard’ platform is largely what drew Apple’s interest. The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)\n\nCanoo is bringing its first vehicle to market next year with its electric microbus/van available at a base price of $34,750 before tax incentives or add-ons. It’s now taking preorders in the United States for the “lifestyle” vehicle, as well as for its round-top pickup truck and multi-purpose delivery van. Canoo is taking a different route than many other electric vehicle manufacturers, which played a role in the interest from Apple and Hyundai. Canoo’s trio of vehicles all have the same proprietary “skateboard” platform architecture that houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis that sits under the vehicle’s cabin. This contributes to a similar design language between the vehicles, which all have the same wide front windshield and relatively low profile. [link](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/)\n\nA quick glance at its balance sheet shows that they aren’t at risk of running out of cash anytime soon. Their total assets are $717.8M (of which cash and cash equivalents are $641.9M) and total liabilities are $107.6M (of which long-term debt is $6.9M).[link](https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-21-007431/goev-20210331x10q.htm#CondensedConsolidatedBalanceSheetsinthou)\n\n**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**\n\n1. **High short interest: Yes,** ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV) \n\n2. **Low float: Yes,** total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV).  \n\n3. **Decent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes,** Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest), Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&.tsrc=fin-srch), marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev). \n\n4. **High short ratio: Yes,** based on the volume numbers above – we’re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn’t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks. [shortsqueeze 5.3 link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&submit=Short+Quote) and [Nasdaq 11.3 link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)\n\n**Additional points**\n \n1.**There’s room to run** - a squeeze would not initially be setting an ATH since the stock is currently down 51.5% [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) from its ATH with a market cap of $2.3 Billion. This is primarily due to an overhaul in management as well as a change in the business model which favored protecting Canoo’s IP instead of providing it to other OEMs, still ended up bring the SP down short-term since it was radically different from when they went public. \n\n2.**Shorts running into a wall** - 150,000 shares are left available to borrow at a rate of 24.5%, which is 0.15% of the entire float so shorts are about to hit a wall in terms of how easy it is to manipulate the share price. [link](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/goev)\n\n3.**Possible PT** – unlike all the other information which is part data part speculation, this is **pure speculation** since we're talking about pre-revenue but I really think you could easily 10x the current share price if it’s a momentum based squeeze since it's a short-term event that isn't based on technicals. Valuations based on fundamentals aren’t really the same as they were a couple of years ago, and given the low interest rate / easy access to cash the question really is how high can it go? Since institutions don't hold the majority of the float (they currently only hold ~24% of the float but have increased their position by ~120% in the last month) and there should therefore theoretically be a smaller likelihood of shenanigans with lower price manipulation, this could easily 10x the current share price to $100 if more retail become aware of the company's potential and buy-in to their long-term vision, and additional institutions start buying in. Personally speaking, I like to look at market caps to see how high things can go – with GME and AMC both were hovering under a $20 Billion market cap before AMC blew open the gates a couple of weeks back. Other tickers that went up in the last week like WISH and CLOV however hit around a $10 Billion market cap before coming back down. If we use that $10B market cap to be conservative, that still gets us to almost $50, which is 5x the current share price – and since you can make a case for Canoo’s short interest being higher than the previous two cases, I don’t see why it couldn’t reach that by the end of the month, or even within a week if shorts start to cover and bring the house down.\n\n**Upcoming catalysts**\n\n1. **Upcoming investor day this Thursday (June 17th)**, which will be a ‘hybrid in-person and virtual journey into Canoo’s product portfolio and business strategy.’ [link](https://canooirday.com/)\n \n2. **Canoo is being added to the Russel 3000 index,** [link](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf) meaning that the stock along with other additions could be expected to ‘trade more than their average daily volume in the Nasdaq Closing Cross on June 25, and some will trade an entire week’s volume on “Russell Friday”.’ [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-small-caps-should-know-about-the-russell-rebalance-2020-06-22).\n\nOn a final note, this is not financial advice so please don’t treat it as such – do your own due diligence, read your own news, study their financials and evaluate multiple perspectives (bullish and bearish) to see what others are saying. Don’t invest money you’re not willing to lose, and do so at your own risk.\n\n**TLDR**:  Canoo is among the healthiest EV startups out there, $641.9 million in cash, only $6.9 million in long-term debt and a market cap of just $2.3 billion with a <$10 share price. This is the company that Apple wanted to buy and Hyundai wanted to partner with. Other EVs have the same market cap and may not even have the cash to make it through the next 3 months so Canoo really should be trading at multiples of where it is atm. Price is trending upwards – 11.8% in last week, 32.9% in last month – someone’s been loading up while it’s cheap (institutional ownership is up 119.2% over the last 3 months).

{"title": "$TTCF DD: Gordon Ramsay Cooking Up The Tendies", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldqey3ny6g571.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=feff8346992b1f20012cd8a888375bc200e29b5d\n\n“Why did the chicken cross the road? Because you didn’t f—ing cook it!\" I felt it would be best to start off this DD with this quote from Gordon because this is something he would never say to Tattooed Chef because they are one of the fastest growing plant-based food brands with vertically integrated manufacturing.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* Rock solid fundamentals if any of you smooth brains care\n* One of the few profitable food brands in this space due to low manufacturing costs\n* Passes[ the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with flying colors. Over 30% Short Interest very high\n* Super low IV, IV in the 50%'s unheard of in meme stocks\n* They have an absolute Chad of a CEO who has worked in food business for over 35 years and his daughter is creative designer of the food products\n* I'm no Gordon Ramsay but this has all the ingredients of a perfect ground floor meme stock with disgustingly low IV\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Brand](https://preview.redd.it/fiqro35ecg571.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=58ebb1a2c6a7a11301f573f3bf669971b0be3b83)\n\nTattooed Chef is a plant-based food brand. They are available in stores like Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam's Club. The company is entirely vertically integrated which gives them a massive edge of the competition. They have been building manufacturing infrastructure since 2010. This company has great growth potential and is rapidly expanding. You might be thinking to yourself right now I'm tired of this plant based shit I don't even care if the burger is still Moo'ing on the plate, but hang with me this industry is experiencing huge growth as the younger generations eat this stuff up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Finances](https://preview.redd.it/yw8qcay9cg571.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8b6aef8c9c960027351e210c9298296e9764bad)\n\nFor full year 2021, Tattooed Chef updated its guidance and expects:\n\n* Revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58 to 63% compared to 2020. This guidance excludes any revenue contribution from the Karsten facility which is currently not in operation. The Company expects to update guidance when production begins at that facility in the coming months.\n* Gross margin in the range of 20% to 25%\n* Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2 million to $4 million\n* TTCF has a current market cap of 1.89B\n* Insiders own 38% of the company\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Advertising and Social Media Presence](https://preview.redd.it/3n21s0n1cg571.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f17957894ac096f09ca6c303beb1a72ac08d7ed)\n\nThey've spent like 0 dollars on advertising. They developed a plan to hit 2 billion impressions in the form of 6 and 16 second videos in the first 8 months of 2021. This is the first time they're spending advertising dollars and they have already built up a loyal following. You can see on Twitter posts of pictures of local Target frozen shelves being out of TTCF stock. Search Twitter for $TTCF and you'll see them. Also the comments on TTCF's official twitter account have stuff like \"yo get the product in my target please, it's always out of stock\" and \"when you gonna be in Europe please\". They have a very popular product that is flying off the shelves. Before 2021, their only sales team was the CEO and his daughter. Now, they've hired marketing teams to get them into more retail stores, like an ex-Coca Cola national sales manager to boost marketing.\n\n[Expansion into Overseas Markets](https://preview.redd.it/vmchh45w8g571.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3bb207edfabd7b103a338dd4a257d7051df5c1b)\n\nEurope has a strong demand for their products, as plant-based proteins are growing in popularity. TTCF has 2 manufacturing plants, one in California and one in Italy. It's cheaper for them to ship ingredients from Italy to the US for their US operations. So they're looking to hire sales in Europe to get TTCF in stores there. They have already entered into Costco UK and are expanding over the continent\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short Interest and Low IV](https://preview.redd.it/7xgcp2z39g571.jpg?width=958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b92c4e7683fc76b00dbcb08a87b3145f433362ff)\n\nTTCF has very low IV and SI of over 30%. It is currently one of the most shorted stocks on the market. This is a stock with solid fundamentals and rapid growth. In my opinion calls are not priced accordingly and you seeing this early could get in on the ground floor while IV is still laughably low. Volume on it is low as well and the float is on the smaller side. If you are able to get in while IV is low this thing could take off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rdxj9ib9g571.jpg?width=280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4063e88ca39efc1dee506f1de0d0afa040fa6818\n\nPositions: 25x 7/16 $25c\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\n* I'm not a financial advisor.

This is a food company trading at a tech multiple, in a very - \\*\\*\\*very -\\*\\*\\*competitive space. Space on food shelves, let alone freezers, is very limited.\n2. With that being said, there is nothing extremely unique around their product. Sure, they are ahead in product development, but I wouldn't be surprised if a big competitor comes in with 5x their market cap in R&D and blows these guys up\n3. Their DTC is lacking, why are they're stores always out of stock? If demand for their product is really that high, why are they not producing more or increasing their capacity? They have a lot of cash on hand and virtually no debt, yet they aren't making any big moves. Sure the acquisition of the Mexico-based producer will help, but they seem to be focused on increasing their product line more than meeting demand.\n4. This leads me to the next, is that what is required of this industry? yes, it is. You have to constantly be developing new products which can be a big cost in the future. They haven't even begun marketing campaigns and are reporting a negative cashflow. They're gross margin isn't bad, but BYNDs is 10-15% higher with far more brand recognition.\n5. Lastly, they're DTC is always going to be tough. They are shipping mostly frozen products. This requires extra packaging etc. that bigger brands will be able to absorb better. The more facilities you have to ship from, the cheaper the cost.\n\nOverall, I can see this company going somewhere in the future. But right now its pretty over valued for some of the (I think pretty notable) headwinds they face.", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "Being downvoted but it’s completely true go to Walmart or any store and you’ll see there are the exact same products that TTCF sell but a different brand.

And they have actual IP to back them up. Beyond Meat and Impossible are vastly superior.\n\nHere is a telling quote from TTCF's S-1:\n\n\"As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have any issued patents and have forgone pursuing any patent applications. As a result, we cannot rely on any protection provided under applicable patent laws\"\n\nThat is a huge problem. The reason that Beyond Meat and Impossible are valuable is because they can create products that no one else is allowed to create. For Impossible, their compound that uses iron ions and heme to create a bloody/meaty taste blows the competition out of the water. For Beyond, they have patents focused more on replicating a more satisfying texture. These cannot be replicated without either R&D on alternatives, or by infringing a patent.\n\nBut TTCF has no degree of protection. Cauliflower Pizza is not new. It is very gay, but not very new. The same can be said of the entirety of their portfolio of products. It's all commodity food-stuffs that any competitor can do better.\n\nThe demand for Cauliflower Wings is not that fucking high. However, the demand for something that tastes like an actual burger, without the use of beef, is extraordinarily high.\n\nThat is the difference. I do not recommend shorting it. But it seems like it is not worthwhile to allocate funds on this.", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "Target can't keep their SKUs in stock!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not being able to keep an SKU in stock is not a sign of high demand, it is a sign that, whatever the demand is, over a certain time period, it exceeded what was ordered by that store.\n\nOften, when a product is a slow seller, you place one order of the SKU, but not another because it is not selling quickly enough. Then, when volume declines, you do not order it again because it sold so slowly. Eventually it sells out. Then you use a different product to take its place. There are many SKUs that are not kept in stock. It is not always for great reasons. Given that all of TTCF's products are frozen and can be kept for a very long time, they are all bound to sell out *eventually.*\n\nThe biggest issue with this is that it does not expand the market. I am a devout carnivore and have a very negative view of vegans. I still tried Beyond Beef and the Impossible Burger out of curiosity. I ended up getting both again when I got bored of a standard chicken, pork, beef, lamb rotation.\n\nI would not consider any of this company's products because they are: 1) Not novel 2) have terrible vegan flavor profiles 3) overpriced. Vegan food is super cheap and requires little prep. \n\nAll of TTCF's products already have rivals in the market:\n\nCauliflower Mac & Cheese - Amy's, Lavo, Trader Joes\n\nCauliflower Crust Pizza - Newman's Own, Nature's Promise, Caulipower\n\nAcai Bowl - Like, millions of competitors.\n\nThere is simply no moat. So, they need to win on scale. Against people who already have that in spades.\n\nOut of all the things in the market right now, betting on yet another vegan food company with cheesy hipster branding is not what I would be doing.

{"title": "11 reasons to invest in $WISH", "selftext": "If you agree with any one of the points below this is an excellent entry point.\n\n1. Worldwide demographic change to value conscience shopping via widening of wealth gap. (Sad but true)\n2. Wish local provides access to areas that have never before been able to online shop. Its also given a large competitive advantage to other areas in terms of shipping rates and product availability.\n3. Wish de-emphasizing cheap products and adding new lines including furniture to bring revenue per consumer up.\n4. Bringing in J.Reses as executive who’s experience in this industry is invaluable.\n5. Anniversary out all the lost customers who had a bad experience in Q1-2 of last year due to bad shipping times and limited product availability. This was mainly due to the early lockdown in China and banned Chinese commercial flights internationally. \n6. Wish logistics revenue rising steady. This might actually be the largest revenue stream in the future as other companies hire wish for 3rd party logistics and take advantage of wish local centers.\n7. The world is shifting to online shopping. Online stores will always win in regards to price and convenience as they have such a low CAPEX costs. The overhead on running a brick and mortar store is reflected in their prices. Everything is changing to online, from groceries to furniture.\n8. Quality and delivery times are improving. Last quarter WISH had an all time low refund rate. They’re actively delisting low quality items and misleading products. They’re also on a hiring spree to further improve this segment.\n9. Partnership announced yesterday with PrestaShop will get wish products listed on 300,000 new internet stores. This should add billions in revenue to $Wish’s bottom line.\n10. If the stock market has a correction and/or potential inflation hikes eroded consumer purchasing power we’ll see a large swing into budget buying. Many people will adjust spending habits from higher priced platforms like Amazon and focus solely on price point. This will make $WISH a great company to hold during recessive times. \n11.

{"title": "Car Wars Episode EV - A CANOO Hope - Why $GOEV can be a tremendous play for both long and short term gains.", "selftext": "**TL;DR** -  HEAVY SHORT INTEREST, MULTIPLE UPCOMING CATALYSTS, LOW FLOAT, HEALTHY COMPANY WITH NO DEBT AND EXCESS OPERATIONAL CASH, BEAT DOWN BY SHORTS AND PRIMED FOR A COME BACK, RUMORS OF HIGHLY PROFITABLE PARTNERSHIPS\n\nHello degenerates, \n\nI like you have been watching the roller coasters and rocket ships that is this market and think I've found something very early with great upside. \n\n**LET'S START WITH THE BASICS** \n\nCanoo is an EV startup that will be selling commercial and passenger vehicles that are in production and are slated to be released next year. They have had a lot of unfounded trepidation surrounding their SPAC debut which has lead to shorts bombarding this stock to well below it's fair cost. As far as EVs go it is one of the healthiest EV's on the market currently with $641.9 million in cash and ONLY $6.9 million in long-term debt with a market cap of just $2.3 billion. This is huge in terms of long term potential when $GOEV can easily be a 10 bn mkt cap stock. \n\n**Let's talk shorts**\n\nThe current float available to short is **0.15%**, you apes know what this means, borrow fee is 24.5% meaning the demand is HUGE. A buy and hold can cause a monumental squeeze here and there's only 11 days to cover. I'm going to refer you guys to /u/ny92 post here because he did a great write up:\n\n**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**\n\nHigh short interest: Yes, ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV)\n\nLow float: Yes, total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV)\n\nDecent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes, Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link,](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest) Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link,](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&.tsrc=fin-srch) marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev)\n\nHigh short ratio: Yes, based on the volume numbers above – we’re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn’t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&submit=Short+Quote) Nasdaq 11.3 [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)\n\n**Other points of interest**\n\n6/17 will be Investor Relation's day, a potential catalyst as the company is urged to share some good news because of short attacks.\n\n6/25 GOEV/Canoo will be added to the Russell 3000 index along with our other favorite meme stocks like GME. This is a tremendous catalyst for volume. \n\n\n**Keep in mind that half of the short interest here is ALREADY under water. They've been short since April and at $9 or under they have been paying a 25% rate. There will be MASSIVE covering.**\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk so, what about the long-term? \n\nBesides their very healthy balance sheet and being vastly oversold they seem to be getting a lot institutional attention and insider ownership, in my experience this is a **VERY** bullish sign. The top institutional investors in Canoo are Vanguard, Invesco and Blackrock. Institutional holdings are at about 22,661,541 shares but more importantly $GOEV stock had 55 **NEW** institutional investments in for a total of 18,683,793 shares. This is a sign of bullish optimism in the long term. \n\n**The Covid Killer Car** [Canoo is starting to release positive news and this is the first of many](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-debuts-air-purifying-climate-control-with-uv-technology), their new interior enhances interior air quality, attacks odors and kills viruses instantly, including Covid-19, and will be pre-loaded in the Premium and Adventure packages of its Lifestyle Vehicle. Their vehicles will have both luxury and more affordable models along with a commercial line. Coupled with **INNOVATIVE TECH** the designs are so good that Apple wanted the designer which leads me to my next point.. \n\nThe juicy **speculative rumors**  - **Apple Partnership** - The co-founder and CEO of Canoo Ulrich Kranz has stepped down and been hired to help with the development of the Apple Car. A lot of people initially thought this was bad for Canoo but I see it as a bullish sign. He is still a major shareholder and his design's have been implemented into the vehicles that will be released next year and they were good enough that Apple hired him to design theirs. More importantly there have been rumors of Apple teaming with Canoo to use their self-driving software or parts of their already developed hardware since it's trademarked by Canoo. Limited Apple partnership could be imminent. This can be a HUGE partnership for Canoo and can easily 10x their stock. \n\n\n**SEC investigation** - I think I should cover this even though it's entirely baseless. This initially made the stock take a huge hit and has more or less been deemed to be nothing. There is so much positive news boiling up that once people reinvest and realize nothing will come of this I can see a lot of FOMO from previous sellers. \n\nThe Long and short of this stock is bullish, if you were just to buy it and forget about it you would do well, if you were to play an upcoming squeeze you would do well, this is a healthy and innovative company that has been unfairly shorted way below it's fair market value. I will be updating this post with more information but I want to post this on a dip, my position is shares and calls bought @~9.60.  \n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nedit: WE HAVE TAKEOFF GENTLEMEN\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**edit 2: I may make a new thread later but I'll keep some news added here as well**\n\nI am still in and like how the stock is moving, [this article here shuts down some of these apple purchase rumors, albeit not the purchasing of certain IPs and product designs, but is extremely bullish on the stock as a growth stock.](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/06/apple-wont-buy-canoo-but-you-should-still-buy-goev-stock/)\n\nTheir twitter is very active, something exciting coming tomorrow? \n\n**This is not financial advice, please do your own research**", "id": "o0k89j", "created_utc": 1623779383.0, "score": 642, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "Calls are dirty cheap, I’m in on this, seems like a low risk high reward play.\n\nPosition: 25 x 16July$17.50c", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "Is you JTTT now or what.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "dang 17.50 at 50 cents, thats 18 breakeven on a stock whose best day is 20.  \n\n\nThem's is stretch odds  \n\n\nyou can get the 10's for 1.90 that give you better odds on printing.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I got my 10s 7/16 for .65 this afternoon.

Also they are much more sensitive to materials prices in particular because of the metals and rare earths used to produce the batteries. TSLA is successful because they market to rich people, but not every consumer is going to pay for the novelty of having an EV if the premium is too big over conventional, which it will be as fake demand is propped up by propaganda and government intervention.

The improved reliability and lower operation cost (aside from the source of the power, electricity is just cheaper than fuels) is a direct benefit to full cycle cost of ownership to the point that the purchase price doesn't really need to come down to be the same price. Dealerships make a lot less sense for vehicles with improved reliability so startups are going to have an edge over industry players. \n\nAnd now for the thing your actually just wrong about - it really doesn't matter if today they grid isn't entirely renewable energy.

If electricity is cheaper than gas, it will be only because electricity comes from fossil fuels. The reason for this is due to physics.  Look at the CA and TX blackouts this past year.

And if transport is EV based, renewables are going to come up short.\n\n\nIf the grid starts to depend primarily on nuclear and natural gas maybe that will change. But thats a long way off.

{"title": "This is [not] investment advise: Listen to your kids.", "selftext": "I’m 30 and I was 8 when the internet started being a common household addition. Amazon launched and was only selling books. \n\nMy dad had recently inherited a small amount of money ($4000) and decided he was going to invest it, but wasn’t sure where. I was busy looking at books I wanted on Amazon when he kicked me off the computer to do research on where to put it. \n\nI wouldn’t leave him alone and kept asking questions about what he was doing. He explained he wanted to buy shares of a company so that over time as more people bought shares and each share was worth more he’d have more money than he started with. I understood the concept and told him to use it on Amazon. \n\nHe laughed and said, “I’m not going to buy 4000 dollars worth of books!”\n\nI explained I meant to buy the shares. But he scoffed at that. “No one is ever going to buy books off the internet—or anything else. No way to guarantee you get what you pay for, or anything at all. Someone could send you an empty box and there’s nothing you can do about it! And if you put your credit card information on there then the company has it and they can drain your bank account. No one will be stupid enough to do that.” I remember other adults having similar fears. \n\nMy age mates thought everything computer related was super cool, and, like me, were already addicted to figuring out how to do basically anything the internet was offering (like make email addresses and explore search engines). They too would have been thrilled to have the internet deliver them things they’d never find locally (like seasons of Dragonball Z and Pokémon that had only been released in Japan) if only their parents could see the light.\n\nI told my dad that when I grew up everyone would buy things off the computer because it would be fun and easy and no one would have to drive. He scoffed and said “People love driving, and looking at what they’re about to buy. It’s never going to take off. That company will be gone in a year.” \n\nHe put the money into Kodak instead at $60ish a share—he sold in 2003 for around $6 a share. In 1998 Amazon was trading at $5/share. If he’d put it all in and held to today, that $4000 would have grown to $2.6 million. \n\nHe recently confessed to me that he remembered that conversation and that thinking I didn’t know what I was talking about just because I was a kid, is one of his great regrets. \n\nTL;DR:\n\nTrust the things that your kids, nieces, nephews, grandkids, etc., understand and take for granted as part of the future, even if you don’t understand it. Do some research to find out which companies are actually producing. Then prepare to hold.\n\nEDIT: \n\nApparently it’s too hard to believe other adults in 1997/98 were also paranoid about computers, so to get specific: My second grade teacher was like 60 and was full on conspiracy theory level paranoid about them.
