{"title": "Time to bet against Facebook?", "selftext": "First let me point out that I don't have any positions in Facebook.  I did however apply for options trading on Fidelity today for just this reason.  Btw, is it just me or do those option prices look steep?\n\nTL-DR: I think Facebook is dropping hard in the next 4-6 month.  YouTube is screwed as well, but I won't bet against Google.  I know FB has a ton of bright people working for them, but Apple is attacking their business model and it seems to be working.\n\nLittle background here.  I work for a D2C (direct to consumer) company and am very involved with marketing spend allocaction, analysis etc.  Basically Facebook has been a boon to these types of marketers for the past couple of years.  We spend on avg 400k-600k per month in Facebook advertising.  It's very profitable until late May when Apple fully rolled out iOS 14.1.\n\niOS 14.1 is essentially a first strike attach against FB & YT.\n\nPerhaps you've seen the latest Apple ads toting how great they are for privacy.  Here's what's really going on.  Advertisers like FB & YT are able to make money by tracking user behavour to deliver ads that will convert.  Apple decided to throw a huge wrench in their business model....and look like they are the champion of privacy at the same time - genius.  Seriously, this was a master stroke move.\n\nHere's the reality of what I'm seeing and have heard the same from other marketers.\n\nFacebook & YouTubes advertising platforms are basically broken.  I mean campaigns that we have run for 6mo's just stopped working.  We are cutting spend by 50%.  We want to spend more, but we can't justify it.  Not only that, but it's getting more expensive.  I'm not sure if this is due to other parties trying to spend their way out of the poor performance or FB increasing rates to make up for advertiser drop off.\n\nNot every company has in depth analytics like we do.  Some can go months before they realize that they just burned a pile of money.  Side note - this is great for companies like Pinterest that are intent based.  Similar to how search works...they know you are interested in certain subject so they send you relevant ads.  Also, Google search campaigns are still performing well.\n\nHere's my view on what's happening w/FB & YT.  If an iOS user upgrades to iOS 14+ they are automatically oped out from being tracked on the apps they use.  I don't know about Safari, but f you launch FB or YT on your iPhone then you look like a brand new user from an advertisers point of view.\n\nSerious advertisers use a funnel approach to FB advertising.  Top of funnel (TOF) is used for brand awareness.  Bottom of funnel (BOF) is used to target people who interacted with your ad.  BTW, an interaction could mean you hoverered over the ad, not just clicks.  With this new reality, advertisers cannot re-target iOS users on FB and YT effectively for BOF ads.  This is huge.  Now we're stuck with some basic demographic targeting for ads with no intent data points.  It's like every FB user who has opted out of tracking looks like a brand new user with not history.\n\nFrom FB & YT's point of view - every iOS user has no historical data to use in targeting.  You still have your friend list and YT subscriptions, but they can't use that data to target ads.  This might be fine for brand marketing but it doesn't work for performance marketing.  Performance marketing means we want you to interact with the ad and buy something.\n\nNow let's talk about attribution.  When FB/YT delivers you an ad, they will track whether you eventually bought the product - think the normal window is 28 days.  This means if you see an ad for a t-shirt, then go to the t-shirt company's website a week later and buy it...FB/YT take credit for the sale.  Now a good marketr knows that FB/YT doesn't deserve all the credit.  You may have advertised to them on some other medium...but FB/YT does deserve some credit.  If they hadn't seen the ad on FB/YT first they would never have eventually bought the shirt.\n\niOS 14 iis changing this as well.  I think the window is 7 days now...but might be less.\n\nMy ompany's sales are down 35% since iOS 14 rolled out.  Not only that but our FB/YT spend is down approx 40%.  In fact, I remember before the rollout happened our FB rep reached out to inquire what our spend budget was going to be for the year.  This is not normal.  Usually these platforms make you come to them and beg...they never reach out...and never ever for a budget plan.  We told them we planned on spending the same unless performanc changed..  Well, we're cutting spend by 50% and I have to imagin we're not the only ones.  Don't get me wrong - we want to spend more.  It's just not working out.\n\nAlso, has anyone noticed how much stock Zuck has been selling lately?  I think he's already doubled last year's number.\n\nOh, and FB nearly hit their all time high today.  Really, how is this possible.\n\nBTW - I have not interest in placing bets against Google.   Who in their right mind would place bets agains both of those giants.\n\nHere's my guess w/FB. I think they will come in a little low on earning on 7/19.  They have been increasing rates and traditionally they are the best place to advertise.  Howver, I think the cracks will really show on Q3 earning and continue to deteriorate in Q4.\n\nMy question is - if you had 20K-40K to invest in this scenario what would you do?  I'm thinking put options winter 2021 or Jan 2022.  Im assuming the stock is going to drop a \\~\\~hundred\\~\\~ $30 bucks between now and then.   How can I maximize my play with this set of assumptions?\n\nedit - Thanks for all the responses.  I've decided to wait to buy put options a week or two before earnings if the FB performance issues aren't resolved by then.   I would not be surprised if they took a 5% hit on earnings in Q2 and provide guidance for 10% reduced earnings in Q3.   \n\n&#x200B;", "id": "o2gwqe", "created_utc": 1623991686.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "I can see not investing in Facebook, but shorting it is just stupid.", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "A few months back some guy made a similar post about shorting Facebook while it was at 250.

This includes, but is not limited to, the device’s advertising identifier, session ID, fingerprint IDs, and device graph identifiers. If your app receives or shares any of these identifiers for the above listed purposes, you must use the AppTrackingTransparency framework to obtain user consent.\n\nThink about it.

Are sales down, or sales are the same but ad engagement numbers on Facebook iOS platform specifically are down? And if they are down, is it guaranteed that this per se will impact sales? I buy a lot of stuff based on Facebook ads but I usually browse Facebook on my phone and make purchases on my laptop. Also, I've read about users now saying they plan to reactivate IDFA on iOS14 because they prefer targeted ads.\n\nMy 2 cents is that you have to forget about Apple and their strategy. Since you are thinking of shorting the stock based on a bet that iOS14 will have a larger than anticipated impact on quarterly earnings, whatever Apple do (or how smart their strategy is) is not relevant enough (it would ultimately factor into a negative sentiment if earnings were surprisingly bad, but only the iOS14 changes themselves can impact Facebook's earnings).\n\nAlso bear in mind that Apple is not going to be able to compete with Facebook in social media platforms. I use iMessage and iCloud for communicating with my immediate family in the US whose device choices I control. But to communicate and share with my friends and extended family overseas, it's WhatsApp and Facebook. To communicate with the public, it's Reddit and Twitter etc. Same goes for Google and YouTube, Apple don't have the infrastructure to deal with 500 hours of video uploaded every minute etc. They could build all that, but it would not be a smart strategy. So whatever Apple do with ads, will be restricted to the Apple ecosystem and Apple users - which admittedly is a very large user base (I think iCloud has almost a billion users now).\n\nSo anyway, the crucial piece of information for this bet is how much Facebook's near term (next quarter) numbers will be impacted by iOS 14 (and also bear in mind, companies have the ability to fix and manipulate their numbers to an extent).\n\nLastly, from a valuation POV, Facebook is inexpensive. It's a 20% grower with 45% EBIT margins trading at a market multiple (or below market ex-cash).

Of course your sales dropped because the budget isn’t being deployed efficiently. Negative sales and shrink in ad budget, well, sounds like companies will stop spending cash to advertise then?

I’ll try to explain since I work as a social advertisement marketing manager haha. The privacy move from Apple has impact on the effect of remarketing ads. So for reference: our clients now need to spend more money to realize the same profits as before since targeting just got a little less efficient. So we are actually spending more ad money, not less. Also: the impact is only on a small part of the total campaign portfolio (depending on the client, but for us it is often like 20% of the budget is remarketing and 80% proactive campaigns). Besides that: large companies with a big ad budget will have advertisement bureaus like ours for example, who will know ways to still optimize returns (for example we can still remarket to people who we know are deeper in the salesfunnel because for example they’ve watched a video of ours on Facebook / Instagram for over 30 seconds)”\n\n“You need to spend more money to get the same clicks for SOME ads, not all, yes. That is my point with the retargeting (often 20% of total budget or less) vs normal ads. But more ad spend means more revenue for Facebook. Most companies use Google as well as Facebook. Facebook’s MOAT at this point is that they are the cheapest for small companies for advertisement ánd they have a very well developed ad system. So yes, worst case scenario: If it becomes more expensive, these smaller companies will also be looking at Twitter ads or Pinterest ads for example. But I can pretty much guarantee that at this point in time, they won’t skip Facebook Ads, since Instagram and Facebook have so many users - they would be missing out on sales.\n\nAs for the sales funnel: You can actually eleminate people who have already made a purchase, but for that you do need the off-platform tracking. \nHowever: Facebook and Instagram are growing more towards ‘in-app’ / one-click shopping and try to do this on their own platform. On their own platform this will be possible once again.\n\nBut to dive into this even further: I can for example target a broad group of people with a certain ad setting and a brand video campaign (brand recognition) with a low cost to reach as much people as possible. After that I can target the group that has watched more than 30 seconds of the video (which is an indicator that they might be interested in the product, since they didn’t click away right away) in the past 5 days again with a conversion ad (for example a picture of the product). So the people I show this to, are more likely to click and buy than If we would have just started with only the conversion ad. Yes: If they have already bought, It won’t have any effect in terms of people buying, but as a good advertiser you’ll have to play with the settings to find out which works best for the target group. \nTrust me: Facebook Ads has one of the most developed advertisement settings out there (alongside with Google).”", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You realize that TOF & BOF campaigns have different conversion metrics and that maintaining a ratio is key to keeping cost per acquisition in line.  \n\nIf the 20% of ads that have the lowest cpa stop performing and you are forced to spend more on the top 80%…your going to change that ratio.  \n\nIf the 20% ads can’t re-market to IOS devices based on >1 day FB history…and iOS is 60% of US FB…and let’s assume mobile is 75%…we’ll that’s 45% of user that are affected.  Actually let’s assume that 20% opt in - so that’s 36% of users affected.  Let’s use my company’s data that says Android users are 35% less valuable…well I think your going to see some cracks.\n\nFacebook is a walled garden - so they have always kept the view thru and scroll thru (who say the ad or paused on it) a secret.  I believe that now they are being fed their own medicine by Apple.  However, I do believe they have more leniency on view thru conversions.\n\nBtw, not trying to be a jerk.  I would love for someone who has your experience to poke holes in this.  Maybe my company is dealing with seasonal decline as well of impact of opening the economy from COVID.  \n\nI also believe that companies that GET Facebook utilize the impressions more than just measuring last click.

Great company and I figured if all those senators are holding it and Buffet loves it… what do I know that they don’t. And their dividend is great.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Been considering buying KO myself. Obviously a solid company with popular products that not only isn't gonna go under, but is in fact one of the most dominant beverage companies out there. And of course they own many other beverage companies that manufacture just about every type of beverage out there. Great dividend stock too as you pointed out.\n\nIn the fairly limited DD I've done on it, the main bearish thesis for it is that this is a company that has been around for a long time and already experienced the majority of its growth, and will therefore see more diminishing returns in the future. Also, Buffett loves it because he invested $1 billion in the '80s, not yesterday.\n\nI would counter the bears here though by saying there are numerous successful companies that have been successful for decades upon decades, aren't doing much more than continuing to be successful, and their stocks are still good investments. Plus, KO isn't just resting on its laurels. They are constantly acquiring new companies and expanding their dominance in their market and sector. And as you mentioned, their dividend is solid.\n\nBottom line: sure, buying KO in 2021 probably won't pay off like buying it in the '80s anymore than buying Amazon today won't see the crazy gains that investors who bought into it in the late '90s saw, but that doesn't mean that either is a bad investment that won't make you gains. It's the whole risk vs reward equation. At this point, both KO and AMZN are rock solid companies that continue to dominate. This makes them pretty safe bets, rather than speculative plays that might pay off handsomely if successful, but might also go under.\n\nMaking KO 80% of your portfolio probably isn't the best idea, but adding some to your portfolio probably won't end up being the worst investment ever.\n\nDisclaimer here: I only just started investing last February, and am hardly an expert or a seasoned vet at playing the market, although I have become pretty obsessed and have spent a lot of time researching, studying, and learning. I'm sure many, many others here are more experienced and knowledgeable than me.\n\nPersonally, with the market currently seeming to be manic in trying to make up it's mind with where it's going to go and with so much uncertainty (are we reopening or will covid come back hard in the fall/winter, what impact will rising inflation have and when will it impact the stock market, can the market continue to go on a bull run after the incredible growth it saw last year despite the pandemic and the economic devastation that it caused, etc.), I'm hesitant to take many new holdings right now. I'm only investing as a hobby though, and don't have serious amounts of my money in the market and am therefore mostly thinking fairly short term with my investments. If the market tanks, for example, I'm selling all my holdings and will reinvest when the market starts to recover. Thinking longer term though and if I were more of your classic long term investor (like Buffett), I just fail to see much of a way that KO will be worth less five years from now than it is today, and again, it's a great dividend stock, which is also a major bonus for a long term investor.\n\nTL;DR: There are much worse investment decisions than adding some KO to your portfolio in my humble opinion. I may well buy some shares myself.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Agree with much of what you said. I also hold KO more as a stable, safe-ish stock that gives 3% dividend.

{"title": "CLNE CEO Speaks and Tweets: CLNE Ready for Launch", "selftext": "I'll start off with the important bits:\n\n🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚\n\nAndrew Littlefair, CLNE CEO was just on Mad Money with everyones favorite person to hate Jim \"We Like The Stock\" Cramer. During the interview Mr. Littlefair knocked it out of the park but also alluded to something Amazon wants to say about their deal.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htY1t6F5QVU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htY1t6F5QVU)\n\nAs of right know we all know that Amazon is buying in big time with 20% stake in CLNE (🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀) at 13.4X/share, but what's left unsaid is from the horses mouth at Amazon. Mr. Littlefair mentioned that Amazon is going to have something to say which is fair to assume is rather positive news.\n\nAdditionally Mr. Littlefair is active on Twitter and just dropped this bombshell (positive)\n\n>Heard from  \n>  \n>[@TotalEnergies](https://twitter.com/TotalEnergies)  \n>  \n>CEO today that they have sold all they're going to sell. They wanted to re-coup their original investment and they have. Still own a little over 20% of our outstanding shares. Our partnership with them remains **firm and deep**.\n\n[https://twitter.com/A\\_Littlefair/status/1405672450902269955?s=20](https://twitter.com/A_Littlefair/status/1405672450902269955?s=20)\n\nSo what does this mean? Well, it appears Total Energies won't be dragging the fucking price down and now the $13 price point that was important for gamma considerations (🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀) has a higher probability for tomorrow.\n\n(ETA: I'm aware of NrdRage's DD and his suggestions on other considerations, feel free to peruse his big dick energy DD [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00qva/bezos\\_cow\\_farts\\_and\\_you\\_how\\_amzns\\_deal\\_w\\_clne\\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o00qva/bezos_cow_farts_and_you_how_amzns_deal_w_clne_is/) )\n\n🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚\n\nWell, I like the fucking stock (and my $9 calls) so I'm holding and buying a little more. What do you do? That's up to you.\n\nSo what does everyone else think of the interview and the revelation by the CEO about Total Energies movement with their holdings in CLNE?\n\n🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚\n\nETA: I was doing some light reading and thought that this was important to include.  \n\nhttps://www.act-news.com/news/propane-autogas-provides-energy-supply-resiliency/\n\nI'll give my opinion of what the article says.\n\nEssentially what they're saying is that resilience and diversification in the energy and vehicle markets are paramount for not just your everyday person and the environment but also our (or any nations) national security. However the argument in the article is for Natural Gas and not for Renewable Natural Gas that CLNE provides via 🐄 💨 and because of that glaring oversight I believe the article falls short. \n\nThat said the articles premise can be applied to and expanded and improved upon with RNG which CLNE provides. We can't remain beholden to either fossil fuels or battery tech in order move freight and goods across the roads. CLNE is fortunately uniquely poised to provide not just proof of concept with RNG but bringing their product to scale in short order and making our country (and any country that would adopt the tech and infrastructure) stronger and safer for it.  \n\nSo... 🐄 💨🚀 ✨🌚 \n\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "id": "o2bwu9", "created_utc": 1623975356.0, "score": 1147, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 233, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|336|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 years ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The Total update was the thing everybody was waiting for, now that it has been cleared the picture looks much better for $CLNE and for natural gas vehicles in general 🐮🐄💨⛽️🚚🚀🚀🚀✨🌛🪐\n\nTOTAL recouped the original investment in $CLNE (around $80 million) and have to invest from $100 to $400 million in the RNG JV with $CLNE.

The \"squeeze\" belief is that when those strike prices are hit, it'll require them to cover and buy millions of shares.\n\nThere are a lot of additional contracts above $13 with a lot of interest.  So this triggers a ladder squeeze where the $13 contracts force to cover, which drive up the price, which then may push into the next strike which forces the $14 to cover, etc.\n\nNow, if the day ends in the $13 range, then only the $13s and below need to cover.  The higher the strike contracts will no longer be part of the equation.\n\nSome of the covering will occur throughout the day if a strike price is hit and maintained, and those shares purchased could help momentum forward.  Other covers have a couple days to settle and those buys will not impact today's action (but may impact price next week, depending on how many naked calls were sold).\n\nAgain, all of this is a thesis so nothing is guaranteed.\n\nThis is my brief understanding, so know this is not financial advice.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate that.

Let me attempt to access the one minor wrinkle I have in my otherwise glass smooth brain to explain:\n\nExpected inflation is highly correlated with actual inflation. E.g. If you think cocaine is going to be more expensive tomorrow than today, you'll want to buy more today. If you think cocaine is going to be cheaper tomorrow than today, you'll wait to buy (not really because it's cocaine and you'll buy it no matter what.) This becomes a self fulfilling prophecy that impacts the actual price of the goods. It's why the fed honey dicks you with when they will actually raise rates. Now replace cocaine with mortgages and you'll see how this impacts UWMC. The threat of higher interest rates will get those thinking about a new home/refi to actually commit. This will cause the demand for mortgages to frontload (come sooner). Which is exactly the kind of change in a stocks momentum that can cause the shorts to get squeezed out.\n\nI also have got my crayons out to show you that on the technical analysis, the stock has broken out of it's downtrend line (purple) and is winding up similar to other squeezes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fonn9girv1671.jpg?width=1011&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=185f0b73cac230cfbce8223051b91785a2f4ebc9\n\nBuy tons of shares in order to trigger the squeeze, so we can high five Chinese astronauts on the way to the moon!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nTLDR: UWMC shorts are about get pounded out harder than my wife when her boyfriend eats two of my viagras.\n\nEdit for positions: Shares for fuel; Jul 16 11c, Dec 17 10c and Dec 17 25c for 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "o2t7qr", "created_utc": 1624033441.0, "score": 553, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 260, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2t7qr/uwmc_now_has_a_catalyst_to_squeeze_thanks_to_the/) \n**Account Age**|2 years ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey OP, **positions or ban.**", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hero.", "score": 33, "replies": []}, {"body": "Oh my god.
