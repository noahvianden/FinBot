{"title": "A note to young investors (or new investors)", "selftext": "As the Fed caused a bit of a ripple in the market today and I considered vacating a position (but ultimately didn't).  I thought a little bit about my journey over the years and thought I'd share a story and a few things I've learned.\n\nBack in 2003, I made my first move in the stock market by taking an $1800 tax return and buying 200 shares of a coal company called Consol.  At the time it traded under the symbol CNX.  I bought it with almost no DD simply because it paid a pretty good dividend.  (Around .50/share if I recall correctly.)  This is back when internet trading really wasn't a thing.  I bought it through my bank and the trade cost me **$40**!  (I actually had to call a broker at my bank and place the trade over the phone.  Ancient times, right?)  lol  I figured, win lose or draw, eventually this stock will pay for itself with the dividend.  I didn't follow the market much after that because I was really holding for the dividend, but realized a couple of years later, it had climbed into the 30s.  Around 2007 it had hit 55 and I decided to sell.  Still with my bank, the trade cost me another forty bucks!  I took the money and put it in a basic savings account where it basically sat doing nothing until 2016.  (I missed the crash of 08, by being liquid at the time, but this was pure luck.  Nobody saw that coming.)\n\nIn 2016, after some reading I decided I had more confidence in trading so I took the money and opened an investor's checking/trading account with Charles Schwab.  *I was amazed at trades costing $4.99 and done on my laptop*!  lol  After quite a bit of DD I decided to buy 300 shares of NVIDIA.  At around $24 a share, it cost me about $7200.  (I took the rest and made a down payment on a new (*used*) car and an AK-47.)  lol...\n\nAfter that, I just held the stock.  Diamond handed it as the kids say.  I've bought and sold quite a few other stocks over the years, but those two trades are where I started.  Two trades over the course of 17 years turned an $1800 tax return into a nice safety net worth over $200,000 with almost no effort on my part.\n\nWhat have I learned?\n\nEven a small amount of money in the stock market can lead to a big return.  But don't invest more than you can afford.  For me, a tax return one year was about all I could throw at it in my 20s.  \"YOLOing\" your rent check is never a good idea.\n\nBe PATIENT.  You're not going to get rich overnight.  That type of thing is rare and risky.  Do your DD and hold onto what you're confident in.\n\nWhen the market takes a downturn, **BUY!**  One of my biggest regrets is not investing heavily in 2008 when I was very liquid and the market had taken a nose dive.  I did not repeat this mistake last April/May when the pandemic caused another crash.  I bought everything I could.  Particularly old giants like Ford, and GE which were no brainer bargains at >$5.  The worst thing you can do is panic sell.  The market will come back.  Hold on and accumulate.  (I actually figured it might take 2 years for a comeback this time, but we bounced back much earlier.)  This thinking is what got me to hold the position I was thinking of bailing on today, when I realized I would just be panic selling in advance of some Fed news.  Regardless of the news, the market would bounce back.\n\nNever let savings sit in a traditional savings account. (*like I did for 8 years from 2007-2016...lol)*  Even if compound interest is all you're after, there are much better rates with other financial products.\n\nBe patient, *but don't be afraid to take profits*.  Don't fall in love.  Have an exit plan.  I sold Consol around 55 with a 9 entry.  Pretty good...  Later that same year, it climbed into the 90s.  Made me wince, but I didn't regret it.  *Unless you have a crystal ball, you're never going to enter at a historic low and exit at an all time high and that's ok.*  I realized at the time that coal was cyclical and was most likely going to decline in value in the coming years.  I stuck to the plan.  When I saw a spike, I sold.  For perspective, that high in the 90s in 08 hasn't been repeated since.  Consol trades in the high teens now and offers no dividend. (New ticker CEIX)  So in hindight I exited on a bubble that could have been better, but if I waited too long, it could have been much worse.\n\nIt's never too late to start.  If you look at those two simple trades over the span of 17 years, you could potentially do the same thing in your late 40s with a small amount of money (*remember nothing you can't afford to lose)* and have a decent nest egg by the time you hit 100% retirement in your 60s.\n\nI hope to have given a little insight here.  I thought it was worth sharing.  If you disagree, don't be too hard on me.  I'm not a financial professional...  :D\n\nHave a good'un!", "id": "o1jm8m", "created_utc": 1623888980.0, "score": 6207, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 722, "comments": [{"body": "When I was in high school I wanted the first iPod when it came out sooo bad!

Now, with Consol, you probably just got lucky since the stock has since crashed from its high. But even still, you did not buy at $90 and then sit on your butt hoping for the day it goes to $180.

As your own story illustrated, Consol never returned to $90. Or even the $55 you sold it at. This isn't necessarily because it was a bad company when you bought it, but is rather because the sector it's in - coal - has since crashed over environmental concerns.\n \nSo without due diligence, and without paying attention to the market, I'd argue that the market isn't nearly as forgiving as the old saying goes. You could well buy high into a stock that *never* recovers or goes bankrupt, taking your money with it.\n\nConsequently, I think to your advice, I'd add the following - \"time in the index is better than timing the index\" and \"only buy individual stocks if you are willing to not only do due diligence, but manage your positions over the long-term.\" Because company and industry fortunes can change, as shown by the collapse of, for example, video renting retail stores and the coal industry.

I grew up in West Virginia.  I had a grandfather who was a long wall miner (that's shop talk for an underground mine...  as opposed to a strip mine...  We have both in WV)  He died of black lung at 58.  In my teens I knew the difference between anthracitic, bituminous, and lignite coal.  I knew that Consol mined in WV with its deposits of anthracitic coal (the highest grade, its high carbon, no moisture, low sulphur)  WV has some of the highest grade coal in the world.  This is important because it's not cheap \"power plant grade coal\"  (bituminous).  It's was in high demand for making steel, not firing power plants.  It commanded a higher price.  China was still in it's city and infrastructure phase and was importing a lot of WV coal.  The US steel industry demand is always there, but with China's unprecedented need, demand and price was high for Consol's product and they were a major player in an area that will basically never run out of that type of coal.  So yes.. perhaps little DD on the company, but I did know the sector (in hindsite...  I didn't know what a \"sector\" was at the time)  lol  The dividend is what sold it.  I really thought the stock would pay for itself eventually and then I'd look into selling it.  Value did go up faster than I anticipated, but again, knowing the sector, I knew where price would eventually be heading, so I took profits.  \n\n\nWith China's \"city building\" phase over, it's very likely that the world may never see that kind of demand for steel (and the coal it takes to make it) again.  As a side note, I always chuckle when Trump or some other vote panderer promises to \"bring back coal\" in WV.  They have no idea what they're talking about.  Anthracite coal had a \"rebirth\" from 1990-2008 because of China.  That kind of demand is not coming back anytime soon.  (Although I think if we get our shit together on this US infrastructure bill, we may see a bit of a renaissance in the sector...  Something to think about...)\n\nWhere I really think I got \"lucky\" was not being invested in the market when it crashed in 08.  Any profit made off that sale could have been wiped out if I had immediately reinvested it when I sold in 07.  I don't know that I would have had the discipline back then not to panic sell and cement those losses rather than ride it out.\n\nI agree 100% though, for most investors index/ETFs are the way to go.

{"title": "There are two ways to build the biggest building in town. One is by actually building the biggest building in town ($RKT) and the other way is by tearing all of the other buildings down ($UWMC). Actually building the biggest building historically wins in the end which is why I'm betting on $RKT", "selftext": "Alright apes so here is the deal. I wanted to play nice, I wanted everyone to win those big juicy tendies, no matter how they get them, but I heard something in the Jim Crammer interviews with UWMC CEO  that stuck with me and is preposterous. It was not even the $5,000 penalty ultimatum $UWMC imposed if any of their mortgage brokers does business with $RKT  (which was a dick move to begin with more on that later) but rather the CEO's answer when he was asked in the second interview \"how he is going to take on $RKT to become the top mortgage lender by 2024\" . Mat's answer was \"$RKT revenue is going to decrease on ours is going to increase because $RKT will lose money as interest rates go up because their business is 94% refinance\" here are my two reasons why this is not a winning strategy or accurate guidance from the CEO:\n\n1. Let's start with this dumb $5,000 penalty ultimatum. Mat Ishbia UWMC CEO is trying to \"protect the broker channel\" by encouraging consumers looking for a loan or refinance to always go through a broker as opposed to going on an app like \"Rocket Mortgage\" which cuts out the middle man broker (link to interview below). Mat's argument is if you are a mortgage broker and partner with $RKT is they are undermining the broker because they are taking business away from the broker by going direct to consumer on the Rocket Mortgage app. While on the surface this looks like a valent effort to protect the hard earned market of mortgage brokers it is ill advised and actually hurting brokers financially. UWMC fantasizing that this would change consumer behavior but it will not. Consumers who want to get their mortgage direct through an app are not the same consumers that are likely to get their mortgage through a broker. To relate this to a different industry lets use accounting (since I'm in this space). There are certain people who will want to file their own taxes and not deal with an accountant for reasons like: it's cheaper, they don't want people knowing their business, ect. Then their are consumers who will only use an accountant for reasons like: they like relying on a professional or they do not have time to their taxes themselves. You can think of Intuit turbo tax as the company in this example. For whatever the reason may be consumers have varying reasons for their behavior and I argue in the case of getting a mortgage or refinance it's almost two different groups of consumers. One that prefers a broker and the other that prefers to do it themselves through an app. This being said this only hurts mortgage brokers in the end because they cannot process any leads through $RKT hurting the people Mat Ishbia is claiming to protect. Lastly $RKT can win the battle on the mortgage broker end, they have the ability to drop their fees charged through a broker to entice more brokers to exclusively work with them. If UWMC continues to play this game in the race to the bottom RKT will beat them at their own game and eventually lead to UWMC removing the $5k penalty. $RKT already lowered their rates to crush them and they are still guiding in their Q1 estimates a higher gain on margin than $UWMC\n\n[Interview where the $5,000 penalty ultimatum is said](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/uwm-ceo-says-fight-with-quicken-loans-is-paying-off.html)\n\n2) Getting back to the statement that the CEO believes $RKT revenue is going to decrease and UWMC is going to increase for them to be the top mortgage lender by 2024 is more ill advised fantasy guidance (link to interview below). Personally I think AMC has a better chance of hitting $10,000 before $UWMC is beating $RKT.  The likelihood of UWMC doubling revenue and RKT revenue decreasing by 50% is very very unlikely as alluded too in the clip. The $UWMC CEO also fails to recognize $RKT has already won the industry and they are moving on to take over other sectors that are growing at triple % rates\n\n* Rocket Homes is going to take on Zillow eventually with a one stop shop of buying a home with your pre approved mortgage all built into one app\n* Rocket Autos is going to launch in an app and they are going to be competing against Carvana with the advantage of having your financing all built within the app so you have a one stop shop for searching for the car and setting up your monthly payment\n* Amrock title insurance services, property valuation and settlement service is growing at the highest level of closing history per their Q1 release\n* See the news article below. $RKT also hedges against the price of rates rising from their purchase of government backed mortgages and is now selling them for a profit [Mortgage companies are making money off your forbearance plan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mortgage-companies-are-making-money-off-your-forbearance-plan-11623835802)\n* $RTK is still sitting on a share buy back program that they have yet to start where as UWMC has momentum and a buy back program occurring right now and it has still yet to pop off. \n\nWith all of these new and fast growing revenue streams, and one industry already dominated, $RKT is the way, short and long term. Not to mention they have a massive advertising campaign and they're trying to crush $UWMC out of their own price war so $RKT could be extremely profitable if they wanted to be, but they don't right now. Right now they want to dominate all these sectors first, like Amazon did early on, and then turn on the profit tendie machine at a later date and watch the earnings roll in.\n\n[Interview where UWMC saying it will be top mortgage lender by 2024 b/c $RKT revenue will decrease](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/06/11/united-wholesale-mortgage-ceo-on-goal-to-be-top-mortgage-lender-by-2024.html)\n\nI want to conclude with the fact that I love this sub and the ability of this group of apes on line at Wendy's to fundamentally change the way the boomers view stonks.

A broker can quote a Rocket mortgage to a borrower with rates significantly lower than that same borrower can achieve by going to Rocket directly. The difference was around 0.50% on the interest rate last I checked. \n\nRocket has protocol in place to prevent their employees from taking over borrowers' applications from brokers.  But if the borrower ever rate shopped on Rocket app, the borrower cannot qualify for the broker rates since Rocket already claimed the borrower as a direct consumer.  Blocking borrowers from getting broker rates is to Rocket's advantage (higher rates charged).\n\nAs brokers make the choice between UWM or Rocket, brokers also consider channel support from their wholesale lender support team.  A broker might be able to get a slight bit lower rate for a particular client with Rocket than UWM, but the broker is also going to consider ease of loan approval and likelihood of closing on time and other factors that are important to the borrower if the rate difference between UWM or Rocket means a difference of maybe $10/month on payments.   \nOverall broker experience between UWM and Rocket is going to vary broker to broker depending on their support team with either lender so I not making a blanket statement about either lender's ability to create a smooth process for borrowers. \n\nThe broker agreement or addendum basically prevents brokers from accessing UWM's programs if the broker continues to give business to Rocket.

{"title": "$JMIA - The Amazon of Africa", "selftext": " \n\nToday we’ll take a dive into JMIA (Jumia) Africa’s biggest e-commerce company.\n\n\n**I  have a lot of experience in population growth and economic development  in developing countries. Africa is poised to be the next area of rapid  economic growth, now that places like China/Vietnam are having a slow  down. Most continent’s populations will falter over the next half century, the  majority of growth will take place on the African Continent -** **📷** [Graph of Human Population Growth - From Business Insider](https://i.insider.com/55d38ec0dd089595388b46c6?width=1200)\n\n\n\nI  am betting on JMIA holding down and expanding their footprint on the  African continent as they poise themselves to grow along with the  continent.\n\n\n**TLDR - Ideal stock for day trading as it bounces like a kangaroo. Otherwise I'd go long, leaps and shares**\n\n\n**What’s Jumia?**\n\n\nJumia  is Africa’s biggest e-commerce company. Its core business is focused in  11 countries on the continent representing around 70% of Africa's GDP  and population. Nigeria, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, Ivory Coast,  Egypt, Uganda, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Ghana. They have been  expanding rapidly to get their foot down in as many countries as  possible without stretching themselves too thin. They have a business  model similar to ebay, in that many products are sold by private  sellers. Since the start of the pandemic, they have pivoted their  business to also deliver groceries as well as take-out food.\n\n\nNigeria  is Jumia’s biggest market so here is their website if you would like to  pursue phones, penis pills, or clothing. Browsing their website you can  get an idea of where they’re pivoting their business.\n\n\nNigerian Website - [www.jumia.com.ng](http://www.jumia.com.ng/)\n\n\n**E-Commerce**\n\n\n**I  am very bullish on JMIA but I will address the bearish argument before  explaining how Jumia has adapted quickly to address these issues and get  on track to profitability.**\n\n\nThe  bearish argument against JMIA and the question many people ask  themselves when considering e-commerce in Africa is logistics. Africa  has some of the worst infrastructure when considering the movement of  people and goods. Both due to poor road/transportation networks as well  as a dizzying amount of bureaucracy and little cooperation between  neighboring countries.\n\n\nWhile  unrelated to Jumia, this American guy who’s a truck driver in Africa can  give you an idea of the difficulties of traveling - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GslPzhFLyas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GslPzhFLyas)\n\n\nEven urban centers don’t have addresses which makes the delivery of goods a big game of cat and mouse. [This video from 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dut-Ln5qOSM)  can give you an idea of problems that Jumia was facing.  As you can see  in that video the biggest issue they’ve had since starting their  business is getting packages into people’s hands at a faster rate.  According to their [2021 Q1 Earnings Report](https://s23.q4cdn.com/836376591/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Jumia-Q1.21-11.05.21.pdf)  Jumia has 1,600 pick up stations across Africa, something which they  didn’t even have in 2019. It is the same concept as Amazon Lockers,  where a person’s goods are put in a locker to be picked up at their  convenience. 23% of packages delivered in Q1 were to pick up stations.  During their Q1 earnings, the company stated the potential of their pick  up stations\n\n\n“We view pick-up  stations as a strategic asset for the future growth of our platform. In  addition to providing more convenience options for consumers and cheaper  delivery costs, they are physical touch points that bring the Jumia  brand closer to consumers. We are increasingly leveraging them as  ordering points where consumers can place orders with the help of the  pick-up station staff which helps educate consumers and build further  trust.”\n\n\nTo give you an idea of their use in more remote regions -\n\n\n“some  countries such as Ivory Coast, pick-up stations are proving to be a  compelling alternative to door delivery and a key tool to expand  e-commerce penetration beyond primary cities. We see meaningful  opportunity in supporting equitable economic development in secondary  cities and rural areas, which led us to establish a scalable pick-up  station model in partnership with CDC, the UK’s development finance  institution. These outlets serve as both pick-up stations and ordering  points. They are operated by local entrepreneurs who earn income from  the delivery fees they receive on package delivery and commissions on  orders placed from the outlet.”\n\n\nTo show what they mean, here is a long list of pick up stations in Kenya- [https://www.jumia.co.ke/sp-pickups/](https://www.jumia.co.ke/sp-pickups/)\n\n\nAnother  issue noted in the video is pay-on-delivery which has been immensely  popular for them when they had initially started. Even when someone  tries to use a card they often have issues with mobile card readers. For  this reason Jumia had started JumiaPay - Their example video - [https://youtu.be/Wh7KsLyO0PA](https://youtu.be/Wh7KsLyO0PA)\n\n\nJumiaPay  enables users of Jumia to connect bank accounts and separate cards all  in one place, a great convenience especially for anyone selling on  Jumia. Described in an interview with the CEO of a website I can't mention,  JMIA sees JumiaPay as an introduction into mobile banking for Africa, a  place that has not has much exposure to mobile banking.\n\n\nThey’re  so bullish on their business that the CEO stated “The company wants to  be in a position to spinoff Jumia Pay and Jumia Logistics when it  becomes relevant enough to consider, he said. Although, he noted Jumia  is \"years away\" from considering spinoffs of those assets”\n\n\nSince  2020, they have started their own in house advertising agency, Jumia  Advertising, an” in-house digital advertising agency catering to both  Jumia sellers and third parties, ran over 283 campaigns on behalf of 137  advertisers. These include high profile partners such as l’Oreal, Leroy  Merlin, Adidas, Unilever, Danone and many more.”\n\n\n**Jumia Food -**  they have been running Jumia food for more than 9 years and now and  basically have their own DASH business. As you can expect, the business  has done well during the pandemic. [Here is an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1U2qLBwA_M) with the CEO on Kenyan Public Television, he explains the success they have had during the pandemic.\n\n\nAs  you can tell, JMIA is coming out to take over the e-commerce space in  Africa. While they have smaller/regional competitors, none of them have  the footprint and services like Jumia. Which is what makes me extremely  bullish on JMIA in the long term.\n\n\nMy  conviction to go long on JMIA is from my understanding of the long-term  growth and development that will take place in Africa. Jumia stands to  profit immensely from any development in Africa and will continue to  dominate the e-commerce space as more Africans enter the middle class  and want to enjoy the same convenience/luxuries available in The West.  They have shown they're capable of pivoting quickly when needed to fit  the ever changing needs of the respective countries they operate in.\n\n\nTwo  of the biggest takeaways from the UN's 2050 agenda is that by 2050 two  in every five children will be born in Africa and that Urban population  is expected to triple. In Africa, the average age is 19 years old and  rapidly getting younger. The continent is growing so quickly that by  halfway through this century, it will be home to one billion children.\n\n\nThis article from the economist is a great example of the growth that will occur in Nigeria alone - [https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/03/26/africas-population-will-double-by-2050](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/03/26/africas-population-will-double-by-2050)\n\n\nWhile  Africa is always slept on when considering business and commerce, it is  one of the last places to be underdeveloped and will bloom once more  manufacturing is relocated to the continent after wages and standard of  living rises high enough in East/SE Asia. Similarly to how many things  were made in Taiwan/South Korea, which then moved to China and now to  Vietnam. As wages rise in these places, manufacturers will move to  Africa in order to take advantage of lax labor laws and low wages,  spurning the continent’s industrial boom.\n\n\nShort-Term  Potential Roadblocks - While the pandemic has slowed down in the United  States, the large majority of Africans are unvaccinated. Which means  that many countries have/are under travel restrictions and may affect  business in the short-term.

{"title": "CLOV FUNDAMENTAL🚀", "selftext": "CLOV is my next TSLA\n\nThe daily suppression and manipulation of CLOV by the hedges is well known, and there are plenty of DD’s on why CLOV will surpass $50-150+ in the short-midterm. However, I’m not going to get into that. My goal with this post is to explain how CLOV is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, much like TSLA did in the auto industry, and give my perspective on why it will outperform its competitors.\n\n**TL;DR - First, intro - they’re changing the game just like Tesla did back in the day. Next, they’re growing, but the haters gon hate. Why? Because CLOV is the first of its kind and troglodytes hate change! Wrap it up - be dead inside, cuz studies show the highest returns went to people who are dead or forgot their account.**\n\n**This is 10% Luck, 20% Skill**\n\nHave you or a loved one ever gone to the doctor more than once to get a diagnosis for a problem you can’t figure out? The doctor reviews your file each time, but always gives the same answer: “Let’s do another test. I’ll refer you to…” It seems like you’re never making progress because either your doctor has run out of ideas or isn’t familiar enough with your medical history. Now imagine an elderly person navigating this same system, trying to remember what tests they’ve had done and their results on their own. This is impossibly difficult for anyone to deal with, and it’s exactly the problem Clover Health is trying to solve.\n\nTheir AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts.\n\n**15% Concentrated Power of Will**\n\nClover Assistant is offered for free, and currently they’re taking a yearly net loss to improve their AI, which will eventually pay off just like Tesla’s AI. One problem they may face in future is their competitors integrating machine learning into their platforms as well, but by then Clover will be years ahead of them with no hope of any of them catching up.\n\n**5% Pleasure, 50% Pain**\n\nLast week CLOV announced new partnerships with [Upward Health](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upward-health-announces-contract-clover-124500091.html) and the [U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244291/0/en/Clover-Health-to-Scale-In-home-Primary-Care-Program-Through-Direct-Contracting.html), expanding their in-home and virtual service offerings. Considering the trend towards virtual healthcare, this is extremely good news and helps strengthen its fundamentals/growth. Everyone can clearly see how well Teladoc is doing with their in-home service, and this integration will only continue to improve and expand as they cater to our convenience/laziness. This is not priced in due to the volatility in the stock market.(Sidenote: If Hindenturd’s claims were even remotely true, CLOV would not be expanding their partnership with Medicaid/Medicare only for it to fizzle out in a year.) Besides, with all the fear of inflation, it’s important to remember that healthcare companies do really well during inflationary periods, unlike most other industries.\n\nIn spite of the evidence of growth, you’ll continue to hear nothing but bad press about CLOV, particularly being compared to its competitors. These comparisons are nonsensical for multiple reasons: first, this is not an outdated, dying business, it has a real future in the rapidly growing healthcare tech industry. Secondly, none of CLOV’s competitors currently integrate machine learning into their platform and are still using archaic methods of service delivery. Similarly, TSLA had bad PR almost daily when constantly compared to regular auto makers, even as the company continued to roll out new and improved technology like their autonomous driving tech. I did not let the bad press deter me from purchasing TSLA for $38-40 per share (price after split), and as the market and media has realized the nuance and innovation of the company my conviction paid off. CLOV is the same - it’s not just a regular health insurance company, it’s a disruptive tech company that uses AI to enhance its database for more profitable and superior care for their future growth. (Sidenote - One of my favorite investors Baillie Gifford has 5 million shares of CLOV, and he bought 2.3 million shares of TSLA at $8 a share during its bearish news cycle period.)\n\nCircling back, why do so many analysts have negative sentiment towards Clover Health? It’s because they’re constantly comparing it to the outdated healthcare insurance companies, the same exact way Tesla was compared to Ford, GM, Toyota, and Nissan. In Tesla’s time, there was nothing else to compare it to - Tesla was the only one of its kind in its sector. Heck, Tim Cook wouldn’t even meet with Elon when he tried to sell his company to Apple for pennies on the dollar in 2018. Imagine passing on what would become a trillion dollar company - **MISSED OPPORTUNITY EEEEEK.** \n\nIf the negative press was so convincing, it begs the question why didn’t institutions and Chamath dump some or all their shares at $28 per share? Because they’re not paperhand losers. These institutions rarely sell their stocks for a 2-3x return; when they invest, they’re looking to hold long for a much, much greater return. They base their investment decisions on solid fundamentals, therefore if they are still holding CLOV the company must have a legitimate future of success. **Institutions are not emotional.** Retail investors, on the other hand, are the real paperhands. Many get in for the short-term, make 100% return, give away 30% to Uncle Sam, and leave with 70% in change. This isn’t a bad return at all by any means, but a lot is left on the table when one makes emotional decisions. Take a look at any successful company and their stock volatility over its lifetime, and you’ll see MANY major dips. Folks who sold on those dips are probably filled with regret, but the Buffets of the world, who are dead inside, have reaped the rewards.\n\n*\"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\"* \n\n* Warren Buffett\n\n**And 100% Reason to Remember the Name (CLOVER HEALTH!)**\n\nLike I said before, I’m not here to talk about the short-mid term potential of CLOV $100+, but rather the long-term potential of CLOV $100+. If y’all have been following Chamath as I have, you’ll know he's known for making conservative valuations. In 2018, he said Tesla would triple... it actually went 22.5x at its peak (currently at 15x). Whether you like the guy or not, he has a stellar track record. On top of that, he is one of the very few who stood with retail investors against market manipulation. This short-term volatility doesn’t deter me - I am long on this company, and will not sell my position for a measly 2-3x gain.\n\nI’ll leave you with what I think is the most succinct outlook on Clover Health that’s been shared.\n\n*“So when you bring all of this forward and you think about the future, here’s what I see in a nutshell: Number one… is a business that is actually delivering the promise of technology improving better outcomes and lowering costs in healthcare. Number two is a market that I think is huge and growing quickly. And number three is a business that is consistently taking share year over year over year. And so when you put all of these things together, in my opinion, this is one of the most straightforward investments I’ve ever made. It’s a business that I think will become extremely valuable. It will build a lot of enterprise value, and will be what I think is going to be our next 10x in 10 years investment.”*\n\n* Chamath Palihapitiya", "id": "o1y8db", "created_utc": 1623939192.0, "score": 1339, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 451, "comments": [{"body": "Not sure what price it will settle on short to mid term.

But the problem is an ever growing amount of federal debt is on notes with terms of 5 years or less. We’re not locking in 10-30 year rates like we used to, we’re taking out shorter term loans because the interest rates are cheaper. I think it was something like 60% of the COVID era debt was issued via short term bills and notes (I want to say under 2 years, but don’t quote me on that it’s been a few months since I looked into that), and we still haven’t really let up on our spending.\n\nIf the Fed has to raise rates to fight inflation, we’re going to be rolling debt forward at higher and higher rates, which is going to eat up an increasing amount of the budget. This means either more taxes, less government spending, or monetizing the debt via inflation. None of which are great for the economy, it’s just a matter of do you take immediate pain or kick the can down the road, and my bet is on the latter.\n\nJust look at the CBO’s projections on the cost of debt interest - it’s going up and up as a percentage of the total budget, and that doesn’t factor in inflation not being transitory, so if inflation continues to come in hot, the problem is hugely compounded.\n\nThat’s just sovereign debt too. The economy as a whole is leveraged to the tits. Back at the tail end of 2019 when rates hit 2.25% shit was already starting to break and the Fed had to reverse course.

CLNE is a fart mine of untapped potential with mega partnerships, positive rumors, and fundamentals.\n\nHello again fellow cow fart enthusiasts,\n\nWake the fuck up - it's show time.\n\nCLNE continues to be a major player here on reddit and across the media landscape. The news is talking about it, we're talking about it, everyone is talking about it. The company is positively positioned to take over a major market in renewable fuels for heavy transportation as per the many dozens of posts that have been produced. The long play has never changed, this is a growth stock that will grow - and we've been giving it a shot of life helping accelerate those plans. \n\n**Let's take a look at where we stand for the 6/18 call walls:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/twcac5brbu571.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3bd9b60b4e9c5472643d14a23e7858367c47f5f\n\n**Not even considering the retards at $16 strikes and beyond....**\n\n**- 1.2 million shares of open interest at $10**\n\n**- 1.3 million shares of open interest at $11**\n\n**- 2.2 million shares of open interest at $12**\n\n**- 4 million shares of open interest at $13**\n\n# Likewise, the assault on cow farts has continued daily:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bpy8oe79cu571.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0e21b7e73a9ac5a49472d7164a4651ef4c24c6\n\n# Recent rumors, unconfirmed:\n\n* Per a power user on here, a deal with UPS in the works/nearing completion\n* CEO to appear on Mad Money\n* Upcoming presser\n\nThese are the things that have come up in the last day or two. The company is aware and actively working to improve their image in the face of new interest. They rebranded this week and updated their entire customer/public-facing image. The CEO tweeted what basically amounts to a meme, featuring Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the Moon.\" I'm loving the engagement.\n\n**One thing I can say is that an absolute whale of a Chad has been buying shares today and unusual options activity alerts have been pinging this morning.**\n\n# I'm not going to beat a dead horse/cow here...\n\n...you all know the drill. This is a great stock and, as I originally said 2 weeks ago, the benefits of owning it go well beyond this expiration date.

{"title": "Why I think $MAPS is more than just a weed tech company with an app", "selftext": "\n\n\nI’ve been following and participating in the cannabis industry for almost 10 years now and have witnessed the landscape change drastically. My insights from participating in the culture along with experience in marketing and brand strategy have brought me to the following conclusion. \n\nWeedMaps is NOT just a tech company with an app (which will be revamped soon). They are NOT just the “Yelp or Amazon” of weed and they are NOT just a tool for dispensary’s to gain attention. \n\nIf this is all you see, your missing a very key aspect of their business - and that is their ability to drive, maintain and excel the cannabis industry as a whole. They have already proven to be a profitable with the current business model under strict regulations but they will really flourish when we start to see more media, events, and eventually consumption lounges - all curated and executed by WeedMaps. They will also be a key brand leading the fight for social justice reform within cannabis. \n\nI can’t stress enough how incredible their potential is for taking over not just Cannabis media in silos or within the confines of their app, but instead a full blown, mainstream take over. Documentaries, Cooking shows, commercials, behind the grow episodes, and eventually full fledged original movies.  \n\nEvents will be huge in the sense that they will enable consumers to experience cannabis in a whole new way with regulation loosening. They will infiltrate the entertainment and music industry to help catalyst the brand awareness while growing and maintaining relevance. \n\nThe skys the limit for WeedMaps as a tech company alone, pair this with the roadmap to media, events, and eventually lounges? It’s game over.

Thanks to better bins, there’s the 6900  XTX which is liquid cooled, with faster memory, higher clock speeds and higher TDP. **A MONSTER!!!**\n\n[Latest super bin model spotted 6900XTX... a RECORD BREAKER for sure!!!](https://preview.redd.it/74prhnfabw571.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02bc05241e25485be5db87fa98c24ed94ce5a290)\n\nThis new model is expected to **BREAK ALL GPU** **WORLD RECORDS** once again.\n\n[https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xtx-reappears-in-a-custom-pc-as-rx-6900-xt-lc](https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xtx-reappears-in-a-custom-pc-as-rx-6900-xt-lc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3- AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution to launch with 44 game developers.**\n\nLatest leak from Vegeta (@Broly\\_X1) published by videocardz.com has AMD launching FX SR on 7 games **next Tuesday**,  with 12 games coming SOON and 44 game studios CONFIRMING to support  AMD's FX Super Resolution (Capcom, Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Warner  Bros., Valve, etc.).\n\nThis is **AMAZING** news.\n\nIn essence, ADOPTION is **already a SUCCESS**. Software developers will push AMD FX SR to GPUs, APUs, Consoles and mobile phones (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S22).\n\n[44 developers already backing AMD FX Super Resolution!!!](https://preview.redd.it/lufh7pwfbw571.png?width=1309&format=png&auto=webp&s=2af3cb2219e4ca6071d681d04fc24db0633db79a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4- Xilinx acquisition update: UK regulator to respond within 3 weeks.**\n\nThe  Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) of the UK is planned to provide  a phase 1 decision on July 6th in connection to AMD’s acquisition of  Xilinx.\n\n[https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/advanced-micro-devices-inc-slash-xilinx-inc-merger-inquiry](https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/advanced-micro-devices-inc-slash-xilinx-inc-merger-inquiry)\n\nAs per Jim Cramer’s Mad Money Lighting Round **YESTERDAY** (see video below) he expects the acquisition to trigger the stock to breakout and keep soaring.\n\nWatch video here: [https://youtu.be/QT5YDHmDpGk?t=140](https://youtu.be/QT5YDHmDpGk?t=140)\n\n[YESTERDAY - Jim Cramer confirms expectation AMD to SOAR after Xilinx](https://preview.redd.it/7kj8xnfjbw571.jpg?width=1272&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f87b2c5ebce97700f0b35c488154ac25334821f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5- AMD AM5 platform to launch Mid-2022 (Zen 3 stacked cache CPUs by end of 2021):**\n\nAs reported by RedGamingTech, AM5 is expected in Q2 and AM4 B660 in Q1.\n\n[https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195](https://youtu.be/u2UWG-vE9cQ?t=195)\n\nIn  essence, the AM4 will be the most successful platform in modern desktop  consumer history, with a new chip coming, with up to 15% performance  BOOST vs. AMD's AMAZING Zen 3 (5000 series).\n\nBut THAT'S NOT ALL, as in Mid-2022 Zen 4 is expected. With higher IPC, in the 5nm process, DDR5 RAM memory support and MORE CORES!!!\n\n**To recap:**\n\nAMD to continue **LEADING** the DATACENTER: **Check - all systems go!**\n\nAMD to break more records with new GPU launch: **Check - all systems go!**\n\nAMD to successfully deploy FX Super Resolution Software: **Check – all systems go!**\n\nAMD to continue soaring with Xilinx: **Check – all systems go!**\n\nAMD upcoming launch on track: **Check – all systems go!**\n\n# Stock was up today 5.55% as we continue ACCELERATING!\n\n# Guys.... prepare for a BREAKOUT warp jump!!!", "id": "o28q7u", "created_utc": 1623966248.0, "score": 147, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "AMD is actually a really smart buy.

Adoption of the Zen 3 and RDNA 2 chips in the new Tesla plaids are great for advertisement. But this is their “entertainment system\" in a car. Increasing consumer chip core count (while it would be nice because more core = wow factor) is not going to be helpful to the regular Joe’s.

AMD has done a great job at showing Nvidia that they are here and are competitive. This will drive competition but Nvidia has been very conservative with their internal R&D roadmap when compared to AMD. Overall AMD needs better catalysts, for example a competitive autonomy product to Nvidia. More investment and product in HPSC specifically AI. I think these things will be their next step now that they’ve created a solid foundation to grow from.

{"title": "$UWMC Undervalued 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌙 🌙 🌙", "selftext": "A Look into $UWMC Tells Us it's Undervalued - A Company with Strong Financials and Operations\n\n[UWMC](https://utradea.com/stocks/UWMC) holds a strong reputation in the mortgage lender business which in turn translates to their large market position in the wholesale channel. With their continued growth from the market outlook, I expect to continue to see strong financials aided by their operational efficiency and their strong IT infrastructure which will help to drive their market share higher.\n\n## Company Overview\n\n**United Wholesale Mortgage Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:** [**UWMC**](https://utradea.com/stocks/UWMC)**)** is a wholesale lender. The company underwrites and provides closing documentation for residential mortgage loans originated by independent mortgage brokers, correspondents, small banks and local credit unions. The company offers its broker partners direct access to dedicated in-house mortgage advisors as well as their own teams of underwriters and closers. It also provides training, technology, marketing support and more to help its entrepreneurial partners.\n\nFor the last 6 years included FY2020, they have been the largest wholesale mortgage lender in the U.S by closed loan volume, with approximately 34% market share of the wholesale channel.\n\n**Strategy:** Operating solely as a Wholesale Mortgage Lender and thereby avoiding conflict with partners, independent mortgage advisors and their direct relationship with borrowers. By not competing for the borrower connection and relationship, they believe they’re able to generate significantly higher loyalty and satisfaction from clients.\n\n## Market Opportunity\n\n* Residential mortgage loan originations continuing to grow\n   * Federal Reserve reports residential mortgages to represent the largest segment of the U.S consumer finance market\n   * In 2020 annual residential mortgage origination volume reached $3.7T and an average of $2.2T over the last 5 years\n   * Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts residential mortgage debt to increase to $12.4T by the end of 2022\n      * An increase from FY2020 value of $11.1T\n   * Loan origination volumes are continuing to shift to non-bank originators\n      * Since 2008, non-bank originators have grown from 32% of the loan origination volume to 79% in 2020\n      * Traditional banks have since reduced their footprint in mortgage origination\n      * Non-bank originators and servicers have been able to meaningfully grow market share\n   * Steady home appreciation driving higher mortgage purchase volume and increased residential mortgage loan originations for purchases\n\n## Investment Thesis: Operational Excellence and Strong Revenues\n\nBy focusing solely on the wholesale channel, it provides UWMC with a differentiated, client-centric business model that allows for scaled, efficient and centralized processes and the ability to focus on high-quality loans. FY2020, UWMC closed approx. 561,000 loans, with an average submission to clear to close turn times of 17 days. With an average of 9.8 loans per month per production team member, UWMC outperforms the industry average of 3.5. At this rate, UWMC is able to capture a bigger market share in the growing industry, and in turn, generate attractive financial figures and returns for shareholders.\n\n**Revenue:** In the 4QFY2020 alone, UWMC reported a net income of $1.37B- nearly half of their total net income in 2020. This was approx. a 700% increase YoY (2019-2020) and is expected to continue to rise given the industry outlook and opportunity. UWMC has a clear advantage over its competitors when it comes to operational strength, balance sheet and their liquidity and further enforces their position if there were to be drastic changes in the market that would add to uncertainty (as discussed in Risks)\n\n## Investment Thesis II: Strong IT Infrastructure\n\nUWMC’s own technology platforms and exclusively licensed technology allows them to support clients and borrower to provide a “best-in-class client experience.” Their variety of full-service technology platforms is offered to independent mortgage advisors and helps to deliver closely managed end-to-end experience for the borrower from origination through closing. Because of this, their technology platforms give them a competitive edge, helps to drive customer retention and offer the ability to efficiently and quickly achieve closing on loan originations. It is primarily due to their technology that they are able to achieve the faster-than-industry average for closing loans. As well, the technology helps to drive brand recognition and brand loyalty because of their personalized marketing tool offered to the independent mortgage advisors.\n\n## Risks\n\n**Their financial performance is directly affected by, and subject to substantial volatility from changes in prevailing interest rates.** A rise in interest rates and increased inflation expectations in the U.S could lead to stagflation in the coming years. As interest rates rise, refinancing generally becomes a smaller portion of the market as fewer consumers are interested in refinancing their mortgages (refinancing makes up 75% of their mortgage volume). In the mortgage loan business, higher interest rates may also reduce the demand for purchase mortgages as homeownership becomes more expensive. These could affect their financial position and the results of their operations.\n\n**Their financial performance is highly dependent on the U.S residential real estate market conditions.** The U.S residential real estate industry is seasonal and highly affected by changes in general economic conditions. Economic conditions such as interest rates, slowed economic growth, unemployment numbers and wages affecting borrower’s income and ability to make loan payments directly affect UWMC’s financial position. Negative market conditions can lead to a decrease in loan originations and will result in lower revenues- or lead to an increase in loan delinquencies this increasing UWMC’s expenses for loans serviced.\n\n## Valuation\n\nUsing a comps analysis, I found 6 companies of competition to UWM Holdings. Given their recent IPO, I found it hard to estimate revenue numbers and use EV/Revenue to further value the company.\n\n**P/S Ratio:** Using a P/S multiple of 4.27, I arrived at a fair value of $15.23 representing a 50.88% upside.\n\n**P/E Ratio:** With the P/E ratio, I arrived at a fair value of $28.27 representing a 179% implied upside.\n\n**Using a 50/50 weighting system, I arrive at an estimated fair value of $21.75 which would imply approx. 115% upside.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3jnsdo75zh571.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca7d3651a24887c3e550cb47d83b2e232099c9c5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7njcs75zh571.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bacc63e965e82e6dc02e034493806199b603e6b\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nGiven the market opportunity, strong financials and the strong IT infrastructure UWMC brings, I think the company is positioned for solid growth in the coming years. By solely focusing on the wholesale channel, the company offers a competitive edge and presents operational efficiency in generating high-quality loans while also meeting the growing demand. Going forward, I hope to see increased revenues on their ER and also a changing social sentiment to help drive this stock forward (Reddit sentiment take from [here](https://utradea.com/feed))\n\nSources: \n\n1.

[Federal Reserve Officials Project Rate Increases in 2023](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/business/economy/fed-meeting-inflation.html?campaign_id=60&emc=edit_na_20210616&instance_id=0&nl=breaking-news&ref=headline&regi_id=76475603&segment_id=60864&user_id=1d5018a087ae3465a62b080157ab67a9)\n\nThe market is hot, and realtors know this. They are making crazy amounts of commission, along with their partnered brokers.  Most of these people just want to put a deal through before everything goes to shit.\n\nIn my area, there are empty houses. Lawns over grown, and no movement around the properties for months. \n\nIt’s a shit show waiting to happen, and I anticipate it to be bigger than the 2008 market crash.\n\nIn fact, Hamilton, Ontario is considered to be more expensive to live than LA.
