{"title": "Approaching a year since getting into options: status update", "selftext": "A little over a year ago I started building a strategy around opening positions with a sole purpose of selling ITM calls that would ideally be assigned and net a 3%/mo return. I created some criteria for the positions, made a couple of threads in [investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/grwt2m/hedging_with_covered_calls/) and [options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/gt3nx9/created_stock_screener_that_finds_stocks_covered/) to get feedback, tested a few positions, and then dove 100% in on July 1, 2020. \n\nMy goal was initially to net 3% or more per month with my break-even being -10%, since then my criteria to open positions has shifted slightly. I only open positions that have the short leg at least 3% ITM, my break even at least -5%, and profit of at least 0.13%/day (4.5%/mo for some cushion). I also won't trade if there's an earning report before my short leg expires.\n\nI tend to exit positions early or I push my short leg down/out any time it falls OTM for consecutive days. Essentially when my \"remaining profit\" drops below 0.7%/day, I take my gains because the capital is more efficient in a new position.\n\nI entered knowing that I would likely underperform a bull market, and that my goal of 3%/mo compounding was kind of insane. After 11 months my total weighted return was 37.49% compared to SPY's 36.82% and I'm projecting to finish the month at 42.38% (assuming my current open positions stay ITM through the end of the month).\n\nMy quarterly results have been:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Quarter|%|Overall Total Weighted Return|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020 Q3|\\+8.14||\n|2020 Q4|\\+14.12%|\\+23.42%|\n|2021 Q1|\\+1.21%|\\+24.90%|\n|2021 Q2 (through May 31)|\\+10.07%|\\+37.49%|\n\n2021 Q3 was obviously an outlier, I had a series of bad positions (PTON opened Feb 12, SNAP opened Feb 22, stuff like that) which ate most of the gains from other positions; since I kept pushing down and out, these positions ended up realizing out-paced gains in April/May.\n\nI've successfully executed positions on 24 different tickers, a few of my positions have been experiments that went against my initial criteria (horizontal-debit spreads, vertical debit spreads, a couple earnings plays, and cash secured puts). After a few tests, I stopped doing most of those positions for various reasons. I do like horizontal-debit spreads and sometimes I convert my covered-calls into a horizontal debit spread if the underlying moves against me too fast (like [when PTON was bad news](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/n5mryo/horrible_pton_position/) \\-- still in this btw).\n\nOf the 120 positions I've closed (I have 8 open currently, 2 of which are monthly-dividend stocks\\*), I've noticed that I have the highest return when I can get out of my position in the first 20 days - which makes sense because if I'm in it for longer than it means i've had to push down/out to offset the underlying decreasing.\n\nI just wanted to share my experience so far because this sub was very helpful when I was still brainstorming the idea.

It scans through each one, filters out any that expire after the next earnings report (don't want that catalyst) and then gives me the \"best\" option for each ticker that fits my criteria. \"Best\" is subjective but it's based off fewest days in position, highest profit percentage per day, lowest cost basis, etc.\n\nThe rest is monitoring the positions.

{"title": "Microsoft is developing new hardware to bring its ‘Netflix for games’ service to TVs", "selftext": "Microsoft is developing dedicated streaming hardware that people will be able to hook up to their TVs to use its Netflix\\-like cloud gaming service.\n\nThe company is betting the future of video games will be a subscription-based model where people pay a certain amount of money each month to get access to a plethora of titles.\n\nIts Xbox Game Pass service does exactly that, offering access to a library of games developed both in-house and by third-party studios.\n\nThat’s mostly digital downloads, but last year streaming was added with Microsoft publicly releasing Xbox Cloud Gaming. The feature is sort of like a “Netflix for games,” allowing gamers to play games that are hosted on remote servers and then streamed to users over the internet.\n\nA number of other companies have launched similar game-streaming services, including Google with Stadia and Amazon with Luna.\n\nNow, Microsoft is aiming to push its cloud gaming product to other platforms. It started rolling out Xbox Cloud Gaming to some users via a web browser on iPhones, iPads and PCs in April (Microsoft couldn’t launch a proper mobile app for cloud gaming on Apple devices due to a dispute over App Store policies). And on Thursday, the company announced it wants to expand the service to TVs as well.\n\nOne way it plans to do that is by partnering with manufacturers to add cloud gaming to smart TVs. But Microsoft is also developing streaming devices which users can plug into their TV or computer monitor to stream games from the cloud. The company didn’t elaborate on what those devices could look like, though it’s reminiscent of Amazon’s Fire TV and Google’s Chromecast dongles, both of which now support cloud gaming.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft says it is working with mobile carriers like Telstra in Australia to offer new Xbox subscription models. It’s also expanding cloud gaming to four new countries — Australia, Brazil, Mexico and Japan —  later this year, and aims to publicly launch the browser-based version of the software to all members of its $15-a-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription in the coming weeks.\n\nMicrosoft said it plans to add cloud gaming to its new Xbox Series X console, which launched last November to compete with Sony’s PlayStation 5. In the next few weeks, the company will also upgrade the servers that power its cloud gaming service from its old Xbox One hardware to the Xbox Series X.\n\nMicrosoft competes aggressively with Sony when it comes to gaming. But it’s taking a different strategy to its Japanese counterpart. While Sony is known for blockbuster exclusives that can only be played on a PlayStation console, Microsoft is focusing on embedding its Xbox services onto multiple platforms, including mobile and PC.\n\nMicrosoft has been stepping up its investments in gaming, buying the iconic studio Bethesda for $7.5 billion in its biggest video game-related acquisition yet.\n\nThe company is holding a joint event with Bethesda on Sunday as part of the E3 gaming conference to show off new games, with fans speculating they will reveal some details about a hotly-anticipated sci-fi game called Starfield.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/e3-microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-tv.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/e3-microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-tv.html)", "id": "nws8lb", "created_utc": 1623343467.0, "score": 2934, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 506, "comments": [{"body": "*Step 1*: Buy Bethesda \n\n*Step 2*: Introduce a browser based cloud gaming service where people can run high end games off of old PC'S, iPad's and TV'S.\n\n*Step 3*: Skyrim 2020 _Microsoft Edge_ edition? 🤣\n\nHonestly a cool concept though, cloud based gaming for high end single player games.

The whole point of a Windows-based system is that you get a lot apps and compatibility for free, directly from the desktop OS.

{"title": "Clearing up common confusions and misunderstandings with CLOV & Additional DD", "selftext": "**Posts have been surfacing all around Reddit/Twitter/Stocktwits regarding uncertainty and confusion about the integrity of CLOV due to its sudden thrust in to the spotlight this week so I'm creating this thread to answer common questions and provide some insight.**\n\nCLOV SEC Filings/Recent Releases/Events: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/investor-relations](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/investor-relations)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Common Questions and Concerns (Sources numbered at the bottom):**\n\n**Q:** **Clover Health has 80/90/100%+ institutional ownership! This is very clearly a collaboration by the hedge funds to earn back their lost money from shorting GME/AMC/BB/(insert any other ticker here) right?**\n\n**A:**  Institutional ownership =/= shorts.\n\nInstitutions decide if they are shorting a position or holding for the long haul. CLOV isn't just a meme stock, they are a disruptor in the Medicare advantage field with promising and improving results quarter after quarter. They were added to the MSCI index in May**^(1)** and are being added to the Russell 3000 index on June 25th at market close**^(2)**.\n\nCLOV has had a high short interest for months**^(3)** driving the price down from $17 in December 2020 to bottoms of $6 making this a prime long pick for non-shorting institutions in the intermediary time between then and now. Citadel isn't even in the top ten for institutional ownership**^(4)**. Do you know who is in the top ten? Vanguard and Blackrock, both very well-known for investing in to companies most likely to be successful.\n\nNumber one in institutional CLOV holdings? Greenoaks Capital. \"***Greenoaks Capital believes a small handful of high-quality technology companies define each generation. Their mission is to identify those companies early in their life cycle and partner with them for decades.***\" **^(5)**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Q:** **Citadel owns 500,000 shares of CLOV, this must be a distraction scheme to cover their positions for AMC/GME/BB/(insert any other ticker here) right?**\n\n**A:** Citadel DID indeed own 500,000 shares of CLOV as of 03-31**^(6)**— Citadel also happens to have been holding over 700,000 shares of AMC as of the same date**^(7)**. Citadel owns approximately 0.45% of the entire existing non-shorted float of CLOV. Shorting Institutions often hold long and short positions at the same time. This is a normal occurrence.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Q:** **Clover Health only has 4 employees according to Robinhood! Why is this company worth anything AT ALL?**\n\n**A:** Clover Health has over 450 employees listed on LinkedIn**^(8)** and they operate in 8 states nationwide (Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas)**^(9)** **and they even have an office in Hong Kong** **^(10)**. Clover Health has been involved in Medicare Advantage since 2014.

That is both a blessing and a curse, of course, because it is presented almost entirely without context.

The two centrist parties in the right wing bloc let the center left government stay in power, though one of them changed policy recently, and the minoriry government, made up of the social democrats and the greens, have to please both the centrist party and the left party, or somehow else find a majority. (Sometimes that happens because the centrists sometimes are even more economically rightwing than the right wingers, cause they are really neoliberal) The greens are kinda bad at being green and kind of a laughingstock, and they, together with the left and the centrists, also stop the socialdemocrats from reaching a compromise over immigration with the big center right party \"the moderates\", so they don't really like having to govern with them, and immigration thus remains a dividing issue even though the actual policy is already more compromised than during the refugee crisis 2015. \n\nAs something of a leftwinger myself I don't like how far to the right that the social democrats have gone economically, but the current situation forces them to make concessions to the centrist, what I hope they will do is to go back to what they used to be and stand up for real social democracy in the next election, the problem is that they have ro take responsibility for policy that that the centrists demanded of them. \n\nThere are also some issues I really think we are wrong on.

First, many of us has multiple accounts with one main one and others for various purposes. Therefore, we may have an account with 1000 with TDAMeritrade, and two more accounts for our children with 18 shares AMC and 7 shares of GME for example placing a US$1000 for each child we have. \r  \n\r  \nThen we maybe interested in Crypto and open an account with eTor for $1000 that we converted to AMC/GME.\r  \nAnother account with Webull because we like the charts or because signup gives free stock. Then we have $1000 in it and we convert to AMC/GME with 18 AMC and 7 GME when it was cheap.\r  \nThen we may also have an account with Fidelity and have 20 shares.\r  \nThen we may have transferred our securities out of Robinhood and had some cash there that we may have 1 AMC share\r  \nAs you see, the total for one investor is 1060 shares under 8 accounts and that makes the average 1060/8 = 132/5 share per investor. When in reality it is 1060 per investor.\r  \nCertainly the number of investors in my example decreased by 1/8th but the average volume by those voted in my example should be multiplied by 8.\r  \n\r  \nMy other issue is that since many of the actual share records is still hidden and controlled mainly on the hidden books and those control them, it would be easy to skew the actual submitted share count.

Of course they are massively shorted.**\"\n\n &nbsp;\n\nThe person who made the decision, Head of the USPS Louis DeJoy, is famous for dismantling mail sorting machines just before the 2020 election. DeJoy is a Trump supporter, and it was believed that mail-in voting heavily favored Biden.  \n\n &nbsp;\n\n\nHe is also a climate change denier, and instead of following Biden's electric vehicle mandate, he instead awarded the contract to a gas powered vehicle company.\nThe night before he did this, he purchased 50k worth of stock in that company. All of this is under investigation.  \n\n &nbsp;\n\nIn reality they have an 8k vehicle backlog, without the USPS deal. They have a patent on launching drones for package delivery into the 2030's. They are working closely with UPS to develop and refine this drone known as \"horsefly.\"  \n\n &nbsp;\n\nBut if all you knew was that they lost the bid, you would rightly assume it was a failing company, and that is why it is so heavily shorted.

When it comes to eCommerce, there is no room for them in the market to establish a new marketplace. On PC they cannot compete with the spending done by Tencent-backed Epic Games to secure free games, nor can they compete with the chokehold on the entire market that Steam maintains.

Unless it’s a hard-to-get item, then I got to E-Bay maybe Etsy or purchase directly from the vendor’s site. If I need volume, I will use Alibaba (but it’s a f#$%ing hassle to deal with import tax and delivery on heavy items). I have yet to try Ali Express. \n\nBecause I have never heard of Wish until now, I immediately installed the app and by the end of the night sent an invite code to 3 people and purchased roughly $184 of stuff I wanted to get. \n\nThe app has a nice flow and it upsells using promo codes and add-hoc discounts. Very addictive experience, perfect for a retarded consumer such as myself. That night I ended up with: \n\n* Green Point Laser that could start a fire $12.00 ship cost $4\n* 100 pc drill bit set $8.64 ship cost $11.50\n* 3 pc ex drill set $5.26 ship cost $11.50 \n* 46 pc repair tools/socket wrench $18.23 ship cost $1.00\n* 50 pc titanium drill bit set $9.00 ship cost $3.00\n* Blue tooth mini ear buds $1.89 ship cost $1.00\n* 7 Inch Tablet with Quad core $0.50 (new) ship cost $3.65 (how the F#$%\\^ is that so low, must see it to believe it)\n* Car Cellphone Charger $18.21 ship cost $3.65\n* Tactical flash light $8.55 ship cost $11.50\n* 20x50 HiDef Wide Angle Binoculars $39.00 ship cost $11.50 ( $1400 MSRP  ... have to see it to believe it)\n* Automotive Error code reader $0.50 (ffs @ 0.50 cents I just bought it to see what its like) ship cost $0.75\n* Polarized sun glasses (gift at join) ship cost: $1.00\n\nSo now I wait for it all to arrive. Some of the things are shipped from USA and labeled as such and many other things will take more time as they come from Gina et all (similar to E-Bay and Alibaba) \n\nI was blown away at how cheap and easy it was to place the order. Shipping didn’t make sense for some of the things, but the price offset that. \n\nThe feeling I had was similar to when I walked into a Walmart store for the first time. The only thing nagging me is that most of the things I bought from Walmart either broke or I threw away so I have a full expectation of the same for the above-mentioned products, but this is not the point and I digress.\n\n**If the above items arrive as described, Wish is my new go to online shopping.**  \n \n\n# Financial Consideration\n\nAmazon and Alibaba are obvious competitors. Because Wish is relatively new it’s not turning a profit. However, the steady Revenue and user base growth over-compensates this in my opinion.\n\nBased on [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wish-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wish-statistics/) I am expecting **2021 Revenue to be around $3.65B** based on historic values\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lmmqaxh50h471.png?width=742&format=png&auto=webp&s=17a51d82a88df08e2c5df5209616e543f4a785ab\n\nWISH user base has a very solid growth \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7uwnaip10h471.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a20cb2fd7ddc01223a9df0ce29d85a701fbd8cf\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Based on finance.yahoo.com stats as of 6/10/2021:\n\n* **AMAZON Profitability**\n   * Profit Margin 6.42% \n   * Price to Sales 4.01  \n* **BABA Profitability**\n   * Profit Margin 20.99% \n   * Price to Sales 5.24  \n* WISH **Profitability**\n   * **Profit Margin -28.09%**\n   * **Price to Sales 2.5** \n\nI personally value stock on how much Revenue it could generate.\n\nSo, given my estimated revenue for 2021 of $3.65B and WISH’s price of $10.79 as of 6/10/2021 it is roughly 2X-3X undervalued against the competitors. Making Fair Value of the stock, in my opinion, $20 - $40 with market cap at around $30B +/- $10B which aligns with original valuation the founders wanted, and only half of what it IPO at. \n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/wish-ipo-shopping-app-public-filing-covid-2020-11#:\\~:text=Wish%20is%20looking%20for%20a,matter%2C%20per%20the%20Financial%20Times.&text=In%20the%20first%20nine%20months,the%20same%20period%20in%202019](https://www.businessinsider.com/wish-ipo-shopping-app-public-filing-covid-2020-11#:~:text=Wish%20is%20looking%20for%20a,matter%2C%20per%20the%20Financial%20Times.&text=In%20the%20first%20nine%20months,the%20same%20period%20in%202019).\n\n# All of this does not take into account accumulating high Short Interest!\n\n# In Conclusion: Riding WISH to its Fair market price of $20-$40, then will see. \n\n***I am not a financial analyst nor advisor; I like to eat green crayons.***\n\nGood Luck to all!\n\nLatest 10-Q: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822250/000156459021027024/wish-10q\\_20210331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822250/000156459021027024/wish-10q_20210331.htm)\n\nLatest 10-K: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822250/000156459021015544/wish-10k\\_20201231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822250/000156459021015544/wish-10k_20201231.htm)", "id": "nwt1ro", "created_utc": 1623345478.0, "score": 528, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "Keep us informed how that $1 tablet worked out", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "It was fiddy cents  plus $3.65 for shipping, and okay, I will reply to this comment when it comes.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "!remindme 2 weeks", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "!remindme 3 months", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "This guy has bought stuff from Wish before 😃", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, I also got my debit card hacked so I never wished again🙏", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I will be messaging you in 14 days on [**2021-06-24 18:10:51 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-06-24%2018:10:51%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwt1ro/wish_personal_dd_fair_price_share_target_20/h1b48t3/?context=3)\n\n[**1 OTHERS CLICKED THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Fnwt1ro%2Fwish_personal_dd_fair_price_share_target_20%2Fh1b48t3%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-06-24%2018%3A10%3A51%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20nwt1ro)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "wil work out good as the stock play i suppose.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Ehhh I made some decent coin in at 9 out at 14 next morning", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "It could be tablet cover :D just saying ha ha once i ordered a keyboard and they sent me slime/ keyboard cleaner.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Stone tablet inbound", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not sure if I screwed something up but the tablet and the car error code reader were both cancelled and refunded to me with this:” We’re so sorry!

Price will absolutely fly once this happen and potentially before if people get in. We only need to buy and hold for nearly a week for this to happen. Look up any previous DD post on CLNE where they explain the reason it is being shorted (revenue growth is expected in the medium to long term so it looks like easy money for hedge funds). [Here is a link with short interest over the past year for anyone lazy](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clne/short-interest).\n\nCLNE also has several partnerships in the works including a large deal to provide RNG (carbon renewable natural gas) to Amazon for their delivery trucks, and in general green energy is growing priority for the USA and the world in general. As someone who is probably most risk averse than most people here, this makes me feel better as I can always hold in case of a sudden dip for longer term gains.\n\nI also did some more research after reading some of the more surface level posts on CLNE and found that they built their stations near existing Amazon warehouses, which gives them an advantage when negotiating future deals as transportation of materials is factored into negotiations (from what I know, I work as a software engineer for a steel manufacturing business).\n\nCLNE has also not even reached it’s all time high of $16 yet, whereas most of the other meme'd stocks have well surpassed their's and are in the pump-and-dump territory that leads to a lot of paper handing.

{"title": "SENS (32% shorted) can be a 10x candidate from here. Warning extreme DD, requires wrinkled brain.", "selftext": "Senseonics Holdings, Inc., is a medical technology company, that develops and manufactures a unique implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Its products include Eversense and Eversense XL, which are implantable CGM systems to measure glucose levels in people with diabetes for a period of up to 90 and 180 days. The Eversense (90 days) has FDA approval since 2018 and the Eversense XL (180 days) is already approved in Europe and FDA approval is expected by the end of the third quarter. A CGM system provides glucose measurements regularly and gives the user an alarm when sugar levels drop too low or go too high, it can also be used in connection with an insulin pump to automatically deliver insulin when needed.\n\nEversense technology is unique as it is a long-term CGM system that can last up to 180 days, versus 7 to 14 days from the competition, and it is the only one implantable under the skin and works with a removable transmitter (in competing products you cannot remove the transmitter; otherwise, you have to replace the whole device). It is a CGM system that allows for freedom of movement and the user can decide when to use it and all this with even better accuracy than all other CGM systems in the market.\n\nThe almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck. The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then, when COVID hit, the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn't get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure. In March 2020, Senseonics was forced to make a $48.5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale.\n\nEnter Ascensia Diabetes\n\nOn August 10th, 2020, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Ascensia Diabetes Care. This is a transformational alliance for Senseonics, as Ascensia is a dedicated diabetes company with a presence in 125 countries and 10 MM customers. It has the trust and reliability of being in this business for over 70 years. Ascensia is the market leader in the Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM) market with its COUNTOUR portfolio of devices and it is the combination of several important companies with interests in the Diabetes market. Ascensia is based in Switzerland and it was established in 2016 through the acquisition of Bayer Diabetes Care by PHC Holdings (formerly known as Panasonic Healthcare Holdings), which is a KKR portfolio company.\n\nAscensia Diabetes Care is betting big on Senseonics. Not only are they providing 35 MM in convertible debt financing but will also invest an approximate $250 MM over the next five years to commercialize and market Eversense in exclusivity all over the world. So why would such a company with approximately $1 Billion in annual sales is interested in a $4 MM revenue company?\n\nI believe Ascensia recognizes the enormous potential of this technology, which could eventually make redundant even their current business. Ascensia business is CONTOUR, a razor/razor blade business model in which the company sells blood glucose measuring devices for a low price and makes money selling the small lancets that are replaceable. Make a tour through Amazon or simply Google \"Blood glucose monitoring\" and you will find that this market is over saturated with dozens of suppliers competing in price. Ascensia prices its wares at a premium over competitors but the technology is mature so I am not so sure if new diabetes clients will be choosing Contour going forward. Basically, they need a new product that can reinvigorate the brand and put them once again at the leading edge of the diabetes market.\n\nCurrently the Senseonics Eversense device requires calibration twice a day, that could be done using a Contour device to measure the glucose level and input the result in the Eversense device via an iPhone or Android Phone. But as the following slide shows, the company has a product pipeline with next generation devices that will require increasingly less calibration. The Eversense XL submitted for approval to the FDA requires only one calibration a day and the Eversense 365 will require only one rebalancing a week reducing considerably the use of lancets for blood monitoring systems.\n\nThe technology has huge potential to disrupt the current CGM market, which is a $5-plus billion market today growing at about a 35% CAGR (according to SENS management) and dominated by three large companies: DexCom (DXCM), Abbott Labs (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT). This market is exclusively focused on the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients which are intensively managed, that means they need insulin shots and many even use insulin pumps as they cannot produce any insulin themselves. The number of people with diagnosed diabetes in the USA in 2020 was 34.2 of which 1.6 MM have Type I Diabetes, unfortunately the number of people with Diabetes is growing very rapidly as can be seen from this National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020.\n\nWith FDA approval for the Eversense XL expected by the end of the third quarter, Senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry, but the real game changer will come with the Eversense 365, as it will open up the Type II market to this new type of CGM devices. Here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either.\n\nCurrently, people with Type II diabetes have only BGM devices like CONTOUR to help them monitor their blood levels, but that requires pricking a finger to get blood and only provides a measurement at that particular moment. The 365 device will require only a 5 minute intervention every year to remove and replace the sensor and if the company gets to the point that won't need a transmitter, as you scan your smartphone over the sensor, then I believe the sky is the limit for Senseonics as there are 420 MM people with diabetes in the world.\n\nThe company is providing the current guidance as to future revenues, I believe these numbers to be conservative once the Eversense XL gets approval in the USA. I am confident it will be approved, it has already been approved in Europe and the 90 days device was unanimously approved in 2018 by the FDA's Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel of independent medical experts that voted, 8 to 0, that the system not only was safe and effective, but also that its benefits outweighed the risks.\n\nSenseonics is a high risk/high reward type of investment, but the type of risk I like, basically there is a small chance that the company will file for insolvency anytime soon and with the Ascencia alliance it stands a very good shot at disrupting the diabetes market. In my opinion, Senseonics has the makings of a potential multi-bagger from here and aggressive investors would be advised to initiate a position at the current levels. Next catalysts for the company will be information of progress in the commercialization in Europe and from April 1st in the USA, then it will be the Eversense XL approval by the end of September.", "id": "nwzmjz", "created_utc": 1623362071.0, "score": 579, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 244, "comments": [{"body": "I can’t read", "score": 132, "replies": [{"body": "Dont look at the russel reconstitution then.

{"title": "Why $CLNE is more than a hype stock and why I’m bullish for the next 5+ years", "selftext": "$CLNE presents a promising future and attractive opportunity for investors given the energy transition the world is undergoing. With CLNE’S established brand and reputation in the renewable gas industry, I believe they are well-positioned to serve the growing demands for RNG. \n\nCompany Overview\n\n**Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:** [**CLNE**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CLNE)) provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and relating fueling solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. The company supplies renewable natural gas (RNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquified natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. They serve heavy-duty trucking, airports, public transit, industrial, and institutional energy users as well as government fleets. With over 20 years in the alternative fuels industry, they are one of the largest (if not largest) U.S providers of FNG for commercial transportation and have a unique position in the market because of their valuable Environmental Credits.\n\nRNG which is delivered as either CNG or LNG is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring, environmentally detrimental waste methane from non-fossil fuel sources such as dairy farms and agriculture facilities. Methane is one of the most potent climate-harming greenhouse gases with a big impact on global warming, 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. They are focused on developing, owning, and operating dairy and other livestock waste RNG projects and supplying RNG to their customers in the commercial transportation sector.\n\n2020 Financial Results\n\n**Revenue:** CLNE’s 2020 total revenue was $209.2M which had a YoY change from 2019 of -15.2% or a decrease of $52.3M. This decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related sales but partially offset by customer contracts with their Zero Now truck financing program and an increase in station construction sales. Of the total revenue in 2020, 84.1% was from volume-related revenue mostly from fuel sales and the performance of O&M services. Despite 2020’s bad financial performance attributable to economic conditions, we also saw similar companies in the industry posting decreased revenues. CLNE is positioned for high revenues with the upcoming ventures and new developments that will allow the company to expand and meet the growing demand in the transportation sector.\n\n**Expenses:** Total cost of sales accounted for 63.5% of total revenue; 55.4% from product cost of sales and 8.1% from service cost of sales. The total cost of sales decreased by 12.6% or $26.7M YoY primarily due to decreased gallons delivered during 2020 and their lower effective cost per gallon. The total operating expenses also decreased but attributable to decreased revenues. In the prior year (2018 to 2019), we saw decreased operating expenses and increased operating margin which was due to cost reduction efforts. Going forward if CLNE is able to continue decreasing their operating expenses and keep at a positive operating margin then they’ll be able to post a profitable period in the upcoming years that’ll help with seeing shareholder returns.\n\n**Debt:** CLNE has a short-term debt of $3.59M and long-term debt of $82.09M of totalling $85.68M making up 44.6% of their total liabilities. They have a debt ratio of 0.27 which is relatively low compared to the competitors identified that have an average of 0.68; representing CLNE’s lower debt to assets. Despite the capital-intensive industry CLNE is operating in, their lower ratio is primarily attributed to their high cash position. The lower ratio also gives insight into the company’s ability to pay off their future debts and their lower risk for bankruptcy (\n\nRecent Developments\n\n**Amazon:** It was announced in April this year that CLNE signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon RNG. The fuel will be provided at 27 existing CLNE fuelling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations that expects to be constructed by the end of the year. This agreement was announced after Amazon’s action earlier this year to reduce the carbon footprint of their delivery fleets.\n\n**Bp Joint Venture:** A joint venture was finalized in March this year with BP Products North America Inc. to develop, own and operate new RNG projects at dairies and other agriculture facilities. This joint venture is valued at upwards of $400M with BP investing a total of $50M.  This joint venture will help to RNG production and meet the growing demand.\n\n**Chevron Adopt-a-Port:** Chevron U.S.A a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corp is investing a total of $28M into this initiative that focuses on providing truck operators near ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach with cleaner, carbon-negative RNG in order to reduce GHG emissions. Chevron’s funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new or converting RNG-powered trucks.\n\nInvestment Thesis: Growing Demand for RNG\n\nThe demand for RNG produced from biogas is significantly growing due to federal, state and local regulatory authorities on reducing the emission of GHG such as methane. Over the past decade, the transportation sector has been the fastest-growing end-market for RNG where it’s used as a replacement for fossil-based fuel. This growth is mainly driven by an increased focus on reducing GHGs across America and worldwide. With any car, truck, bus, or any other vehicle capable of being manufactured to run on RNG, the shift to RNG is imminent. In the U.S, renewable energy growth is expected to accelerate in 2021 and forward as the Biden administration starts to execute many initiatives including:\n\n* Rejoining the Paris Climate Accord\n* Investing $2T into clean energy over the next 4 years\n* Fully decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 in order to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050\n\nRenewable natural gas production has already more than doubled from 2015 to 2018 growing by an annual average of 30%. If the industry continues to grow at this rate of growth, we can expect that the industry would reach 1B gallons of the annual production of RNG transportation fuel in 2022.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nWith CLNE being the biggest producer of RNG in the U.S and the increased demand for RNG set to accelerate as stricter restrictions come into place, we will see a shift in the transportation industry into cleaner fuel sources. The company is well-positioned in the RNG industry to continue being a leading provider and deliver attractive returns for shareholders in the future to come. Going forward, I hope to see more news on developments with bigger corporations looking to hop on the RNG wave. I think it is only soon until cities regulate the use of RNG in more commercial use transport like public transport and we see the shift to decarbonized transport\n\nSources:\n\n1.
