This is uncommon for tesla in the last quarterly days since normally they are pushing local deliveries of fresh production to minimize days of inventory in the quarter. I believe there might be a temporary demand issue in china but I see it like a maturity check on tesla and partly even bullish - if tesla knows the Chinese won't flock to buy their cars and still haven't tried to discount the pricing or incentivize more aggressively that means they would rather wait (and thus build up the inventory) and deliver the cars in Europe, Australia or other Asian countries instead.

It's one thing to read about a Tesla... It's a whole different world to see one on the road or even have someone you know own one, which may lead to you getting to physically experience it. For Tesla, this used to be theory... but the more EVs Telsa imported to China, the more the people of China wanted them... And Chinese public demand for a Tesla factory grew as it meant cutting the export costs to customers, which lead to not only a Gigafactory in China... But the only fully foreign owned factory in all of china, which local demand for Tesla's and EVs allowed them to negotiate for. In addition, in allocating exports, you decrease local supply... And as we all know, when there is equal or more demand for a product than production, decreasing supply will increase demand. If Tesla allocated 10 percent of Chinese EVs to other countries, demand would massively increase in China, allowing them to increase the cost of the EVs. In addition, while exporting EVs to other countries is currently their best advertising in countries that don't have Tesla's, Tesla makes a decent additional profit on exports... Meaning they get advertisement AND increased profits on both the EVs they export and the ones they don't.

This was an attempt to understand their methods towards solving autonomy in comparison to Tesla's method. It was presented by Drago Anguelov, Head of Waymo Research, back in February 2019.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Q0nGo2-y0xY\n\nHere are some things that stuck out to me:\n\n1: The whole presentation is based around the idea of solving for \"The Long Tails\" aka corner cases.\n\n//\n\n\n\n\n2: Corner cases are collected from their current fleet of vehicles and from historical accidents from the localized areas where they operate a driverless service.\n\n  \n//\n\n\n\n3: These cases are run through their simulator and scenarios are tweaked to try to account for the variation of possibilities.  \n\n//\n\n\n\n4: The simulator was designed to try to help train the machine learning models in a way to imitate learning from humans. Drago talks about the issues and solutions implemented to create a simulated driving environment. Still...  \n\n//\n\n\n\n\n5: The simulator isn't perfect. The tweaks to the simulation can often clash with real driver behavior captured in the logs. That is, the simulated Waymo car isn't changing the behavior of other cars in the recorded environment because they're just that, a recording. Waymo talks a bit on how they try to mitigate this.  \n\n\n//\n\n\n\n6: There are limitations to the simulations. The higher the complexity of the simulation, the more issues that arise with the simulation and the more corner cases that pop up.  \n\n//\n\n\n\n\n7: Real Human driving behavior falls within a bell curve and they seem confident enough to be able to account for 1 standard deviation through complex models created from their simulations and real world data. One thing he mentions is if you only have a few examples of a corner case, \"there's no guarantee that your 10 million parameter will learn it well.\" The tough parts are the tail ends of the curve, hence their focus on \"The Long Tails\".  \n\n//\n\n\n\n\n8:  Waymo's current plan is to handle corner cases via \"expert designed models\", e.g. hard coding for specific scenarios, until they have enough training data to create complex machine learning models. They admit that \"learning from demonstration is key.\"  \n\n\n//\n\n\n\n9: Corner cases will continue to be an issue as they expand to new areas.  \n\n\n\n\nRelevant slides from the presentation:\nhttp://imgur.com/a/JkTzZld\n\nAlthough Waymo still believes that simulation can lead them towards full autonomy, it's clearer than ever to me that they needs real data by real drivers.  Their attempt to solve this through simulations isn't good enough to reliably recreate real world scenarios for corner cases as errors/issues in complex simulations accumulate and create noise in the data. Adding to that noise is sensor fusion because not all sensors will see the same thing at the same time and as Elon puts it, when  sensors disagree, which one do you believe? The debate isn't Lidar vs Vision, it's about who can build the best neural network and that will be determined by data. \n\nAs a note on the sensors: our own brains will start ignoring one eye if there are issues with the quality of its signal. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppression_(eye)\n\nOn Lidar vs Vision: It's all about quality and specialization.\n\nTesla's ability to identify corner cases using triggers from their exponentially increasing fleet is unparalleled. It allows for training a complex model with clean data that doesn't include the noise of a simulated driving environment and unnecessary sensors. Elon's claim of not using Lidar even if it was free makes total sense now. Oh, and I didn't even mention shadow mode!\n\nThis is a game of data and Tesla is winning.

The results of the training should be exactly the same. So the real benefits are cost and time.\n\nFor cost I'm actually not sure if the hardware will be cheaper or not? Making custom chis and computers isn't usually cheaper than buying \"off the shelf\" parts. If the new hardware is more efficient it might be cheaper in terms of cost to run it? But it could be more expensive if it's more efficient but also just doing a lot more work.\n\nI think time is the real benefit. I remember seeing a stat that to train a really large model like GPT3 on a current cloud training platform would take something like 300 years. Anyone doing development on these really huge NNs needs to have many teraflops of computing available to train in a somewhat reasonable amount of time. No one outside of Tesla knows the specifics, but I'd guess that retraining their current FSD version from scratch would take days if not weeks? They've even invested in a lot of very expensive NVMe storage for their current clusters, which makes sense since they must be loading many terabytes of video data to even train a small part of the NNs?\n\nAnd the number of cars on the road, and the number running FSD software is just going to keep growing and growing. Which means way more data available for training. I think it will probably take a computer like Dojo to just keep developing at a decent pace, otherwise they might have to wait weeks for a full training run? If they can cut that down by 10x-ish, then it means they can test and develop much faster, even with much larger models and lots more data.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I can offer a bit more insight!\n\nI would say the hardware will end up more expensive. Developing custom hardware is very expensive, and even if the computations you do are more efficient on this custom hardware, that would be offset by that you will be doing more of those computations which lands you squarely in the same energy/thermal budget. Which is fine, because all we care about is maximizing the amount of computations we can do.\n\nYou are exactly right about training times! The whole point of Dojo is to give more \"training budget\" to the AI team. That can mean either bigger/more neural networks, or more training data. Tesla currently lets their cluster train for 2 weeks (the maximum amount of time people want to wait to test a new version, also conveniently Tesla works in 2 week sprints based on that they use an Agile work schedule). When two weeks is the hard limit, that becomes the primary constraint on the entire workflow. So right now, the AI team is forced to be selective about how many networks they get to train, and how much training data the current cluster can handle in two weeks. A lot of effort goes into refining their training data because of that, from what I have heard MOST of the effort. But when they get more computation budget, the team doesn't have to be as picky with their training data, or might even be able to iterate/test faster than every two weeks!\n\nWe know that Tesla has done custom silicon before (the current FSD chip in every new car), so I think that is a given for Dojo.

Consider that in 2006 Ford took on more than $18 billion in debt to help restructure the company while taking massive losses. Between 2006 and 2008, Ford managed to lose over $30 billion from its operations. Nobody wanted to buy a Ford vehicle then, nobody. Things are completely different today. The Fusion is changing consumer attitudes and the Escape is selling like hotcakes. 2013 has started off with a bang in automotive sales, and Ford is taking full advantage of it. The company was confident enough in its financial shape to double its dividend a few months ago. There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic in Ford as a company and in having its stock in your portfolio. So the next time you hear someone mention that its $100 billion in debt is too much, enlighten them, please. Thanks in advance.\n\nBesides the fact that the article is from 2013, my interpretation is that the author is claiming the debt levels are fine because of good sales in the first quarter of 2013? My understanding is that debt is fine if Ford can keep producing ICE cars, but if they want to pivot to an EV producer (by that I mean a majority of production being EVs, not just 10% or something), they will have to purchase new equipment, which is capital intensive, and pivoting also renders old equipment useless/less productive. So the concern is essentially that the equipment purchases with debt stops generating income, and they will need capital to purchase new equipment. \n\nDo you have a more up to date explanation regarding Ford's debt?

{"title": "CLOV detailed DD", "selftext": "Hi everybody, I've decided to finally try and write up a more in depth DD for CLOV because I think a lot of people have a tough time understanding their business model, and understanding why they have a legitimate shot at helping to fix one of the biggest issues with healthcare in America. For some background, I'm an MD who did my undergraduate degree focused on healthcare systems and economics-essentially many of the same courses someone pursuing an MPH would take (I actually did about 2/3rds of the courses required for an MPH at my alma mater). So in addition to being a WSB degen I understand what Clover Health is trying to accomplish, and I'm going to try and explain it because I think unlike a video game retailer or a movie theater most people have no idea wtf CLOV does.\n\n# What is Medicare Advantage and why was it created?\n\nTo understand Clover's business model we first need to understand what ***Medicare Advantage*** is, because that's Clover's primary business model (though they also have expanded into Direct Contracting Medicare which is somewhat similar). Medicare Advantage was created by the government to try and fix a lot of the broken incentives in our healthcare system that have lead to rampant inflation in the cost of healthcare in the US.\n\nHave you ever wondered why healthcare costs per person [**have more than doubled in the last decade?**](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HLTHSCPCHCSA)  Healthcare costs have been growing for a long time and [have worsened wealth inequality](https://www.ft.com/content/0d7ea0c1-f0b8-4c8a-a532-f18f147079bc) due to growing 5X since 1980, but this inflation has accelerated the last decade so we're going to focus on the primary cause of this for simplicity.\n\nRight now, literally everyone in the existing healthcare system has had financial incentives to continue driving up costs, from consumers to hospitals to physicians to drug companies to insurance companies. Focusing on insurance though, the crazy thing is that **insurance companies only make more money if healthcare costs more money.**\n\nWait a minute you say, \"That makes no sense! Why would insurance companies make more money if they're paying out more money?\" That might have been the case in the past but over most of the last decade insurance companies have been restricted by the [80/20 rule](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-care-law-protections/rate-review/), a frankly economically stupid regulation that was ironically pitched as a way to bring costs down in health insurance. You'll often see this referred to as a \"Medical Loss Ratio\" especially when talking about earnings for insurance companies. But basically the law was changed so that insurance companies could only keep 20% of whatever money they charged for an insurance policy and had to pay out at least 80%.\n\nSo what did health insurance companies do? With this new law it meant that every insurance company was **now aligned with** ***higher*** **payouts to hospitals, physicians and pharmacies** and [stopped trying all that hard lower healthcare costs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5145008/) because the higher their payouts were the more money they could charge on their insurance policies the next year. That's become the primary way for health insurers to grow their profits and revenues. Letting healthcare costs grow out of control is a big part of why [United Healthcare stock has rocketed up in a straight line up for the last decade-up more than 1300% since Obamacare passed in 2010.](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/UNH#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-)\n\nNow, most people in the United States may have private healthcare through their work. But a very large chunk of healthcare costs are paid out by the government through Medicare because the oldest and sickest patients that use the most healthcare dollars are people over 65. The most expensive healthcare in America is the catastrophic kind-where patients have a stroke, have a heart attack, get cancer, and then they require repeated hospitalizations and extremely expensive treatments that run well into the six and seven figures. As healthcare costs have gone completely insane the amount of money the government has had to spend on Medicare has gone crazy as well. Medicare Advantage is their attempt at trying to align better healthcare that costs less with higher profits for insurance companies. Instead of hospitals and doctors billing the government directly for care provided to Medicare patients, the government just hands over a set amount of money for each patient that an insurer covers. So the more patients a health insurance companies has, the more money they get from the government for taking care of those patients. This basically brings back into the system the old incentive where spending less money on healthcare leads to better profits. Now you're going to think, doesn't that just mean they'll just deny paying for everything and make bank? No, because combined with this the government also looks at the quality of the outcomes and care that patients get, and the better the patients do the higher the pay you get per patient. This is the government's attempt to fix the completely broken incentives in the healthcare system.\n\n# Why Clover Health?\n\nSo now you have some idea of what Medicare Advantage is. Why should you invest in Clover and not just buy shares of United Healthcare and Anthem since they've been printing money since before JPow bolted the turbo to the money printer? What it comes down to are two things.\n\n**1)** **Clover Health is a \"pure\" play where focusing on improving healthcare by preventing health problems before they become catastrophic will always improve Clover's profitability.** Clover only covers patients with either Medicare Advantage, or Medicare Direct Contracting (to avoid this being 80 pages long, this is a type of  hybrid of traditional Medicare with incentives for quality and cost reduction). This means that they can aggressively focus on improving healthcare quality, preventing patients from needing to be hospitalized, preventing patients from having those heart attacks, strokes, cancer. If other insurance companies aggressively improved the health of their patients they would actually make less money over time because the majority of their profits come from patients on plans where they only make more money if you're less healthy and requiring more and more expensive healthcare. If United Healthcare or Anthem successfully got their patients to be healthier they'd actually make less and less money due to the 80/20 rule! So they literally cannot be aggressive in pursuing a focus on preventing those terrible healthcare problems because they'll actually annihilate their own profits if they succeed. Any company that's attempting to do both traditional health insurance and also Medicare Advantage will be fighting with itself, either they do really well with Medicare Advantage or they do really well with their traditional insurance business. They can't actually succeed in both because the path to profitability for each are completely different. With Clover, if they succeed it's literally a win for everyone. It's a win for shareholders with larger profits, it's a win for patients because they have better health, it's a win for physicians because their patients are healthier which actually means less of a workload and physicians actually getting paid to keep people healthy, it's a win for the entire United States because we can maybe stop setting all our money on fire and maybe do something other than spend a quarter of a our salaries on healthcare while having our healthcare system [ranked last place against similar nations](https://www.citizen.org/article/dead-last-u-s-health-care-system-continues-to-rank-behind-other-industrialized-countries/).\n\n**2) Clover Assistant**. This is the killer app that Clover has been working on, it's their electronic health records system that attempts to keep track of all the moving pieces in healthcare to help physicians help their patients in a timely manner. For example, a lot of the time a patient gets hospitalized and they get well enough to go home, but they're supposed to follow up with their physician to make sure that they're continuing to improve, that they're not getting worse again. In traditional healthcare what happens is that the hospital physician sends the patient home and gives them a pile of papers and written somewhere in there is that they should go see their doctor within a week. The patient may or may not read this, and even if they do they'll call their doctor and the phone number will be busy and since they're not feeling well to begin with the patient gives up. 2 weeks later, the patient is feeling sicker than ever and ends up calling 911, ends up back in the emergency room, back in the hospital. [Medicare has attempted to punish this type of thing by financially penalizing hospitals for this type of situation known as a bounceback](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program) but it's still a rampant problem. With Clover Assistant however, the software is constantly looking at every patient's record and if it sees that a patient was hospitalized and discharged it proactively notifies their primary care physician that hey, you need to see and follow up with this patient to make sure they're continuing to get better. Then their physician might intervene with something like a $20 prescription for new antibiotics to help the patient continue to improve, instead of yet another $20,000 hospitalization. That's just one example of what it can already do today, but the Clover Assistant will eventually be able to use a large dataset of health records with AI to discover new ways to improve healthcare.\n\n# Addressing short seller critiques\n\nTo be frank, the report from Hindenburg sounds like it was written by someone with absolutely no real knowledge of healthcare or the healthcare business. But since this report is what so many people like to harp on when trashing Clover Health as some sort of scam I'm going to address the points they bring up.\n\n**#1 Claim: Clover is being investigated by the Department of Justice.**\n\nClover received what is known as a Civil Investigative Demand from the Department of Justice, which is a request for more information from Clover to make sure that there is no Medicare fraud occuring. This doesn't mean that there's any actual fraud, but it's standard when the government is your primary payer that you get hit with these CIDs to make sure that everything is on the up and up. There's no credible evidence that this has any actual material impact on Clover Health's performance. As an example, where was Hindenburg's short report when [Anthem dealt with a DOJ CID in 2018?](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/anthem-doj-medicare-advantage-risk-adjustment-chart-review-civil-investigative-demand) If we [take a look at Anthem's stock during this same time period](https://finance.yahoo.com/chart/ANTM#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--) we can see that there was literally no impact from this on their share price, and since 2018 their stock has grown over 70%! It's absurd to believe that this has any material impact even if you do somehow believe that Clover broke the law in pursuing their vision. They pitch it as an \"existential risk\", essentially insinuating that the government would stop working with Clover even though this is clearly not true as CMS has continued to approve Clover for new programs and frankly this has never happened to any legitimate health insurer. [Clover also recently added this heavy hitter to their board](https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/health_care/clover-health-taps-former-cms-official-for-board/article_51803ebc-e162-596b-a372-d7907d6abe7a.html) which will help them navigate the complex regulations around Medicare.\n\n**#2 Claim: Clover had tons of patients inappropriately funneled to them through Seek Healthcare**, a Medicare plan comparison portal owned by Clover's head of sales.\n\nThis claim just has no factual basis, the vast majority of plans recommended by Seek were for non-Clover plans so all the evidence out there points to them having been neutral in matching patients to a plan that would benefit them.  Regardless, Clover has made it clear on Seek's website that Seek is an affiliate of theirs.\n\n**#3 Claim: Clover's software tries to \"upcode\"**\n\nIf you're not familiar with healthcare this will sound negative, but what Clover's software is doing is literally what every piece of healthcare software does. Medicare billing codes can be coded higher (meaning that your care and work is seen as more valuable to Medicare) based on how much data you've included about a patient in your documentation. Traditionally on a paper chart a doctor would have needed to write down the x-rays, labwork, etc. to bill the higher codes but with electronic health records systems you can code at a higher level without extreme effort because all the data is right there. That's a large part of their business plan, because they can show that yes we have the data and our physicians are able to review this to provide better and more detailed care. Hindenburg makes it sound like they're doing something nefarious when in fact, reviewing and providing this extra data is exactly what will provide better care. Complete absurd negative spin from Hindenburg on this claim and I frankly don't know of any healthcare record software that would purposely not include healthcare data so that physicians would only be able to have rudimentary data-free documentation. That'd be beyond moronic.\n\n**#4 Claim: Doctor's whine about Clover's software.**\n\nSo coincidentally in a past life I actually worked to train physicians to use electronic health record systems. I'm sure that Hindenburg was able to interview several physicians who would have complained about Clover Assistant, but the part they're not telling you is that a [third of physicians are over the age of 60.](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/physician-retirement-why-its-hard-doctors-retire) There is no software in existence that isn't going to be whined about by physicians, it doesn't matter if it's Allscripts, Epic, whatever, the reality is that the older physicians will struggle to learn any new software they have to deal with. If you've ever tried to help your grandma learn how to use a computer you probably have a good idea of what I'm talking about so to use this as a critique is yet again incredibly stupid.\n\n**#5 Claim: Clover health pays doctors money to use Clover Assistant and they pay primary care physicians good money.**\n\nHindenburg tries to spin this as a negative, that doctors are getting paid $200 per patient visit to have them adopt Clover Assistant. Well, in order to improve patient outcomes and thus eventually make more money by having healthier patients the entire business model revolves around having physicians adopt Clover Assistant. Clover also pays primary care physicians more money because investing more money into primary care to prevent health issues down the line is their business model. **Studies show that** [**every $1 extra spent on primary care is going to save $12 down the line**](https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/delivering-value-healthcare-starts-increased-primary-care-investment). This is actually what sets Clover apart from the other health insurance companies, they're going out of their way to pay primary care physicians more, so they can spend more time with each patient, **so they can use the Clover assistant to deliver higher quality care that'll prevent more health problems down the line**. Hindenburg doesn't actually seem to be able to at all understand Clover's Medicare Advantage business model here, which makes me seriously question how they felt they were qualified to analyze Clover at all.\n\n**#6 Claim: Clover's CEO made his previous hospitals a ton of money charging a lot of money.**\n\nI could go into the nuances of how the CEO justified this type of billing as a negotiation tactic with existing insurance companies that had bullied these hospitals into bankruptcy in order to save hospitals that were going to be shut down. But forget that and realize what you have here is a short seller ***spinning the CEO of a healthcare company being incredibly good at making money in healthcare as a negative***. I honestly can't think of a stupider fucking thing for a short seller to say.  Garipalli knows and understands the business of healthcare better than anyone else, and now with Clover he's going to fix how fucked up it is while Clover makes bank.\n\n# Short term price catalysts/Short Squeeze prospects\n\nThis is probably the part that most of you degenerates care about so we probably should go over it. I think Clover health is going to be an incredible long term hold. Chamath thinks it's one of the most obvious 10-baggers he's ever seen and frankly I agree, but let's break down the short term.\n\nShort Interest: Over the last few weeks SI has been 40-50% of the float. I know some people have talked about some institutional shares being misclassified, and the SI being even higher but it's not clear to me that this is the case. Nonetheless, [Ortex is looking into this](https://twitter.com/trades_dutch/status/1406999851313807362) so we'll know for sure what the correct numbers are soon enough. It really doesn't matter that much though, this is extremely highly shorted. When VW underwent their infinity squeeze **the SI was only 12%**, what actually made it squeeze was that all of a sudden the short sellers couldn't cover their position-that matters much more than the exact number the SI% is. 40-50% is honestly a massive number that's more than enough for a huge short squeeze to occur.\n\n**Why did the price just jump?**\n\nNow here's the big thing that makes me think that CLOV is a prime short squeeze target right now. If you read BS financial blog posts a lot of people claim that it's because of WSB reading the SEC filings where the short squeeze is mentioned as a risk, but that's not the reason. Obviously WSB has obviously thought it's a possible squeeze target for a long time so to believe that an SEC filing triggered the price runup is stupid.\n\nThe reason is simply that 6/22 is the day that a ton of shares became unavailable for short sellers to borrow. A ton of call options for CLOV expired ITM on 6/18. How these work is that they get executed after market hours finish and then the people who sold the calls have to settle them in 2 business days. That's known as T+2 settlement, which is the settlement time for options contracts in the US. So any hedge fund that sold naked calls had another 2 business days to provide the shares. Purchases can be done through prime brokerages with T+1 settlement, meaning that the last day a hedge fund or market maker could have scrambled for shares to hand out on 6/22 was Monday 6/21. So they had a lot of incentive to drive the price down and force some liquidity on Monday, which is pretty much what you saw happen. But Tuesday all those shares went to people who executed their ITM call options.\n\nNow if you think about it, why would someone execute an ITM call option instead of just selling it off? It's because those entities want to hold those shares for a longer time frame. So as these shares got assigned off to folks who wanted to just hold these shares with their diamond hands you saw that share borrow availability tank. By 4PM on 6/22 there were ZERO shares available to borrow at IBKR and the borrow fee had jumped to almost 9%.\n\nRegardless, that major change of hands in shares has likely made this one of the weeks where it's going to be harder than every before for short sellers to be able to obtain shares to close out their short position. Even though CLOV has had a very high short squeeze score for a while now [(100/100 at S3)](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404880301428547585?s=19). I think the folks holding shares this week may be more likely than ever before to be the type that refuse to sell to the shorts cheaply.\n\n# Long term value\n\nThis is admittedly hard to pin down because while CLOV doesn't currently generate profits they're an incredibly fast growing company. If they manage to achieve what they're trying to achieve the sky is going to be the limit, because we're talking about profit margins that would put every other insurer to shame while continuing to grow at double digit percentages per year. Plus while their current core business is Medicare Advantage and Medicare they also have an entire other business in the possibility of licensing out Clover Assistant. The EHR business could become another multi-billion dollar business alone. Allscripts is worth $2.5 billion and Epic is worth more but it's privately held.

Over time they've come up with a lot of tools to help more rapidly bridge healthcare databases with each other. Clover is already able to pull data from many hospital systems with various different EHR systems-the good thing is that a lot of this compatibility work has already been done over the last decade so it's not as hard as it would have been 10-15 years back. \n\nMostly it's a matter of reaching out to healthcare systems where they're expanding and negotiating with them for access-generally most healthcare systems wouldn't mind having two way data access with a network of patients like Clover since everyone having access to everyone else's data helps save a lot of time/money for them. In the past I've seen some healthcare systems refuse to participate in data-sharing efforts, but over time most large healthcare systems have become pretty open about sharing data.\n\nSo Clover will be able to interface with EPIC, or Allscripts, or whatever other healthcare systems use, though each expansion/integration will likely require some manpower to build a \"bridge\" that correctly syncs up the data in case they've stored it differently.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Clov's creators are tech guys who went into the medical field.  the one thing I don't worry about, is them having trouble interfacing...", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for the response.

The reason I used to train clinicians on using EHR was that I used to implement EHR systems before I became a physician myself.\n\nBut yes, making sure that the data is what you expect it to be is a big part of being able to leverage that data to improve healthcare with their AI.

You bet some of it is going to be blown on nice vacations. \n\nWe have all witnessed how the recovery plays took off in the past few months leaving tech FD chads who had been winning last year on the breadline. Last week was not so good for these plays but many of them are still not at levels worth buying the dip.  While any recovery stock has been literally free money so far, as the boomers over at CNBC say, tHe eAsY mOnEy hAs bEeN mAdE. It is now time to pick the clear winners of the reopening. The market is bigly underestimating pent up leisure demand.\n\nPlaya Hotels & Resorts is a luxury all-inclusive oceanfront resort chain with hotels and properties in Mexico, Dominican Republic and Jamaica. They are very well run and raking in money. They are perfectly positioned to take full advantage of the deluge of tourists who will be coming in waves.\n\n[\\*insert obligatory wife's boyfriend joke\\*](https://preview.redd.it/yxcf3dr0ct671.jpg?width=510&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2be91356644726d4114149a8b54480cf127bc533)\n\n# The setup:\n\nThe market is pricing $PLYA as if things will be just be going back to normal by next Jan, which is usually peak demand season for their beach resorts. However, they are going to absolutely crush the numbers from previous years as their business is picking up steam rapidly. Their average room rate is already exploding and they could be operating at peak demand from July which is unprecedented. Their June and July rates have also surpassed December recently based on data from booking.com, hotels.com etc. \n\nHere are some stunning trends:\n\n[It's June and the search interest is spiking; every other peak was in Jan in prior years.](https://preview.redd.it/l10irfjs8z671.jpg?width=903&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bf74164723873c579413100a4046555a03b76c8)\n\n[US Google search volume for beach resort is 25&#37; higher than pre-pandemic levels.](https://preview.redd.it/53kbt8ez8z671.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3608bbfa6ea96bde2ded380574fdf334b7b075f)\n\n[ YouTube search interest for “beach resort”  spiking bigly.](https://preview.redd.it/ubg35ovgxz671.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=59b04a6343f81cda3d072f1564f6b3887bcb4449)\n\n[Worldwide search interest is recovering, should give another boost to $PLYA.](https://preview.redd.it/co4hfxc4yz671.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e1dd47dec6bbd2fe0a518583e52145b561377c)\n\nTheir hotels also have some of the best reviews and ratings for a luxury resort chain in Tripadvisor, bookings.com, hotels.com etc.  They don't have properties in business locations so the uncertainty about the return of business demand does not affect them. Flight trend data (from kayak.com) also points to an increase in traffic to the locations where $PLYA has resorts.\n\nAll this without significant traffic from Europe, Canada and Asia. They have been slower to reopen compared to the US, but when they inevitably do, expect the demand to skyrocket even higher.\n\nUnlike many recovery plays, they have pricing power. And they are going to absolutely milk this opportunity by charging top dollar. Here is what the CEO had to say about it in the last last earnings call before this crazy spike in demand. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f19jeep6vy671.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e94839cee17f93b1b4d7d818084cf92b25f354a\n\nThat is a nice way of saying that they will be adopting a \"fuck you pay me\" approach to doing business when demand booms.  So they were anticipating this and planning accordingly. So far, it looks like they are going to have a  blowout quarter.\n\n# Financials:\n\nNot that y'all care, but they have a healthy balance sheet. They raised cash back in Jan with an underwritten public offering of shares. Cash and cash equivalents are up and debt and liabilities are down compared to the previous quarter so there is little chance of further dilution now that their resorts are starting to get packed again. \n\n[Source: Playa Hotels & Resorts N.V.

First Quarter 2021 Results](https://preview.redd.it/yof56qcyet671.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=68b2448d114e94d95dcb56bb7e7d12c3da66c9f9)\n\n# Analyst ratings:\n\nThe average Wall Street PT sits at $7.25, totally oblivious to what is happening. But the big boys have started to take notice. Deutsche Bank has upgraded the PT from $8.00 to $10.00. Even Bank of America, which which used to have a $1.5 PT on our beloved gamestonk has initiated coverage recently with a PT of $10.00. \n\n# Technicals: \n\nI passed PLYA through u/pennyether's tried and tested SMELL system.  \n\n* **Short Interest:** SI is currently estimated to be 7.03M shares by MarketWatch, which is about 5.5% of the float. Even though it is low (which is good news fundamentally ya apes), this is a very illiquid stock with an average volume of 1.29M shares and 5.34 days to cover. So shorts covering quickly due to the market waking up to the potential should give a nice boost to the SP.\n* **Market Cap:** Market Cap is $1.23bn.\n* **Extremely Memeable:** Memeable? Idk, I really like how the ticker sounds.\n* **Low Liquidity:** Average volume is just 1.29M shares ($9.38M), or 0.7% of market cap. Institutional ownership is high and sits at 75.74% which makes it even more illiquid.\n* **Low IV:** IV is currently at 51.64%, with the IV Percentile at 10% and an IV rank of 4.46%. So the IV currently is nearly as low as it gets for $PLYA. I have seen that many of you regularly make generous recurring weekly donations to our favorite market maker Citadel by buying overpriced FDs with IV above 200%, so here is a chance to not do that.\n\nI don't play with crayons, but $PLYA briefly dipped to the 100-day SMA last week with JPow tanking the market and the general drubbing of the recovery plays. Expecting this short term dip to be eaten up very quickly.\n\nAlso, I am just another tard and did not come up with the trade. I shamelessly copied most of the stuff from the amazing research done by Chris Camillo (The incredibly successful social arb trader in Jack Schwager’s Unknown Market Wizards.) and friends who specifically hunt for opportunities like this. This trade has gone under the radar so far, though I suspect it shall not remain so for long.\n\n# Bear case:\n\nThe only bear case I can think of is another COVID surge which could potentially drive down demand, but the chances of that happening in the short term is small enough to neglect imo. Even then they are less likely to be affected compared to other hotel chains as they don't have any business locations.  \n\n\n# TLDR:\n\nPeople are flush with cash and the pent up demand for leisure is exploding. $PLYA is perfectly  positioned to take advantage of this with their amazing all-inclusive beach resorts and the market has failed to appreciate it so far. Technicals and fundamentals point to a good entry now.\n\n# Positions:\n\nCommons are safe, but I am allergic to commons and playing options only. \n\n* Jul: $7.5C - Betting on the market realizing that Playa is going to absolutely crush it this quarter and capture the pre earning run-up.\n* Aug, Sep: $7.5C - Safer calls that expire post earnings.\n* Sep:$10C - A tiny handful of lottos for dIvErSiFiCaTiOn.\n* Nov: $10C- I expect the market to fairly value Playa by then.", "id": "o6dyij", "created_utc": 1624458626.0, "score": 800, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 220, "comments": [{"body": "Looks pretty good. \n\n\nHot girl pic in DD = I’m in", "score": 185, "replies": [{"body": "[Here's some DD on how to succeed with brunettes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC5NcQjDj-Y)", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Most informational video I’ve seen on this sub.

{"title": "A friendly reminder that UWMC Russell Index inclusion is on Monday, June 28", "selftext": "Hello again. It's your boy Silbergleit Junior. Sipping champagne as usual as I read about you losing millions of dollars every week.\n\n**Who am I?**\n\nDo you remember me? I'm the guy who [broke the news](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m911ba/uwmc_is_not_on_the_final_russell_index_inclusion/) to you back in March that UWMC will not be included in the Russell 1000 index. I'm also the guy who [told you back in May](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7ahq5/uwmc_dont_be_fooled_my_friends/) that Wall Street is playing games with you and trying to convince you that UWMC is going to $0.\n\n[Told you on May 7th, markets are bluffing on UWMC](https://preview.redd.it/5fnnfg9su1771.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=283ff75375546cb5905310cd25fc883d006910b5)\n\n**Why am I here?**\n\nThis time I'm here to tell you that UWMC will get added to Russell index on Friday, June 25 after market hours. It's for sure this time. It has been confirmed. They made it to final list. No fooling around this time.\n\n**What does this mean?**\n\nThis means there will be a significant demand for UWMC stock, [starting Monday, June 28](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1407323737150693382?s=20). Every index fund manager, tracking Russell 1000, will need to buy UWMC shares. No questions asked. This is going to be a one-time jump in the price until each index fund gets the correct amount of shares.\n\n**Why don't index funds buy the stock right now?**\n\nCause they can't. Rules are rules. Each index announces its changes in advance, but index funds cannot acquire the new company until the effective date of change.\n\n**History tells**\n\nRemember TSLA being added to SP500 on Dec 21, 2020? Remember what happened after inclusion? It had a 35% run up over the next month.\n\nRemember YHOO being added to SP500 on Nov 30, 1999?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z3eig3kos1771.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b35ba777674ce82b88ca970215312ea819d1175\n\n**Calm before the storm**\n\nMy gut feeling is telling me we are in the calm before the storm. The stock price has been pretty quiet. Many of you losers lost interest. Implied volatility is almost at the 6 months bottom, but you don't care about that because you are waiting to start buying calls when IV shoots through 100%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fnh0ymqqs1771.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bbf16654551e13f14567fa9705b2d336a40fa73\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* UWMC is being added to Russell 1000 on Friday, June 25, after market hours\n* Index funds will need to buy UWMC\n* Stocks tend to go up following index inclusion\n* IV is low *(gambling tickets are not overpriced)*\n\n**Position**\n\n* 5000 shares\n* \\-10 Jul P $8\n* \\-10 Aug P $9\n* \\-10 Nov P $8\n* \\-10 Dec P $8\n* \\+10 Jul C $9\n\n*Disclaimer: I'm not an expert.

The issue here is if WSB wants to moon a stock UWMC is primed to do it. Russell inclusion is just part of it. It means institutions will buy up more of the float that won’t be sold, thus reducing available shares. Institutions currently own ~20M shares and from the projections I’ve seen Russell inclusion should be another ~3M shares. There are approximately 15-17M shares short and only ~80M shares available to trade. \n\nWith all of that being said, there is literally 0 downside to buying shares right now.

Now, I don't know how many of those there are or what their holding volume look like compared to the main index, but from the Russell 1000 addition you can expect around 1 million shares to be purchased. \n\nYou can also expect Friday to be a high volume day. Looking at one of UWMC's recent high volume trading days, on June 9th 25.5M shares were traded. So the Russell's purchase would have made up ~4% of that day's trading volume.

{"title": "Palantir. The Solution to the Problems that didn't exist (Yet)", "selftext": "Palantir. Love it. Hate it. You will never stop hearing about it. And here's why.\n\nPalantir was created for a world that didn't exist yet. A world where information and data would become so large no human workforce could ever be able to manage it effectively let alone, extrapolate insight from. So what's data do? It either sits there, or becomes a parasite on you for companies like google and facebook to target your dollars in the form of user specific ads. This way of utilizing data is indeed parasitic, and Palantir rejects this use of data in everyway possible.\n\nBut what if data wasn't used to fuck over your own customers, but instead used to help save them money and resources. Perhaps their lives? Restore supply chains, accelerate cancer research, and help restore the world to (somewhat) normalcy post pandemic. The sophisticated tools required to manage this type of data would have been inconceivable. No one predicated this kind of disjunction. Well. maybe some, but no company that would sacrifice half their revenue in R & D to solve problems of this magnitude they may or may not come to fruition. No one. Except 1 company. Valued at less than 1 billion back in 2010, then up to 9 billion in 2013 and 20 billion in 2015. And as high as 41 billion right before becoming public. Palantir 40x in 10 years is impressive, but its total addressable market would suggest a runaway so large and growing so fast that those returns are far from over. \n\nHow big is this market? Well. Looking at the S-1 Filings it's estimated to be 119 billion. This is broken down into 63 billion in government and 56 billion in commercial. This is less than a fucking percent. How fast is it expanding? Well the S-1 is old news in my opinion of the \"macrotrend\" that Alex Karp says is happening.  \n\nThis comes from COO Shyam Sankar himself...\n\n \"And -- and with our investments in the end-to-end, sensor-to-shooter workflows from space to mud, we're not just going after the roughly $60 billion of government IT spend anymore, we're talking about the quarter-trillion dollars of U.S. DOD weapons system spend in 2020.\"\n\nThis is fucking huge. And is completely overfucking looked. Everyone is still looking at the S1 filings about PLTR's TAM and its just wrong, it's so far much more now. This is why perhaps that government revenue is actually picking up at a more rapid pace despite it being their main customer base to this date. Government revenue grew at 68% YoY in Q3 2020 and in Q1 2021 it was 72 percent (With US revenue at 83%).\n\nAll-in-all I believe that a price to sales ratio of 40 is completely justified. This TAM is most definitely expanding into the commercial space as well. As IBM pointed out, 90% of all data has been generated in the last 2 years alone. This means that the data is growing faster then people can analyze it. This is where software like Palantir will be crucial in the future. What we're seeing with covid is all but just 1 example of how Palantir has been preparing for a future of disjunction. Palantir's investments only exacerbates  the obviousness of the problem the large amounts of disperse data creates. They're putting their money where their mouth is by not only putting half of their revenue into R&D  (561 Million, up 100% from 2018)  but taking whatever's left over into data-intensive business startups that utilize Palantir software. These actions of SPAC investments are probably more or less on Peter Thiel's part considering he's created the Founder's Fund and has a track record of picking innovative companies. This doesn't suggest that Palantir is slowing down and that Palantir simply doesn't know where to put their money, but they're more or less trying to plant seeds in industries and sectors that they are wanting to penetrate. Not only could they see significant returns that startups that succeed bring about, but also an increase in reputation and a testament of Palantir's usefulness in that sector. They want to make examples like BP saving 50 million in the first 2 weeks to potentially a billion a year off using Palantir's software become the Rule and not the Exception to the Rule. Palantir's usefulness is not 'niche' but can be applied across any sector.\n\nI don't want to consider this DD as I barely did any research that I'm sure most of you guys didn't already know. My main point here is the counter argument to Palantir's valuation. And the skepticism surrounding its potential slow down in the future. In my opinion, Palantir and their competitors aren't growing as fast as the TAM and that's why I don't expect to see revenue both on commercial or government to grow slower than 45% in a couple years when the entire commercial sector will start to generate so much data that they'll have to switch to something new then their own built in piece by piece enterprise software that simply just doesn't work. This is the reoccurring problem Palantir has on it's sales side. It's not other software enterprise companies that they mainly compete with, but their own customers that try to build their own systems.  If they can get this much revenue from less than 200 customers (not to mention that the top 20 customers continue to pay 30%+ more for their subscriptions on a YoY basis) then any fear of a slowdown should not be on your mind when deciding whether or not to purchase Palantir stock. \n\nMy main concern for Palantir is ironically how much cash it has. I say ironic because Peter Thiel ripped in Googles cash hoard saying they aren't innovative enough to know how to use their 50 billion cash hoard. Now Palantir only has 2.3 billion cash but there market cap is much smaller than Googles back in 2012 when their massive cash hoard was addressed. (50 billion Vs Googles 270 billion). Now this cash hoard isn't nearly as severe and a drag as google's through the forces of inflation but it does pose some headwind if they cannot utilize it in innovative ways. Now Palantir has invested in 4 additional SPACs that I'm aware of since their ER (Perhaps 5, Idk if the \"partnership\" with Primer includes a PIPE investment) and perhaps we may actually see a decrease next quarter on their cash on hand which I'm not opposed to, as long as its being reinvested in some way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Palantir may be a multibillion dollar company but the the billions of dollars spent on R&D are just now beginning to pay off as the macrotrends are beginning to point closer and closer to companies like Palantir to be the next solution to the next problems that will plague the world in the not too distant future.\n\nPositions 4882 shares @ $24.01 cost basis", "id": "o6j1k9", "created_utc": 1624473364.0, "score": 344, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 108, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|54|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Too much words without 🚀 and 🌕.

Inflation is actually good for markets but high inflation that causes the federal reserve to raise interest rates is the concern.

It’s not a big factor when it comes to inflation and at the current levels it has room to grow before it outweighs the benefits of debt-leveraged investment. I’m not a big advocate of wasteful government spending (don’t want to get too political in here, but I don’t like the proposed bills), but it can’t be said on a blanket approach that more government spending = bad debt = inflation.  \n\nFor the interest rates, I don’t think it’s a reactionary approach, but rather a normal shift due to their protective approach against Covid. They lowered rates during Covid in order to ease up the money supply to provide more liquidity to survive the lockdowns. They will gradually raise them back to normal levels, not due to inflation, but due to the lack of the need of excess liquidity as the economy is back in full swing. The markets will freak out for sure, because they love to overreact, but in my opinion it’s more of a sign of a successful Covid survival plan rather than a reactionary move against inflation.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "True. If you’re long on the market none of this matters to you because the market will eventually surpass every high. However, in reality, most people on here are not. Without naming names I would be less concerned if there weren’t stocks out there that can dramatically move the market if there was a sell off because it’s not based on any core fundamentals. Coupled with the fact that there are a lot of new investors that will panic sell as things are going down causing the dip to be bigger. Hedge funds and smart money can shift their portfolio to other emerging markets if they feel that the US market is too much of a risk and they have been saying they’re starting to do this.

Raising tariffs is always a poor economic choice because it introduces extrinsic negative pressure on supply and demand to artificially drive down supply (which will add to price increases). Minimum wage increases add extra costs to goods which inflates the prices leading to lower demand. All of these scenarios cause inflated prices, which in a normal economic setting would have nominal impacts, but they are only exacerbated due to the current prices already being inflated. In my opinion, since the current price inflation is only due to temporary circumstances, these extra negative economic policies will only extend the timeframe of prices moving back down by a bit, and not stop the deflation altogether. Prices will still go back down, high inflation will still not be seen, and these policies only add an extra bump in the road.
