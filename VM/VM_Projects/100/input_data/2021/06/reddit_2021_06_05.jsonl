How an actual global legislation or agreement on taxation would look like or be enforced is all to be seen. Until you see the paper, this is just an empty promise to a room full of journalist. \n\nSecondly, even the principle (15% minimum corporate tax rate globally) is meaningless, because all the 7 countries have already higher tax rate. What they would need to do is close tax loops that allow corporates to LEGALLY move profits abroad. For this they don’t need any globs treaty, they can just change their local tax codes. \n\nFinally, tax ‘competition’ is encouraged in the European Union (which many of these countries belong to) and in general globally. \n\nLet’s start with Europe. Inside the EU Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and to some extent Greece (on ship taxation) all use lower corporate taxation to their benefit at the expense of larger EU states. Geographicaly inside the EU, Switzerland also does. The EU is a dead project that is reluctant of any change since 20+ years. These countries all have vast power inside EU insitutions and have used it consinstely to make sure legislation is not changed in regard of ‘tax competition’ between EU members. In plain terms, EU members couldn’t even agree on a common travel policy in times of covid (with good riddance to the principles of Schenghen and weaponization of COVID issues against Britain in times of brexit), do you think they will ever agree to have a minimum corporate tax? \n\nOutside the EU, the USA already has one of the lowest tax rates for a developed country.  Of course Biden now signs these ‘agreements’ and promises change, but believe me the USA have very little to earn or lose from different corporate tax when they only represent something like 6% of total tax revenues as of 2020. Add that they are only talking about making the minimum 15%... which is below what they already have. Nothing would really change for them. \n\nWhat actually matters is to close tax loops that allow companies to not pay taxes in the countries where they register profit. To do so, the US does not need any global agreement and neither does Europe. They should just change their respective tax codes ...which they won’t do. \n\nReminds me of some news a few months ago when banks and big corporations in the USA signed some sort of agreement saying that from there on they would consider their impact on the environment and not only return to shareholders.

Check out the made in America tax plan that was detailed in April and check out Treasury’s “Green Book” that was released the Friday before Memorial Day. They discuss this mechanism in detail. They just say “if a global rate is agreed upon, we will follow, but until that, min rate is 21%.” I literally did a presentation on this last week at a conference. Yes, that means I’ve spent the better part of last week learning this stuff. So yeah, although an agreement in principle is nothing in that sense, we already have our own proposals out. \n\nSo those 7 aren’t concerned about lowering their rates. It’s about a one stop way to ensure that companies based in those jurisdictions aren’t effectively eroding their tax base. \n\nThe dynamic changes because you will have to move some of your cost centers from certain low tax jurisdictions. Note - because the way this is drafted, it effectively only hurts non US parented companies. \n\nSo transfer pricing principles are always there. This won’t change that. My transfer pricing study may tell me that I should allocate 30% of revenue to cayman. So I will - but I may not get the requisite deduction that I had planned into because cayman doesn’t meet the min rate. Does that make sense? (Plus, transfer pricing and profit allocation (nexus) is addressed in the Pillar One proposals.

This said, yours is still pure speculation and only concerns the USA - which, back to the point on my first comment, do not need any -global- tax agreement to have companies pay more taxes. They can simply enforce it unilaterally.\n\nOn the other hand, how a global agreement would even be enforced is all to be seen. We are talking about sovereign states that have no interest to accept an agreement and in most cases are well respected on the international scene (not the Cayman Islands). \n\nIn your example, even the Cayman Islands could nominally raise their tax rate to 15%, but then find ways to make companies pay way less. Similarly to how Ireland did with Apple in the 1990s, when the official corporate tax rate was 15% or something like that, but Apple ended up paying 2%. Or how Luxembourg does today, or how Cantons in Switzerland do as well. \n\nUltimately, a sovereign country can always force companies to pay more taxes. How it’s just a matter of tax codes and legalese. For a country like the US, which is the first or second economy in the world depending who you ask, this is an easy task. You pay how much the IRS wants or you don’t do business in the US. Why this doesn’t happen today all boils down to political will and lobbying. \nFor a country like Italy or France, there is a point at which international companies would rather decide not to operate at all in the country rather than paying too much to do so. This is why in Europe what it’s needed is European coordination on tax matters - unlikely to happen. \n\nIn China international companies do not ‘optimize’ taxes with subsidiaries. Why? Because it’s a dictatorship and if you don’t pay how much the regime deems proper they kick you out of their market and put you in jail. \n\nSo, again, corporate tax avoidance issues can be solved unilaterally by countries or block of countries without the need of any global tax agreement.

Just remember, current proposals have a clause saying “to the extent a global rate is agreed on, we will lower our threshold.” \n\nEnforcing it unilaterally is tough. Keep in mind that the principle being followed here is to capture under taxed income. That framework/proposal really is based on a global min rate. But I understand you are saying that the Us could just say “f it, we are just going to disallow everything and force you to pay more here.” Realistically, that’s a tough sell. And there’s more bite to this proposal if all parties agree. We’ve seen that most recently with mandatory disclosure rules in Europe as well as anti-hybrid legislation as well (with various degrees of complexity amongst jurisdictions). \n\nOk so one technical correction. The proposals talk about an effective tax rate, NOT a nominal tax rate. It basically tells you to look at “total taxes paid” in computing your effective rate. So you can’t do the “oh the stated rate is 15%, we good here.” You are right about how nominal and effective rates are very different - and this is clearly addressed. \n\nIf you think people aren’t doing tax planning in China….\n\nThere is a surprising amount of support behind these proposals - and these aren’t new.

Same goes the other way, when selling, SOMEONE is offering the stock at that price.\n\nSo when someone says, there is no way, it's not going up OR down, statements to that effect, know that THEY have zero idea about what they are saying.\n\nThe price is THE price for a reason.\n\nUnless someone like Carson Block (insert any short seller, with a staff of 200 investigating, and uncovering fraud) or the odd CEO or  company official (insert, insider info)  who  knows something is present, 99.99999999999 percent of the people on Earth have ZERO idea where the stock will trade tommorow or a year from now, or any time period in between.\n\nThe only thing that actually works, is actually IV, it is the best reserarch on the planet giving you their prediction in unsion as to the expected \"move\" in the market. The IV will always be a tad bit, or quite a bit higher,  almost always, to include the \"volatility risk premium\" of the writer. So if a $100 stock has an IV of 25 %, then we can be almost certain, it will move a little less then 1.3 (call it 1.15 to 1.2  pts) between today or tomorrow, UP or DOWN, 68 percent of the time. And 2.3 to 2.5 pts, 95 percent of the time. That's it.\n\nIt doesn't matrer if it's a meme stock, or APPL, the edge is to the writers period, and it's computed to the best of the computing knowledge in the world.\n\nAll the fundamental due diligence will get you NO CLOSER then that. That's like saying you have uncovered something, NOONE knows in the UNIVERSE knows. It's hubris to the enneth degree.\n\nIV, is in of itself, the best and only forward indicator that you can use to structure your moves. \n\nIt took me fourteen years to internalize the above, the sooner you do it, the better it is. Just like price, there are no high IV or low IV stocks or other underlyings, the IV is what it is, it's what the collective knowledge on Earth, forecasts at that very moment.\n\nLearn to make a robust plan around that, and adjust the strategy when needed (exiting is an adjustment, but they are tons of others), manage risk, manage correlation and stay on your toes, trading is hard, but spend your time, doing something that works. Not scouring Dd's (due diligence, Lol) done by a normal poster or a financial genius, NOONE fucking knows.\n\nYour job will become easier, exponentially, it will still require hard work, but it will be fruitful hard work\n\n\nP.s. there are ways you can gain an edge with price action analysis by understanding where the orders lie (order flow, vol profile, double pressure), very selectively but that also takes hard work and TIME, and don't even attempt that, until you internalize the above. \nBecause, the IV models assume a continuous market that is also always \"normally\" distributed, of which neither is true, \"all the time\", so opportunities present themselves selectively from time to time. But leave that be for the advanced years.\n\nJust get it through your head, that don't ask anyone or follow anyone's opinion on where they think the fair price should be. They almost ALWAYS  have no better idea then you. Almost Always to the 10 th order of magnitude.\n\nThe price is the price for a reason and in options, the sellers edge is built in, period. Just trade that basic information, diligently. And ask NOONE. You will make it.\n\nEdit: when selling options on low IV stocks, the complaint is low premium received. Well, just sell more contracts, if your risk management is robust, the risk does NOT increase BECAUSE of that very low IV.

Curiousity is your friend, when it comes to learning anything.\n\nYes I do. Plenty. But you are going to have to read. Really read, and then comprehend and practice. I have been on this forum for just a minute,  so im not sure, but mostly around the net, people want a quick link or a youtube video, that basically is not going to teach you much more then the basics. There is no such resource available, except an odd needle in the haystack, once in a while. \n\nGo to the BOOKS, since Options is a quantitative endeavour by nature, it has plenty of good literature available for very cheap out there, unlike trading in general.\n\nI would recommend you start with Jeff Augen's day trading options. A short 186 page book. He will simply explain what constitutes a three dimensional volatility surface and will describe a couple of  very simple systems, where you can set up a very simple library of surfaces on Excel which will help you spot mispricings visually.  \n\nAlso how to collect spike data for close to close, close to open, and open to close to show you how sometimes most of the movement is happening in the open to close itself, and you can capture a lot of that movement in the DAY itself and close the position before Close. Thus avoiding the bane of most option buyers, theta decay, or most of it (the main cornerstone of our friends here). We are talking long straddles  and strangles there.\n\nLike this you can start simply, like we all did in options, going long, but just for the day, not overnight, and get an introduction to solidly extracting an edge from the market. By GOING LONG. \nDon't believe what every one says, neither 99 percent nor 70 percent of all options expire worthless. If you just put some simple thought behind that, you will see WHY?  If you don't get it, ask me.\n\nThen you can move onto quite a few other resources which includes extracting the volatility of an option by going delta neutral before earnings, and move onto advanced works by Euan Sinclair etc. You will find what to do, trust me. Other wise you can come back here.\n\nStart with that book.\n\nAnd a couple of tips,\n\n1) Learn that it's going to take hard work, but it's not rocket science or general relativity. With basic mathematics, you can conquer it, but you will have to read and work.\n\n2) Try to do what others shun or are not doing. Following the majority is a sure route to failure. Do you see why?\n\nThe second tip above applies to not only trading, but life in general.

{"title": "I analyzed all the controversial trades made by Senators in the 2020 Congressional insider trading scandal. Here are the results!", "selftext": "**Preamble:** The ability of Congress Members to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. There have been multiple stories covering the 2020 congressional [insider trading scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) where Congress Members allegedly used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash. But none of the articles talked about the financial implications of those trades and whether the retail investors could have front-run the market using the disclosed data.  Basically, what I wanted to know was\n\n**How much did the Senators save by offloading their positions before the crash and could I have done the same?**\n\n**Where is the data from**: efdsearch.senate.gov\n\nFor my [previous analysis into congressional trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n958n7/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/), I used data from senatestockwatcher.com. But not all the transactions are captured on the website and I wanted to match exactly with the trades reported by famous journals. efdsearch.senate.gov is the United States official website where Senator, former Senator, and candidate financial disclosure reports are available. Some of the data is available as a scanned file and some in normal HTML format. I had to manually transcribe most of the data used in this analysis.\n\nIn case you are wondering about the time delay between the actual transaction and reporting, Congress Members are expected to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/). The median delay in reporting that I observed for all the trades was 28 days.\n\nAll the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThere are multiple factors at play here.\n\nTimeline: On January 24, 2020, the Senate Committees on Health and Foreign Relations held a closed meeting with only Senators present to brief them about the COVID-19 outbreak and how it would affect the United States. I am considering this as the start time for my analysis. Any sale made by the senators after this point up to Feb 26 is considered. (I did not consider sales beyond that point as SPY dropped 8% during that week. My assumption here is it’s realistic for any person be it a normal investor or a Senator to panic sell after seeing that drop). For reference, SPY dropped an additional 25% over the next 3 weeks!  \n\nSenators under consideration: I have considered trades done by 4 senators in my analysis. I have focused on these 4 as all of them were investigated by [Justice Department and the FBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) following the trading scandal.\n\n1. Richard Burr\n2. Kelly Loeffler\n3. James M Inhofe\n4. David A Perdue\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owzxgiv17g371.png?width=751&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbb5ec251a813bfcaf6d954b3992263b167ebdbd\n\nDavid Perdue sold 44 times ($3.49 MM) in the 33 days following the closed senate meeting. Interestingly James Inhofe only transacted 8 times but the combined value of shares he sold was a whopping $4.12MM. The most ironic part is that Richard Burr who was under investigation the longest and had to step down from the intelligence committee due to the scandal had the least dollar volume in the transaction ($1.1MM).\n\n**Results:**\n\nBefore we dive into the overall amount saved by the Senators and the retail investor side of the analysis, let’s see what were the best trades made by the Senators during that time period.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zzkp2rh37g371.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=02669d67934a2bc1e4b0dc54f5a4ff97860c8b0e\n\n David Perdue absolutely killed it with his stock plays. He is present 7 times in the top 10 list and his best play, Caesars Entertainment reduced 83% after he sold his position. Fun Fact: if a stock reduces 83%, it has to go up 488% just to reach back to its initial price. Another interesting observation from the chart is that senators mainly sold stocks related to the entertainment and hospitality industries which were the most severely affected industries due to the pandemic. \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/vzd0kq757g371.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec18cc544fefb81597f8929af51b299cf36edc65)\n\nThe above chart showcases the amount of money saved by the Senators due to front running the market crash. David Perdue saved an insane $2.2MM with his stock sales. I also kept a multiple of annual Senate salary to showcase the scale of impact they made to their portfolio because of the trades.\n\nFinally, we come to the million-dollar question. **Was it possible for the retail investors to follow these trades and front-run the crash?**\n\nThis is where the analysis gets a bit tricky. 88% of the transactions were reported by March 3rd but if you consider it in dollar values, only 52% of the transactions were reported (some of the high-value transactions were reported only after the crash). But if you were an astute investor, you could have observed a stark difference in what the Senators were saying and how they were trading. For Eg. [Richard Burr reassured the public that the US was well prepared](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/5/14/21258560/senator-richard-burr-coronavirus-insider-trading-scandal-explained) for the pandemic but then sold $1MM worth of stocks in the next two weeks. I know that hindsight is 20/20 but if you could have connected these two dots, then you could have saved up to **25% of your portfolio** before the crash.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** There are some limitations to the analysis.\n\na. I have only used one black swan event for the analysis. A better method would be to analyze the stock trading pattern over 3-4 major crashes and see if any pattern emerges. But the current limitation is that efdsearch.senate.gov has only data since 2012.\n\nb. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress Members. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the transaction amount, I have taken the average of the given range.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I did not want our political views clouding our financial judgment. I could not find a single example where a retail investor or an institutional investor or even a hedge fund leveraging this information to make their trades (it might just not be public!). Another possible explanation here is that Senators might just have superior stock trading capability as [none of them were indicted for this and all investigations are closed now](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/richard-burr-stock-trades-investigation.html).\n\nHowever you view it, this analysis in addition to my [last analysis (which proves that Congress Members have better returns than SP500)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/nsvk50/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) showcases that there is significant money to be made by following their trades closely!\n\n**Google Sheet containing all the data**: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DmIpEkMrEWix30whYWkHg_mGypVBMQxYnx_sQYXkwz4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.*", "id": "nsvma5", "created_utc": 1622899296.0, "score": 22554, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 1143, "comments": [{"body": "My next analayis is on IPOs.

Slowly grows at 5-10% every year.\n\nThe second one is another retirement account that is moderately aggressive that I do maintain.  I will tweak it as needed and will jump in riskier plays that I deem still safe.  Growing about 10-20% each year.\n\nThe third is my primary investment account/day trade account.  This is highly aggressive, gambling, option, meme play account.  I am in this all the time and this is my best performing account, lol right now.  Made huge life changing money on GME and AMC recently.  Up 8,900%.  I was a combination of lucky and smart, more on the lucky.\n\nEven in my aggressive account, I have rules.  For example, I invested in AMC back in December when it was $2/share, going bankrupt and way before this meme craze.  Bought a ton of leaps (Jan 2023) and 5k shares.  My rule was I was anticipating a rise up to $20 within 2 years once covid was gone.  When the price started recently rising due to the meme craze, I exited most at $20 (my goal target) and took profit.  I realized that it kept running and bought back in at $30 for that massive gain last week up to $70.  These gains don't usually go multiple days, so I exited that same day at $65 and took profit.  No way I was going to let this sit over the Memorial Day weekend.  Could it run more, yes.  If it does and has huge momentum, I may buy back in.  Right now, I am fairly confident that investor base is getting tired and I plan on making money on the way down.  Bought a bunch of December 21 puts.  I didn't think twice about buying $20k on Puts because I made $250k on the way up.\n\nShort answer is set rules and don't be too greedy.  Most important, is get lucky, LOL.

Talked with the crew and they kept saying numbers were way up and people were spending stimulus  checks.  I figured they would blow their numbers out of the water.  So I bought a bunch of shares and calls.  Sure enough it went from $20 to $60 now with a quick pop to $30 the quarter after stimulus.  \n\nSimilar to AMC.  I love movies.  Used to go every weekend with the family.  As soon as AMC was open, started to see that people didn't care that COVID was around and that they were still seeing old movies.  Figured with the backlog of hits and pent up demand, it would blow numbers away when restrictions were lifted.  So I gambled on that when they were on the verge of bankruptcy.  I also think the bankruptcy wasn't as bad as it seemed.  AMC still acquired theaters during covid.  They acquired two near me that were competitors.

In fact the vast majority of deals are fairly boring, companies generally don’t like the idea of leaving cash on the table in issuing shares at $20 and the first trade is $50, they left $30/share on the table theoretically. The unicorn tech darlings that you see skyrocket and the companies don’t care, because for them the IPO isn’t really to raise more capital, it’s just the next step in their growth for a number of reasons, is not the norm. \n\nIf the bookrunners do their job correctly they should have an slightly oversubscribed order book on the open at a price the company is satisfied with that investors will except, as demand from the order book isn’t fully met with the ipo allocations these people obviously have to go into the open markets to purchase the remaining shares they need to establish their desired positions, thus making the stock go up some. Part of the allocation process is the bookrunners making sure they aren’t giving too much of the deal to people who are just looking to sell as soon as they can mark a profit, specifically with the large institutions they want long term holders who will support the stock in the open markets by purchasing on weakness. Obviously a large fund isn’t going to sign some agreement stating they will always buy the stock when it drops, so again this is where the bookrunners make their fee in building a good order book. Have to give the right people enough of an allocation so it’s worth their while, but not too much that they never go in and buy more especially on down days. \n\nThere’s also the trend that now days companies aren’t as reliant on the raise of funds from the IPO, as I mentioned earlier. Usually the strategy is a smaller ipo in terms of the actual number of shares sold, with the hope that it has a good 3-6 months of appreciation in the markets and is at a significantly higher price when the company does a much larger dilutive follow-on offering for a larger amount of cash that’s much more important to its actual strategic growth plans. IPOs are very expensive IBD fee wise and very time consuming, every roadshow trip with the C-suite is time they aren’t actually doing work growing the company. If you’ve ever been at a company in the process of going public it might seem like things kind of come to a halt until it’s all completed. Large follow-on offerings (also seeing a big uptick in bought deals which are even cheaper from an underwriting concession standpoint) have fractions of the fees and time commitments that the IPO does, even if they have to price it at a deep discount to the prior days closing price, it still is likely much higher than where the IPO priced at and there will likely be more appetite for shares at this point than during the IPO for a variety of reasons. \n\nThe numebr of people in IPOs that actually sell them right at the open for a profit is a relatively small afterthought on most order books if it’s a big enough name where the bulk of shares are going to your fund shops like blackrock, fideltiy, capital group, Schwab, PIMCO, Invesco, Vangaurd, etc. the only reason smaller retail investors or small institutional players like family offices or hedge funds get an allocation is as a “thank you” so to speak for participation of less attractive deals that will likely be down or flat best case and take some time to unwind. Hedge fund A puts an indication for $10 million worth of some small REIT or boring mid-cap industrial stocks follow on knowing full well they will likely trade below the re-offer price they paid, but they do it because they get taken care of when your hot IPOs come around.

{"title": "Wendys stock, undervalued, quarterly dividend, dividend growth, capital appreciation, international expansion. Stop asking \"When Lambo?\" and get yourself a 🚀$WEN🚀 Lambo", "selftext": "I was inspired to look into Wendy's stock ($WEN) a few days ago after seeing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrqxsv/wendys_lot_of_people_getting_jacked_behind_the/) post on this sub.Here is a short list of why I think this is a good buy.\n\n* Q1 earnings showed the beginning of their recovery from pandemic woes.\n* Same store sales up 13%\n* Q1 85% of dining rooms were open, Q2 should be close to 100% open.\n* Q2 2020 was the hardest hit by the pandemic, Q2 2021 should be the time where recovery becomes growth, smashing yoy numbers.\n* Big breakfast push, breakfast was about 3% of same store sales increase in a limited market. Target EOY is 10%.\n* New and international expansion\n* Consensus estimate price is around $27, its already at a discount\n* $150M loaded up and ready for buy backs.\n* Quarterly dividends have already recovered from pandemic slashing and should continue to grow.\n* Very low volume right now. (Avg 3M shares/day)\n* Scarcity: Float of 220M, Insiders own 21%, institutions own 73%. Only 6% or 13M shares available to retail, which sounds bad until you consider the next bullet point.\n* Most memed company on the internet if it gains traction then, frenzy+scarcity+low volume means minimal buys could push the price quickly.\n\nMy open positions are very bullish and my plan is to accumulate shares up to about $26 before August and ride the wave on the cheap options I already own. Current open options.\n\nFD calls: $25 strike, 6/18 exp. $0.05 price/share\n\nEarnings calls: $28, 8/20 exp, $0.10 price/share\n\nTLDR:   🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 Wendy's to the moon🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀\n\nEdit: I posted this and instantly had to leave for work. I left one important word out of my last sentence, it should have read; \"I am NOT a financial professional DYOR and left me know what you think.\" I apologize if i misled you.\n\nMY professional background is in restaurants, I have worked everywhere from fast food to high end Italian and even one that went bankrupt last year.\n\nIt is my opinion that Wendy's is set for strong growth and significantly increased same store sales through the end of this year and into next. I know it isn't the short squeeze WSB loves so much but I think it should be a solid, worthwhile, long-term investment. And I will be buying more shares on Monday.\n\nThank you all for reading and commenting. This community is awesome and I love all you apes. I hope you all have had a lovely weekend.  🥂 Cheers 🥂\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "nt5ule", "created_utc": 1622928401.0, "score": 522, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 270, "comments": [{"body": "Rhymes with tendies.

In addition, in a major development, WEN is positioned to debut in the United Kingdom, with the launch of its first two restaurants during FY2021. Moreover, the firm is currently evaluating 20 franchisees in the geography, and believes that it could eventually launch 400 restaurants in the region. Furthermore, 130 additional foreign franchisee applications are in various stages of processing.\n\nImportantly, at the end of the first quarter, WEN had 6,838 stores in 31 countries comprised of 5,885 stores in the U.S. and 953 stores in international regions. 95% of the U.S. footprint is franchisee owned and operated. International stores are entirely owned and operated by master franchisees. The company has set a long-term annualized new unit development growth objective of 3%, comprised of 1% and 10% potential growth from the U.S. and overseas.\n\nWe believe that WEN's international diversification strategy is the right maneuver at the right time. Given, its growing brand recognition across the world, the company is in a position to attract well funded and competent master franchisees, which is critical to ensure long-term success.

That Professor may even try to help you get an internship or job. When that happens job applications can sound like 'We need to fill Y job and Professor X said you'd be a good candidate, please go to our site and apply for the position so we can setup an interview.' Instead of, 'hello i sent in an application and was hoping we could setup an interview.'\n\nMy wife has held a great career for about 7 yrs now that started from an internship a great professor of hers helped line up.
