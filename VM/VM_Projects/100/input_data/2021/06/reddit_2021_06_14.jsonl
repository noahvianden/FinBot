Second, since everyone's account size and risk tolerance are different, the same trade isn't always appropriate or good for every trader: position sizing, entry/exit points, profit targets, etc. When I looked at the trades I copied, I realized I would never have made most those trades if someone hadn't suggested them.

When building trades from blocks we can offset certain positions to limit our risks. So, for example if we are going to sell a put with strike price of 100 and buy a put with strike price of 95 then we will get limited risk, limited reward trade(ie. bull put spread). I get that if we would own 100 shares of underlying then sold put would be covered. But I don't get how buying a put with lower strike price would cover sold put with higher strike price, as those positions different strike prices, hence they are not equally same and they should not behave in same way as time passes. I get that we bought a put and we sold a put and the only difference between them is strike price(hence strike price range defines our risk, as we have to cover difference), and those options are cancelling each other out, but there are so many changing variables to this(ie. greeks) that I have no idea how one could be so sure about outcome. Speaking of this, are those payoff diagrams of such trades drawn in such way that the information they present is also accurate on the last day of trade even if they would be drawn months prior?\n\nAlso, what is the ensurance that upon closing, such short put/long put position legs will get closed at exactly same time? For example, what if we would be trying to close it at late Friday just before market closes and long leg would get filled immediately while short put would stay queued over they weekend?\n\nAnd finally, even if we would do two-block trade, because there's selling involved, do we have any ensurance that our short leg won't get assigned?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> When building trades from blocks we can offset certain positions to limit our risks.\n\nNot without adding more risk of a different kind.

You can't be sure, until expiration. You absolutely can lose more than the expiration max loss, or make more than the expiration max profit, with a vertical spread.\n\nBut why should that trouble you? Very little about option trading has sure outcomes. That's pretty much why we trade, because premium is the cost of uncertainty. The more uncertainty, the higher the premium demanded for a contract.\n\n\n> Speaking of this, are those payoff diagrams of such trades drawn in such way that the information they present is also accurate on the last day of trade even if they would be drawn months prior?\n\nIf it is an **at expiration** P/L diagram, yes. All uncertainty is removed at expiration, so the P/L is 100% accurate. But by the same token, such diagrams are pretty useless, because you usually don't hold trades to expiration. You are in and out before expiration, so why should you care about the expiration P/L? You shouldn't.\n\nNow that said, you can always make a new diagram that is accurate for the current information.

Don't hold on expiration day for sure. Precisely because something like what you said could happen, even if you trade the spread as a whole. You don't want to get stuck holding a trade because the spread order can't get filled in time. I usually open spreads 45 days to expiration and close well before 12 days to expiration. Sometimes I close the day after I opened.\n\n> And finally, even if we would do two-block trade, because there's selling involved, do we have any ensurance that our short leg won't get assigned?\n\nIf you are asking if assignment is a risk when you have a short leg, the answer is yes.

And if I wouldn't be able to trade spread as whole? \n\nFind a better broker. Legging in or out is an advanced technique that should only be done when circumstances merit. But yes, generally it's best to close the short leg first, since that's the leg with the largest potential loss. But again, in all of 2020, I only legged in/out of one vertical out of more than 50.

No. Change for rho is slow and well anticipated, so you don't have to pay as much attention to it as you would delta, for example.\n\nWhere rho should be carefully considered today is long term plays, like if you want to buy & hold a LEAPS call that expires in 2 years.

Since the market is closed all these quotes are bogus, but close enough for comparison purposes:\n\n* F ($14.52) $0.91/$0.93, spread = $0.02, **% of bid = 2.1%**\n\n* SPCE ($36.80) $4.30/$4.50, spread = $0.20, **% of bid = 4.6%**\n\n* WYNN ($124.44) $7.55/7.85, spread = $0.30, **% of bid = 4.0%**\n\n* SPY ($414.92) $7.71/7.74, spread = $0.03, **% of bid = 0.4%**\n\n* TSLA ($623.31) $34.15/34.80, spread = $0.65, **% of bid = 1.9%**\n\n* AMZN ($3486.90) $103.50/106.65, spread = $3.15, **% of bid = 3.0%**\n\n* SPX ($4166.45) $71.80/72.30, spread = $0.50, **% of bid = 0.7%**\n\nSo in my somewhat random selection, TSLA has the third best spread, on a percentage basis. And is only beat by two of the most liquid options out there, SPY and SPX.\n\nOther things to consider are the strike interval (ranges from $1 to $10) and the price increment ($0.01 to $0.10). Those add some error to the comparison, since a ATM for one option might be within a $1 of the actual price in one case, but within $10 in another case, while the bid that has to jump up a nickel at a time will have wider percentage error than a bid that can jump up a penny at a time.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "KMPH, can anyone explain this to me a little better?

There's me and some others on this board that are aware of the problem, and occasionally I'll talk about it inside various threads: Most of you trade like retards.

And if you don't understand how you can be \"cash-secured\" and still deeply over-allocated, you don't know what you're doing. I'd also say if you're trading theta strategies on momentum stocks, you probably also don't know what you're doing (Ah said it).

I actually included everything you need to know in the post, and the key words would have jumped off the page if you knew what were the most important concepts to know in trading:\n\n1. **Risk management** \\-- this always comes first, before you ever trade a single stock. If you don't understand this concept, you're fucked. Ask any profitable trader who's been profitable over a long period of time. I've not seen a single one that doesn't put RM first. But it's boring and people don't like to think about it and they'd rather hit the ground running with no plan or direction, because, well, why the fuck would I learn something boring like how to *lose* money when I'm gonna *make* so much with this hot shit right here! Seems to just be human nature, I guess.\n2. **Fundamental Analysis** \\-- Holy shit man, learn how to value a company. None of you know how to do it, and worse yet, you act like you know how to do it. Yes, there's some opinion involved, and you'll get a range of numbers that value a company, but they're generally mostly in line with one another, within reason. There are so many books on this, and no, I'm not going to give recommendations because what works for me may read like gibberish to you. You've got to dive in. Google \"books on fundamental analysis,\" and run through the pdfs. If something reads like shit to you, go with something else until something sticks. You need to dive into a lot of different resources -- one or another may not be all it takes. Or just look at the people who do it and have become the greatest investors of all time, backed by verified annual returns: Graham. Buffet. Lynch. Greenblatt. Munger. Pabrai. None of you have the first fucking clue how to do it. I see endless posts about \"This is a great price for XYZ,\" or \"I'd LOVE to own XYZ at that price!\" and then I'll run a basic financial analysis of the stock....the revenue is flat/declining, the net income/cash flow is negative, the balance sheet has a shitload of debt and no considerable equity, and the stock is priced like it's making $5b/year and will have 80% YoY growth for the next 15 years, all because there's been 60% growth for the last 3 years. Wake the fuck up and value a stock based on its current/past earnings, or based on a *very conservative* future growth, *not* based on a future forecast you have absolutely zero idea about. You can't even come close to making accurate predictions on a stock that's been around only a few years (which probably means it's also not something to play around with). If you've got a stock that's been around 50 years with a consistent track record of earnings/cash flow growth, then maybe you can make a somewhat believable prediction of the future (which generally just falls in line with the growth of the overall market, somewhat more, or somewhat less).\n3. **Technical Analysis** \\-- you all do this anyway, yet there's no end to people on this thread talking shit about it. \"I think this stock will go up because there's a crazy amount of hype around it and it's been going up\" is technical analysis. You're saying \"There's a lot of volume in this stock, and price action is bullish, therefore I'll buy.\" You're predicting future price action based on past price action. In that example, you're doing it in kind of a stupid/unempirical kind of way, but you're doing it nontheless. There are better ways of predicting future price action based on past price action. Learn them. Implement them, in addition to your risk management and fundamental approach. It'll round out your trading. No, you don't need it, but it's a nice tool to have.\n4. **IV contraction** \\-- this is what you all *should* already know, but I guess forgot in recent times. We are very clearly in a low IV environment. You trade theta strategies in a high IV environment for the best results. You don't trade fucking IV contraction strategies in low IV environments. You also preferentially trade the indices, because that's what the fuck we have data on. We don't have data on how AMC reacts to IV contraction over time, and what those PL curves look like. We have data on the indices, and data on *some* major individual stocks, and how those compare (news flash: the indices do *way better* across the board, btw). This is simple stuff. Prefer the indices and major liquid names over cash-bleeding hype garbage. I'd rather see someone trading NKE right now (\\~45 IVR last I checked) than AMC. And I don't even love it or think there's much of a trade there, other than maybe a bearish spread out of boredom.\n5. **Don't Overtrade** \\-- My exact phrase was something like \"sit the fuck still.\" This is another one of those things amateur traders don't have the first fucking idea about, but it's an unbelievably important psychological concept: if there's no trade for your strategy, tie your fucking hands behind your back, man. Stop forcing things. Stop doing things you don't need to do, and fucking your PL curve over as a result of it. You're doing *more* work for *less* pay and *more* risk. Meanwhile, you pay your broker commissions (if it's not RH) to give your dumb ass this privilege. Don't do it. When a trade is there, it's *there* \\-- it'll blare sirens and jump off the page at you. This is something traders learn with experience. If there's no trade, shut the computer down and go do something else. Come back tomorrow or even next week, depending on what your time frame is for trading (simple general rule: day trading you can come back tomorrow, swing trading you can wait a few days to see what comes up, and investing you can wait up to a few months for something to come cheap).\n\nSo yeah, all these were in the post. But newbies didn't read between the lines and  continue to talk shit instead of spending their time learning what they don't know. Same as with anything else. I just like to poke fun at the fact that it's happening here every day, right before your very eyes. And it's so glaringly obvious it deserves mention. So I mentioned it. Those who have a desire to help themselves will do so. I've seen a few of those in the thread.

Buffet. Lynch. Greenblatt. Munger. Pabrai.\n\nGreatest value investors of all time. They all wrote books, which you can read. If you read all of their works front and back, you'll understand how to value companies and therefore you'll understand how to know when a company has more upside than downside for a favorable trade. As for techs, I (key word \"I\" as in me, not you or anyone else) found it helpful to go through the following:\n\n1. Technical Analysis in the Financial Markets -- Murphy\n2. Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques -- Nison\n3. Mastering the Trade, 3rd ed. -- Carter\n4. Volume Price Analysis -- Coulling\n\nBut there are a billion and one books out there on TA. I've seen successful traders quote tons of different ones as being helpful, which I've never touched or had to. I like to read new books whenever I can, but the above 4 are the major ones in my mind, that laid it all out for me. **Warning**: The reason I don't give out books on TA, generally, is because some of the authors will try to sell you on courses or subscriptions. Avoid ever buying a subscription or a course, at all costs. There is absolutely no need to pay for anything when learning how to trade. All of these pdfs should be available online, or at least they were last I checked.\n\n>It would be like a calculus teacher saying \"So derivatives are super easy, you can learn them in a weekend by reading and practicing some problems\" and then talking about their weekend for an hour.\n\nIt's not really like that at all. I'm just a guy on the internet, with zero control over anyone's future, and no one's paying me to help them. This is also not really like math. There's some level of specificity to \"what works for different people.\" That's a cringe meme, but it's actually true for trading, because I can't get inside your or anyone else's head and know what you'll be most comfortable with. It's a very psychologically stressful undertaking, so it has to be individually tailored. People know themselves best, so they'll know what kind of risk management plan and what kind of strategy will work best for their mindset.\n\nI can tell you to read Mark Douglas who's done a series of books on that, but again you may think Mark Douglas is a fucking moron talking nonsense and a terrible writer and nothing will stick.

This has to do with the fact that you can only lose 100% of the premium that you pay. When you sell options, you take the opposite side of that trade, so you will have decelerating profits and accelerating losses. You can very often lose greater than 100% of the premium you obtain selling options. This is why a lot of people will recommend that you take profits if you are up 50%/25%/whatever very quickly.

Defining your risk prevents catastrophic loss, but it also reduces your profits.\n* Know the relationship between probability of profit (POP) and max profit. Higher POP = less profit, lower pop = higher max profit. \n* Always know your max loss on each trade and keep it small. If you have undefined risk, what is the loss you will incur from a 2- or 3-stdev move against you?\n* Trade multiple positions in uncorrelated assets / asset classes.\n* Keep your positions small. Tastytrade peeps drill hard to \"trade small, trade often\". It's about making high-POP trades and getting the law of large numbers on your side.\n* Our edge is not high IV. It's the fact that IV changes over time and that it *reverts to mean*. This means we want to sell premium only when IV is much higher than it normally is, because we know the odds favor IV falling. IV Rank and IV Percentile will tell you whether this is happening.\n* Do not sell premium when the IVR is low, say, below 20. It doesn't matter if raw IV is 100%: If IVR is at 5, then you're probably going to see IV pop to 150% and your short options will get murdered.\n* The higher IVR, the more you want to lever up. This goes against the conventional wisdom of de-risking in volatility. We short volatility most aggressively when it is highest.\n* A big mistake I made in the beginning was going all long, i.e. large positive delta. Delta is basically a measure of directionality. If a position's delta is positive, you are hoping the underlying goes up. What happens if your entire portfolio is CSPs and the broader market drops 10%?

I don't think there's ever been a year like this in the past 20 years, if you're starting from the corona lows to March of this year. You could have just loaded SPY at or near the bottom and nearly *doubled your money*. I don't know of any year-long period in recent history where the S&P has doubled in just one year, except maybe directly after the Great Depression bottoms in '32. Traders have been insanely babied in this past market, and they're so uneducated that they think it's their \"expertise\" that's gotten them their gains this past year. They don't understand that you take gains over a long time frame, in order to get an accurate picture of how you're really doing over time. You can't just isolate one month or even one year.

Learn them extremely well. Focus heavily on *the downside* with everything you do -- what are you risking, and what you can lose. That's how professional traders think. They don't think \"how mut muneee\" they can make. They are constantly considering and framing their strategies around potential losses, and they carefully and constructively *control* their losses.

Even Michael Burry is predicting it…(SEC made him shut down his Twitter account)\n\nThe first and best thing you can do to position yourself for being financially stable after a rocket ride to the moon is PAY OFF all of your debt. House, cars, cards, loans, etc…then you are slave to no man, woman, corporation etc…\n\nNext i would strongly recommend establishing an emergency fund of 6-12 months of expenses…or more. If you have NO DEBT then this will be easier to accomplish. Choose what you want, Gold, cr$pto, silver, ammo, whatever will help pay the bills and protect you and yours.\n\nThen (and I’m still doing my own DD) find some funds that are low risk, and increase with inflation. Also remember that interest rates are at an all time low right now! The ONLY place for them to go is UP!! So find some funds that give you gains as interest rates rise. \n\nFinally if you are able, wisely help others with your newfound wealth and abilities and NEVER NEVER NEVER forget where you came from and the sacrifices made for you, and by you on the way to the moon!\n\nPlease comment with any helpful info especially if you have DD on good funds that protect / help as mentioned above.\n\nThis is NOT financial advice it is life advice, from one crayon eating dumb money APE 🦍 to another.

{"title": "$CRSR DD Part 2 or why Corsair will swallow the gaming industry and be a 'millionaire maker' stock", "selftext": "Sup apes. In my first [DD last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxhh7d/crsr_dd_or_why_you_should_park_all_your_cash_in/), I gave a short rundown of why Corsair is incredibly undervalued, and how it should be in **everyone’s portfolio**. With Part 2, I’m addressing a lot of the comments I got as well as going a bit deeper into how Corsair will make this industry their bitch and reach ATH in 2021.  \n\n-\n\n\n**Why is Corsair in a strong position to leverage the gaming and streaming industry?**\n-\nCorsair didn’t snooze, but rather spend the last years hunting for good companies to acquire. Being well funded, profitable and raking in cash every year allowed them to expand in all directions with a core focus on the fastest growing niche: Streaming. Have a look at their investor relations page:\n\n-\n\n*“Corsair is a leading global provider and innovator of high-performance gear for gamers and content creators. Our industry-leading gaming gear helps digital athletes, from casual gamers to committed professionals, to perform at their peak across PC or console platforms, and our streaming gear enables creators to produce studio-quality content to share with friends or to broadcast to millions of fans.* \n\n*CORSAIR also includes subsidiary brands Elgato, which provides premium studio equipment and accessories for content creators, SCUF Gaming, which builds custom-designed controllers for competitive gamers, and **ORIGIN PC**, a builder of custom gaming and workstation desktop PCs and laptops.**\n\n-\nWith Elgato they positioned themselves years ago already to capitalize on one of the fastest growing entertainment subsegments (Streaming). While acquiring SCUF Gaming and ORIGIN PC allowed them to also expand and play in the console market as well as Pre Build PCs and laptops. **They basically moved up the ladder from RGB fans, keyboards, RAM sticks and Cases to EVERYTHING you need to play, stream or game properly.**\n\n**How much faster is Corsair really expanding?**\n-\n\nI cannot stress this enough, but their last quarter results really blew it completely out of the water. Seeing how they raised guidance, I think August will be even more brutal. One for value:\n\n* **$529.4 million** in net revenue, an increase of **71.6%** year-over-year. \n* **$175.9 million** net revenue for Gamer and creator peripherals segment, an increase of **131.9%** year-over-year.\n* Gross profit was **$160.3 million**, an increase of **103.9%** year-over-year, with a gross margin of 30.3%, an improvement of 480 basis points year-over-year. \n* Operating income was **$67.3 million**, an increase of **404.5%** year-over-year.\n* Adjusted operating income was **$80.4 million**, an increase of **221.4%** year-over-year.\n\n\n-\nDo yourself a favor and whip up a site like FinViz, punch in your favorite meme stock and have a look at their revenue number vs market cap. There’s a reason why GME got picked up by DFV. Sales is still king and undervalued companies with aggressive growth have insane potential short and long term.\n\n-\n**Why hasn’t it blown up yet to +100?**\n-\n\nThere is a good amount of chatter about two things. One being market manipulation, the other is that there is very little retail investor interest, compared to the amount of net sellers. The second point actually holds up, the stock never really got picked up by retail investors (or apes) and a lot of the commenters that did buy it up, mentioned how they were perfectly content with amassing shares every month while the price is still low. Pure but selfish value investing. \n\n-\n**Eagle What?**\n-\n\nThis one was also pointed out a lot. Corsair is owned by a private equity firm called EagleTree. They purchased the majority stake back in 2017 (which in turn allowed Corsair to expand much more aggressively) and now is obligated to reduce their share position over the next years until they only hold 10% of the company. \n\nThey currently hold 61.9%. The shares sold are mostly picked up by **Vanguard**, **Blackrock** and a few other small institutions, plus retail of course. Looking at insider transactions we can see that EagleTree usually sells shares twice a year with the last transaction happening **June 3rd 2021**. \n\nThis point doesn’t concern me too much personally, as it’s normal for private equity firms to reduce their stake after IPOs and Corsair is barely dipping $2 even with EagleTree selling 5 million shares. Now having sold their shares just now, it will probably be quiet for the next 6 months. \n\n-\n**Back to 2021 and how you can make money**\n-\n\nThey have a strong customer base which they've built up over the last 20 years, and thought f+ck it, let’s go all in on this market. Tits and streaming? Amazing! Controllers for consoles? Let’s do it. RGB Spinners on your lambo? Fuuckyea.\n\n-\n\nInstead of focusing on boring office peripherals that every Chinese company provides, they instead decided to slap RGB on everything and are loved for it. \n\n-\n\n**Now EagleTree is gonna continue doing what eagles do, and we will continue doing what apes do. I’ll continue buying this company and watching their ER like a hawk while analysts jack themselves off over the sort of numbers Corsair hits out every quarter.**\n\n-\nI said it once, and I’ll say it again. If you don’t hold Corsair shares, you are pretty retarded. But since that’s half the sub already, just do your wife’s boyfriend a favour and pick up some shares while they are still dirt cheap. He will thank you for it once they hit **$70** or even blow through the stratosphere with **+$100.**\n\n-\n\n**TL:DR**\n\nCorsair CEO Smart. Put this in your boomer dad’s portfolio (shares) and If you like gambling, buy some calls. \n\n-\n\nPosition: 100 shares at $33 and 12x 40$ Nov Calls.

One being market manipulation\n\nWhy, dear why, does everything that doesn't skyrocket get pinned as \"market manipulation\"? I realize you posted a second potential reason, but the first seems to be a common cop-out for not knowing what is actually happening. Similar to UFO's. Frequently, if somebody sees an *unidentified* flying object, their first response is \"welp, must be aliens!\" No Kathy, you've acknowledged that this anomaly is *unidentified*, your argument ends there. Do you have any source for this alleged market manipulation?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNothing else in this post per se irks me, as I'd love to have some RGB spinners on my Lambo.\n\n(Timmy Tuner's Dad) IF I HAD ONE! (/Timmy Turner's Dad)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll reference back though\n\nFrom Post numero uno:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Their current market cap stands at 3.12B on 1.92B sales and 148m profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not a gripe. If people should be convinced, this is one of the major reasons. The profit is fucking impressive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>**3.Cheap Options**  \n>  \n>Flat movement for the last months meaning LOW IV and CHEAP option prices. $40 Calls on November are $2. And long term leaps at $50 barely cost $1.40. Since inception last year, their shares went from $15 to $54 in the span of a couple months. This rally died off when people finally decided to take profits after the IPO. But if options are too rich for you, it's still an excellent time to buy shares and park your cash there while the run up to $50 happens.  \n>  \n>**4.Low Risk**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI included the Low Risk heading in here for a reason. Promoting how healthy this company is and how safe an investment it is while simultaneously promoting options is ludicrous. I know this is WSB, I know. However, options are ***not*** a safe investment. They're inherently risky and thus come with greater rewards. Deep ITM calls are much more safe, as long as you're exercising, but let's be real, WSB thrives on those cheap FDs. If we look at CRSRs activity over the past several months (excluding today. I know it's up a lot) it's just been sideways trading. Which is to be expected, because of it's low IV!  If you buy some slightly OTM calls and hold them until expiry, your investment goes to zero if the stock hardly moves. Even if it moves slightly higher, these will be crushed by Theta decay. Poof! Whereas if you would have put the same amount into stocks, you'd still be holding the equity and might even be in the green!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, not to say the options weren't cheap, or that your reasoning wasn't accurate, but promoting options as low risk isn't the best way to get your point across.

In 2020, net income margins were 6.1%. All of that increase (and more) can be attributed to the  700bp increase in gross margin. They have no operating leverage whatsoever. \n\nThe key to this investment is whether that increase sticks around - not the PE firm, or meme potential, or growth of the wider gaming industry. If all of those go right, but gross margins go back to historic means, CRSR WILL NOT PRINT FCF.\n\nMy view of the gaming market is that the past year has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for component makers like CRSR. The demand was so high that they could gouge prices and increase margins, but that's not going to stick around forever.

In making this determination and approval, the Board considered, among other things, the factors and characteristics of the transactions described below.*\n\n\r  \n*First and most critically, the Board believes Amazon is a valuable strategic partner for Clean Energy.* ***Under the Fuel Agreement, Amazon will be purchasing low and negative carbon RNG from Clean Energy, initially through 27 existing fueling stations and 19 non-exclusive new or upgraded stations that we expect to construct by the end of the year. The new and existing stations will provide RNG in 15 different states across the United States, and we will own all the stations.***\n\n\r  \n*The Warrant Shares vest in multiple tranches, the first of which for 13,283,445 Warrant Shares vested upon execution of the Fuel Agreement. Subsequent tranches will vest over time based on fuel purchases by Amazon and its affiliates, up to a total of $500 million, excluding any payments attributable to “Pass Through Costs,” which consist of all costs associated with the delivered cost of gas and applicable taxes determined by reference to the selling price, gallons or gas sold.* ***Importantly, if all the vesting conditions of the Amazon Warrant are satisfied, Amazon will have purchased hundreds of millions of GGEs of RNG at today’s fuel prices from Clean Energy.***\n\n\r  \n***We believe a commercial partnership with Amazon will enhance our strategies, initiatives and efforts to achieve our goals to grow fleet and other consumer support for the use of RNG as a vehicle fuel for our target customers and geographies, and other contributions and factors.*** *The Board also believes the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock to Amazon in the event Amazon were to vest and then exercise the Amazon Warrant in part or whole for cash, would enhance our liquidity in support of our operations, as well as our ability to execute our business plans and pursue opportunities for further growth.*", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I appreciate the thorough answer.
