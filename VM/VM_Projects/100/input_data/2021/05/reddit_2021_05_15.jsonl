{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 17th, 2021.\n\n# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after April’s hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.\n*****\n> Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.\n*****\n> Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the week’s heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.\n*****\n> Technology shares were among the best performers in Friday’s rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.\n*****\n> “Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive.” He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.\n*****\n> But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.\n*****\n> Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.\n*****\n> He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.\n*****\n> # Fed Ahead\n> The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before April’s Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.\n*****\n> That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.\n*****\n> “I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. They’re thinking that one data point is not a trend,” said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.\n*****\n> But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.\n*****\n> Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.\n*****\n> But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.\n*****\n> “We saw hot CPI, hot PPI,” said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. “That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.”\n*****\n> The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.\n*****\n> # Retail earnings and housing\n> Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowe’s release results Wednesday, and B.J.’s Wholesale and Kohl’s on Thursday.\n*****\n> Another disappointing data point was Friday’s April’s retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.\n*****\n> “You’re likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe’s,” said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.\n*****\n> Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.\n*****\n> Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.\n*****\n> “The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications,” he said. “What’s good for home sales is good for auto sales. It’s good for Home Depot and Lowe’s.”\n*****\n> Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.\n*****\n> Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.\n*****\n> “The S&P 500 held the 50-day moving average, which is constructive,” he said.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50-day, which is the average price of the last 50 closes.

In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. “Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We don’t expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.”\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years. The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150%. Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We also keep an eye on the presidential cycle. We are now past President Biden’s first 100 days and choppy action with a new President in Office is perfectly normal right about now.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> The financial press has discussed the well-known “sell in May and go away” market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isn’t doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # NASDAQ 100 Finds Support\n\n> Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.\n\n> While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months – the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.\n\n> We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical “Reposition in May” period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.\n\n> Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.\n\n> If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.\n\n> In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c4ffe169712380686f4a043d144535fc/397fdf33b9b1b8ad-cc/s500x750/2549c02528c3b9ce57bd8c40d47ea821e87961e7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks\n\n> We’ve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rally—this week notwithstanding—since last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that aren’t pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.\n\n> Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “Should strong performance by value stocks continue—and we suspect it might—international stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance,“ explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.”\n\n> We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.\n\n*****\n\n> # Bullish Sentiment Down Big\n\n> The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n> The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&P 500 trading higher across all time frames.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**\n\n> With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n> That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**\n\n> While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Neutral.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # \"Inflation\" Trends\n\n> You know it's getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter, but that's where we find ourselves this morning with the terms '#GasShortage2021' and '#inflation' both trending on our Twitter feed.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**\n\n> On Google, the frequency of searches for the term inflation looks like it's on its own path straight to the moon.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**\n\n> These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**\n\n> Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**\n\n> While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-1940.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation\n\n> In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.\n\n> The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051121-NFIB.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ePmOTCH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/WKzaYrw.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/TGasATl.jpg))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 5.17.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/kfHiRhB.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 5.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/WzIKfgg.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  5.18.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/24ouS9G.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 5.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gNfJJS2.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 5.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Atp7yhv.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 5.19.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/PrnJ1hL.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 5.20.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/S47R7im.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 5.20.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/NAY2VSq.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 5.21.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/uB2KeDp.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 5.21.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n**(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.", "id": "ncw45t", "created_utc": 1621075629.0, "score": 812, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "In my market, apartment properties are reaching 95-97% capacity which has pushed rents up.

They sold out all of their Q2 production in the first month, so they could easily be selling their cars for much higher prices and make a higher profit, but that's not their strategy.\n\nThe 4680 won't change anything about their strategy.

Here's Teslabjörn running a hands on test:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWkyXApmOpQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWkyXApmOpQ)\n\nWhat this means is that you'll charge from around 10% to around 70% in give or take 12-15 minutes. On a Model 3 LR that means roughly 200km range if you have a lead foot like me (\\~200wh/km). It means you'll probably stop every 1.5-2 hours. You get much farther on a charge with more reasonable speed (100-110km/h) but Sheepherder don't play like that.  \n\n\nMost people who get an EV will charge at home, and if you are like me with a fair commute (120km return) you'll use about 30% of your battery on that trip and you'll want to charge nightly. This means that the 95-98% of the time when you aren't doing a road trip you'll never really think about your battery. Plugging in becomes as normal as washing your hands after you take a shit. (As in some people don't, but you really should.)  \n\n\nB) \n\nAs you can now see, the 30-60 minute stops you're afraid of aren't going to be necessary unless you want to. Ahead of any long trip you'll charge to 90 or 100% depending on how nervous you are about battery degradation, and that will get you around 300km which is way longer than a lot of people will want to drive without a stop.\n\nI've only done one long road trip so far (two days 1500km) but what I can say is it felt very natural to make those frequent stops and the drive was less taxing than it would've normally been.  \n\n\nAt no point did I worry I wouldn't reach a charger in time, and while I spent maybe at a guess 90-120 minutes on charging, much of that time would've been spent on leg stretchers or food breaks in an ICE car anyway. On the morning of the second day for instance I got up a bit early and charged the car while the rest of the group was having breakfast.\n\nIn conclusion, what you're worried about is what everyone is worried about before they start really looking at the reality of EV, but once you're past the hurdle of that worry you'll find that you didn't need to worry. \n\nNo, you will not feel a need to charge to full in 5 minutes. I promise you.\n\nNo, you will not feel a need to have a thousand miles in the battery. You can take that to the bank.\n\nWill you \\*want\\* to charge to full in 5 and have a thousand miles in your battery? Absolutely! I'd love to. But the reality is that while charging may be quicker, what is likely to happen is that batteries become cheaper and most people won't want to pay for thousand-mile batteries even when they become available. Knowing what I know now, I would absolutely not want to pay €30 000 more for twice the range, and frankly maybe not even €10k more. The 550-odd WLTP of the Model 3 LR is more than enough.\n\nThe real problem right now is not range, it's cost. Additionally, for Scandinavians, it's the lack of towing capability. Both of these issues will be fixed within the next few years. Prices are already dropping and towing capability is increasing.\n\nThat said, as you can see from Norwegian and Swedish sales numbers, even with these real hurdles, adoption is coming and as you can see from Norway it's a real snow-ball effect. Anyone buying an ICE-car in Norway today is going to regret it very shortly.\n\nAt the end of the day, nothing I've said thus far can really persuade you if you're certain that I'm wrong, but everything can be easily verified by simply taking a rental out on your own.\n\nIf you don't believe me, try it and come tell me how wrong I am afterwards.

It literally doesn't help OP *at all*. \n\nIf you had properly read OP's post, you'd have seen that their quest for information goes a bit deeper than \"will this stock go up?\".\n\n\nA reply that's actually helpful to OP would mention many more of the aspects that go into making sure OP doesn't stupidly blow the money by keeping the stock all as TSLA or selling calls against it or selling it all for doge (I hope that's sarcasm) or whatever other *spectacularly redacted* crap people are writing in the comments. \n\n\nFirst, you have to find out what OP *actually* got. Is it RSUs? Is it options? Is it actual *stock*? Is there a lockup period? What's the vesting schedule? You'd also have to ask what country OP is in. \n\nDepending on 1., you'd have to mention that OP possibly can't just \"sell it all\" at once but would have to wait for the lockup period or vesting schedule or whatever. \n\nAlso depending on 1., there's taxes. OP will have to pay taxes on the sale of whatever it is that he got. You'd mention that there are, in the US, tax benefits to holding stock for longer than a year. If it's a one-time immediate bonus, you'd have to keep the stock for a year before selling to qualify for long-term tax rates. If there's a vesting schedule, you'd have to keep each vest for over a year. \n\nNext, you'd ask about OP's general financial situation. Does he have other assets? Is this TSLA the only stock he has? If he financially stable enough to not need the money for, e. g., an emergency fund? \n\nIf the answer is something like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/nd6q9f/given_30000_in_tesla_stock_what_should_i_do_with/gy8xqbk/), you'd make sure to tell OP that it is a really stupid idea to keep all your assets in one stock, and even stupider to have that one stock be *your employer*. Any exposure beyond \"marginal\" to your employer is not a good idea unless you are at levels of income/wealth where there is simply no other possibility. \n\nWhat happens when in three years, Tesla tanks and has to let him go? \nHe'll be out of a job and out of most the value of his stock. \n\n\nSo now you'd have established that the best idea is probably to sell the stock as soon as it's possible and/or tax-optimal. Since OP is now effectively standing there with quite a big sum of money in his hands, and his post and comments indicate that he probably doesn't want to blow it *all* on coke and hookers, you could tell OP (who's clearly eager to learn about personal finances and investing as per the above linked comment) to read the /r/personalfinance wiki and other material about how to build a properly diversified portfolio with stocks, ETFs and other assets/ asset classes. \n\n\nYou'd also tell him that if he wants to just invest some/all of the money for the long term without thinking about it again for the next 10 years and without reading any of that /r/personalfinance stuff or investing too much time into financial literacy, *his best option is putting it all into a broad-market ETF*. But all of this is explained in the /r/personalfinance wiki too, so with OP's willingness to learn, you'd insist that he just read it and improve his financial literacy. \n\n \n\nOf course there are dozens of other aspects that are important for OP that he'll have to figure out himself, but I hope that this helps him at least a bit more than \"you like company? keep. you not like company? sell\", because that is, quite frankly, BAD advice.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Have you ever thought that maybe you're just wrong?

{"title": "Huya: The most undervalued company in the market.", "selftext": "https://i.imgur.com/dVC4QND.jpg\n\nWhat is Huya? \n\nHuya is the largest game streaming platform in all of China, it’s basically the Chinese equivalent of Twitch. \n\nEsports is absolutely huge in China, bigger than in the west, it’s like a real sport over there. They hold tourneys in giant $900m stadiums and offer substantial cash prizes to winners. This is an industry with strong tailwinds and we know there will only be massive growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe majority shareholder of Huya is Tencent, which is great news for Huya because they can buy exclusive streaming rights for all Tencent games like League of Legends and Dota2 as well as exclusive broadcast rights for tournaments, which is creating a very nice moat. Add the network effect and you can forget about anyone ever challenging Huya’s dominance in the industry. We all know Google and Microsoft could never even compete with Twitch despite sniping the largest streamers Ninja and Shroud, because the network effect for game streaming is just that strong.\n\nSo what makes Huya so undervalued?\n\nWell, just look at these goddamn numbers:\n\nMarket Cap: $4b\n\nSales: $1.67b\n\nP/S: 2.4\n\nPE ratio: 28\n\nPEG ratio: 0.3\n\n2020 Revenue growth: 30%\n\n2020 Earnings growth: 89%\n\n5 yr revenue cagr: 20-30%\n\nCash: $1.6b\n\nDebt: $0\n\nCompare these with a somewhat similar company, Bilibili, the Youtube of China.\n\nMarket cap: $37b\n\nSales: $1.8b\n\nP/S: 20.5\n\nPE ratio: 0\n\nPEG ratio: 0\n\n2020 revenue growth: 50%\n\n2020 earnings growth: -118%\n\n5 yr revenue cagr: 35-45%\n\nCash: $2b\n\nDebt: $1.29b\n\nBut why?\n\nHuya has been hit with the perfect storm of bullshit. We all know tech and growth stocks are crashing right now because of inflation, add the fact that Chinese stocks are getting hammered right now because of the new regulations that threaten to delist some of the shadier Chinese companies out there. But that’s not all, there is something else holding this stock down, a pending merger with their largest competitor Douyu.\n\nThis potential merger would basically double Huya revenue instantly, double the cash on the balance sheet, while giving them a new market cap of roughly $7b, and they would instantly capture 80% of all game streaming market share in China. Basically a monopoly in a hyper growth industry. They could also increase margins substantially with no competition and no need to outbid competitors with large contracts to their streamers to keep them on the platform.\n\nUnder normal circumstances this potential merger would be the most bullish development of all time, but not today. The CCP really doesn’t like it. They don’t like Tencent buying up smaller companies within an industry, merging them together, and creating a monopoly. These days it seems like there is an article every day about how the Chinese government is really starting to crack down on Tencent and Alibaba. The Huya Douyu deal is at the center of all of that China stock FUD, and there is a real good chance that this merger gets blocked outright within the next month or two.\n\nThen Huya is screwed? \n\nNot really. Whatever happens, it’s good for Huya share price. Right now Huya is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. There are a large number of shorts looking to take advantage of the price difference between Huya and Douyu shares, Arbitrage shorts. They will have to cover either way once the merger decision is reached, leaving Huya to run higher once the merger FUD is over. Over time, Huya will rise to reflect the strong fundaments and growth of the company. \n\nThis stock should be 5x the price it is today at a bare minimum.\n\nWhat am I doing?\n\nI’m buying LEAPs all the way down, averaging in from the start of this week. I’m up to 90 already and buying many more hopefully before it shoots up.\n\nPositions: HUYA $20 calls 01/2023.", "id": "ncnic1", "created_utc": 1621040602.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "CEO's name is Rong Dong.

{"title": "Why concrete companies are going to be the next meme stocks", "selftext": "Alright so I'm sure you've heard of Biden's proposed 2.3T American Jobs Plan, fixing and creating vital infrastructure for the US economy while at the same time employing thousands for work. Out of this Bill, there is around 621B allocated for transportation.\n\n\nHere is a quote from the White House's website about allocation:\n\n\n\n*\"Repair American roads and bridges. One in five miles, or 173,000 total miles, of our highways and major roads are in poor condition, as well as 45,000 bridges. Delays caused by traffic congestion alone cost over $160 billion per year, and motorists are forced to pay over $1,000 every year in wasted time and fuel. The President is proposing a total increase of $115 billion to modernize the bridges, highways, roads, and main streets that are in most critical need of repair. This includes funding to improve air quality, limit greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce congestion. His plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main streets, not only “fixing them first” but “fixing them right,” with safety, resilience, and all users in mind. It will fix the most economically significant large bridges in the country in need of reconstruction, and it will repair the worst 10,000 smaller bridges, including bridges that provide critical connections to rural and tribal communities. The plan includes $20 billion to improve road safety for all users, including increases to existing safety programs and a new Safe Streets for All program to fund state and local “vision zero” plans and other improvements to reduce crashes and fatalities, especially for cyclists and pedestrians\"*\n\n\nThis will be the largest infrastructure plan since FDR released the New Deal, nearly 100 years later. 173,000 miles of concrete, 45,000 bridges made of... You guess it, concrete. \n\nWith 621B up for grabs thats going into a product that gets manufactured, bought, sold and which companies issue shares for this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to hop on the concrete and cement train.\n\n\nNow, this still has to get passed through congress. Along side with the American Families Plan, this a MUCH easier sell for republicans. 1.8T for the American Families Plan, 2.3T for the American Jobs Plan to a whopping total of 4.1T in spending. The funny thing is, out of the 4.1T the least contentious part is the 621B for infrastructure. This is actually [what](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/what-to-watch-for-in-congressional-debate-on-biden-economic-plan) republicans **want.**\n\n\nFree education for four years? Tough sell.\n\nDirect support to families and children? We'll see\n\nSenior care and wage hikes? Good luck.\n\nInfrastructure to repair roads, bridges and infrastructure using American made products by hiring American workers? **SIGN US UP** \n\nEven if its less than 621B, say what gets agreed on is 450B, I guarantee you out of anything in the entire two plans, the infrastructure will go through.\n\n\n\nHow to play this:\n\nLoad up on concrete. Firms and funds have already been doing this quietly in the background. Look at $PAVE, the US Infrastructure Development ETF. Since Biden was elected, its been on an escalator ride up. I believe this escalator will turn into an elevator soon enough, especially when the Dems and the Republicans get an appetite for all the sweet sweet gray concrete and black asphalt.  \n\n\nSo you can either go the ETF route or hop into individual companies.\n\n\nSome of the top US Concrete companies:\n\nCRH Oldcastle\n\n**CX** - My favorite\n\nLafarge\n\nUS Concrete\n\n\nCX is what I'm currently holding, got in around $6.50. I personally think anything under $10 is a steal. I think these are all going to run hot in the next few weeks with chatter around the two bills. Their revenue last quarter beast estimates by over 1000%. You read that right. They are perfectly positioned to take in a big chunk of this government spending. Look what they focus on:\n\n\n\n*\"CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V., together with its subsidiaries, produces, markets, distributes, and sells cement, ready-mix concrete, aggregates, clinker, and other construction materials worldwide.

Currently, 42% of all bridges are at least 50 years old, and 46,154, or 7.5% of the nation’s bridges, are considered structurally deficient, meaning they are in “poor” condition.*  \n>  \n>*A recent estimate for the nation’s backlog of bridge repair needs is $****125 billion****. We need to increase spending on bridge rehabilitation from $14.4 billion annually to $22.7 billion annually, or by 58%, if we are to improve the condition. At the current rate of investment, it will take until 2071 to make all of the repairs that are currently necessary, and the additional deterioration over the next 50 years will become overwhelming.*\n\nSo ignoring all other types of infrastructure in need of upgrades, $125 billion is needed just for bridges alone. \n\nNow according the White House face sheet, the $621 billion from 'The American Jobs Plan' that is allocated to infrastructure also includes roads, public transport, passenger and freight rail services, building electric vehicle infrastructure (charging stations), ports, waterways, and airports.\n\nSo that means only a fraction of the $621 billion will get allocated to bridges. The cost of replacing/rebuilding an existing bridge from scratch is a freaking nightmare - not only the logistics but the cost - and this option would only be considered in extreme cases. So the main headache would be how to spend the money they get allocated - fix thousands of minor repairs before they get worse? Or replace a handful of bridges that are over 70 years old?

If Biden proposed $621 billion allocated to *new construction* then yeah maybe, but repair and upgrading infrastructure is more about expertise in diagnosis and smart budget spending so a better bet would be on Contractors and Engineering Consulting Companies.
