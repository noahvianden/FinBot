Many are expecting a continuation of the current bullish trend as the US and other countries look to reopen after the pandemic. However, I'm concerned with the inflationary risks and Fed. tapering towards the latter half of the year. More than 40% of the US dollars in circulation were printed in the last year and no one really seems to care. At this point, I have completely acknowledged that I have no clue how the market works and that market movement is not explicitly tied underlying fundamentals.\n\nI'm relatively new to options, and I want to understand how I can use them to hedge against any potential major market correction we may or may not see in the near future. If I don't want to miss out on potential gains, but still hedge against a downside, would it make sense to purchase SPY puts at around $350-$375 with expirations maybe 6-9 months from now? Are there better ways to hedge? I've thought about just holding cash or bonds, but holding cash makes no sense if I have inflationary fears and bond yields are kind of terrible at the moment.\n\nI appreciate any feedback or clarification. If I'm severely misunderstanding something here, let me know. I'm 21 and began investing 2 years ago and have very recently started looking at options, so by no means am I a seasoned investor.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Not easily, is the short answer. There are more direct ways to hedge inflation, like buy real property, precious metals, commodity futures, or TIPS.\n\n> If I don't want to miss out on potential gains, but still hedge against a downside\n\nThere's no such thing as free downside insurance. If you want to hedge, that will come at a cost, including less upside. But you might still net a gain, it just won't be as much of a gain vs. no hedge at all.\n\n> would it make sense to purchase SPY puts at around $350-$375 with expirations maybe 6-9 months from now?\n\nNot as an inflation hedge, no. For one thing, inflation doesn't necessarily mean SPY will go down. For another, that put will cost a lot of money, maybe more than the potential gain even without hedging, so it may be a lose-lose trade.\n\nThe best way to hedge depends on your time horizon and your risk tolerance (as for any investment decision). If your time horizon is 45 years, you probably don't need to worry about inflation at this point. Unless we get a decade of stagflation like in the 70's, you'll be fine with the usual diversified portfolio that has worked for the last 50 years. You'll know if we get stagflation of that magnitude and it won't be too late to do anything about it if it does happen, because you were already well diversified.\n\nYou should take a look at Ray Dalio's [All-Weather Strategy](https://www.bridgewater.com/research-and-insights/the-all-weather-story). **NOT Tony Robbins' dumbed-down All-Weather Portfolio**, which is often confused with the actual hedging strategy.

It's been amazing. I've almost recovered my initial \"tuition\" that I paid during the first couple of months. During this initial period, I was watching the movement of my trades through out the day, and so I never set automatic stops, since I was actively watching. I figured it was time to start getting these set up, but on my first try this morning it didn't work at all the way I thought it would. Luckily this was on a single contract as a test. I'm sure this is obvious to you all, but before I do this again I'd love to understand why it did what it did?\n\nSo the trade was a single vertical put spread SPY 5 MAY 21 PUT 422/421 @.68 placed this morning. What I wanted to do was sell if it dropped more than 2/3's, or if it raised to just below max profit. What I entered was two OCO sells. The first was a Limit for the same set for .99 GTC, and the second was a Stop set for .23 GTC as well.\n\nThe outcome was the Stop executed just a few minutes later, while SPY was trading for 419.12.

Before diving into the question, I just wanted to say that I did use the search tool to see if this question has already been answered here but I didn't come up with any relevant results.

Apologies in advance if this question has already been asked. \n\nHaving said all of that, here's my scenario and corresponding question:\n\nBack in 2017 I bought 100 shares of Shopify. That position has done exceptionally well since then. Long term (2-5+ years), I'm bullish on Shopify and have no real desire to sell. Short term (1-3 months), I think it's going to trend sideways for a bit and I've been considering writing covered calls so I can collect some premium which would either be reinvested into Shopify, or some other positions I currently have. \n\nAssuming that I wrote a covered call and the buyer decided to exercise it (for any reason - I'm looking at worst case scenario here), the 100 shares I currently have would be sold and I would now owe long term capital gains taxes on the $100k+ profit from the trade. \n\nMy question is: Is there any way to avoid triggering the sale on the \"Long Term\" position that I hold? For example: My brokerage notifies me that the the call I wrote is going to be exercised. I buy another 100 shares of Shopify at market price that same day. Can I instruct my Broker to sell the shares from the new/short term position that I just opened, or are they always going to pull from the 100 shares that I wrote the covered call under? If that wouldn't work, is there another way this can be done?\n\nNote: I do know that I can reduce the risk of a contract being exercised by closing the position 1-2 weeks before expiration.

Each of those possible final prices has some probability, right? And the further you go up or down from 100, the lower the probability should be, right? That's just common sense.\n\nWhen you look at the history of a lot of different stocks for a lot of different values of T, it turns out that the distribution of prices tend to follow a log-normal distribution, which is a kind of bell curve. Statistically, 68% of the final prices for any value of T tend to be within one sigma (one standard deviation) from the mean. That gives us a way to turn delta into a probability.\n\nBasically, the value of XYZ at time T will be somewhere between the left tail end (low) of a bell curve and the right tail end (high) of a bell curve. Then delta is normalized to 0 to 100, with 0 being the low end and 100 being the high end, with the peak of the bell curve (the mean) at the most likely price, which works out to 50 delta. That means that 50% of the likely final prices of XYZ are above 50 delta and 50% of the likely final prices of XYZ are below 50 delta, after time T.

Roll the position down into a bull-call/debit spread as described here: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/05/030105.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/05/030105.asp)  So in my case, this would be done by placing an order to sell two of the 5/21 $17.5 calls at the new lower price of $50, then at the same time, buying a call with a lower strike price than what it's at currently, so at $9 (now OCGN stock price is at $9.29. The problem with this is that the site gives an example of a call with 150 days left till expiration that has only gone down by around $2. My call went down over $6 with 2 weeks left till expiration, so I don't know how effective this would be at cutting my loss.  \n\n\nC. Leg into a bull-call/debit spread by selling another call that's further OTM with the same exp as described here: [https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/how-to-fix-losing-trades-15001](https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/trading/how-to-fix-losing-trades-15001) So in my case, this would be done by buying a call at the next higher strike price of $20, for a total premium of $42. I've read that using call debit spreads will cap the upside and the downside, and it's definitely what I should have used in hindsight instead of a single long call, but is it worth it to leg into a debit spread after my call already lost $187? I don't mind that it will cap my upside, since I don't think there will be an upside, but is it better than rolling down into a debit spread, or just selling for a loss?  \n\n\nD. Do nothing since there's still 2 weeks left and implied volatility is still high at 287% (though ER is coming up on 5/14)  \n\n\nE.

From the reading I’ve done, I see that covered calls are pretty safe in terms of losses if the underlying stock does not reach my strike price. \n\nWhat I’m having trouble understanding though is how to do all the math. What I’m wanting to do is sell one contract of a $MNMD call at a $5 strike price.

This is like a self-automating buy-low sell-high tactic, and they give you premium for the privilege.  But don't sell covered calls on _all_ your shares because TSLA likes to spike 10% in a day and 20% in a week without warning.  In fact, I'd say only sell covered calls on your \"play\" shares that you use to see how well you can speculate with (or doing my put-call strategy with).\n\nAs for the next month, the premium doesn't seem to be worth the risk.  I'd definitely stick to weeklies knowing that you're going to get your shares called when it does its 10% run up.  I'd probably go with right around 10% out of the money and hope the run a) dials back the next day and isn't on a Friday, so you don't get called and b) stop selling calls when TSLA again turns into the flavor of the month and all the momentum players pile back in. \n\nWhen the technicals turn bullish and the momentum players are back in, we'll see 1000 easy this time, maybe significantly higher.  It won't last but we won't see the 600s again either.  So you don't want to have a longer term call (imo 3 weeks is too long) at 750 strike when the price is moving north of 900 and still see 3 weeks on expiration.  Stick to selling 1-2 weeks out so when it happens, you just get called and you can buy back in with minimal damage.

It didn’t help.  Maybe they were bad at their job, but responding to FUD actually caused this lawsuit.\n\n“ At Tesla, employees are expected to solve substantive work problems by communicating with anyone at any level or department within the company according to what is the fastest way to achieve the best possible solution. This is fundamental to how communication works at Tesla, and reflects the importance of putting the best interest of the company ahead of any particular department. However, this obviously doesn’t mean that employees should use this openness to advance their own personal agenda – the opposite is true – or that every time employees raise an issue within the company, that means there really is a problem or that they have the right solution or approach in mind. It also doesn’t mean that every email sent to senior Tesla leaders (particularly emails that are not relevant to our mission or the job at hand, or are clearly suspect or misleading) warrants a response, especially when they are already being looked into.\n\nAnyone looking objectively at Ms. Balan’s theories can see that they are patently false, and frankly, completely nonsensical. While at the company, Ms. Balan made a number of inaccurate claims about our selection of particular suppliers and supposed quality issues, all of which were investigated extensively and found to be entirely without merit. For example, Ms. Balan was unhappy with a particular supplier that was selected by an internal group of subject matter experts who extensively studied the issue. She took it upon herself to find an alternative supplier that had no prior relevant experience and that had failed a mandatory site inspection, and was upset when that supplier was not chosen. Additionally, with respect to complaints she made about the fabric headliners we were using, when some of them did not perfectly fit into vehicles, Tesla modified the headliner and the B-pillar sill by inserting a piece of foam to ensure a proper fit. Ms. Balan disagreed with Tesla’s engineering solution and subjectively perceived an “issue” when Tesla’s solution did not match her personal sense of what the company should have done. She also admitted that the “issue” did not impact vehicle safety in any way. Rather than working on her assignments, Ms. Balan spent company time working on a “secret project” without her manager’s approval and booked an unapproved trip to New York at Tesla’s expense to visit a potential supplier for her own personally-created project. She also illegally recorded internal conversations within Tesla without anyone’s permission, which is clearly criminal conduct. ”Finally, contrary to Ms. Balan’s claims, despite her own misconduct, she was never fired from Tesla. She voluntarily resigned – not just once, but on multiple occasions. Also contrary to her claims, she never once informed the company she had any kind of significant medical problem prior to her resignation. Ms. Balan left Tesla the first time because we had previously provided her with a special 10-month living stipend as an accommodation to help her with family issues, and she wanted that stipend to be extended even further. When we did not extend it, she quit.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that Tesla is over 33,000 people, so while we feel that this case absolutely lacks merit, there will at times be cases where Tesla is genuinely at fault. Expecting 33,000 people to be perfect is not realistic. However, when such cases arise, we will never seek to avoid responsibility. Also, due to the clickbait nature of articles about Tesla, journalists and editors who do not hold truth and appropriate context as sacred will at times write inflammatory articles and misleading headlines. We are sympathetic to the pressure they face to maximize their audience, but that does not make what they do right.”", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Is that relevant?", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "The haters are still gonna hate either way. 🤷‍♀️ Look at the way the media twists everything Elon says and he is the technoking.

It is light year's behind HBOMax and D+ in terms of content. I think VIAC has a lot of out licenses that will be coming back in a few years, but right now I just don't see the pot of gold in that product. \n\nVIAC makes a massive chunk of change off carriage fees and Paramount+ is necessary to replace those.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I agree.  Paramount has been trying to monetize their content through steaming now since streaming really came about and they've failed.  And they've failed for the reasons I outlined in another response.  Their DRM (Digital Rights Management) is (was) pure draconian and people would quickly find themselves without a device that could play the content.  (i.e. Go to Big Box Store, pick up MediaStreamBox/DVD/Bluray player, it works for 2 weeks then it becomes non-compliant.)\n\nWhat people don't realize is the absolute nightmare streaming services endure at the hands of content providers with DRM.  Which is why we're seeing a trend toward the content providers themselves streaming the content.\n\nAs DRM becomes more sophisticated and more platforms support it, content has become much more accessible for everyday users without the hassle of trying to fumble their way through a DRM compliance issue.\n\nIt used to really be just Flash Player on a computer that could handle the DRM, and a lot of people ended up on the wrong side of that as Flash Player is so clunky it couldn't really handle the graphics quality demand a good stream would provide.\n\nI've been in this fight since 2009 trying to get Netflix to work via Linux.  Linux communities consistently said they'd be generally happy to pay for content.  But what was happening was providers were asking for subscription fees, AND THEN, dictating what devices you could stream their content on, trying to double dip by getting licensing fees from device manufactures and streamers and subscription fees from the consumers themselves.\n\nSo, we'll see.  Viacom has a shit ton of content.  Disney and HBO have shown that if you have a shit ton of content, people will pay for it.  So, there's hope for Viacom.\n\nBut, to your point, if you have a premium service, it had better look, feel and operate like a premium service.  Viacom, and specifically Paramount have some work to do in that area.\n\n(EDIT 1)  Just signed up for Paramount+.  You are correct.  Total trash.  Much of the content was OTA content alongside ancient ass Comedy Central and Nick stuff.\n\nI don't know.  Definitely looks like they're fucking this up.\n\nAs I look at it, what they need is a free, commercials based service that provides all their OTA content, while offering a fee-based subscription for their cable channels.\n\nI see the question asked a lot why we can't have a la carte channel selection through our cable providers.  The streaming services have a chance to dig into that market and Viacom is WELL positioned to offer just that.\n\nFuck.  I was excited, but more hesitant now.  That was disappointing.  Going to go cancel that subscription before they charge me $5.99.\n\n(EDIT 2)  The movie selection is pretty damn old.  I'm 50 and if I haven't seen those by now, it's probably because I don't want to.  And the ones I do like I've seen enough that I probably won't miss them.  Oh no, I won't be able to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark for a 100th time.  I'll be stuck at 99 indefinitely unless I pay $5.99 a month.  \n\nThere's probably a market for it, but nothing like Disney and HBO which are two premium content creators as well as providers.  \n\nThis is looking less and less appealing unless Viacom can get us access to more recent content.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "> This is looking less and less appealing unless Viacom can get us access to more recent content.\n\nThat is my thought.

Literally, just searched Pluto TV, hit the link and was immediately watching \"The Soloist\" on my screen.  There was a guide at the bottom to scroll through for other programs.  The Soloist is just what popped up first.\n\nHere's the thing.  I run a Linux based operating system (Ubuntu) as my main media purposed machine as well as another named ArchLinux for personal computing.  And anybody that runs these platforms for media knows the headaches many content providers create by trying to protect their content via DRM (Digital Rights Management).  So, while, the content may be streamed from a Linux server (looking at you Amazon), the ability to watch the content on a Linux based machine can be problematic if the proper DRM decoding isn't happening on the receiving machine.\n\nDisney+ screwed this up pretty bad when advertising their service as being available on all devices and Linux users immediately signing up, giving Disney their money and finding out that their machines didn't qualify as \"all devices\".  This was corrected by Disney to their credit, but it did take a few weeks to work it out.\n\nThis is important to note because the average consumer doesn't have the knowledge or ability to work through a DRM issue with their device when their device somehow ends up non-compliant.  This has happened with Bluray playback devices, Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu.  Pretty much all of them.\n\nThe industry standard answer has always been to go buy a new compliant device or, in the case of Bluray, to hook up your device to the internet and download new firmware.  Given your playback device had the capability.  If not, you were fucked.\n\nAgain, this is all in a response to what the OP is talking about in the pirating industry.  The content creators are trying to protect their IP (Intellectual Property), and they have a right to do so.  But in the past, mostly it was protected via advertising.  The money these channels made was never from the consumer, but rather the advertiser.  Redistribution of free content has never really been a problem.\n\nNever really been a problem that is, until recently, when that content was making it's way into streaming services that were fee based.  Want to watch \"The Office\", no problem, every past season is on Netflix and even though at release it was free to watch on NBC via an old school antenna, now it costs you money.  Then on top of that fee, you need to jump through the hoops Netflix puts in place to ensure the content is protected from piracy.  But, yay, no commercials.  So, you've got that.\n\nThis is all to say that streaming services are still a very new thing in how we consume media. And many streaming services are struggling to maintain their fee based structure, while ALSO protecting their content from piracy (Come on, EVERYBODY has seen Game of Thrones.  There aren't that many people with HBO subscriptions.)\n\nSo, we have multiple problems in the streaming industry.  And the bulk of consumers have no idea how to navigate those problems, or even that those problems exist.  What they want to do is plug in their device hit a button and start watching TV.\n\nSo, when I say that I just opened my browser on a traditionally non-compliant device (Though I have DRM enabled through Chrome), and was able to immediately start watching TV.  No registration, no username, or more importantly password that I need to remember for my mother-in-law because she'll forget it.  Nothing.  Just log in and start streaming live TV.\n\nFuck, it doesn't even need to be good TV.  It just needs to be TV, and some shit people are familiar with or somewhat recognize.\n\nThis model is a game changer and it'll be interesting to see if it's sustainable as all revenue is going to come through advertising.  But, it's accessible in an industry that is making a lot of people feel really dumb when trying to find a way to watch The Andy Griffith Show.  Something they just got for free in the 1960's with little hassle has become so complicated that many consumers are incredibly frustrated and struggling with how all this technology has made things better and more accessible.\n\nSo, I'm in.  I'll be buying some VIAC tomorrow.\n\nI tested Pluto TV on 4 different browsers.  Chrome, Chromium, Firefox and Opera.  The only one I had an issue with was Opera, but I have that running through a VPN and other customizations.\n\nThis is a big deal.  Don't know if it'll make money in the streaming space.

Gives you nice risk/reward and also allows for some wiggle room. \n\nAlso, in a market where everything seems to be highly overvalued, I'd rather enter a trade that is fundamentally strong instead of the garbage WSB has been going after lately (e.g. MVIS).

However, FDA sent a CRL on March 1st because of the third part manufacturer and it tanked the stock. The drug is still insane and FDA has no issues but because of a third party manufacturer, the timing and development of the drug is in limbo. When I looked at MVIS, I looked at it's history as a company, it's balance sheet, it's competitors as well and I thought a lot of the hype around the stonk was grossly misleading.

Current bubble\n\nThe NYSE advance has peaked and is now declining, even though the S&P and Dow continue higher or have went flat. This indicates that while the selective market indexes are moving higher, the broader market is struggling. Characteristically, our current financial markets fit the same picture as 1998-2002.\n\nIn 1998 the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in order to reduce the chances of an economic slowdown due to material and labor shortages. After this, money flooded the market resulting in the overvaluation of many equities and dotcom runup we saw prior to the bubble.  -  (*We can relate this to coronavirus stimulus and subsequent interest rate reduction)*\n\nIn the fall of 1999, with the market at ATH, the U.S. shrugged off the emerging-market crisis and the collapse of a large hedge fund(sound familiar?), the Fed reversed course and raised rates three times in 1999.  - (*We can relate this to the current market state, with many investors believing the market cannot go down, Bill Hwangs hedge fund seemingly brushed off, and federal reserve stating interest rates will be increased in the future.)*\n\nFollowing this, in 2000 financial institutions informed their clients the tech stock were no longer undervalued and the dotcom bubble selloff began. - (*This is where I think we are heading this summer into 2022.)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nTo be clear, the outcome of the near term market relies heavily on how retail investors perceive current market conditions.  Its my belief that once the general public has enough pressure on the federal administration to fully reopen the economy then tapering will be announced, lenders will raise rates and hedging will begin... triggering the sell off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$SPY 350 & $VIX 50 by 7/15\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(Thank you to those who messaged me  with kind words and questions.

{"title": "Is NKLA undervalued or insignificant - My Nikola Clear Up", "selftext": " People seem confused about Nikola’s worth. Let’s try to clear things up. \n\nTo get into the EV stocks, best thing is to understand a bit about EV’s.\n\nWhat’s the difference between: electric vehicles, powered electric vehicles and plug-in vehicles?  Also what is the difference between hydrogen vehicles and electric vehicles? So, here is a simple explanation. \n\n**Electric, power electric and plug-in are all the same**: They run on electricity,  use a lithium battery and **need to be re-charged by plugging them into a socket.** \n\n**The hydrogen vehicles are also electric.** But, instead of a lithium battery, they have a hydrogen tank that produces the electricity. So they are similar to regular vehicles in that, **when needed, you fill up the tank, just, instead of gas, you fill it up with hydrogen.**\n\n**Pros of hydrogen vehicles?** It takes five minutes to fill up the tank.There isn’t a “range” problem with them. In theory, you can drive them very long distances as long as you have a hydrogen station along the way.\n\nAs opposed to lithium batteries. You can drive a Tesla about 200 miles before you need to recharge it. Yep, Tesla will tell you it’s 400 miles, but practically, it’s 200 (400 would be if you are driving alone, no passengers, in a straight line with nothing stopping you all the way, (like a traffic light) or slowing you down (like slopes, curves, bad weather). \n\nThis is a HUGE difference. Think about it. 200 miles is a 3 hour drive at 70 miles per hour. If you have a 4 hour drive, you will need to recharge the battery for AT LEAST one hour, and probably way more. Your 4 hour drive just turned into a 7-8 or more hours…And that is IF you have where to charge along the way.\n\nA hydrogen car you just need to refill the tank and be on your way. That sounds awesome. \n\n**Where is the catch**? Well, there are about 40000 electric charging stations in the USA. That is a solid number when compared to a bit over 100,000 regular gas stations. So, if you own an electric car, you have a decent chance of charging it. Although it might take you 4-8 hours, don’t forget. \n\nMeanwhile, there are like...wait for it...45 hydrogen stations in all of the USA. So, basically, if you have a hydrogen car (you don’t, it’s really experimental at this point), you don’t have where to fill up your tank. \n\nThe other problem with hydrogen vehicles: to “produce” the hydrogen, you need power. It doesn’t just “exist”. So you need to “manufacture” it, so to speak. Nowadays, that costs too much. That is ONE reason Elon Musk says hydrogen cars are stupid. (He is only right as long as making hydrogen remains expensive…)\n\n**But electric cars also have some important issues:**\n\nYou see, creating electricity has a price. That price depends on how you create that energy. Some electricity is super cheap, like that created using the sun, the wind or even nuclear energy. Others are expensive. Some countries have lots of electricity, others don’t. Some can create clean electricity. Others need to pollute the air in order to make electricity.\n\nSo 1st problem: electricity. If all cars would be electric cars, it would be a HUGE problem to provide electricity from a plug to all of them. In most countries or states, that wouldn’t work at all.\n\n2nd huge issue with all electric cars: where to charge them. If you live in a house, have a garage, no problems. You come home, plug it in, go to sleep, in the morning the car is charged. \n\nBut if you live in an apartment building, if you park your car in the street,  if you are too busy cause when you get back from work, you son/wife etc. take the car to do shopping, night studies, night job, whatever, when and where are you going to charge the car?\n\nBottom line: the biggest problem with electric CARS is that if everyone will have them, it will eat up too much electricity, there will be nowhere to charge them, and even worse, no time to charge them. Not everyone can have an electric car, gas cars aren’t disappearing that quickly. Too many private electric cars are going to become a huge headache. \n\nBut trucks on the other hand….let’s think about it. Everyone wants to make electric trucks (or large vans) why? Well, it’s a smaller, more manageable fleet.  They are parked at designated spots or parking lots, easier to charge in that sense, the gas/money you save by turning a truck electric as opposed to a car, is much larger, and the truck brings in revenue so that even if it’s expensive, companies can offset that cost. \n\n**So now we understand:** \n\n1. Electric cars are awesome cause they are friendly to the environment, easy to maintain, and as soon as the lithium batteries become less expensive (they will, technology is making them cheaper by the day), you will be able to afford one!\n2. Electric cars aren’t THAT awesome because it takes time and lots of electricity to charge them. Good luck doing a movie about a road trip using an electric car. You’ll have plenty of shots of people waiting at a charging station and making small-talk…\n3. Hydrogen cars can solve the charging issue except that there are no hydrogen fill up stations (almost) and hydrogen is expensive as a solution right now.\n4. The private electric car market is huge and awesome, just not as huge and as awesome as Elon Musk wants you to think it is.\n5. Trucks are actually a better market for electric vehicles in the mid-term / current long term outlook. Whoever makes a good electric truck/van is going to be in an excellent position.\n6. Equally, whoever develops hydrogen fueled cars best, will have an upper hand. \n\n**Which brings us to Nikola**. And what it has or doesn’t have. One could argue that Nikola is just a bunch of ideas. And nothing else. \n\nBut that isn’t accurate. \n\nThey actually have several patents to their name. Some of them are more related to visuals. What the truck would LOOK like. But others are about real technology. This is a big deal in a field that is all about new technology. If you own some of the concepts of how to transform that idea into a product, if you own that patent, then that can be worth a lot of money.\n\nNikola is suing Tesla for using some of its patents (the ones related to how the truck looks, not how it runs). Though the lawsuit has been ongoing for years and might keep going for a few more years, down the road it seems very probable that Tesla will need to pay Nikola a sizeable payday.\n\nSo Nikola has some value because of its patents, it’s a real player in this new technology. \n\nThe 2nd thing we know for sure is Nikola is building a factory, and that factory is in fact being built, and it will start producing something, pretty soon. We need to understand what that something is....\n\nNikola is aiming at building an electric truck. So is Tesla. Also Ford, Daimler, Volvo...this is a market where many big names want to make a splash. And then there is Rivian. They have a 100,00 truck order (!!) from Amazon. And their IPO is coming out this year. \n\n**So now that we are EV “experts”, what is Nikola worth?**\n\nNo one has a reasonable, practical EV truck (maybe except BYD. But I don’t trust Chinese companies, because they do not operate with transparency, they’re fishy to me). Whomever gets a good EV truck on the road is bound to see a pretty nice spike in stock value. \n\nRivian is planning on an IPO setting its initial value at 50 billion. Mind you, this is a company that has a 100,000 truck order for a truck that doesn’t exist yet. Its development is advanced, and they are hoping to deliver the truck to the market in the next few months. But 50 billion, considering this number can easily go to 70 as soon as the IPO is launched, is a lot of money. \n\nNikola’s current value is at 4.5 billion. They are building a factory, they have hired many, many professionals, they have patents that show they understand the technology very well, they have experience building the prototypes (through which they got the patents). They are potentially a very, very cheap stock. \n\nJust news of the factory actually working and any kind of initial pre-order doubles the price of this stock. Hold it for 2-3 years, the chances for a tenfold valuation is reasonable. \n\nAs far as Nikola’s hydrogen trucks. I wouldn’t bet on it. They need to set up the infrastructure to have hydrogen stations for filling up the tank at a national level. That is just billions of dollars in costs. They need to create the technology that lowers the cost of providing the hydrogen. That still doesn’t exist at a satisfying level. I wouldn’t build on that as an investor. If they do somehow get that going, their value increases through the roof. But if they start focusing on it too much, they could waste lots of money, like they have done before. \n\n**Bottom line:** NKLA isn’t as dead as people think, IMO. It has value, it has a real plan, it’s focusing on the right market (the trucks) and it will be worth way more. It isn’t going up anytime soon.

Just know there will ALWAYS be a good time to buy, and take some of your profits on the way so you can use those funds for pet investments and YOLO trades. Don't sell all, just sell some and only when you need to or only when it will be used for a bigger possible payoff somewhere else and the odds are truly in your favor. Reinvest when appropriate. Comparing the stock now to where it started will always make you feel like you missed the train. Instead, look at it in context. Is now a good time this year? Does it look attractively priced compared to where it could reasonably go? Do you have some tidbit of info that others haven't taken notice of yet? If so, then go for it. If you would prefer it at a different price and that price is within the expected range of volatility, set it to buy at that price and move along to focus on something else in the meantime. But there really is no time like the present for companies like AAPL. World stopping pandemics don't happen every day, and no one can really predict that sort of thing. I just set YOLO money aside for when those events happen so I can take advantage and buy extremely low on companies like AAPL. Otherwise I just use dollar cost averaging and don't let myself focus on regret or FOMO. \n\nPpl always say this isn't a casino, but I apply a couple simple rules for myself at both places, and the only time I lose is when I exceed those limits. \n\n1. Never use money you can't stand losing. The road to BK is littered with those who had a sure bet, went all in, and lost. If you are limited for resources, put the money in things less risky until you have more room to breathe. For instance, if I gamble at a casino, I start with like $20 (or whatever I am reasonably ok with losing that day). If I lose that, I allow myself another $20. If I lose that I walk. No ifs ands or butts.  I don't even bring more money than that, nor do I bring my credit cards. I make sure I have my apple pay or whatever or a prepaid debit card to use in case of emergency, but can't use that at casinos nor with trading so it keeps my money safe from my idiot impulses. I only gamble when I want to go drinking for free, so for me casinos actually save me money lol. But even so, I set a limit for the day, and I don't exceed that limit. I do the same with trading. Only deposit what I can safely fuck off with, and if I can't fuck off with it, that money goes into boring shit I know it will at least be stable in. Doing this has served me extremely well. \n\n2. Play on profits- The minute you have your initial investment plus a bit of padding, pull the initial investment money out or protect it accordingly and use the rest of the profits to fuck off with. If I lose that, who cares? It is money invested into the experience and knowledge I gain from it, or the fun I had being stupid with it. Sure I could have walked with more, but why not have a little fun instead? Keeps things interesting. \n\n3. Don't get greedy - With longterm holds, I just make sure I set a stop loss at a place I will feel ok about getting out w initial investment ➕ a little on top...and then just monitor the markets.  Take profits when it would be stupid not to and let the flux slide through my mind because there will always be another uptick and another correction.. I go through my stops and adjust as necessary so I'm not sold out of a position I'm willing to ride out a correction on, but when greed hits on a bull run, I know it's time to get out. At least for a short time. I can always get back in if I didn't fuck myself by going all in with money I can't lose. \n\n4. Never ever forget that the House Always Wins. My task is to be nimble, move quickly when needed, and minimize my exposure to their fuckery. That's why I trade companies I know a bit about or industries I know, and at casinos I play roulette and poker, never craps and never slot machines. If I do play those games, I refer back to rule 1. Always taking them head on with no advantage means I will never gain because my losses will be too great at some point and then I can't keep playing. When working with limited resources compared to the opponent, you need to press every small advantage and minimize weak points. Like Ali said \"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee\". Know the system you are working within and utilize womp-rat sized holes whenever you find them. Even your odds of good outcomes by only playing games with a high enough payout with money you can stand to lose (especially if it is high risk) and where you have an advantage, even if it is a small one. But then refer to rules 2 and 3 when you seem to be on a streak. \n\n5. Remember! What goes up, must come down. It may not drop to where it started, but there is always a correction coming. If I have followed my rules, that correction either won't actually touch me, or I've made enough good moves to have a buffer for when it hits and am positioned to take advantage of the downturn rather than getting fucked in the ass w out lube by it. \n\nI'm up on both gambling and my trades even though I have taken losses at both at times. No one can perfectly time markets or casinos, but knowing the system and having MY system helps. Over the whole scope I am up.

{"title": "RKT earnings options play", "selftext": "Right now, I see a unique options play on RKT earnings. If you were to acquire some OTM call options for the may 7th 23.50 strike, if the calls go in the money and you pay 50 bucks for each contract, big fat ROI over  5 day time period.\n\nCurrent vol and open interest on the call side is rather high. We are not seeing a ton of trading volume for the shares of RKT, but I personally believe this is the calm before the storm.\n\nTherefore - I believe the price of RKT call options are grossly mispriced and the potential for the stock to move 10% or higher shortly before and after earnings is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25-40%. Historically this has happened before so it's not outside the realm of possibility. Because the stock stays stable for so long, calls are much cheaper than gambling on something like MVIS or GME (I guess due to implied volatility being lower comparatively).\n\nThe keener among you may have seen how this played out with short dated Tesla options on last Friday. The stock was trading down.. then did a complete upwards reversal, turning 1500 dollar call options into 30,000-50000 dollars in one day for seemingly no reason.\n\nUsually I never take the risk on short dated OTM calls but this time it's different. I think there is too much evidence stacking up to the fact that RKT has something under their sleeves for this earnings call. Fundamentally I expect a strong beat.. but they could also announce another special dividend or stock buyback. This is your time to buy the rumor sell the news.\n\nTLDR, buy lots of RKT call options expiring 5/7 at the 23.50 strike or higher. I'm holding 2 contracts at the 23.50 may 7 strike. I plan on scoping more contracts up if the stock falters tomorrow then holding through earnings. If you want less risk - you can opt for the longer dated contracts just in case the market is stupid and doesn't react to RKT earnings by Friday. Just keep in mind that the further out in date you go - the more expensive the contracts are. I guess you COULD just buy shares too. There is more upside with calls, albeit you are risking more in exchange for the increased leverage.\n\n\\*EDIT\\* added more positions\n\n# 🚀\n\n# 🚀\n\n# 🚀\n\n# 🚀\n\n[Options](https://preview.redd.it/093ozm5n74x61.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=50e52f6db90fed8b596da91b8a490eb390d6f8c9)\n\n[Shares](https://preview.redd.it/yl4c2c2u74x61.png?width=1107&format=png&auto=webp&s=049536957551abb6e4071ddfc7f5b10ea29fe8d3)", "id": "n45z4d", "created_utc": 1620072588.0, "score": 273, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "Last spike was 5-6 days after earnings, earliest expiry for my 24 call options is May 21st just to be safe.
