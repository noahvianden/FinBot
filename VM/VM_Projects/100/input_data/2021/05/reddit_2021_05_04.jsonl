The indicator can help day traders confirm when they might want to initiate a trade, and it can also be used to determine the placement of a stop-loss order. Typically, the number of periods used in the calculation is 14 (days, weeks, etc.). Day traders can use ATR information, about how much an asset typically moves in a certain period, for plotting profit targets, and for determining whether to attempt a trade. Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that measures volatility. As with most of his indicators, Wilder designed ATR with commodities and daily prices in mind.

It is a daily two-bar chart pattern that contains a price range which is both above and below the prior day’s range. It also features a higher high and a lower low on the second day when compared to the bar of the first preceding day. On a candlestick chart, you will see a larger candle than the previous day’s candle. It is essentially the opposite of an inside day candle. An outside day candle, in a general sense, means that volatility is increasing due to a much larger range of prices than the previous day. It can also be an indication of an outside reversal, which means that the price of a stock begins moving in the opposite direction from the previous trend.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah makes sense.

Its a contract where the buyer of the call is buying the right to purchase the stock at the strike price by the date of the contract.  So if a call is listed at .60 5/21 $12 you are paying $0.60/share (calls are contracts of 100 shares, so it would cost $60) for the right to buy the shares for $12 by 5/21.  On 5/22, if the price of the stock isn't at least $12.01, the contract expires worthless.  Also consider that you paid a premium of $0.60/share, so your breakeven wouldn't be until it's above $12.60/share.\n\nIf the stock went to $13/share, you'd be getting a discount of $0.40/share and could immediately sell the shares for $40 profit.  Most people that are interested in the quick money like that won't even buy the shares, they'll sell their contract as it would then be worth like $2.00/share if it goes well above the strike price before expiration.  Then you're looking at a profit of $140 for example.\n\nI think only like 8% of contracts are actually exercised.  23% expire worthless and 69% are sold/closed before expiration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you already own shares of CLOV (at least 100) you could write a contract that would obligate you to sell your shares if the contract went into the money.  The reason most people do this is because they don't think it will actually hit that price within that timeframe and they pocket the premium up front.  So the writer of our call from the above example gets $0.60/share up front = $60.  If the contract expires worthless, they keep the whole $60.  Most people will buy to close the contract as it gets close to $0, so maybe they buy to close for $10 and pocket $50.\n\nIf the contract does go into the money and they don't close out, they keep the profit on the shares, up to the contract price, plus the premium they received for the contract.  So again, using our above example, if the stock was at $10 when they wrote the $12 call, but it goes up to $13, they sell 100 shares at $12 each, plus the $0.60 in premium, so $2.60 profit per share ($260 total profit).  They miss out on that extra $0.40, but hey, profit is profit.\n\nEDIT: Also, if you're able to sell multiple contracts over a few weeks or months, you're indirectly bringing down your cost basis.  So if you pocketed like $0.60/share 4 times and you had bought in at $12.00, you're really at like $10.60/share without having bought more shares to average down.  Then you can sell for profit at like $11, even though you bought in at $12.\n\nCheck out /r/thetagang if this sounds appealing.  /u/RealLifeFF just tagging you cause I edited.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "CLOV had been getting absolutely wrecked.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "After I jumped in with no toilet paper and a wet shit. \nIt tanked.\nOh well riding this out win or loose.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Bought in yesterday.

Full disclosure i have 100 shares and 2 short puts on AMD expiring 5/7 @$85. here we go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why buy?**\n\n$AMD released their earnings last week with some pretty stellar results both on YoY and vs consensus estimate. They increased their full year guidance from a 37% YoY growth to 50%, and what does the market do? It dumps the crap out of the stock down almost $12 from earnings intraday high of $89. \n\nThey say stonk prices are valued by future potential and not past performance, and it seems the market doesn't like good earnings or upgrades to forecasts. This I don't understand and this market movement downwards presents an opportunity to buy in when the stock is undervalued. \n\nAs a gamer, i recognise how AMD has transformed over the years, and simply as a chip maker its clearly the market leader in CPU's now, and with an all encompassing monopoly over the current of consoles. There's simply no downside to their current trajectory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chip shortage.**\n\nThe elephant in the room is obviously the global chip shortage. I believe this is the core reason for all the FUD. If we dig a bit deeper the chip shortage is really because of Covid, more people at home to work, play and learn means more demand for tech, which is a great thing in the mid to long run. \n\nBut I believe that the market is being short sighted at the moment, focussing in, and penalising AMD because of their percieved risk around being able to pump out enough stock to meet demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final thought**\n\nEnd of the day, i think if your investment horizon is more than 12months, there is a pretty strong bull case for AMD. Looking at the 1 year chart, there is a pretty strong support around $73-75.\n\nAs always do your own research , but hopefully you'll see what a massive potential AMD is.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cznh9hm6j3x61.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=f982f936b4337cca2f1b63452b526fc0045cda1b", "id": "n4ncpw", "created_utc": 1620131959.0, "score": 415, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 192, "comments": [{"body": "1 year? excuse me this is a casino", "score": 127, "replies": [{"body": "Farm those free drinks at the penny slots", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 150, "replies": [{"body": "Or maybe Nvidia is just overvalued.", "score": 85, "replies": [{"body": "not rly they are shitting gold lmao", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "Sold out shit the moment it drops", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "The same could be said for AMD though.", "score": 20, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nvidia isn't worth a ton of money because of their consumer desktop graphics cards dude.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Same could be said for AMD, they are starting to rip Intel a new one in the HPDC and Server segments.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nvidia Revenue 2020 was $16b.

{"title": "AMD: An explanation on merger arbitrage and how to play it for big gains", "selftext": "I read long and boring white papers from really smart people so you apes don't have to. Here's the gist.\n\n**Background:** AMD expected 37% growth this year but in Q1 revised it to 50% growth. Meanwhile, Intel expects -1% growth. Analysts continually upgrade AMD to Buy increasing price targets. The current medium target is $106 with a high of $135, the stock is at $77. Why is it so low and not moving?\n\n**Merger Arbitrage:** In October of last year AMD announced it was acquiring XLNX in an all-stock fixed ratio deal. That is, 1.72 shares of AMD for every 1 share of XLNX. This action immediately kicks off hedge fund arbitrageurs to do their thing. For the smooth brainers, Arbitrage is the trading of the same asset on different mediums to profit from the difference (I had to look it up too). \n\nAfter merger announcement, XLNX jumped to a share ratio of \\~1.55, about 10% off of the 1.72 final merger price. The 10% difference is there because of the possibility the deal will not actually close. Arbitrageurs aim to profit from this difference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/public.tableau.com\\/profile\\/upndown#!\\/vizhome\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\\_16114624177710\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/wvsnql2p64x61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b19380ad8d798a8e2c8c6d8736d97714c553cd)\n\nIn an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the 10% price difference. So long as the deal goes through, the profits are locked in and guaranteed with this strategy, no matter how the market moves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/papers.ssrn.com\\/sol3\\/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/gi31myc384x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=46b1036b008d8c9fea2f74996f7e3c5cf70410e2)\n\nWhat sucks about this is that all the short selling always causes the acquirer stock to go down. That's what's happening to AMD. AMD's daily volume is \\~50M with 20% of it being short selling. Hedge funds know people like AMD so they can play another game on top of the arbitrage which is to shoot for Max Pain. Not to be confused with the awesome video game series. Max Pain is when they can get the price of a stock to the point where the most option holders lose the most money. Meaning no matter if you bought calls or puts, you lose, they win. \n\nSo how does one win? I wouldn't recommend doing what they do because there's the potential for unlimited loss if the merger falls through. But once the merger is complete, the short selling stops and the stock normalizes. In the case of AMD, normal is 25% above the current price, that's going to be a huge jump.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/papers.ssrn.com\\/sol3\\/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/xijh87hfb4x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc144da8bbba46b37ddb59f18d306bbad6104599)\n\nI think the safe play would be to buy XLNX stock, so one gets the \\~10% discount, and buy LEAPS on AMD (long calls expiring after the merger). \n\nFor example, if one buys AMD calls at a $80 strike expiring in June 2022 for $12, if the stock were to merely normalize to $106 at the end of the year after the merger, the options would be worth $26, an easy 110% profit.\n\nThe other, more riskier option, is to buy AMD options expiring throughout the year, hoping the negative pressure of the short selling arbitrage stops before the merger. This can happen if XLNX shares get too close to the 1.72 ratio, then arbitrage doesn't work and the short selling stops which will push AMD higher. Or if AMD shares jump huge suddenly, which can happen on some amazing news, or if AMD decides to offer dividend payments, or especially if the deal falls through, which will force hedge funds to cover early, thus pushing the stock even higher all at once, to the moon.\n\nEither way, this negative pressure from arbitrage short selling has an end date. The fundamentals are so good, one could bet on it.\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. I don't really know what I'm doing. But I like the stock.  \nPositions: I'm doing both strategies and own AMD shares and call options spread across this year and next year.

It's one thing to make grammatical, spelling errors in writing (which you might find many in my comments and posts here) but saying 2M in a place of 1.64M is not about the language barrier. He might have made the trade, it was an extremely ballsy call no doubt. Despite that courageous call he appeared like a fake/liar due to his questionable claims about that trade.
