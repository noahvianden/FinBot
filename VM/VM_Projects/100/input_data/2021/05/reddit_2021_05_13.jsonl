Max gain is $6.01 against a $1.99 initial investment.\n\nObviously this is a highly simplified example with ideal prices and entries/exits, but you get the idea. If SPY moves bigly in either direction it'll wreck the trade, if it goes ITM the options at the same strike will quickly approach the same value as the extrinsic value evaporates. The short leg will catch up to the long leg and you would either have to BTC for a loss or roll and hope the direction changes.

And if you look at Tesla's stock value and when Musk gave that \"end of 2020\" timeline, it did absolutely nothing for the stock price, and it's not been something that anyone is really talking about, analysts or investors.\n\nAs for the 4680 cells, at batteryday (septemper 2020), Musk said it would take them probably 12-18 month to just start realizing advantages from this new approach, but realistically he thought it would probably take 3 years to *fully* realize the advantages. So if they achieve volume production 18 months from today, I'd say that fits very well with what he said at battery day?\n\nAnd for individual products like the semi, CT, roadster. Yeah these are obviously not on the originally stated timeline. That's hardly something that's really surprising or \"an issue\" though. Not that uncommon for new vehicles to not meet initial timelines. In Tesla's case, the reasons seem to mainly be due to things like not having production to meet demand, so they have to prioritize. As well as new productions methods taking a bit longer work out. again hardly a big issue since they're not even done building the factory yet. Neither of which I'd say mean that Tesla is having \"issues\" with their progress on these fronts. \n\nAs for other tech names and their stock movements compared to Tesla. Like I said, Tesla's stock movement has been very volatile since day 1, so it tend to move more in both directions than other similar stocks, but it still follows the same trends. In this case, most of the tech and growth stocks basically got hit starting around mid february, and are lower today than when that started, including companies in FAANG or Nvidia. The only ones that seem to have managed to increase from there are some of the super profitable mega cap tech stocks like MS, Facebook and Google.\n\nAt the end of the day, Tesla's stock started dropping along with the rest of the tech and growth stocks, and has more or less been following the wider movement trends that those stocks have been seeing since. \n\nAnd they seem to pretty well on track with the big key initiatives of the company like building new production facilities, developing their next gen batteries, and being on track for the expected growth, which ultimately matter far more than whether or stuff like the CT ends up being delayed half a year", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Let‚Äôs be real: the only product/initiative they were on time with was Model Y.\n\nThis is a $600+ billion company.

That‚Äôs not accurate. Half of ARKKs 2025 $3000 price target includes robotaxi.

And that was a big deal after the call because they wasn‚Äôt even going to bring it up unless analyst Pierre Ferragu asked about it.\n\nOn a percentage basis, TSLA is down ~30% from their February high.  The other tech companies I mentioned haven‚Äôt dropped that much.  Yeah maybe the charts follow each other, but the magnitude of TSLA‚Äôs drop has been much more severe.\n\nI appreciate your optimism, like I said I‚Äôm also long.

Largely because what they do is extremely hard and musk gives very aggressive timelines. However the only times this really seemed to matter was during Tesla's production hell during the Model 3 ramp. Ever since then no one's really cared that the products like the semi or roadster have been mia for years, probably because Tesla keep scaling up productions while growing sales, profitability, and reiterating that their demand continues to outstrips production capacity.\n\nApple makes a tiny phone that is vastly easier to produce, so it's not a comparison that makes a lot of sense to me, they're very different things.\n\nAnd yeah, some of Arks 2025 price targets assume that there will be robotaxi's driving around. but again, that's a 2025 estimate, we're in 2021 talking about Tesla not having robotaxis driving around at the end of 2020. It's also no like they don't have price targets that don't include robotaxi and autonomy\n\nAs for Adam Jones, he's been fairly conservative with his Tesla price estimates for years, however in mid february this year, basically just as the tech and growth stocks started dropping, he gave a bull case price target on Tesla for 1200 per share. This was after Tesla didn't have a million robotaxi's driving on the roads at the end of 2020 like Elon had said at autonomy day. So when even the more bearish analysts start giving bull case price targets after Tesla's failure to do robotaxi's by the end of 2020, I don't really find the argument that Tesla missing robotaxi's by the end of 2020 was a big deal to super convincing\n\nI'm definitely not trying to give Tesla a free pass, I feel like I'm generally one of the people throwing cold water on some of the stuff that get's said and posted in this sub. \n\nLike, I don't have a problem saying that I personally think Tesla's share price is overvalued even at current values.

{"title": "Let's discuss recent losses", "selftext": "Without mincing words, I've taken some painful losses in the last week. Got murdered when LMND, AMD punched through my put credit spreads. A lot of people on r/thetagang are feeling the pain in other underlyings, too, judging by the tenor of the memes lately. My goal with this post is not just to commiserate, but also to discuss lessons learned and strategies for managing losing trades.\n\nI'll go first. **Lessons learned:**\n\n1.  If you find yourself wincing at the losses, swinging despair and elation, if your trades keep you up at night, you've bet too big and too risky. This was mistake #1 for me: trading too big. Find your own personal risk tolerance threshold. This comes naturally from regular trading. \n\n2. What's more, once you discover your risk tolerance, you'll quickly get a feel for what is a \"good deal\", i.e. to sell overpriced volatility.\n\n3. Educate yourself. I lost money because I was impatient, greedy and didn't fully understand the implications of my trades. Tastytrade is IMO the best resource for theory and practice of selling options.\n\n**Strategies for managing losing trades**\n\n1. Did you sell a spread or simple CSP and the price of the underlying is grinding down towards your short strike? Consider rolling out to a later expiration. This way you will have more time to be right. Do this especially if you believe the underlying just needs more time to rebound. If rolling out, make sure you can do so for a credit. This is usually possible when the price of the underlying is hovering around your short strike, aka the \"dance floor\". If the price has punched too far below the short strike and has approached or even breached your long put (as in a spread), you will probably *pay* to roll out.\n\n2. If you have a delta-neutral trade on (iron condor, strangle), roll the untested side. Whichever side of the trade has produced a profit, roll it down (if you've sold a call spread and the underlying has dropped) or up (if you've sold a put spread and the underlying has gone up).\n\n3. If you're near max loss, you have two choices: capitulate or wait for expiration. If you're already close to max loss, just waiting to expiration will give you a chance to be right for very little risk (since you only have a little more to lose, but a lot to gain). If you have the choice of closing the trade for little extrinsic value in order to avoid further bleeding, that's the alternative.\n\nI'm in a tricky spot with my LMND 6/18 75/65 put spread. LMND is trading around 60 as I write this and I'm facing about 50% of my max loss of $1000 on the trade. The current $500 loss could become a $1000 loss if I wait 36 days to expiry, or maybe LMND could bounce back.\n\nHow are your positions doing? What have you learned?

Every person I know that goes into the market with this mentality ends up getting creamed eventually.\n\nThe reality is that the stock market is all about *timing*, and while you may think you can time the market, you probably can't. \n\nLook at what happened with the inflation numbers this week. Inflation came in way, way above even the high end of consensus, showing an upward trend for the last 4 months that should scare everyone. What should have happened is the US dollar should have tanked and gold should have risen, but the exact opposite happened. Why? Because the pulse on the street seems to be that the economy is strong enough for the Fed to sell down its balance sheet to correct inflation. Time will tell if they're right or not. Given that unemployment is also high and that people seem quite content to stay at home and spend government money right now, I have my doubts.\n\nSo what should you do? Buy gold? Well if the narrative is right, you'll just lose money doing that. So buy equities? Well if the narrative is wrong and we end up back in something like stagflation with double digit interest rates, you'll get clobbered as discount valuations tank. Buy bonds? Well if the economy goes into a recession and the Fed decides to worry about that rather than the inflation from all this money printing, you'll get killed and be wishing you bought gold. \n\nTiming is key and you only have milliseconds to react, which means you need foresight. Foresight into the news (phychic?), and political motivations; but nothing moves it more than narrative. Are you privy to the narrative the big market players are operating on? Unless you're on the board for Goldman Sachs, probably not.\n\nWithout being able to time the market, your optimal strategy is buy, hold, and diversify. Don't buy anything you don't plan on holding for at least 5 years. That is the only way, and the realization I think most mature investors eventually come to.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Strategy **is** what makes for good trading. Timing is part of trading strategy and timing applies to buy/hold just as much as theta, FDs and everything else, so not sure what you are driving at. You need to time the market to get in for a buy and hold just as you would for other strategies. \n\nNot sure what your inflation discussion has to do with anything. You say timing is what makes trades win and then explain what should have happened to USD/Gold based on movement/expectation. None of that has anything to do with your emphasis on timing trades, that is analysis you would do when you're deciding what position to take. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Timing is key and you only have milliseconds to react\n\nI am not sure what kind of trading you do, but I do not need to make trades in milliseconds. This is thetagang, major strategies here are to buy a stock, hold and sell CCs against it, add in hedges and do weekly/monthly strategies. The most time-sensitive actions are usually on very volatile movements where you want to capture a premium top, and this is usually a progressive situation but can require very precise timing to take advantage of big/asks.\n\nYou do not need to time the market to the millisecond to profit. Stocks are not +100% and then down back to even within a millisecond. You can be minutes, days, even weeks late to the party and still make money. Prime example was the GME squeeze, which lasted for months. You could have bought it at $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, and still made money. \n\nMMs are better suited to maximize profits from movements, but you do not need to maximize every position, it is not possible. If I could have made 53.14% from making a perfect trade with perfect timing but I was late and made 31.75% I will not consider that a failed trade. I made less than the absolute maximum, but it was a very profitable trade.\n\nLastly, buy and hold is not trading, it is parking money. This is completely different. This is like comparing walking to driving a car. Yes, you are technically \"moving\" but mechanically it is very different. The fact you say to buy and hold for 5 years is laughable. That is a very long time in which companies can go sideways, down, or even collapse and die. You have NO control over your ROI because you are not doing anything active about it, you are on the sidelines watching, peeking into the room and hoping.

(which is more like half that if you consider them being able to pay off their debt) While also getting news that they are literally sold the fuck out from the start of the quarter??\n\nWhy did it randomly decide to pop on the 30th and then continue it's decent into hell? Keeping in mind, tech looked like this. So it certainly wasn't going along with the market that day\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ic907jlxdsy61.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d048dfb7b5335b7b41df45dcd1b1f00f2cec77a\n\nThis is fucking why.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cxmt4p4aesy61.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=79d46fef2330a621f275ec61619f35dd2209baca\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4jsjfunbsy61.png?width=1481&format=png&auto=webp&s=02f060842eb84507a9852305be690ad86e9e2686\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShort interest only gets reported in two week intervals. On the 30th, the shorts have to either cover or it gets reported. It was building up over 8 weeks straight. Right after that, the downward pressure continued. There was no news that day, nothing.\n\nYes yes, soon after everything else went to shit and TSLA got fucked even harder. With all the shit that's happened this year with short squeezes, I suspect that shorts are just a tiny bit more hesitant about disclosing their positions. This is not a fucking short squeeze so don't start that ape shit.\n\nThe 15th is on Saturday, so they'll have to close out their position by Friday and send the stock up. It might be down in the depths of hell by then so even a 20% day won't really mean much.

{"title": "Why potential inflation could lead to a financial crisis?", "selftext": "**A bit of history**\n\nThe decade of the 2000s may have been a pretty good decade in many aspects, movies such as the lord of the rings or harry potter were released; music albums such as The Strokes' \"Is this It\" or Bob Dylan's \"Modern Times\" were released. Nevertheless, this decade was not a good one in economic terms. This decade started with the dotcom crash, which was triggered by the rise and fall of technology stocks. And, this was not the only remarkable economic event of this decade, when the economy seemed to have recovered from this crisis, another crisis broke out, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, triggered by the collapse of the housing market in the U.S. All these economic turbulences can be clearly seen in the evolution of the S&P500 between 2000 and 2010 as shown in Figure 1.\n\n[Figure 1. S&P500 \\(2000 -2010\\)](https://preview.redd.it/6g7jwgdjnuy61.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddf64cd6bce2330521f414c2533359a5ca76ac8)\n\n**A time of low interest rates**\n\nMoreover, these economic disturbances led governments to act severely. Keynesian policies for the activation of the economy began to play a fundamental role. To encourage consumption, interest rates were lowered to near historic lows. Figure 2 displays the US 10 year note bond yield between 1920 and 2020. In this figure, we can see how the dotcom crash pushed down this yield. However, after that it started recovering until July 2007, when the financial crisis started, after that, that yield continued a downward trend.\n\n[Figure 2. US 10 Year Note Bond Yield](https://preview.redd.it/p7mnvg3gduy61.png?width=746&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbd8e007d5d740cf3bd371bc53dba2a8a59df93d)\n\n**Stocks as the only attractive investment vehicle**\n\nSuch a long period of low interest rates inflated stock prices. Figure 3, shows how cyclically adjusted S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio has been rising during the last decade, being quite high in comparison to other periods of time (specially before the dot-com bubble). Stock prices started trading at a premium, because there were no attractive alternative investments, this channelled much of the liquidity into equities (bonds with almost no interest or even negative interests were not an attractive investment anymore).  Moreover, this low interest rate setting has prompted greater investor leverage, due to its low cost. Hence, low interest rates justify high stock prices, since stocks are highly attractive relative to bonds.\n\n[Figure 3: Cyclically adjusted S&P 500 price-to-earnings rations](https://preview.redd.it/9al89cizwuy61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=63a21d3c6b829fdb2c9427c653a7da1421bfb274)\n\n**An unexpected event: A global pandemic**\n\n2020 was not a good year, this year will always be remembered as the year of the COVID. COVID brought many changes in our lives, which undoubtedly had an impact on the economy.    As a result, governments continued to pursue stimulative policies and interest rates remained at very low levels.\n\nOne of the best illustrations of those stimulative policies is the amount of dollars printed in 2020: 21% of the United States dollar was printed in 2020, as shown in Figure 4. This large injection was used for both direct and indirect assistance in the COVID situation. This, at the same time, indirectly channelled part of this aid to the financial markets, increasing their value.\n\n[Figure 4. Annual Money Stock Growth \\(Trillions of USD\\)](https://preview.redd.it/l0c36b3gzuy61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf093aa9e839d942d3f65b3a9f875b37858e060c)\n\n**A  double-edged sword**\n\nInjecting money to the economy is always something controversial. Through the law of supply and demand it is easy to infer that a considerable increase in supply (without a similar increase in demand) will reduce the price of a good.  In money, when this happens, we say that the money loses value, i.e. one monetary unit can acquire fewer products. In other words, this is what we call inflation. Even Warren Buffet has shown concern for inflation in the past month:\n\n>\"**We are seeing very substantial inflation \\[...\\] We are raising prices. People are raising prices to us and it‚Äôs being accepted.‚Äù**\n\nThis raise on prices can be  already tracked on several indices such as Bloomberg's agriculture index, shown in Figure 5 and also in the annual single-family home price, as shown in Figure 6.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 5. Bloomberg agriculture index](https://preview.redd.it/ad6oocg86vy61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=145f863fb092b97f061d7cff98b2b3361a519ac9)\n\n[Figure 6. Annual Single-family home price \\(extracted from: https:\\/\\/www.bloomberg.com\\/news\\/articles\\/2021-05-11\\/u-s-home-prices-surge-the-most-on-record-in-buying-frenzy?sref=RJ2RlMrh\\)](https://preview.redd.it/5oc8mgum6vy61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=558de3a89d40db8d9c9a511318ebb4e9178ebbdc)\n\nThe appearance of inflation means that interest rates should rise. Something that was already pointed by Janet Yellen at the start of this month:\n\n>**‚ÄúIt may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn‚Äôt overheat‚Äù**\n\nBut what would happen if inflation persists and interest rates have to be risen? Remember that I previously said that stocks are trading at a premium due to the lack of attractive alternative investments. This would no longer be true and this premium would no longer be a thing. In addition, an increase in interest rates would reduce the attractiveness of leverage, thereby encouraging investor's deleverage. And, thus, we should expect a decrease in the stock price.\n\n**The market can not be timed**\n\nEven with all these indicators, it is difficult to say whether this will happen in the short to medium term. There are many factors which could deter inflation away and interest rates low. As an example, Berkshire Hathaway has been stacking cash during the last years, as shown in Figure 7, playing a slightly more defensive position. This may be due the fact that they already saw that low interest rates during the last decade were driving the stock market at high prices. However, interest rates are still low and during that time the stock market has continued rising.\n\n[Figure 7. Berkshire's Cash Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/3ag5lqt6cvy61.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=f91b8be62cb599332c4c1404ef878e6dcf6529a3)\n\n**Summary**\n\n* The first decade of the 2000s was characterized by two economic crisis, which defined an economy with very low interest rates\n* Low interest rates increased stock market prices, since there were no attractive alternative investments and leverage was cheap. Thus, stock markets traded at a premium.\n* The Covid crisis led to a massive injection of money into the economy.\n* This money injection is a double-edged sword which may have brought an exuberance illusion awakening a ghost that has been dormant in recent years, inflation.\n* The emergence of inflation would imply an increase in interest rates.\n* An increase in interest rates would mean that the premium paid for stocks would be lost.\n* Despite all these facts, timing the market is no easy task. And thus, other factors could keep inflation away and interest rates away, prolonging this situation.", "id": "nbdztx", "created_utc": 1620903726.0, "score": 1128, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 406, "comments": [{"body": "Hoard cash to buy the dip, but don't hoard cause inflation?
