A strangle involves buying a call and a put at different strike prices. What you are describing is a straddle (same strike price). The volatility characteristics are still the same.\n\nYou are positive gamma, meaning you are really banking on a larger move in the SPY than what is already priced in. You are also positive vega so an increase in IV is helpful for this position.\n\nTheta is going to be especially working against you in a long straddle. You also picked a 4 week expiration period which is when the time-value of an option decays at a much accelerated rate. Everyday that the SPY does not move sharply, you are losing money.\n\nThe trade is simple, yes. However, you need a movement in the SPY that is beyond both the price of the call and the put. This is typically greater than a 1 standard deviation move. If the SPY does not move enough, you lose everything.\n\nTracking the VIX is important when trading SPY.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The VIX essentially represents the implied volatility of the SPY 30 dte option. However, it is also the annualized rate. So for example if the SPY closed at 400 and the VIX is at 10, it means that in one year you can expect the spy to move +/- 40 with a 68% certainty (1 standard deviation).\n\nHere is a quick video explaining the relationship between SPX and VIX https://youtu.be/BcA5c46B1QY\n\nRemember, an option's implied volatility represents the 1 standard deviation move up or down of the stock price for that particular strike and dte.\n\nWith regards to your strangle/straddle question. If you bought an at-the-money straddle vs strangle where both the call and put are equidistant from the stock price... Without factoring in volatility skew there is no directionality preference. If you looked at the profit & loss chart of both spreads you will see that being true. Straddles are V-shaped while strangles are U-shaped.\n\nOf course you can make either spread bullish or bearish by moving your strike prices together.\n\nLong strangles are cheaper than long straddles because you are buying out-the-money calls and puts. This means that the underlying has to move the combined cost of the call and put above or below your upper or lower strikes. This is less likely to happen.\n\nSo anytime you in a positive gamma position (meaning you require a market move), you will be negative theta. You have paid money (net debit) to open your position and the time value of your option will decay every passing day (theta decay). If you look at a chart of theta decay versus time to expiration, you will notice that theta decays at an accelerated rate the closer you get to expiration. This rate is especially fast when there are less than 30 days. You give yourself very little room for error when you go with these options. https://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/2434/are-there-comprehensive-analyses-of-theta-decay-in-weekly-options\n\nYou have to understand how the impact of changes in IV will affect option pricing. Usually when there is a binary event such as earnings you will expect to see a drop in implied volatility after. This will decrease the price of options. Since you are positive vega (increase in iv helps you, decrease hurts you), that's bad. We can only speculate as to when this information will be released and how that will affect IV so you have to take that into consideration.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">Probably whatever it drops to at end of day tbh, the coin might get some long weekend pump.

MM can buy stock so if they have to return the stock they don't have to buy it at an inflated price.\n\nThey have the ability to move the stock around a bit in order to make more of their sold options expire worthless, but they don't have total control of the stock, especially if whales are loading / unloading.\n\nThere are also sold options by retail / non market makers (not a huge part of the market but need to mention) that are calculated into the max pain that market makers don't care about. They only care about their positions, and again since there are multiple market makers one may have sold a ton of calls and wants the stock to go down, one might have sold more puts and wants the stock to go up.\n\nSo its a very complicated system, and max pain isn't some magical number that must be hit each week, but it does give a sense where the market makers probably want the stock to end up.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "So max pain is not entirely made up?

For Tesla though... max pain is much more real. Something like a QUARTER of ALL OPTIONS premiums are from Tesla. It is the most heavily traded security by dollar amount on almost every trade day, and it is far far far and away the most heavily traded in terms of derivative contracts. My guy at SIG (one of the biggest option sellers in the world) says working Tesla is like trying to take a sip of water out of a firehose. So normally max pain isn't especially important, since the bulk of value any given day is tied to the trading of shares, with not that much at risk (relatively speaking) on either end through derivatives. But given the derivative share for Tesla the dynamic changes. Suddenly ENORMOUS blocks of shares are at risk due to the sheer volume of contracts. So lets say you are a market maker who is short 100,000 contracts at $650 sold at a premium of $5 per earlier in the week. A relatively small position for an option seller. At 655 on Friday you are zeroed on those sales. At 650 they would pocket $50m. At $700 they lose a HALF BILLION dollars. So how much would you be willing to spend to try and keep the SP down under $650? A massive amount of money.

It debuted at the 2008 North American International Auto Show, and first deliveries were in 2011. (Wikipedia)\n\nFisker Inc. is an American electric vehicle automaker founded by Henrik Fisker and his wife Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Launched in 2016 and based in Southern California, Fisker Inc. was preceded by Fisker Automotive, which produced the Fisker Karma.

Fisker was named one of the 10 Most Interesting People of 2015 by *The Drive*.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Fisker#cite_note-jschultz-6) Goliath.com named him one of the 10 greatest car designers in automotive history, writing that he has created \"some of the modern masterpieces in the automobile industry.\"\n\nIn 1989, Fisker began working at BMW Technik, the company's advanced design studio in Munich. His first project there was the E1 electric concept car. -  Henrik Fisker has been working on Electric cars since 1989, years before most people even knew about them.\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997, he refined the Z07 concept car, which would become the BMW Z8 roadster, produced from 1999 to 2003.In 2016, at a press conference celebrating BMW's 100th anniversary, BMW CEO Harald Krueger named the Z8 as one of his three favorite BMW models in the history of the company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wr56rhy68w171.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=14be7fd7c99ed72b3d411ccfd34e8ca64b3cd35a\n\nIn 2007, Tesla Motors hired Henrik Fisker to perform initial design work on the Tesla Model S electric sedan, which was introduced in 2012.\n\nFisker stated in 2018 that, with the growth of car-sharing, ride-hailing, and autonomous shuttles, he believes within 10 years private cars will be used for less than half of what they are currently used for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Fisker Automotive\n\nIn 2008, Fisker Automotive raised over $90 million from investors including venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and actor Leonardo DiCaprio. In September 2009, Fisker Automotive was awarded a $528 million loan guarantee by the United States Department of Energy (DOE). The automaker was one of four recipients of the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, to encourage the domestic manufacture of electric cars. The funds were to be used to develop the Karma, as well as an affordable family-size plug-in hybrid car. The loan facility was frozen at $192 million in February 2012, after the DOE claimed that Fisker missed its milestones\n\nIn December 2011, just as the Fisker Karma was launched, its battery supplier, A123 Systems, recalled all batteries, followed by a second recall in 2012. A123 filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, leaving Fisker Automotive without a battery supplier. After selling approximately 2,000 units, production of the Fisker Karma was suspended in November 2012, in the absence of its battery supplier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59vfj5wa8w171.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c03d1e1254fea00c195776122de2b26099dd35\n\nHenrik Fisker resigned as chairman from Fisker Automotive in March 2013, because of disagreements with management about business strategy. Later that year, the company declared voluntary bankruptcy.Fisker raised and spent more than a billion dollars over its lifetime.The heart of Fisker‚Äôs business model was in that early deal with Quantum. The idea was to design a gorgeous car, and have suppliers like Quantum provide the technology because off-the-shelf parts from suppliers would help keep costs down.\n\nBut there were problems with this strategy: Sometimes, those parts had to be custom-made to fit the design vision, which resulted in higher prices for Fisker. Other times, parts were delivered late or, worse, faulty, but Fisker was locked in to those supplier relationships. Sources close to Fisker have also said that many of the parts were owned by the suppliers themselves, so Fisker didn‚Äôt own a lot of the internal technology.\n\nThe broker that raised funds for Fisker automotive, by selling their private shares, was Advanced Equities.It wasn‚Äôt until December 2011 and into 2012 that the more dubious efforts of Advanced Equities became clearer to Fisker‚Äôs hundreds of investors. The last few hundred million dollars of Advanced Equities‚Äô fund raising for Fisker, starting with the D-1 round, was what brokers call ‚Äúpay to play.‚Äù As Fisker was running into technical, delivery and political problems, its valuation was quickly declining. But the company still needed more money, so the brokers went back to its current investors and said: Unless you give this more, your current shares will be diluted and your preferred stock will be converted to common stock.\n\nIt was essentially a gun to their heads. This is why investor Wray sued Fisker in February 2012, alleging he was on the receiving end of this tactic. In his lawsuit, he says Advanced Equities sent him a letter dated Jan. 18, 2012, stating that he needed to decide if he wanted to invest in Fisker‚Äôs next round, and pay around $84,000 by Jan. 27, 2012 ‚Äî a little over a week from receiving the letter. He also says that Advanced Equities assured him that he would have anti-dilution protection. According to the audio clip from Advanced Equities‚Äô internal sales call in early 2010, Advanced Equity leaders say that the Fisker deal will ‚Äúsuffer no dilution,‚Äù and was ‚Äúa dream scenario.‚Äù\n\nThat dream would soon end. In September 2012 after Fisker closed on $1.2 billion in funding, the bulk of it organized by Advanced Equities, the SEC charged the broker with misleading investors when it raised money for another company back in 2009 and 2010 (Bloom Energy). Advanced settled, agreeing to pay $1 million, and its co-founders were personally fined. Two months later Advanced Equities closed up shop.\n\nLater, A123 Systems itself went bankrupt, causing more problems for Fisker. Fisker claimed that A123 Systems owed it $140 million, but a bankruptcy settlement reduced that to a paltry $15 million.\n\nThen there was the just plain terrible luck for the ironically named Karma: Super Storm Sandy wiped out 338 of its Karmas in storage in New Jersey. The cars first drowned, and then caught on fire ‚Äî salt water damage caused a short circuit that was spread to other cars by high winds, Fisker said at the time.\n\nWith all of this happening in public ‚Äî and in a presidential election year ‚Äî Fisker‚Äôs struggles became highly politicized. The company was mentioned numerous times in presidential debates and speeches leading up to the election. Republican nominee Romney called Fisker and other DOE-supported companies losers.\n\nThe company didn‚Äôt seem to invest substantially in technology innovation or tech IP, and seemed to spend a disproportionate amount on suppliers. For example, numerous sources have said that the company paid upfront for 15,000 of some of the parts for its planned 15,000 Karmas. It ended up only selling around 2,000 of the cars. It has also been said that Fisker paid some funds upfront to have BMW make engines for the 100,000 Nina cars it hoped to produce ‚Äî in the end, Fisker didn‚Äôt deliver a single Nina.\n\nCosts to build each Karma also creeped up because the company missed its volume targets, and because engineering had to change designs around supplier constraints. The company ended up adding $20,000 to its initial sale price.\n\nExpensive hires may also have sucked away chunks of Fisker‚Äôs funding: Sources say that Fisker filled the upper levels of the company with seasoned auto executives from Detroit. At the high point of Fisker, the company had around 300 employees, plus dozens of contract staff. Bringing in a certain amount of the old guard could help a car startup ramp up quickly, and also impress potential investors with ‚Äúindustry names.‚Äù But those people are also used to big auto-industry budgets that included extensive travel and salaries ‚Äî that‚Äôs the opposite life of a tech startup.\n\n## Fisker Inc.\n\nIn July 2016, Henrik Fisker expressed interest in designing a fully connected electric car with autonomous driving features and an aesthetically pleasing look. He has pursued battery technology, and hinted at potentially reviving the Fisker name with a pure-electric vehicle using technology that nobody else has. Since then Fisker has talked about delays to the promised solid state battery technology, which he does not expect to be able to be produced in volume until at least 2025. Posing risk for competition from more scientifically experienced future solid state battery producers such as Quantumscape.\n\n***Forbes:*** ‚ÄúNow he‚Äôs back‚Äìand three things are different. First and foremost, he has a vital new partner: his wife, cofounder and Fisker Inc. CFO Geeta Gupta-Fisker. Second, his Los Angeles-based company is public this time around, raising more than $1 billion in an October 2020 IPO. And finally, Fisker‚Äôs stock price, up 56% since its debut, has made both Henrik and Geeta billionaires, each worth about $1.1 billion as of Friday‚Äôs market close. The auto industry has seen father-son and sibling leadership teams, but Fisker Inc.‚Äôs CEO-CFO combo is the fast-changing sector‚Äôs first husband and wife power couple.‚Äù\n\nWealth isn‚Äôt the purpose of the new company, Henrik says. ‚ÄúI never got into cars because of money. (This shows he is willing to do what is in the best interest of the company because he is not motivated by money, unlike 99% of other CEO‚Äôs)\n\nThe couple sought a big stake in the new venture to ensure they can control its fate in a way Fisker couldn‚Äôt with his earlier company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yzhded6pfw171.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b30259720cf853a8efeacf058f2f74315260b9\n\nHenrik is an auto industry celebrity, but Geeta‚Äôs background is equally impressive. A native of India, she holds multiple degrees in science, including a Ph.D. in biotechnology from Cambridge University where she was also a Research Newton Fellow. From there, she started a career in international investment for Lloyds Banking Group, and then managed investments for a high-net-worth client for several years. (In particular, this is insanely important - Geeta **KNOWS MONEY**! She knows how best to keep a company afloat, organize its share structure, provide value to shareholders, etc. because she has worked in the industry before. She may just be the most important element of Fisker Inc., due to the financial experience she has. At every step of the way, she is likely to make decisions with one sole focus - increasing share price and value).\n\nShe met her future husband in 2011 when he was visiting London, just before things started going very wrong at Fisker Automotive. They married in 2012.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I left Fisker Automotive, all I had was my car,‚Äù Henrik remembers. ‚ÄúI'm in a different position, mainly because of Geeta. Because she cuts the deals.‚Äù\n\nTo get the new venture off the ground, the Fiskers invested the majority of their life savings‚Äìan enormous financial risk given the fate of Henrik‚Äôs prior company. Then, just as they were locking in plans for the IPO back in July, they were hit by a highly unwelcome complication: Geeta learned she had early-stage breast cancer.\n\n‚ÄúShe got the call (from her doctor) during a call with investors,‚Äù Henrik says. Despite that bombshell, she continued working with banks and investors in the weeks that followed, even as she underwent two surgical procedures and radiation therapy. Her medical therapy concluded in November.\n\nHenrik, who marvels at her fortitude throughout the health crisis says, ‚Äúshe only missed something like one day of work...That's just how she is. She works tirelessly.‚Äù\n\n## Fisker Ocean\n\nThe Fisker Ocean will have a nearly 300-mile range with an 80 kWh battery and a solar panel roof as a range extender, adding approximately 1,000 free miles of range per year. Advanced electronics will be housed under the hood, and the vehicle will incorporate recycled and sustainable materials throughout. Deliveries of the Ocean are scheduled to begin in 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s87j6bdsfw171.png?width=438&format=png&auto=webp&s=e40add9ce53319d31db242cce73a303afb03cbab\n\nFisker has also announced a partnership with Electrify America to ensure Fisker Ocean vehicles will integrate seamlessly with Electrify America charging stations when the e-SUV hits the market. With features such as a solar roof and recycled inner materials, it will be, according to Fisker Inc., the \"world's most sustainable vehicle.\"\n\nIn 2017, Fisker Inc. announced that it had filed patents on flexible solid-state battery designs. Fisker expected the batteries to be produced on a mass scale around 2020. A prototype of the battery debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. In October 2018, Fisker announced new funding for battery development through Caterpillar Venture Capital. The solid-state batteries are intended to deliver longer vehicle range and faster charging times.\n\nIn 2018, Fisker was named to the board of directors of First Cobalt, a North American cobalt refinery that produces battery materials.\n\nIn September 2019, it was announced that Fisker Inc. was partnering with Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who will serve as a partner and sustainability adviser to Fisker, to work on advanced, affordable, electric mobility models.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[In addition to being a well-known actor, Coster-Waldau is also the United Nations Development Program Goodwill Ambassador for climate change and other social issues.](https://preview.redd.it/3hssff5vfw171.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebe55e2468c5b63d1bc0ac3c71547219dff5afaa)\n\nNikolaj wrote this piece about Fisker:\n\nTo quote a friend of mine who is a lot smarter than me, architect Bjarke Ingels: ‚ÄúThe idea that sustainability needs to sacrifice quality of life is a flawed one. It‚Äôs a design challenge, a challenge to build something that transforms the idea of sustainability into something that will increase the quality of life for all those around it.‚Äù\n\nOne person meeting that challenge is Henrik Fisker, who has designed some of the most iconic cars over the past decades for BMW and others, like the BMW Z8, Aston Martin DB9 and Aston Martin V8 Vantage. He‚Äôs a hero for gas-guzzling supercars. He is a fellow Dane, I am a fan, and we met, of all places, on Twitter.\n\nWhen we met in person, he described his new project ‚Äî an all-electric luxury SUV ‚Äî and asked me if I would help spread the word on his car. The problem as I see it with most electric cars is that they only accomplish the basics. They get you from point A to B. They run electric so you don‚Äôt pollute while driving, but that‚Äôs it. They are basically unattractive combustion engine cars that have a battery thrown into them ‚Äî and for most of them, a battery with a limited range. What Fisker does is to try to make every part of the car in a sustainable and attractive way, like a full-length solar roof, recycled floor mats and vegan leather seats. It looks incredibly cool and inviting, with a great 250- to 300-mile range, and at a cost of just under $40,000, it‚Äôs a luxury car affordable to a mass market.\n\nI said yes and even became an investor, not only because it‚Äôs a great car but more importantly, I hope and believe it can inspire other companies to actively incorporate sustainability goals into all aspects of their business. Fisker then had the idea of calling me ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù adviser. Which I am not. Just to be clear. Thanks Henrik, sounds cool, but I am an actor and a citizen, and that‚Äôs really it.\n\nAnd what about Hollywood? Is our industry changing, are we at the forefront? Looking at social media, you would think so. And things are happening, but usually only when a camera is pointed at people. Remember a few years back when all awards shows only used EVs for the red carpet? We made a difference. We mattered. We showed the way. So cool. So green, so ‚Ä¶ brief. Now it‚Äôs back to the Escalade. But hey, we are not using plastic straws anymore!\n\nTo believe that change will come from Hollywood is not really based in reality (when did that stop us?), but we are great at reacting ‚Äî and things around us are changing, and changing us. I have a good friend who loves his SUV. It‚Äôs not electric. But he cannot give up his car. He is a good guy, he‚Äôs works for the U.N., so if he has a problem going electric, we all do. But if he is presented with an alternative that doesn‚Äôt mean a reduction in his quality of life, something like the Fisker SUV, I think he‚Äôd transition to electric in a heartbeat.\n\nThe IPO deal values Fisker Inc at US$2.9 billion, with an IPO share price of $10.\n\nOn July 30, 2020, Fisker announced plans for a four-vehicle portfolio by 2025. The Fisker Ocean SUV will be joined by a sports sedan based on their previously announced Fisker Emotion concept, a coupe-like SUV, and a lifestyle pickup truck. All will be electric vehicles.\n\nOn October 15, 2020, Fisker Inc announced it would be outsourcing vehicle production of its Fisker Ocean electric SUV to Magna Steyr, to reduce the complexities and costs related to the building and operating its own factory. Magna will start building the Fisker Ocean in Europe in 2022.\n\nWikipedia:\n\nMagna Steyr AG & Co KG is an automobile manufacturer based in Graz, Austria, where its primary manufacturing plant is also located. It is a subsidiary of Canadian-based Magna International and was previously part of the Steyr-Daimler-Puch conglomerate.\n\nMagna International Inc. is a Canadian mobility technology company for automakers. Magna is currently investing heavily in AI, and Level 5 Automation. It is one of the largest companies in Canada and was recognized on the 2020 Forbes Global 2000.\n\nYahoo Finance:\n\nMagna International Inc. designs, engineers, and manufactures components, assemblies, systems, subsystems, and modules for original equipment manufacturers of vehicles and light trucks worldwide.

Magna International Inc. was founded in 1957 and is headquartered in Aurora, Canada.\n\n## Henrik Fisker Interview quotes:\n\nI have people on Twitter saying, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make the car next month? You have a prototype.‚Äù Most people don‚Äôt understand that it takes 18 months to do long-lead body tooling for high-volume vehicles. Most people don‚Äôt understand it takes two years to do durability tests and do all the engineering certification and everything else.\n\nAnd on the business model itself, I believe that there is nobody in the near future or the next couple of years that‚Äôs going to make a million EVs on one model. Today, there‚Äôs nobody doing it. Tesla probably has the highest volume of one single model, a couple hundred thousand. But even the big giant established carmakers are not making, right now, a couple hundred thousand vehicles of one model. So the way you get volume, in my view, is if you partner up with other OEMs and share some of the expensive parts of the platform, which in my view is not anymore something that is unique IP or something that is a unique experience to the customer. An aluminum stamped floor or a steel stamped floor really doesn‚Äôt have any brand value anymore.\n\nAnd obviously, as we move forward, we always start to do some of the things ourselves. But it was really about de-risking in our first vehicle to market. So we‚Äôre going to do another three vehicles, which we can do because we don‚Äôt have to spend all our money and effort on learning how to manufacture a car, for instance.\n\nSo we have programmed a lot. We have hired a head of ESG, environmental and social governance, and he is really spearheading developing specific... we kind of put out some goals that we would like to reach with suppliers, and we at least try to bring them in that direction. They are not reaching those goals right now, but they may reach them later. And then we have goals for ourselves. So for instance, we look at transport. Are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs closer to the plant, or are we choosing a supplier that‚Äôs on the other side of the planet that way we have to then transport all that stuff. So those are the types of things that we‚Äôre really thinking about now as we‚Äôre nominating suppliers. And finally, materials as well, looking at sustainable materials. We‚Äôve actually picked up a lot of knowledge on that side as well, where we are adding more sustainable materials to our vehicle. So we are actually looking across everything ‚Äî supply chain, where the suppliers are located, what the suppliers are doing for sustainability, and also then of course in the vehicle itself ‚Äî in terms of the type of materials there.\n\n## [Investor Presentation](https://s26.q4cdn.com/943649897/files/Fisker-Company-Overview-April-2021-CLEAN-(FINAL).pdf)\n\n***Key Points:***\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2020: approx. $1.0bn cash / $0 debt\n\n*($1bn cash with a $3bn market cap is a sign of obvious undervaluation.

I thought he turned a new leaf and would do shareholders right this time. It is evident that he has not changed:\n\nHe lied about the Pope meeting, he lied about the minimum wage salary, he lied about not needing to dilute. Henrik is a pathological liar. He says that the chip shortage will not affect Fisker and it seriously troubles me that a historic liar would say something so vague. It is affecting some of the largest car manufacturers and I am supposed to believe Henrik yet again? He makes bizarre false claims to pump the stock price and it is really no surprise the yearly tock chart looks as volatile as it is. \n\nRealistically, stock price aside, I probably should have sold my stock by now and taken the loss. The two things that have really repelled me from doing so is the valuation is too cheap and growth potential is simply too large, as well as my own optimism in the car itself.\n\nI do not understand many things. Again, Pope meeting was bizarre. Also, the lease subscription model is cool but how does it align with \"profitability by 2023\" like Henrik claims. It is mathematically obvious he won't reach that, especially because the lease plan is good for the company long term but there is no way they can  reach profitability so soon with such high fixed costs yet so low margins.\n\nI am stunned at the pessimism in the space. Maybe it is because the chip shortage is priced in or people are bored with the stock, but the conference was much less anticipated than I expected. And I really want to play devils advocate as I know a lot of bulls are overly attached to this upcoming conference, but the reality is it will release a lot. Everything is so unknown right now. The space is obviously going to grow like crazy, Fisker does have really unique partnerships and is well equipped for the future, and the company is finally going to get more clarity on the future. Clearly nobody has any clue how to value the company as of yet. I want to say maybe the conference probably isn't too big of a deal and big investors know best, but after seeing analysts upgrade the stock twice and the stock price shooting up 30% in days, I also think people simply are just impatient and not as intelligent as expected, even in todays environment.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
