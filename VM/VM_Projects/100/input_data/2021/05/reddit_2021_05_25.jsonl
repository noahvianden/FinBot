Ad revenue is highly profitable like AWS, so it could use the profit to support other business. The ad revenue is growing very fast so it could able to compete with FB and Googl in the future. The stock is trading under $3300, investors should consider buying some and hold.\n\nThanks for the awards.", "id": "nkqj4f", "created_utc": 1621951490.0, "score": 3329, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 268, "comments": [{"body": "A side effect of this is the Amazon shopping experience has gone to shit.", "score": 1076, "replies": [{"body": "Yea this is why I don't think the advertising revenue is that sustainable.

Cabin size, storage compartments, cleaning, power, customizable tires, and the overall capabilities of adjustments is what matters the most. The capabilities of off roading is a big plus.

A lot of people look at this from the eyes of a technology user. But I think Tesla needs to accommodate actual Ford users.

Most truck owners consider resell value but often times in my own experience hold trucks much longer than a sedan.\n\nSo I would like to see the cyber truck focus on longevity, quality, customization, interchangeable tire sizes, modification capabilities, ease of cleaning. Autonomous is okay, but not necessary. They also need consider the hours of output capable with the current charging system under strenuous use.\nThis sounds bearish but it's not. The cabin space and interior looks nice in both vehicles. But when you work on a coffee farm for example.

Tesla needs 1 pack per 1 car.  Whats the ratio needed for Nio if they need to have swap outs as well as put packs in cars?  How many swap stations are they going to need?  How long does a swap take compared to a fast charge?  If it's half the time I still dont see how that justifies this investment, and that investment is destined to get less efficient as battery charge times reduce over the next few years - which is also the minimum timescale to build a swapping station network versus established (all be it not complete) charging networks for Tesla and others?\n\nAnd lastly, I really dont understand why easy cleaning is one of the deciding factors in determining which is better (you mentioned it twice), and even if it was important, why you think its easier to clean an F150 versus a CT?

Like you said you are.\n\nThe swap stations as I've said in other posts from my initial post would be in designated highly dense areas. Where in these dense areas like Honolulu, Boise Idaho, parts of CA (examples). Where the battery swap stations could actually work specifically for Tesla cyber trucks. Similarly to NIO one day, Tesla could be a distributor of batteries due to Teslas superior battery technology.  And set the standard for other automakers choosing to opt in. This would be specifically for E trucks. It would make no sense for a swap station for trucks only unpopulated areas. Because those people wouldnt buy an E truck anyways like you said you wouldn't be seeing as well in your area.\nDue to the strenuous activity of work trucks.

It will be “the initiation of the next big economic downturn,” Dent predicts.  \n>  \n>“Fake earnings, fake GDP, fake interest rates and super-high valuations” make for an increasingly untenable situation, he warns. The expanding market bubble has been building since 2008. But the Federal Reserve keeps averting the next huge crisis by continuously “printing money,” declares the Harvard Business School MBA.  \n>  \n>His HSD Publishing, an independent research firm, generates monthly newsletters that he and Rodney Johnson, HSD president, each write.   \n>  \n>In the interview, Dent delivers his prescription for investing amid the weakened economy and impending disaster, as he sees it: Zero in on long-term Treasurys.  \n>  \n>“What’s better than sleeping with 30-year Treasury bonds,” he exults. They’ll “magnify your money.” He then describes a portfolio allocation for the investor that’s “willing to take more risk.” As for the notion of high inflation, “no way in hell,” he says.\n\nNot sure what to feel about this, especially when there are lot of big players saying the same.\n\nOpen to discussion..\n\n\\---\n\nEdit: This is not DD even though it seems like it (or is it?).

With an ATM program, companies quietly sell stock into the open market at prevailing prices, and the amount of proceeds that are ultimately raised depend on what prices the shares are sold for. There are currently approximately 450.3 million shares outstanding, so 43 million additional shares would represent roughly 9.5% dilution.\n\n\"We have previously pointed out that the sale of up to 43 million AMC shares, the currently available amount for possible issuance under a previous shareholder authorization, should more than satisfy AMC's liquidity needs for 2021,\" CEO Adam Aron commented in a release. \"This assumes an expected recovery in the patronage of movie theatres in the second half of this year.\"\n\nI think AMC will hit 5 dollars again by end of summer. The reason I think this is because who tf is really trying to go to the movies with masks on in the heat to see movies that are being released on streaming platforms anyway.
