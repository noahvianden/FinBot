It is in constant communication with every car around you via a shared protocol designed to optimize the behaviour of unrelated vehicles in traffic and to coordinate reactions to unexpected events. Your car knows there's a meaningful chance that a child or dog follows that ball, because duh: this has happened literally millions of times in its training. It stops faster than you possibly could, and signals the car behind you to do the same, essentially in real-time.
