They're not just a \"practical research\" company. They are a top research company.\n\nWhether this translates into profits, though, is a different story as we all know research is high risk, which is why traditionally universities operated at a loss and required either donations, foreign students, or government subsidies to keep them running. To the extent that Google can leverage their powerful research departments into actual profit making products and services, Google is the most promising of the big technology companies. \n\nBut we all know what happened to IBM and Bell Laboratories - former examples of research oriented technology companies that fell on hard times when their core businesses disintegrated. To avoid the same fate, Google must do more than produce advancements. They must focus on the quality of their products & services, which until recently, I felt they were pretty mediocre at.

If Jassy is half as good as Bezos, their ability to succeed in any market will make them incredibly robust -- while avoiding concerns about becoming a monopoly in any one area. eCommerce is still a small fraction of overall commerce, and AWS is a profit machine.\n\nI'm also heavy on Apple and Microsoft, but a bit less. Apple has an incredible hardware side, with innovations like the M1 chip likely to result in massive sales for years to come. But it also recognizes that it needs to transition from hardware (phones specifically) to software in order to maintain their growth rate -- their ability to diversify into a services model will be important for their long-term success. They have no cloud computing, which to me seems odd as it would be a natural extension of iCloud and an easy profit maker. I'm also a bit worried about the $90B share buyback -- while it's good for shareholders like me short-term, it implies that they have no better use for the money, like R&D. It might be evolving into a value company, not a growth company, which in tech is a dangerous thing.\n\nMicrosoft is the safest option -- it trades at a low multiple, is well diversified, and has a great CEO. Azure will keep them growing for the next several years, although it does have tough competition. The main reasons it's not my dominant position: they haven't had the same historical growth rate as Amazon or Apple, are pretty weak in the hardware department (particularly when compared to Apple), and don't have a great reputation among consumers for quality (few people really like MS Office or Windows, they just don't have other options in most circumstances).\n\nI don't have Google or Facebook. I like Google, and I plan on adding to it if there's an opportunity. I'm a bit less enthusiastic about it, because it has less of a moat than the others and has had a recent run-up in price, so I don't think it's a bargain right now.\n\nI'm most bearish on Facebook. They almost have an anti-moat; a ton of people younger than 40 really hate the company and its leader. Their main site will diminish in significance as demographics shift, so they need to keep acquiring the next trendy social media site to stay relevant.

Perhaps vol hedges are enough?      \n  \n**TL;DR: Do you consider a Black Monday 1987 type crash (20+% single day drop) a plausible scenario?

Sorry for the length but you asked for it :->)\n\nI've had many reincarnations in my market career, investing for the first 20 years following by 20 years of trading. I did covered calls and naked puts in the 80's.  The '87 crash clued me into the problems with that approach.  \n\nIn the 90's, I spent a lot of time with a smart bunch of people, dissecting technical analysis and trying to evolve an effective trading system.  After a few years of technical trading, I gave that up because you can design a great system but the market has to behave for it to work (oscillating versus trending indicators).  The nature of the market dictates what indicators work best and until the day comes that you can know what type of market you're in, it's just a guess.  Do effective trading systems exist?  No doubt but I bet most of them are at  the likes of Goldman Sachs rather than retail traders like me. I surely didn't find it.\n\nDue to lots of broker connections, I was an IPO whore during the late 1990's internet run up.  It was like Vegas comps. Once you get on their lists, the offers flow. Easy money until it burst.  \n\nIn the early 2000's  I traded volatility contractions post earnings announcement (ratioed diagonal iron butterflies and diagonalized iron condors to capture disparate volatility contraction).  Fairly consistent return but it was terribly  time intensive getting all of the data and repeatedly looking up option prices and re-verifying EA dates.  It might be easier now since there are far better tools available but I moved on from that.  \n\nOne of the things that I learned well from that experience was how to defend option positions that move against me, seamlessly adjusting  and transitioning into others.  Sort of a pseudo delta neutral experience. \n\nThe other thing that I learned from that was that for me, it was an exercise in futility trying to figure out a  Holy Grail trading system and that I fared much better by just  reacting to price  rather than hoping that it cooperated with my preconceived notions.  I don't do much of that now and my approach has simplified though my risk management has gotten more complex.\n\nI've looked for an edge of 20+ years.  Occasionally, I found one but like most, they were short lived.  In late 2007, I stumbled on to a very simple long/short pairs trading plan that seemed implausible as an edge.  At the same time, I was clever enough (or if you want, lucky enough) to figure out that a shit storm was coming so I greatly reduced my  long market exposure.\n\nI started 2008 with a couple of 200 share pair positions and they worked out in minutes to hours (volatility). I bounced around with this for a few weeks and with ongoing success, I slowly increased position size and expanded the number of pairs as my 'training' progressed.  Within a few months, I had  1/2 a million dollars in positions but since I was net short in dollars, it was other people's money funding my long purchases.  Not going to brag with numbers but it was a big pay off over 18 months. The day Lehman Brothers went under was my biggest payday ever.  That was big money for an average Joe retail guy like me who's happy with at $25k or so of trading gains a year because that's what I need not to spend down my nest egg (I retired young).\n\nThis strategy has worked well in every volatile period since then but nowhere near as well as 2008-09 (the China GDP fears, the implementation of China tariffs, the inverted yield curve fears in 2018, and last March).  The rest of the time, it's worthless. And no, I'm not going to divulge it because it involves illiquid stocks and intruders would likely wreck it.\n\nSince that 2008 windfall, I have gravitated toward hedged positions  because I reached the point where keeping it is far more important than making it, though I don't mind when I make it. \n\nAs mentioned above, hedging saved my bacon in March of 2020.

{"title": "How to profit from 💸 runaway inflation 💸", "selftext": "**TL;DR: Calls on securities tied to physical assets, especially those that historically rise during inflationary periods. A historical analysis of the value of gold shows that $GLD LEAPs have the potential for an incredible 80,000% return.**\n\nIn this post, I will outline:\n\n1. Why we haven't seen inflation in the past 40 years\n2. Why we are going to see inflation now\n3. What to do about it\n\n*\\*Disclaimer: This post contains only my own opinions. I've strived to be as accurate as possible with the information below, but some information may be inaccurate or outdated. I am not a financial advisor or an investment advisor, and this is not financial advice. Please do your own research before investing your own money.\\**\n\nSince the crisis of the 1970's, inflation has been near-absent from developed economies. Almost every financial professional who traded through the 1970's inflationary period is now retired. Since humans always doubt the applicability of times they haven't lived through, society has grown complacent.\n\n**Why we haven't seen inflation in the past 40 years**\n\nSince the 1970's, we have seen two massive deflationary forces:\n\n1. The outsourcing of manufacturing jobs to developing countries, especially China\n2. The importation of unskilled labor for agricultural and service sector jobs that couldn't be outsourced.\n\nTo understand the incredible deflationary impact these forces have had, imagine a world in which the United States of today manufactures its own goods, and sends back anyone living in the country who is descended from undocumented immigrants (disclaimer: this is not a world I want to see, this is just for the purposes of a thought experiment). Now imagine how much a cheeseburger or an IPhone would cost in that world. It wouldn't be difficult to imagine a $20 McDonald's burger or $8,000 IPhone. Of course, wages would also be much higher in this world, since there would be a much higher demand for US labor.\n\nBy visualizing this, you can begin to understand that the impact of our monetary policy over the past 40 years has been *dramatically* inflationary, with this inflationary pressure only being offset by trade and immigration policies that should have lowered the cost of goods and services by 5-10x. This is why, on balance, prices have stayed relatively stable during our lifetimes. In fact, while prices have risen modestly during this time period, the increase in labor supply due to outsourcing and immigration has actually put a massive downwards pressure on the wages of unskilled laborers in the US since 1970:\n\n[US unskilled labor wages actually decreased since 1970](https://preview.redd.it/4z4ieaozdqw61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=45cc63cfaffbdd85a609dc3b6144f7e5bdbf50cd)\n\n**Why we are going to see inflation now**\n\nThe problem with the trends outlined above is that the deflationary trends have already reached their near-maximal levels. Concerning immigration, undocumented workers already make up 50%-70% of the agricultural workforce [\\[1\\]](https://www.fb.org/issues/immigration-reform/agriculture-labor-reform/economic-impact-of-immigration). Foreign-born workers make up 20% of the *entire* low-wage labor force of the US [\\[2\\]](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/forbrn.pdf):\n\n[Percentage of US workers that are foreign-born, by industry](https://preview.redd.it/brcy6aa79qw61.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=af0715c21249f8ba0742542f399d214c7b8a4095)\n\nConcerning manufacturing, the US imports \\~$2.1T of manufactured goods each year [\\[3\\]](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/imports-of-manufactured-goods). In comparison, the US's total GDP from manufacturing is only \\~$2.2T [\\[4\\]](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-from-manufacturing). Taking into account that some of the goods the US manufactures are exported, that means that more than 50% of all manufactured goods for sale in the US were made in other countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: thebalance.com](https://preview.redd.it/dnn8isnkdqw61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef710b492bb0cfadb6e09cfd977f3de23f0de7c6)\n\nWhen we account for the fact that some goods are too expensive to ship overseas, and the fact that the US has recently realized that having some domestic manufacturing capacity is crucial for national defense, the percentage of manufactured goods that the US imports is likely near its maximum sustainable level already.\n\nOn top of this, as developing countries industrialize and become wealthier, their labor rates are naturally rising, putting upwards pressure on the price of imported goods:\n\n[Manufacturing labor costs per hour for China, Vietnam, Mexico from 2016 to 2020](https://preview.redd.it/4b6m8bdffqw61.png?width=1558&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aba0db5e2bd43f63527ecd91d6c3c7477c4ab4e)\n\nAll of this together means that the United States can no longer mask its inflationary monetary policies with deflationary trade and immigration policies.\n\nNow, enter the pandemic. The massive monetary and fiscal stimulus employed by the US government in 2020 and 2021 greatly increased the number of dollars in circulation, but added nothing to the productive capacity of the United States. The average productivity of a US worker has not grown substantially from 2019 levels. Yet in that time, the S&P 500 has gained 50% in value. A glut of money has flooded the system, leading to the \"everything bubble.\" In addition, the US government owes \\~$27T, and thus has a *massive* incentive to devalue the US dollar. The only way the government can stay solvent is to continue its inflationary, low interest rate policies.\n\nInflation is coming.\n\n**What to do about it**\n\nFirst, understand that while the Fed wants you to believe inflation will be temporary, in actuality, inflation is a self-perpetuating cycle. Investors see that the US dollar is losing purchasing power, so they dump the US dollar in favor of physical assets and foreign currencies. This further devalues the US dollar, causing even more fear amongst investors, leading even more people to dump the US dollar for physical assets and foreign currencies. This is why the Fed worries so much about \"inflation expectations.\" As long as no one believes inflation is here (it is), the system won't spiral out of control. Unfortunately, in a free market, you can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool everyone forever.\n\nNow, personally, I do not believe we will see true hyperinflation (defined as prices rising more than 50% month-to-month). Instead, I believe we'll see what I'll call \"runaway inflation.\" This is a return to the **\\~8-10% yearly inflation rates** we saw during parts of the 1970's.\n\nIn such an environment, we should expect to see a few things:\n\n1. Nominal interest rates will rise, but the Fed will strive to keep real rates low or negative\n2. P/E compression on stocks\n3. Investors will rush to physical assets\n\nBy keeping real rates low, the Fed ensures that the US government remains solvent. Stock market P/E ratios will compress, since higher nominal rates will increase the discount rate used to value future cash flows.\n\nHere's a list of some assets ranked by how they would likely perform in such a situation, from worst to best:\n\n1. Bonds (including Treasuries)\n2. Stocks\n3. Real Estate\n4. Gold\n\nFor the rest of this section, I will focus on gold for three reasons:\n\n1. It's historically performed the best during inflation.\n2. It's a pure inflation play.\n3. You can buy call options directly on gold.\n\n**Gold**\n\nGold increased in value by **14x** during the inflationary 1970's:\n\n[Gold price during the 1970's](https://preview.redd.it/b7wqgc49kqw61.png?width=2334&format=png&auto=webp&s=22947b7178e65a581e47c79fbbb341a8b9c5e1c5)\n\nAdjusted for inflation, this is still an increase of **717%** in a single decade. Since 1980, gold has fallen out of favor with most investors. This pessimism has set the stage for a massive rally in gold prices over the coming decade.\n\n**How to value gold**\n\nThe problem with gold is that, since it is not an asset that generates cash flows, it's difficult for people to agree on how to value it.\n\nThere are essentially 3 different ways to value gold:\n\n1. As a commodity\n2. As an asset class\n3. As a currency\n\nIn the analysis below, keep in mind that in 1980, one troy ounce of gold was worth **$668**, and it is now worth **$1769**\n\n**Valuing gold as a commodity**\n\nSince 1980, commodity prices have risen by **2.54x**:\n\n[PPI for all commodities](https://preview.redd.it/sirmxwhblqw61.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2472c79d44d7125edf8805e8d526e482d03077f)\n\nIf gold rose by the same percentage, this would imply a current price of **$1696** for gold. This represents a **4% drop** from the current price. We will use this as the floor for gold, as I believe it is unlikely we will see a drop substantially below this price. Keep in mind that, if we expect commodity inflation to average 10% over the next decade, this would still imply a **$4398** price target for gold by 2030\n\n**Valuing gold as an asset class**\n\nGold is more than just a commodity. It's an established asset class that has been in use for thousands of years. How should we value an asset class? Well, investors tend to allocate a fixed percentage of their portfolio to a given asset class. For example, investors nearing retirement will typically allocate their portfolio 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds, and will rebalance this portfolio when stocks or bonds change in price.\n\nWhat percentage should we expect investors to allocate to gold if inflation returns in the coming years? In the middle ages, gold and silver represented essentially the entirety of the world's financial assets. In modern times, however, before the removal of the gold standard, gold seems to have constituted about 5% of the value of the world's financial assets. In fact, this was remarkably stable up until 1960:\n\n[Gold as percentage of global financial assets, from 1960-2015](https://preview.redd.it/7iyd80imnqw61.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7f3453cf4e8a0cc30ac2a77ebcfa630d6cad5b)\n\nWe can see that, despite the world coming off the gold standard in 1980, gold remained 2.5% of global financial assets by 1980. After 1980, low inflation rates convinced investors that fiat currency was viable, and pushed gold down to a low of only 0.2% of financial assets during the dot-com bubble.\n\nI believe that, if and when runaway inflation rears its ugly head again, prudent investors will allocate 5%-10% of their portfolio to pure inflation hedges, such as commodities and precious metals. I believe it's reasonable to assume that of this, 2.5% of the portfolio will be allocated to gold, as it was in the 1980's.\n\nIf everyone allocated, on average, 2.5% of their portfolio to gold, the price of gold would jump to **\\~$8980** today. After 10 years of 10% inflation, gold would reach **\\~$23,290** by 2030.\n\nThus, valuing gold as an asset class, and assuming an allocation percentage that is half of the pre-fiat-currency historical average, we could expect a **1,200%** increase in the price of gold over the next decade.\n\n**Valuing gold as a currency**\n\nThe third and final way to think about gold's value is as an alternative currency to the US dollar. Gold has historically been held by central banks as a universal currency, to protect these banks against exchange rate risks. \n\nIn order to value gold as an alternative currency, I will look at how many dollars there were in the past, how many ounces of gold there were in the past, and then assume that there should be a fixed ratio between the total value of all US dollars and the total value of all ounces of gold over time.\n\nThere are currently **187,000** metrics tonnes of gold sitting above ground (and only about 57, 000 metric tonnes discovered left to be mined) [\\[5\\]](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-much-gold-has-been-found-world?qt-news_science_products=0#). Each year, about 1% of this is mined [\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_gold#/media/File:World_Gold_Production_1900-2014.png). Extrapolating backwards, we can estimate that there were **\\~75,000** metric tonnes above ground in 1930.\n\nToday, there are **$2.15 trillion** US dollars in circulation. In 1930, there were **$4.4 billion**.\n\nIn 1930, there were thus **$59,000** US dollars in existence for every metric ton of gold in existence. Today, there are **$11,497,326** US dollars in existence for every metric ton of gold in existence. Thus, valued as a currency, the price of gold should have risen: 11,497,326 / 59,000 = **194.85 times.**\n\nIn 1930, gold was worth $20.69 per troy ounce. Using the ratio derived above, today, gold should be worth: $20.69 \\* 194.85 = **$4,031** per ounce. Assuming a 10% inflation rate for the next decade, gold would reach **$10,455** per ounce by 2030.\n\n**Doing better than gold: The beauty of modern finance**\n\nNow that we've seen that gold is potentially massively undervalued by historical standards, the question becomes, how can we maximally profit from this information? After all, we don't just want to preserve purchasing power, we want to actually create wealth. \n\nLuckily, we have access to something today that medieval peasants did not: call options on gold, priced in nominal dollars.\n\nSince call options are priced in nominal dollars, runaway inflation makes nearly all call options appear desirable. This is especially true of an asset with low implied volatility, such as gold. For the purpose of the rest of this section, I will be examining **$GLD**, the world's largest physically-backed gold ETF.\n\nI've chosen gold and **$GLD** rather than silver and **$SLV** for two reasons:\n\n1. $GLD options have much lower IV than $SLV options, at \\~16% versus \\~32%. Thus, with $SLV you're paying roughly twice as much for your inflation bet.\n2. $GLD is backed by physical gold\n\nTo figure out what we could expect to make from $GLD LEAPs, let's summarize the results of our three ways to value gold analyzed above, assuming additionally a 10% annual inflation rate for the next two years and using that assumption to predict Jan 2023 $GLD prices:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Priced as a commodity:\n   * May 2021 predicted value: $1696 / oz\n   * Jan 2023 predicted value: $1987 / oz\n   * Jan 2023 predicted $GLD price: **$186**\n* Priced as an asset class:\n   * May 2021 predicted value: $8980 / oz\n   * Jan 2023 predicted value: $10,524 / oz\n   * Jan 2023 predicted $GLD price: **$986**\n* Priced as a currency:\n   * May 2021 predicted value: $4,031\n   * Jan 2023 predicted value: $4,724\n   * Jan 2023 predicted $GLD price: **$442**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing an options profit calculator [\\[7\\]](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html), we can then determine which Jan 2023 options would be most profitable in each scenario:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Priced as a commodity:\n   * Most profitable option: **Jan 2023 $150.00 Call**\n   * Expected nominal return: 56.7%\n   * Expected real return: **39.5%**\n* Priced as an asset class:\n   * Most profitable option: **Jan 2023 $350.00 Call**\n   * Expected nominal return: 82,497.4%\n   * Expected real return: **82,480.2%**\n* Priced as a currency:\n   * Most profitable option: **Jan 2023 $320.00 Call**\n   * Expected nominal return: 12,608.3%\n   * Expected real return: **12,591.1%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIt's possible to not only survive runaway inflation, but to profit massively. If gold ends up being valued the way it was historically, as an asset class or a currency, there's a potential for a **100-800x** return through $GLD options. Even valuing gold as a commodity, $GLD options have good potential upside.

Optical genome mapping with Saphyr detects structural variations ranging from 500 bp to megabase pairs in length and offers assembly and discovery algorithms that far outperform sequencing-based technologies in sensitivity.”\n\nTheir next-generation genome mapping and analysis tools **help researchers see true genome structure to fill in what’s missing from sequencing-based data**. Saphyr, their high-speed, high-throughput whole-genome mapping solution, offers unmatched structural variation discovery capabilities and the ability to construct the most complete genome assemblies.\n\nThe Saphyr® System by Bionano Genomics is a genome imaging tool for high-speed, high-throughput **structural variant detection** and analysis with exceptional sensitivity and specificity.\n\n**📷**\n\n**TLDF:**\n\nThey analyze genomes and produce maps which enable researchers to find information that could be crucial for helping drug enhancements, preventive care, cures, susceptibility awareness and more.\n\n***ApE LaNgUAgE-***\n\nSaphyr finds some things in genomes more efficiently than traditional technologies. So yes, it is cool and we may moon but not primarily because of this.\n\n1.

Lineagen acquisition  \n\n   1. BNGO acquired them in August 2020, with **only 5 months** of work in an increased regulatory environment (covid), they brought in **$1.5M in revenue**.  \n\n      1. 1.5M×2 (12 months in year, double amount from 5 months, add a small bit more because 2021 is likely to have less covid restrictions, also of course extra 2 months of revenue {CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATING EXTRA 2 MONTHS AND ADDED REVENUE FROM LESS COVID STIFLES})=3M+200,000 from extra 2 months and less covid restriction benefits\n\n$13,234,750\n\n1. Benefit of cash=new opportunities  \n\n   1. Unlike all years past, Bionano now has **cash for marketing**, more acquisitions, r&d, and plenty of catalysts to look forward to including **saphyr 2.0/higher throughput**, **saphyr’s use in prenatal & postnatal screening**, more saphyr sales, and cytogenetic space. CFO Chris Stewart said that Bionano believes its cash stockpile \"significantly de-risks the company, solidifies our financial future, and allows us to focus on the achievement of our long-term vision to disrupt genomics through the global adoption of Saphyr.\"  \n\n      1. 13,234,750+1,500,000=\n\n$14,734,750\n\n1. More recognition=more recognition (domino effect, kinda)  \n\n   1. As more and more labs and universities adopt and approve saphyrs capability and efficiency (like african genetic lab just a week ish ago), others will do the same. It will be similar to how crypt0 got and is getting more recognition from the mainstream as more places adopt it. Bionano has never had interest like it is now nor has it ever had the exposure/popularity it currently has and they will continue to gain and (imo) capitalize on the added attention.  \n\n      1. 14,734,750+1,500,000=\n\n$16,234,750\n\n1.

Bionano anticipates the validation of three of its laboratory-developed tests with billing codes. It also expects to have a prototype of its next-generation high-throughput Saphyr system ready.”\n   4. “If all goes according to plan, Bionano will finish this year with a much larger installed base.

However if [operating expenses continue to keep rising](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNGO/financials?p=BNGO) then we could see a revenue and EPS growth similar to that of the analysts projections (not necessarily though if revenue keeps increasing at the current pace, a pace which is not possible to be kept perpetually, but I believe it could be prolonged for at least few years if things go Bionano’s way)\n\nTLDF:\n\nThere is an extremely high chance that revenue will grow more than 100% YOY and a high chance of getting closer to 130%-150% growth given the above.\n\nApE lAnGuaGE\n\nmoney will grow much faster than what analysts are predicting resulting in bngo go moon and bionanians portfolio’s go brrrr\n\n2. Markets\n\n& Potential Markets, TAM, SAM, SOM and Future TAM, SAM & SOM\n\n(basically listing all revenue sources and likely future sources)\n\n1. Genetic Labs  \n\n   1. Universities, R&D companies, hospitals, scientific institutions, unorthodox educational facilities (more in the ***future*** section), nonprofit hospital system (ex. - [Mayo Clinic](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/mayo-clinic-adopts-bionano-saphyr-for-applications-in-neurodegenerative-diseases-2019))\n   2. Cytogenetics  \n\n      1. “$500 million to $600 million from selling Saphyr to cytogenetics labs for diagnostic purposes, along with annual recurring revenues of $200 million to $400 million. There are over 2,500 such labs around the world, the company estimated.” - [INVESTORPLACE](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/bngo-stock-buy-on-innovation/)\n      2. TAM of cytogenetics according to CEO in ER call is around 3B, which he said was attributed to all genetic labs essentially, *but* there are many more markets that increase the TAM (not necessarily the SOM, but nonetheless the bigger the TAM, the higher ((probably)) the SOB in the long run and in the aggregate based on my anecdotal non-scientific opinion) significantly.\n2. NIPT  \n\n   1. Susceptibility of diseases, proclivity for this sickness or that one, offers the individual a chance to take action to mitigate an increased risk for them *at a young age*, the benefits of this are not researched heavily (obvious reasons) but one can assume that it could be absolutely revolutionizing for health quality, life expectancy & wellness.\n   2. WIDE range of various crucial information NIPT can discover (OGM *could* disrupt this industry and/or provide enhancements to the technology capabilities of LRS and NGS)\n3. PostNatal Screening  \n\n   1. Validation studies of hematological malignancies and post-natal constitutional disorders have progressed nicely, and management anticipates having data from \"no-call\" reflex testing in NIPS later this year and next year for solid tumors. - [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ma9f0t/bngo_bionano_genomics_dd_the_future_of_genomics/)\n4. Autism  \n\n   1. CEO, “The wide spectrum of genetic variation between individuals with ASD makes it difficult for traditional tests to provide a diagnosis of the genetic condition. We expect OGM with Saphyr to reveal a more complete picture of genomic variants that provides actionable information that can potentially improve outcomes.” - [source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/04/2152632/0/en/Bionano-Genomics-Publishes-Study-on-Autism-Risk-Genes-After-Detailed-Analysis-of-The-Genome-of-Professor-Temple-Grandin-Who-Has-Brought-Awareness-to-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Throug.html)\n   2. The company has [already made breakthroughs](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/04/2152632/0/en/Bionano-Genomics-Publishes-Study-on-Autism-Risk-Genes-After-Detailed-Analysis-of-The-Genome-of-Professor-Temple-Grandin-Who-Has-Brought-Awareness-to-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Throug.html) in the space, it is my belief that the [flywheel effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_effect#:~:text=The%20flywheel%20effect%20is%20the%20continuation%20of%20oscillations,such%20oscillations%20are%20said%20to%20be%20flywheeling%20.) *could* come into play here\n   3. OGM is a relatively new space, given that it essentially only has one real company devoting its time to it (see ***competitors*** and ***history*** section for more info on OGM competition & other companies), it may be likely that as researchers become more experienced, the [learning curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve) will play an important role.\n   4. Understanding a whole genome and how it replicates may give us a rudimentary knowledge of how they develop and how to stop it (possible cures, preventatives, mitigations-$$$)  \n\n      1. About 1 percent of the world population has autism spectrum disorder. Prevalence in the United States is estimated at 1 in 59 births. More than 3.5 million Americans live with an autism spectrum disorder.\n5. Neurodegenerative Diseases - Alzheimer's, ALS & Possibly Others  \n\n   1. “Dr. Ebbert uses long-read sequencing and Bionano whole-genome imaging because it can identify large structural mutations that cause disease. Many individuals who have neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and ALS do not have a known genetic cause, and studies to date have focused on short-read sequencing, overlooking disease-causing structural mutations. Bionano’s Saphyr provides the potential of long-read sequencing now.” - [source](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/mayo-clinic-adopts-bionano-saphyr-for-applications-in-neurodegenerative-diseases-2019)\n   2.

Around 20,000 ALS cases per year in US - [source](https://www.westernslopenow.com/news/local-news/keenan-van-goes-to-the-11th-als-patient/)\n6. Leukemia  \n\n   1. “Dr. Alexander Hoischen reported the results of a successful validation study comparing the performance of Bionano Genomics’ Saphyr® system to traditional cytogenetic methods for the clinical analysis of leukemia genomes. The study, published in bioRxiv, found that Saphyr was 100% concordant with the standard of care for the detection of somatic chromosomal abnormalities.” - [source](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bionano-genome-imaging-concordant-traditional-130010495.html)\n   2. “We are positively surprised by the smooth and fast implementation of the Saphyr system in our laboratory. Less than a year after training we now have successfully run more than 150 samples, including the 48 leukemia samples which we now present in this publication. Other samples include novel research findings for unsolved rare disease cases and known cytogenetic abnormalities which may validate the Saphyr system’s use for constitutional aberrations.” - Dr. Alexander Hoischen\n   3. “Breakthrough Findings in Leukemias Presented at ASH 2019 Demonstrate Bionano Saphyr’s Potential to Replace All Cytogenetic Methods and Show Additional Clinical Utility” - [source](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/breakthrough-findings-in-leukemias-presented-at-ash-2019-demonstrate-bionano-saphyrs)  \n\n      1.

According to [nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bionano%3A-prenatal-testing-offers-another-opportunity-for-saphyr-says-analyst-2021-04-09), Kevin DeGeeter’s positive outlook for the company is partly based on Saphyr’s potential to impact other markets beyond cytogenetics for hematologic malignancies. Ones where the use of microarrays, FSH and karyotyping also “results in long and expensive analytical decision trees.”\n   2. Correcting and discovering genetic abnormalities\n   3.

(((BONUS)))\n15. Just a reminder that analyzing saphyr’s data requires other products that are not cheap and these do not last forever, this means recurring purchasing will be periodically happening (+ saphyr 2.0, all customers who wish to have the 1400x higher throughput Saphyr will need to purchase that).\n\n**Some orthodox important points**\n\n**according to an INVESTORPLACE article**\n\n* TAM - $2.6 billion to $3.8 billion according to [company estimates from prior to March 12](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/bngo-stock-buy-on-innovation/). **(based on below point, the author of** [**this same article**](https://investorplace.com/2021/03/bngo-stock-buy-on-innovation/) **actually means** [**SOM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_addressable_market#Difference_between_TAM,_SAM_and_SOM)**,** ***if the below point according to the same article is true,*** **‘because the CEO believes they could realistically achieve 2.6-2.9B yearly’)**\n* Over 7,000 research labs in the world.

Saphyr Deep Dive\n\n(How it Works), Advantages, Disadvantages\n\n1. Optical genome mapping using Saphyr® reveals what’s missing in your research. Rapidly identify genome variation like never before with the high-throughput Saphyr system. - [Details](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Saphyr-Brochure.pdf)\n\nAdvantages & A Bit on How it Works\n\n1. The cost of PACB’s method is estimated, based on list pricing, to be between $10,000 and $20,000 per genome. OGM with Saphyr, which costs less than $500 per genome, was shown to be significantly more sensitive than the sequencing method. And much faster. (It should be noted that although the Saphyr can seemingly detect all that NGS & LRS can but at a lower cost, it is not actually the full case. Basically, saphyr can detect certain parts at a higher efficiency but not everything. Most NGS & LRS provide higher-resolution base-level nucleotide information. Saphyr’s map provides a structural map, and does not directly identify the chemistry comprising the structure. Very roughly like if you assay a house, the optical map would be great for showing you the shapes of the foundation, wall and roof framing, but it wouldn't tell you the materials. For similar esoteric information ((intro to ogm & how saphyr works, what it does)) that will help in illuminating the basic process of OGM in action vs. LRS or NGS, these two sources might be good starting places. [#1](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Saphyr-Brochure.pdf) [#2](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+youtueb&docid=608026313887146892&mid=0E68F17FBBC6CB9D42B30E68F17FBBC6CB9D42B3&view=detail&FORM=VIRE)).\n2. Higher detection rate of large svs than NGS & LRS\n3. Cheaper\n4. Easier to use and not as esoteric\n5. Less false positives\n6. Rapidly accumulating evidence indicates that structural variations can comprise millions of nucleotides of heterogeneity within every genome, and are likely to make an important contribution to human diversity and disease susceptibility. - [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_variation)\n7. “The system comes with a screen, keyboard, a processor, and a server and costs \\~$150 thousand. Besides the system sale and installation revenue, BNGO receives recurring income from consumables like pigments and reagents. Similar to a printer and ink cartilage, this business model creates a regular income stream for BNGO.” - [source](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/saphyr/), [source](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4410239-bionano-genomics-second-chance)\n\nDisadvantages\n\n1. “BNGO... plans to seek an FDA clearance for Saphyr medical use. The delay is due to the high costs of obtaining the license, stemming from lengthy clinical trials and robust requirements. It is worth reminding that the commercial launch of Saphyr is only recent, and the company has been operating as a publicly traded company for a small number of years. The addressable market of BNGO will increase significantly in the event of an FDA approval.” - [source](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4410239-bionano-genomics-second-chance) (whether this is true or not in the ‘FDA Approval section’)\n2. Cannot detect all of what NGS & LRS does\n3. Somewhat high cost, although relatively it is cheap when factoring in alternatives because there really are no true alternatives that replicate what the Saphyr does.\n\nFor more basic information on how the saphyr works you could watch these [#1](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+intro+to+BNGO+and+saphyr&docid=608023006763444898&mid=19A3E7A04639BDAA25A119A3E7A04639BDAA25A1&view=detail&FORM=VIRE) [#2](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+intro+to+BNGO+and+saphyr&docid=608010697387433297&mid=68C7A6CA1AE8D6F8662768C7A6CA1AE8D6F86627&view=detail&FORM=VIRE) [#3](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=doctor+dean+intro+to+BNGO+and+saphyr&docid=607988153116227555&mid=A29766594B704CEEECBBA29766594B704CEEECBB&view=detail&FORM=VIRE).\n\nTLDF:\n\nSaphyr has very auspicious advantages with innovation left to come as built-in obsolescence proponent’s idea in regards to the Saphyr is completely nullified with their ongoing updates and enhancements (I don’t know anyone who doubts the Saphyr in this way, but I’m sure there are some). Recurring revenue with their market strategy is a nice benefit as well and the disadvantages of Saphyr are nothing compared to its current benefits and future innovations.\n\nApE lAnGuaGE\n\nSaphyr good, bngo good, mapping good, sequencing bad, buy bingo shares\n\n5. FDA Approval\n\n1. Saphyr does not [necessarily need FDA approval](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lco5kt/the_following_bngo_saphyr_post_is_only_intended/).  \n\n   1. Saphyr is already in *full* use in hospitals, labs, clinics, universities and more.\n2. [Pacbio does not have it](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/kvp1dp/the_fda_argument_for_why_ark_wouldnt_invest_in/) and it is one of Ark’s largest holdings.\n3. Although FDA approval for the Saphyr may generate more interest and hype for the stock, it likely would not instigate huge moves to the stock price.  \n\n   1. Or as Saphyr gets FDA (if) approval, Ark pulls the trigger, that could happen although personally I think Ark is sophisticated enough to realize that what determines Bionano’s success will not be the FDA approval for a box (Saphyr’s shape resembles a box)\n\nTLDF:\n\nFDA Approval will not make or break the stock, if anything it would boost interest and little else. Bionano can easily do all the things bulls want it to without FDA approval although they would welcome it if it did happen as some institutions may warm up to the Saphyr a bit more in that circumstance.\n\nApE lAnGuaGE\n\nbNGo go moon with or without fda stuff\n\n6. Cancer\n\nI have been saying since before January and February that cancer could be the one thing that makes this stock turn us into millionaires. And although the stock price has gotten beat down, my synthesis for an entire market in cancer solution enhancements/mitigations has only been more legitimized.\n\nSeveral articles and Bionano themselves alluding to Saphyr being able to ***possibly*** help develop cancer mitigations - cures, chemotherapeutic drug enhancements. A more thorough understanding of how cancer cells replicate and spread so fast provides the *opportunity* to find what stops them. I think the [learning curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve) will play a huge role into Saphyr’s findings in cancer related research especially as they have not been working on cancer research very long.\n\n1. “On April 22, Bionano announced that a group of scientists, using Saphyr and other tools, had developed a technique that is “capable of determining the timing, speed and origin of DNA replication in human cells at a coverage level that is thousands of times higher than what earlier methods such as nanopore sequencing allowed.” Errors in “DNA replication” may result in cancer, “many chemotherapeutic drugs target and disrupt DNA replication,” Bionano stated. As a result, better comprehending DNA replication can aid scientists in developing cancer treatments with reduced side effects, the company believes.” - [source](https://investorplace.com/2021/04/bionanos-uk-deal-is-huge-for-bngo-stock/)\n2. “Cancer samples are just too complex for low coverage whole genome sequencing. Complex rearrangements, tumor heterogeneity and unsequenceable repetitive regions of the genome present additional challenges for short and long read sequencing technologies.” [source](https://bionanogenomics.com/research/cancer/#:~:text=Bionano%20Genome%20Imaging%20provides%20cancer%20genomics%20through%20a,genomes%20in%20heterogeneous%20samples%20revealing%20large%20structural%20variations.)\n3. “Professor Vanessa Hayes at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research published a complete tumor-normal comparison from a primary prostate cancer.5 Her team identified 85 large somatic deletions and insertions, of which half directly impact potentially oncogenic genes or regions. Only one-tenth of these large SVs were detected using high-coverage short-read NGS and bioinformatics analyses using a combination of the best SV calling algorithms for NGS data. A manual inspection of NGS reads corresponding with the Bionano derived target regions verified 94% of the total SVs called with Bionano mapping. Many SVs detected with Bionano were flanked by repetitive sequences, making them all but invisible to short-read sequencing.” - [source ](https://bionanogenomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Bionano-Genomics-Next-Generation-Cytogenetics-Resolves-Structural-Variants-in-Cancer_White-Paper_A.pdf)(page 4)\n4. “Bionano Genomics (BNGO) new study is likely to lead to a new level of cancer research and drug discovery with reduced side effects, demonstrating the importance of optical genome mapping (OGM) in a large research market. Notably, the study is led by Dr. Nicholas Rhind from the University of Massachusetts Medical School along with a global team of scientists from France, Canada, and the US. DNA replication is a fundamental process of cell growth seen in cancer and was not easy to study in human genomes. Through Bionano Genomics’ Saphyr-based method, the timing, speed, and origin of DNA replication will be known in human cells at a coverage level, which is thousands of times higher than earlier methods such as nanopore sequencing. The body of humans and other organisms develops and grows when cells divide, and for each division, the entire genome needs to be replicated, the company said. Erroneous DNA replication might result in genome instability and mutations driving cancer. Therefore, as cancer cells divide excessively, many chemotherapeutic drugs target and disrupt DNA replication.” - [source](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bionano-genomics-publishes-new-study-on-dna-replication-shares-gain-in-pre-market-2021-04)\n\nTLDF:\n\nIf BNGO discovers new groundbreaking advancements in cancer research then stock price go boom portfolio go brr and bears go hibernate. This seems at least somewhat likely in my mind given all of what they have done so far and considering the learning curve and flywheel effect. Curing cancer is not what we are talking about here, however that may not be out of the range of possibilities down the line, we are emphasizing Saphyr’s proclivity for discovering vital information that could lead to more breakthroughs in mitigating cancer growth and risk. Preventive care, susceptibility, enhancements in chemotherapeutic drugs are all things that Saphyr could certainly help with inventing. If any of this does happen, BNGO GO MOON.\n\nApE lAnGuaGE\n\nBNGO find cancer information BNGO find all time highs invest in BNGO\n\nI had to delete a TON of stuff literally like half of the whole 73 page document because stupid reddit has a very small word limit.

Soft target reached!   LFG!\n57 more shares for a total of 1057 as of 5/17/2021!\n\n5/31 Edit: 1106 shares and counting as of 5/29/2021! 1share at a time and 10 or better on dips! Preparing for imminent liftoff!\n\nFor many of you in this post, the DD has been known, for those that need me to give an example of my reasoning for a n easy 20x's eval...here it is:\n\n  Upon historic research, we can see that during a time when NOK was thought to be a Japanese cellphone company(completely misunderstood) they reached an all time high of @$59. The whole time, the company was a Finnish technological hardware company. This means that their niche was providing innovative technology and the hardware to make it happen to other companies in many different markets. Admittedly they had taken on some debt and were involved in a few failed projects and ultimately lost market of telecom via cellphone endorsement losses. As a result the short sellers lumped in against NOK and investors fled. Meanwhile, NOK has continued to aggressively pursue contracts in emerging markets to be the sole provider of the 5G infrastructure technology, while creeping out of debt also. This is just the tip of the iceberg. They are well positioned in the Healthcare, Industrial, Blockchain, PC & Laptops, IOT, and again in Telecom, as they recently released 5 well reviewed flagship touchscreen devices that come with an eco friendly case for <$500 during an economic nightmare and semiconductor pause.\n\n  The company is poised for market leadership in very much the same way as TESLA. What I mean by that is Tesla is thought to be an EV play instead of a all around tech play the same way as NOK was thought to be a telecom play instead of an all around supplier of Technologies and their hardwares.\n Acquiring new partnerships most of 2019, 2020, and continuing into 2021...the direction of NOK can only be up. The aspect of Samsung(an industry leader and direct iPhone rival) engaging NOK in contracts for video tech says a lot. Blackberry(whose stock I also hold) has also partnered with NOK on projects that include other partners such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Palantir(whose stock I also hold) on 5g, and IoT plays, which also includes AI and automation by the way. They are not spending a lot on advertising and yet they keep gaining position in new markets through partnering. This is bullish behavior to me. \n\n  Everything in the market is speculative, but I have also looked at a lot of charts to try to gain an understanding of previous resistance and support levels. IMO none of them apply. Let me stabilize that statement by saying historically, no one has ever let the truth out about NOK and after cell phone debacle, people forgot about the thought to be Japanese cell phone company that it never was!\n  What is the true valuation of NOK? Who knows? What I do know is that the company is worth a lot more than it ever was thought to be worth while hardly anyone really understood the purpose, origin, or function of NOK. There is still a lot that I have left out on purpose, to force people to do their own research. After all, I am only an independent trader/investor in search of DFV, and in no way offering financial advice.
