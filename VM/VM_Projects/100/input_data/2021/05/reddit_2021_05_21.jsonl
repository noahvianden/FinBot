Examples: IV ratio, put/call ratio, distance from strike price, etc.\n\nTo pre-emptively answer some expected questions:\n\n* The data is sourced commercially and paid-for. And yes, it's expensive.

If the 200DMA can prove to hold as support as it did back in March 2020, it is likely Tesla is bottoming out at these levels and should reverse to the upside sooner than later.  To the upside, if the 200DMA holds as support at the $591 level, we could see it rally into resistance at around $650-670 level which is where the 50DMA and another key trendline both converge at.  A breakout above this level and the next resistance will come in at around $700.  If it can break back into the consolidation zone above $700, there is resistance at the top of this range at around $775.

Fiat is not a slur. It's literally what it is. It is called that because the value is determined by government / federal bank's fiat (seriously, look up the meaning of the word).

Fiat is not a slur.\n\nNote the trademark crypto condescension, which like Godwin's law always appears eventually in any crypto pro/con discussion.\n\nIt's amusing, given our relative likely competence in knowing enough about crypto to create one from scratch.\n\nFiat IS a slur, in that it is labelling a currency based on a perceived failure. \n\nCrypto is not the opposite of fiat.  That's complete bullshit.  The rules change, the system updates... based on the decisions of a relative minority of massive early crypto adopters.  Almost all crypto has the early adopter problem... where the very earliest people have on paper billions of dollars based on nothing more than their transaction list getting popular.\n\nMost crypto variants are just an excuse to start a new coin, to take a shot at a get-rich-quick scheme.  There's nothing idealistic in that.  It's pure greed.  Greed cloaked in a shroud of mostly fake idealism is a particularly potent thing.\n\nElon complains about power usage and Etherium puts out a near-immediate press release saying they'll reduce transaction energy requirements by 99.95%.\n\nThis does not sound that different to fiat.\n\nThe whole forex exchange is \"fiat\" currency changing value with the market.  That's it's default state.  Occasionally, governments intervene.  Crypto OBVIOUSLY has government as well, which ALSO changes things based on their collective whim.\n\nFiat as a descriptor is just marketing bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Then, the whiners should leave crypto \n\nThat's what I'm saying.  Some whiners will leave.  The ones that stick around will be thinking \"if only this or that was fixed\" and next thing you know crypto's regulated.\n\nYour own example is perfect.  How many sites were like 4chan before, and became more moderated and controlled?  (hint: Reddit is one of them)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Okay, in your ideal world, how exactly would crypto be regulated? How would it be different from fiat in that situation? Why will people continue using it?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Mainly, I'm arguing against the idea of an ideal world.  The real world is anything but ideal.\n\nStill, I mentioned solving greater problems so.... from that point of view... I don't know, man.  It's a really tough set of problems.  Recent events have really underscored just how incredibly selfish a large chunk of the population really is.  Most of the elite are almost certainly sociopaths... in practical effect if not clinically.\n\nThe main thing is the current path is totally unsustainable.  Each generation is like half as wealthy as the previous.  Individual people are holding more assets than double-digit percentages of an entire generation of people worldwide.  It's absolutely nuts.\n\nMany people bury their heads in the sand, repeating the same tired tropes \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\", \"work harder\", etc.... never facing how incredibly different the world is right now compared to the world of their own formative years.  A couple success stories a year are good enough for them.  \"See, it's still possible!\"  Yes, luck still works.  It's not representative at all.\n\nDemocracy is under assault right now, specifically because so many people are so disenfranchised at this point that they're going to start voting for change.  It's essentially impossible IMHO for that not to happen.  No matter how effective the whole tinkle-down economics marketing effort has been, as more and more people face destitution in a supposedly 1st world country... they'll vote.  I personally don't think the voter suppression stuff will work for very long if it does at all.  However...  I've been aghast and appalled at what's happened with this whole covid thing... so who knows.\n\nI would hope that people vote for dramatic improvements in minimum wage (why not make it what it was half a century ago adjusted for inflation?)  The whole fight against that saying costs would go up is absurd.  They HAVE gone up anyway.  Massively.  The whole market is going to destabilize as fewer and fewer people are able to afford anything at all.  Wages have to be addressed.  The whole \"Millennials are killing X\" is almost always because THEY DON'T HAVE ANY F-ING MONEY.  That'll just get worse if it isn't addressed.\n\nI think health care in the US needs complete reform.  We're already at a point where adequate health care is mostly just for the rich.  That's inhumane and insane, for a culture.  Ignoring any ethical argument... healthy people are simply WAY more productive.  The status quo is self-destructive behavior that needs to stop. Any reasonable government would realize that eventually.\n\nI'm personally sort of a weird mix of optimism and pessimism.  I do think this stuff has a good chance of swinging back towards sanity... but I don't know.  The power of disinformation is proving to be almost magical.  It's a new world, difficult to predict.  \n\n\nMy gut tells me things will continue to get bad for a while, until people finally vote to change.  Maybe it sounds hopeless, but it really is the only meaningful means of changing anything on a large scale.  Ultimately, it can work.  Once enough people feel enough pain, they'll start to care enough to force that change.  It's sad it seems it has to be that way.\n\nA reddit channel shook the stock market on a whim a little while ago.  People CAN collectively make a difference.\n\nThe only other option really is an Elysium kind of world.\n\nWell, unless/until general AI comes around and either fixes us or destroys us.\n\n... unless the general AI just empowers a super-Elysium dystopia, which is a depressingly realistic outcome. Eh, maybe not... they'd probably just kill everyone else at that point.  So maybe it is just fix us or destroy us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for crypto continuing... people will use it as long as they think they can make money trading it.  Once that's not the main thing, they'll generally move on to whatever's more convenient.  The believers will stick around, sure... but it won't really become all that mainstream.  Convenience is really one of the most major features for any widely traded currency.  Once that's destroyed people simply won't want to use it.\n\nIf it accepts being regulated, then it has a chance to be accepted by governments and therefore used by institutions, etc.  What will it MEAN then?  Well, probably back to just convenience.  Smart cards that contain actual currency, making transactions easier.  (offline, etc)  Minor improvements like that.  The original point probably gets lost along the way, really.  The crypto that won't let that be forgotten probably just fade back into the background.\n\nIt also occurred to me that most crypto trading is done through major commercial sites like Coinbase, etc.  Those places ARE more and more regulated... the trades done through those will probably end up following most of the same rules regular currency does even if a specific crypto coin refuses to adapt.  So, in effect, the majority of transactions fail to benefit in any real sense from the goals of crypto.  Some of those places won't even give you your keys.  Are you really even using crypto at that point?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI mean, if it wasn't for the energy use thing... I'd probably like crypto myself.  I already liked it enough to use a form of blockchain-based authentication and validation in a product of mine.  Ultimately used a centralized authority, though.  The ability to authenticate offline users a device has never heard of before is pretty killer.\n\n I knew about it early enough to be a bitcoin billionaire... but I decided way back then it was mostly just facilitating black and grey markets and I didn't want to participate in that.  Later on, as it matured such that the legitimate uses outweighed the harmful uses it also enabled.. it was too late to be an early adopter.  :)  ... it's ok, I got my second chance (third? twentieth?) with TSLA and did alright.

You don't realize the gimping is the exact thing that will cause the solution to cease being a solution. In fact, the gimping will lead to even more problems than you had in the first place.\n\nThe Reddit example is a classic. You actually think the gimping of free speech on Reddit is an acceptable solution. Let me tell you - it is not only not acceptable, it is not even a solution. The gimping of free speech on Reddit and other Internet platforms is both a cause and an effect of similar restrictions in the physical world. And this is not going to lead to anything good. Every totalitarian state that ever existed started with similar gimping of free speech on their most popular media. Those who exchange liberty for safety will have neither safety nor liberty.\n\nLet's come back to crypto. The raison d'etre for crypto currency is to have a currency that is FREE. Period. Anything short of that is not crypto currency. If you want anything short of that, you are better off actually adding whatever new features you want to USD and other fiat currency systems. If you like some features of crypto but are scared of others, don't you think a more mature and responsible thing to do is call for those features you like to be added to existing fiat currency, than to call for the ~~regulation~~ cancellation of crypto?

At least, apart from the stuff on what the current big problems are.\n\nHowever, your doing the \"take something to extremes\" / \"slippery slope\" thing.  Moderating Reddit more was a normal consequence of it going more mainstream.  I'm personally not sure what I think about that.  I would personally like somewhat freer speech, but not to some crazy degree.  However, much like theoretical gun regulation... restricting speech on Reddit is not automatically an evil first step to totalitarianism.  There can be middle ground that might necessarily contain some steps that lead in the general direction of restricting things, without restricting everything.\n\nAfter all... if I walk north I'm not automatically just going to end up in Canada or the Artic.  \"You're going north!?!? My god, you don't have cold weather clothes!  You'll die!\"\n\nThe difference is common sense... which SHOULD moderate things to a sensible middle ground.  We've got to stop pretending every single step in any direction is going to lead to insanity.\n\nAbsolutism is a problem.  Gun owners won't allow even criminal background checks at gun shows, because it's on the \"slippery slope\" to \"they're going to take our guns\".  That's flat out insane, but a huge portion of the populace has been sold that idiocy and believe it.\n\nFree speech can't be an absolute.  You can't have say a pedophiles subreddit, or a murder-for-hire subreddit... allowing those things isn't some kind of virtuous defense of a constitutional right.  It's idealism taken to a stupid degree that directly causes harm.  The courts have already clarified you can't be free to incite violence, stuff like that.  There are limits.  Sensible limits, generally.\n\nThat \"Liberty for safety\" thing can and is taken to ridiculous extremes.  Obviously, if the government doesn't allow me to build a weapon of mass destruction... that's not a bad thing.  That's trading a little liberty for safety... and only crazy people would think that's not a good trade.  There's a common sense understanding to that saying that somehow seems to be misunderstood.\n\nAs for crypto being free...  well my wife paid a healthy chunk of a transaction fee to Coinbase the other day.  :)  ... I know, I know.  However, I'd argue that crypto just has different masters... and not necessarily better ones.  Heck, wasn't there a concern a while back that China could take 51% of the bitcoin network and assume complete control of it?  Smaller coins already have to deal with this problem.  There are huge players in crypto... It's really not as decentralized as most people think.\n\nHell, I guarantee you that if crypto got big enough to care about China WOULD start screwing with it in 51% attacks.  They more than anyone else in the world have the ability to control it if they decided they wanted to.  Too much mining infrastructure is in China.  It's not good.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is most definitely not some kind of woke culture bullshit.  First, I'm saying what I think will happen, not necessarily what I personally want to happen.  Although... I suppose to some degree I am in favor of some regulation.  I'm not sure how it'd actually work, so I wouldn't argue for specific things right now... but I do think that complete irreversibility and the lack of recovery mechanisms for theft, fraud, loss, or trickery are significant failures that need meaningful solutions.\n\nCaveat Emptor was a BAD THING.

This is the problem Ford and the others have. If you reduce the volume of truck sales by 20-30% the manufacturers probably make no money on their trucks. Ford only makes money on trucks, so if you start to eat into their truck share, it spells disaster for their financials. \n\nWe do not have any information about the design capacity of the CT, but I'm hoping for at least 500k from the Austin plant. If they sell the majority of those in the USA, say 400k and the market doesn't expand, that's already a market share of 16%. Tesla could quite easily reach that run rate in about 2 years.

These two buckets of valuation scenarios are very distant from one another. \n\nIf you look at the $700 mark, and reflect that on the scenario list, essentially we have been floating around scenarios where scale, factory cost, factory speed, and the ability to get costs down are the driving factors.\n\nI know that full self driving is still part of the valuation, that that price is hedged in, but it does seem like the driving factors are non-software related. So it makes me wonder whether progress on full self driving, the wide release of the beta, could lead to a breakout.\n\nOne element of this line of thinking is that we really are sort of in insular echo chamber. I know we all know that, but I’m not sure we appreciate what that means.

{"title": "FORD DD - $F - Don't worry about debt", "selftext": "Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.\n\n**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    \n**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**\n\nWhile Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**\n\nIn other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.\n\nIn short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.\n\nAdditionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.\n\nAt this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.\n\nTherefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.\n\nFrom old post:\n\n1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.\n2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.\n3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.\n4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.\n5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.\n6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.\n7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.\n\nOther side note:  2022 Ford F-150 Lightning is big hit with everyone - [https://www.motor1.com/reviews/508450/2022-ford-f150-lightning-first-ride/](https://www.motor1.com/reviews/508450/2022-ford-f150-lightning-first-ride/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://stockdividendscreener.com/auto-manufacturers/ford-total-debt-and-leverage-ratio-analysis/](https://stockdividendscreener.com/auto-manufacturers/ford-total-debt-and-leverage-ratio-analysis/)", "id": "nhmv7n", "created_utc": 1621582832.0, "score": 110, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "I come from the future, I hope you have diamond hands.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Because it just skyrocketed 15%", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "With the inflation happening nowadays I’ll remind you at 2000%", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "From a dealership perspective as a Ford salesman I can tell you people love the new models.

But this is not what the valuation stems from, I am just speaking in the very long term\n\n2. You do realize that the biggest companies on the NASDAQ all at times had similar ratios?

Just because you can refer past bubbles doesn’t mean that this is a bubble.\n\nLet me leave you with one final thought. When you look at the cost per car, most of that is due to battery costs. Tesla has battery technology they will provide higher power output and density per dollar than its competitors in a huge way. Then, on top of that, you take into account the economies of scale they are going to achieve, and low cost they are going to achieve with the casting machines. What you get is a car body that is cheaper then the competitors, with battery technology that can provide the same range, acceleration, and longevity for a far cheaper price. Add to that the insurance angle and you have a total car that can be produced far more cheaply than anyone else, the profit margin‘s will be very high. \n\nAnd this ignores the energy sector, this ignores the software angle.
