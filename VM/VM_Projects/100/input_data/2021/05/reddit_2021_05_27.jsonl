Much of the stuff are just purpose built ICs, that regulate voltage and such. Nothing a CPU can do. So let's talk about those chips that simply compute stuff.\n\nSometimes you need really quick reaction times (-> realtime is a really important factor here; the airbag *must not* deploy half a second late or it might be worthless or even dangerous), e.g. when processing some sensor data like ultrasonic sensors (you send out a ultrasonic sound signal and measure the time until it bounces back from some object and you catch it again). Normally you basically have some preprocessing here. Some small chip that does nothing else than this and converts it to some kind of digital signal that contains the distance measured. That digital signal then is sent to the main computer where it's processed and e.g. displayed.\n\nIn other cases, a sensor or a bunch of switches or something have a dozen of cables. But for cost reasons you don't want to run more cables than you have to throughout the vehicle. There are already many kilometers of cables in a modern car. And routing those, manufacturing them, putting them into place... reaaaally expensive and a source for errors. So you'd preprocess the stuff and only route one or two cables instead with some digital signal sent over them. E.g. over a LIN bus.\n\nHowever, your general thought is not wrong. A classic car has wayyy more ECUs in it than actually \"needed\". The airbag ECU. An ECU for the seat controls. An ECU for climate control. Even ECUs for controlling the headlights! There are efforts to consolidate this and put more stuff into a single computer. Read up on the AUTOSAR standards for some more information which IIRC had this as one goal.\n\n(but you should not forget that each ECU has special hardware to it: The airbag ECU has multiple sensors like a gyroscope and accelerometers to detect an accident; it also has a big capacitor in it to safe some energy, so that it can actuate the airbags at exactly the right time, even though the battery is already broken due to the crash and thus the car experiences a power loss. Xenon bulbs neeed to be powered by a huge voltage which has to be converted first etc. - each ECU is very specialized and traditionally, they all come from different suppliers, be it Bosch, Continental, ZF, ...)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "When I think about buying a foundry, the only solution that makes sense to me is having a small but highly specialized one for Tesla needs.

Without getting into the details, some of which are laid out in the post here, I think comparing them to other automakers is about as relevant as comparing Apple when the iPhone launched to other phone makers.\n\nFurther, Tesla and EV's bring about benefits to society as a whole (e.g. less climate-change causing carbon, less sickness causing pollution, etc) which justifies, at least till ICE is clearly dead, government benefits funneled that way which should help with profitability in the shorter term.

For example converting the front and back to single casts eliminates 2/3rds (about 600 robots) of your body shop.

I would think in every aspect listed above they are years ahead of any competitors.

We can recycle well over 90% of the lithium found in batteries. And that's even ignoring that those batteries can have a second life in stationary applications. \n\nThere's an incentive recycle because economically viable lithium mines are not too numerous yet, we are essentially piggybacking on ancient dry lake beds and other places where nature concentrated it for us.
