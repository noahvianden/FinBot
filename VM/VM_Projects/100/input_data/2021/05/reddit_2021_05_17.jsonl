Sorry, couldn't resist the joke.\n\n> Put Credit Spread with short leg ITM long leg OTM. Here my loss would be the difference between premium received for short leg minus value of leg at expiry and the long has no bearing unless I manually close it before the bell\n\nThis is understated for the general case. A short put delivers cash and receives shares. The shares have to settle (T+2) before you can do anything with them (but see note below), so there is further risk the shares will lose value before you can liquidate them. Since the short put was ITM on a decline in the underlying, further decline is more likely than a reversal.\n\nNote: Some brokers will give you a float on the settlement time and let you net out the delivered cash vs. shares, so YMMV. Also, specifically for SPX or other cash settled options, this delay in settlement is not an issue, since there aren't any shares. You just pay the net cash difference immediately.\n\n> Put Debit Spread with long leg ITM would be equal to the net cost of option minus the value of option at expiry with the short leg having not bearing on the outcome unless I again closed it manually.\n\nAgain, understated for the general case. An ITM long put that is exercised by exception delivers shares and receives cash. Where do the shares come from? Not from the short put, that expired worthless. So you have to obtain shares to fulfil the exercise of the long put. Your broker may sell shares short to do that. So you get cash from the exercise and cash from the short sale (and cash from the sell to open of the short put leg), but have to cover the short shares at some point. If the underlying goes up in price before you cover, you could end up covering for more money than all the cash you collected combined.\n\nAlso, you should write \"net cost of the spread\", rather than net cost of the option. It's less confusing that way.\n\nSPX and cash settled options would just net cash, no shares to short. So for the cash settled case, expiring at a price between your strikes isn't that bad. It's just slightly worse that both legs being ITM.\n\n> I am looking at the risks involved in expiry because I do not want to risk the PDT strikes from closing before expiry as much as possible.\n\nA better way to avoid PDT is don't trade the same options on the same day. Bet on a lot of different horses. The 0 DTE strategy risk/reward isn't worth the additional risk of trying to dodge PDT. You should have more than $25k cash in your account anyway, if you are trading SPX 0 DTE.

If the price rises too much, the market valuation of the company might outpace its true value, causing professionals to sell the stock and take profit. If the price drops too low, the market valuation is below the true worth of the company and professionals start to buy. This is a **negative** feedback loop.\n\nThe positive feedback loop is destabilizing, the negative feedback loop is stabilizing. By design, crypto does not has a negative feedback loop. So there is no price range where it would naturally stabilize. Thats why people are soooooo touchy on the topic and salty with Musk. The holdings of Tesla are small compared to the total available BTC, but because there is no negative feedback loop, even the small turbulence caused by Musk in the crypto sphere is a huge thing and can cause BTC to crash big time.\n\nSo there you have it, BTC is inherently unstable and based purely on sentiment.

That said, Tesla is not selling any of the bitcoin on its balance sheet.\n\nTesla’s decision seems to have been triggered by private equity firm Greenidge’s plans to revive a coal power plant to mine bitcoin. Elon Musk referenced the announcement in a tweet. Subsequently, Greenidge clarified not only that its plant is powered by natural gas and feeds the grid but also that it bought carbon credits to offset the emissions.\n\nIn our view, the concerns around Bitcoin’s energy consumption are misguided. Contrary to consensus thinking, we believe the impact of bitcoin mining could become a net positive to the environment. With real-world data, we demonstrate how mining could impact the amount of renewable energy provisioned to the grid by transforming intermittent power resources into baseload generation by way of energy storage. We illustrate that renewables would be able to satisfy only 40% of the grid’s needs in the absence of Bitcoin mining but 99% with the commercial “subsidies” associated with Bitcoin mining.\n\nStay tuned for more ARK research highlighting Bitcoin’s potential impact on the adoption of renewable energy.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I don't really care much that they bought carbon credits to \"offset\".

Their plan was within sight with the Lockdowns as both companies were hit hard. They were very close and slotted for BlockBusters fate until **we stepped in and fucked it up**. With everyone straped into their couches this last year binging tiger king how do you increase revenue? They've been trading sidways ever since. Now Netflix is fucked. The release of Cuties shot themselves in the foot (lost 800,000) viewers at such a competitive time in the streaming sector.\n\nKarma's a bitch, just like my stepmom: Netflix has it coming, and that's why I'm not very tall and I hear they have hedges in between the Eiffel tower. *yeah you like that?*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally just don't like Netflix as a company, and for that ***I don't like the stock***\n\nI welcome to your thoughts\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit1: I'm Super Serial guys\n\nEdit2: Ryan Cohen's Cryptic message\n\nSource: [https://mobile.twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1346943412663177218](https://mobile.twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1346943412663177218)\n\nCredit to u/thecrazyslopoke\n\nEdit3: #Netflixeverywhere\n\nSource: [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lIiTv00L-48](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lIiTv00L-48)\n\nThis is not financial advice, I'm not an advisor.

But to think that bankrupting Amc or Gamestop would convert into more Netflix Subs is braindead. Even with expansion of Netflix, I don't believe they have any plans to capitalize on Gamestop or Amc's market because they can't do what Amc or Gamestop Does. Let's think logically. If you go to the theatre OR go shop Gamestop, you more than likely have a Hulu, HbO max, or netflix subscription. The overlap would be insane. If anything Netflix would be competing for market share within their OWN streaming industry. Makes no sense IMO.\n\nInteresting theory, but a link to interactive netflix specials doesn't prove anytthinf like what you're saying.

Will their service be as reliable or match the performance and resellability that physical games provide? Absolutely not. Their competitor would be google stadia if anyone.
