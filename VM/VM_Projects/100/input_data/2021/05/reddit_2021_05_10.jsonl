For example, you could exit when your spread’s delta doubles or the deltas of the short strike double, you could exit at your trade’s breakevens, you could exit at a predetermined fraction/percentage of your max loss (50% of max loss is fairly common, although there’s nothing magical about any particular percentage in and of itself), or you could exit if the underlying closes x number of consecutive days below/above your short strike, and so on. There really is no one magic risk management formula. The key is to know what your rule is before hand, stick with your rule no matter what, and then periodically re assess to determine how appropriate it is with your system. As a general rule, you want to exit your trade at the very earliest point where/when you know you were wrong.

Even if the stock falls further to $100, the put will increase in value a roughly equal amount, so the net loss will stay around $50.

If my call options are in the money at expiration, but I don’t have the cash to be able to purchase the shares, will robinhood sell-to-cover my contracts? Does it fall on me to sell my contracts before expiration if I know that I don’t and will not have the funds to be able to afford to buy the shares at the strike price? Does robinhood automatically execute options at expiration, even if I don’t have the funds to pay for the shares?\n2. If I have a robinhood Gold account, and I *execute* the options in-the-money without having the funds to buy the shares, does the margin account allow me to sell the shares I receive from the execution in order to cover the cost of the shares at the strike price? Is this a freeriding violation? Some brokers appear to allow selling-to-cover, but I can’t seem to figure out if this is possible with robinhood.\n3. And with this question, if I haven’t already, reveals my ignorance: if I want to close out my in-the-money options before expiration, I assume this means that there must be a buyer for my contracts. If the option I bought has a strike price far below the market price (due to a leap in market price), is there a risk of being unable to find a buyer for my contracts to close out my positions? Am I somehow guaranteed to be able to close my options? I’ve bought a few options in the past but none of them worked out before so I didn’t ever have to worry about closing.\n\n\n  Thanks for the guidance, and I know that I shouldn’t be trading options without fully knowing the ins and outs of the process, but I do fully expect to get razzed in the responses regardless.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> So I’ve done something extremely stupid which is to plunge into the world of options trading without fully comprehending the ins and outs. \n\nRead the explainers linked at the top of the page, starting with **Getting started in options**. Your questions are all answered in those, but I'll give brief answers here to whet your appetite.\n\n> If my call options are in the money at expiration, but I don’t have the cash to be able to purchase the shares, will robinhood sell-to-cover my contracts?\n\nThey will unilaterally close the contract (sell to close) before it expires. It's not just RH that will do this, pretty much all brokers will do this, except for the few that will float you the difference by liquidating the shares.\n\n> If I have a robinhood Gold account, and I execute the options in-the-money without having the funds to buy the shares, does the margin account allow me to sell the shares I receive from the execution in order to cover the cost of the shares at the strike price?\n\nExercise, not execute. We make options run laps, not haul them out to the firing squad.\n\nYou will never get to that point because of #1. **And more importantly, never hold options to expiration**. Since you should only exercise at expiration, that means never exercise also. \"Never\" has a few exceptions, but as a rank beginner, treat it as never and learn the exceptions later.\n\nThe goal of trading long calls is to buy low and sell high. It's just like trading stock. Buy to open a call for $4, sell to close a while later for $5, that's a 25% profit on your money, long before you got anywhere near expiration or your strike price. **The goal is not to exercise.**\n\n\n> If the option I bought has a strike price far below the market price (due to a leap in market price), is there a risk of being unable to find a buyer for my contracts to close out my positions?\n\nNo. This is a very common fear that goes against common sense. If you have something that is now worth more than when you bought it, **the reason it is worth more is because there is a demand for it.** Demand drives price up. So how can higher demand mean less of a market for you to close for a profit? That makes zero sense.\n\nYou will always be able to get parity for an ITM call. Parity is stock price minus strike price. If there is plenty of time before expiration, you probably can get more than parity. Again, \"always\" has some exceptions, but you can ignore them for now.\n\n> I’ve bought a few options in the past but none of them worked out before so I didn’t ever have to worry about closing.\n\nI wish people spent more time worrying about the market for assets that **LOST VALUE** than assets that gained value.

If you take profit at 50% max profit and exit at 100% loss relative to max gain, it takes roughly 2 50% winners to makeup for 1 of your biggest loser at 100% loss. \n* Rolling out in time for credit if possible - don't seem to be frequently possible unless rolling very far out, or the losses aren't that heavy yet. Seems reasonable approach when possible and you just want more time to be right.\n* Rolling down - throwing more money in a losing trade and increasing your risk, so far my least favorite thing to even consider\n* Turning into iron condor - Seems reasonable as this reduces max loss with credit you receive from the other side. If the trade continue to go against you this hurts less at the cost of profit if the trade starts swinging back the right way with your original trade. \n\n\nSo far I am leaning towards doing nothing. It is simple because you calculated already what you want to risk at entry. Don't fiddle with it and just let the situation play out. If the trade starts to go against you, the risk:reward actually looks decent enough to just stay on the trade to see if it swings back.\n\nAs an alternative I also keep on thinking about using exiting at % of loss like 100%. Say we have an example where you gets credits 1/3 of the width, e.g. 10 wide for 3.33 credit. Then you close it out when it cost 6.66 to buy it back at 100% loss. \n\nThis prevent the trade from further sliding to max loss, costing 10 to buy back (200% loss at that point). In the former case it takes 2 50% winner to make up 1 100% loss, in the latter it takes 4 50% winner to makeup 1 200% loss. From this perspective this mechanic seems good. \n\nHowever pot odds would seem to maybe best to not do this. At the point of 100% loss, you are risking 1 to make 2 (3.33 credit left to lose versus 6.66 to gain). \n\nWhat mechanics do you guys prefer when dealing with a losing credit spread?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Adding money to a trade is generally a way to risk losing more money. \n\nAll of the rest are reasonable choices.   \nYou get to assess where you want to be in terms of risk.  \n\n I exit early when I see the trade is not behaving as I intended.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you remove the first and last bullets from your list, that's what I do, in priority order.\n\n* Take an x% loss according to my trade plan (also exit after max holding time if not quite x%)\n\n* Roll out and/or down (assuming we are talking about a PCS) for a credit, as long as the new expiration is less than 60 days total.\n\n> So far I am leaning towards doing nothing.

{"title": "I analyzed 9000+ trades made by U.S Senators in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:**  The ability of Senators to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is\n\n**Did Senators beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**\n\n**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com\n\nMassive shoutout to u/rambat1994 for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Senator trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)\n\nWhile senators are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.\n\nAll the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s9r7hqi3kay61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c4662276a454b61da569f3f643b7c5218eb3f4\n\nA total of 9,676 trades were made by the senators in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)\n\n**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. \n\na.            One Month\n\nb.            One Quarter\n\nc.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ahvv5x25kay61.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=190eb917fc2689d2a5156d40ec50f803b5988ef8\n\nAt this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Senators did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldtd6ww6kay61.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aeefa934c23ab0b4ba988c20380e56f72e0e637\n\nIf you had invested in the stocks Senators bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.\n\nNow that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted to be answered was which were the best trades made by Senators over the last 2 years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mae0ngf8kay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e052dde0f4e801f28bfc9bba2e3c7474dc18786\n\nBrian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month, investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Senators were successful as shown below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wfxap4q9kay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=152d4f443a4a7fc8fcae256f6824e6eddde6baf0\n\nThese are the worst trades made by Senators with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period.\n\nBut even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered senators having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cmsj6jkbkay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=56fe38d2ab186d34e1952131a0e1983254d5dea6\n\nJohn Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Senators comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. The next thing I looked at is the Senators that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e06c1s8dkay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=09e02e536f8127b72e942da9fce19f1bdb468ce2\n\nThe top 3 senators as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.\n\nFinally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S senators\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wx93kvfkay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=1136fdc3f26b04a1be2a50091ca5c52b8bb50cd3\n\nAs expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have a $100B+ valuation.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.\n\n1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession\n2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Senators.\n3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Senators. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis analysis proves that Senators indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.\n\nWhichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!\n\nLink to Google Sheet containing all the analysis and trades: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rg5jMYG-X4I7cidQylzCNc_UpJZGNhGrjAt7g0QkXYs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*\n\nEdit: \n\n> There are two chambers in the legislative branch: Senate and House. Not all of these people are “senators” as you describe. \n\nI mistakenly classified all of the trades under the broad term of Senators! This is a mixture of trades done by both houses. So please keep this in mind while reading the post. Apologies again as politics is not really my strong suit.

{"title": "I analyzed 9000+ trades made by U.S Senators in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results.", "selftext": "P**reamble:** The ability of Senators to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is\n\n**Did Senators beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**\n\n**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com\n\nMassive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Senator trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)\n\nWhile senators are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.\n\nAll the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ir6jqgjwsay61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=d057f55015d8e25479815bfe760d4dde81240de6\n\nA total of 9,676 trades were made by the senators in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)\n\n**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. \n\na.            One Month\n\nb.            One Quarter\n\nc.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnijwbqwsay61.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=828da0f685646a73946097f6b0dd86f753de024b\n\nAt this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Senators did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95cl91nwsay61.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=00ffc2fc430e5b7f3157ae4f264872d3ef95a0b2\n\nIf you had invested in the stocks Senators bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.\n\nNow that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted to be answered was which were the best trades made by Senators over the last 2 years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75nyoa5ltay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb5b27919716360fdbaf31f4548f4d21e0401b49\n\nBrian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month, investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Senators were successful as shown below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xing6reltay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9c3d13abbb8b060fecf8cee7b312bbdfd6efaf\n\nThese are the worst trades made by Senators with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period.\n\nBut even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered senators having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4r34rpusay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=084ac821754d87d42d2f1ac9b822a9015125a443\n\nJohn Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Senators comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. The next thing I looked at is the Senators that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/igyz3jwdvay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=223b91d21b9201211a21ea24ec2daee0627b9166\n\nThe top 3 senators as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.\n\nFinally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S senators\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fd66tjagvay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e92ab79c5b7316eb95e70dc22bed0b2f8615127\n\nAs expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have a $100B+ valuation.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.\n\n1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession\n2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Senators.\n3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Senators. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis analysis proves that Senators indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.\n\nWhichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!\n\nLink to Google Sheet containing all the analysis and trades: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rg5jMYG-X4I7cidQylzCNc_UpJZGNhGrjAt7g0QkXYs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*\n\nEdit: \n\n> There are two chambers in the legislative branch: Senate and House. Not all of these people are “senators” as you describe. \n\nI mistakenly classified all of the trades under the broad term of Senators! This is a mixture of trades done by both houses. So please keep this in mind while reading the post. Apologies again as politics is not really my strong suit.

Printing trillions of dollars, giving out $1400 checks to 85% of the country, keeping interest rates at 0% (basically since the global financial crisis, save a year or two where we were at ~2%), and else-wise pumping obscene amounts of money into the economy is bound to lead to rampant inflation at some point.\n\nAs for how to prepare, a good general principle is to buy stocks in companies that will be unaffected by inflation, or even benefit from it. For example, I own a stake in Foot Locker. Foot Locker’s basic business model is to buy shoes from manufacturers like Nike and sell them in retail stores at a premium. These manufacturers usually manufacture in China, where I am less concerned about inflation than within the US, meaning that the cost to manufacture these shoes likely won’t increase. Nike and other manufacturers can then keep wholesale prices consistent instead of raising them with inflation, and Foot Locker will be able to buy their inventory at the same prices as before. They will also be able to raise their retail prices in line with inflation because demand for essential products like shoes is liable to remain constant. Their cost of goods would remain the same, but their revenues would increase. In this scenario, they would actually benefit from inflation and grow their margins.\n\nThere is a possibility that NKE and other manufacturers would decide to raise prices in-line with inflation, which would prevent FL from growing their margins at all (in which case, it would be manufacturers like Nike that benefit). That being said, Foot Locker could still increase prices and would at least remain largely unaffected.\n\nIn other words, look for companies that sell essential products, where rising prices will not lead to a drop in demand, i.e., shoes, pharmaceuticals, food, etc.\n\nAnother strategy would be buying stocks in payment connections firms like Visa or MasterCard. As spending increases, leading to inflation, these companies will be largely unaffected as their basic business model is to charge fees for processing transactions. As spending increases and more transactions happen, there will be more fees for companies like Visa to earn (although I can’t say I recommend buying at these valuations).\n\nI do not believe you should liquidate your stocks in favor of “assets that protect against inflation”.

Once financing is sorted, it will easily 5x in 2 or 3 years. That's not counting the other properties like the one in Saudi Arabia.\n\nJubilee Metals (JLP) - A very safe bet for the future, with a 450m MCAP and if you want a more green mining company, this is it. They buy the waste ground that other mining companies can't be bothered to use and make a killing from it as there is so much. They have recently had a bit of a run up as well due to various factors including moving into Cyprus.\n\nGreatland Gold (GGP) - if you want a safe bet and an amazing value play, buy this stock. They have Havieron (Google it). Recently the stock has been hammered due to it being the golden boy in mining but it had bad results back from one of its other properties. Complete overreaction.\n\nAlien metals (UFO) if you want good exposure to a silver mining company. They also have amazing iron ore and graphite prospects.\n\nEUA if you want to gamble on an amazing sale to various majors. They have Monchetundra (again, google it) and the sale process has been going on for over a year by now. Danger is it is Russian juristiction and putin is bait as fuck. Sale could 10x tomorrow for all we on the boards know but it will likely be another few months and will probably 3x when (if) the sale goes through. But if it doesn't go through and we mine it ourselves then Holy fuck the possibilities for return are endless but so will the wait be.\n\nI have to jet for dinner now so won't be giving any more detail but if you want higher risk / higher reward like the first one in particular then check out GWMO / WSBN / XTR (all AIM tickers).\n\nGood luck, homie.
