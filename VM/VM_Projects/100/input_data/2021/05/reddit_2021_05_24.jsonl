Not looking for \"you're fucked because AMC goes to $100 tomorrow\". I get that much.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "No offense, but these questions really reflect a lack of even a basic understanding of how options work.  You really need to read some of the links at the top of this thread, and watch a few introductory videos from sites like OptionAlpha or Youtube channels like Project Option.\n\nBTW, screenshots are kind of frowned upon around here, because it makes others do the work of figuring out your position.  You should be able to explain your positions yourself.\n\n>Confusion #1:If you purchase a Put like this means you are paying $925 now, and on 6/11, I can then sell 100 shares of AMC at $30, for $3000. $2,075 profit. Yes/no?But yet when I use an options profit calculator I'm told that to make that mystical $2075 profit, I would need the stock to hit $0?\n\nAnd where do you think you are going to get the shares to sell?  You could exercise the put without having them, thus selling them short, but then you'd have to buy to cover, so you're going to have to buy the shares one way or the other.  So you need to factor the cost of buying the shares into your calculation.\n\nBut that's really a moot point, because to take profit from a long option that has moved in your favor, you don't exercise it, you just sell it, as the introductory material you should review will make clear.  Optionsprofitcalculator is telling you that the most you will make on this trade is $2075, because the most you will ever be able to sell that put for is $3000.  And that put will be worth $3000 if and only if the underlying stock goes to zero. Because then, it would theoretically allow a person to buy 100 shares of AMC for $0 and then sell them for $3000.\n\n>Confusion #2: Vanguard's interface is shit. Here, what are the difference betwen buy to open, buy to close, sell to open, sell to close?\n\nVanguard's interface is not optimal for trading options, but it's not their fault you don't understand this.  Read these links from the main post above:\n\n**Getting started in options**\n\n• [Calls and puts, long and short, an introduction (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/basics)\n\n• [Options Basics (begals)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/gh9vpl/options_basics/)\n\n>If AMC is $25, and I set my strike for $20, I'm saying I \\*want\\* the stock to go to $20 by the expiration, or sooner, correct?\n\nIt would be nice, but it's not necessary for that to happen in order for you to make a profit.  All that is necessary is for the value of the put to increase so that you can sell it for a profit.  Again, you really need to read/watch a lot more introductory material.  The way you make money with options is not by using them as a bet that a stock will reach a certain price by the expiration date.\n\n>Confusion #3: I really don't want to do anything complicated here.I buy stock and hold it. If stock price goes up, I am happy. That's all I need. Calls have never interested me, because if I think the stock is going to go up, why would I buy a call? I'll just go buy 100 of the stock!\n\nGood, that's what you should do.  And if you think a stock is going to go down, why would you buy a put?  You can short the stock.  You don't consistently make money with options by buying single long options as directional bets.  For one thing, options' value decays with time, unlike shares of stock.\n\n>Confusion #4: The fact that you can buy puts for higher than what the stock is currently trading, and calls for lower than what the stock is currently trading, or I guess \"ITM\" is the fancy word here, that seems crazy to me. Free money???\n\nNo, because the premium--that is, the cost--of the option itself negates what you are thinking of as \"free money.\"  Say McDonald's is currently selling Big Macs for $3 each.  Then let's say they issue a coupon allowing its bearer to buy a Big Mac for $2.50, and you buy one of these coupons from someone else for $1.  You then take it to McDonald's and use it to buy a Big Mac for $2.50.  So you've spent a total of $3.50 to obtain a Big Mac, which you could have just bought without the coupon for $3.  Is that free money?\n\n>Confusion #5: Vanguard gives me the option to \"sell\" my puts after I have purchased them. I guess this means to \"exercise\" them? How do I go about even calculating what profits/losses happen if I exercise something? Should I even, or just always wait for expiration?\n\nVanguard also gives you the option to \"sell\" shares of stock after you have purchased them.  Are you confused about what that means?  Selling them means selling them, as in giving them to someone else and they give you money in return.  Exercising them means using them to buy or sell 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price.  And as you will learn from reading and viewing more introductory material, you normally never do this.  Under most circumstances, you just sell to close.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Confusion #7: Why are these numbers different?  \n>  \n>Here it says I have 150 shares of $7 at 6/11, but yet in this view I'm being told 195??? These are the exact same holdings. What the hell?\n\nNo idea.  I'm not familiar with how Vanguard's interface handles options.  Plus the second one isn't even a full screenshot, and doesn't even have column headers.  How are we supposed to know what we're looking at?  I would guess those numbers represent the numbers of contracts you have.  Did you first buy 150 of them, then happen to buy 45 more?  You can always call Vanguard and ask them.  But if you don't even know what you bought, God help you.\n\n>Confusion #8: If I let an option expire, or reach end of day given the expiration date, then it's kaput? The amount I paid for the option is gone, and that's that? No profit, just losses for the amount on the option? Why wouldn't I sell the option before end of day, then, at the very least? Recoup some of the losses, even if the option doesn't sell for much.\n\nYou would.\n\n>Confusion #9: This is the fun one.

{"title": "Apple Stock Analysis: Is AAPL a good buy?", "selftext": "Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my first analysis that I post anywhere. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday we will look through the basics of Apple´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple´s stock using discounted free cashflow. \n\nThis is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.\n\nFirst let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. \n\nFor the valuation: \n\nWe take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple´s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.\n\nNow feel free to include a margin of safety to that. \n\nBecause Apple´s price is higher right now, I don´t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.\n\nWhere I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. \n\nWhat I´ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. \n\nThank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.", "id": "nk5zl6", "created_utc": 1621884208.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "You should look into Buffett's financial statement analysis of businesses.

Getting  rid of a transmission, engine, and all the complex parts there is a huge deal, which is already accomplished. The main parts the in-wheel motor eliminates is the halfshafts and differential. I am very skeptical that it makes more sense to build multiple in-wheel motors vs one mounted one that connects to a diff which connects to the halfshafts which drive the wheels.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "That's false.

Much more critically their insufficient capital to achieve their production targets and rising costs, are real concerns that might weigh on the stock heavily. To put it simply, the company is going to go bankrupt if they can't produce sufficient revenues or fundraise soon.\n\nSteve Burns likes talking about Tesla, but I might remind you, Tesla did many rounds of fundraising in the stock market that were very dilutive to get to where they are (including being near bankruptcy in the M3 ramp). This is not a small thing to consider. LMC is a small company trying to get to volume production their first time (ignoring for the moment the issues with whether the in-wheel motor design makes sense or not) and if comparing to Tesla which was forgiven for doing that fundraising, not sure investors in LMC will be as tolerant.\n\nThe rest... They being the only game.. Well the Tesla CT has a 6 ft bed so is a large truck, has 250 miles range and costs $39,900 versus the Endurance costing $52,500... Oh, and the CT has a stainless steel body (no rust). Of course you can get the dual-motor CT for $49,900 that has 300 miles of range (50 more than Endurance). The dual-motor CT is hopefully aimed for production late 2021 (much like I will be surprised if the Endurance is sold this year, I would be a drop less surprised if the CT is sold this year).\n\nThe van, not happening for a while as LMC will not have the money without fundraising to touch that, until they can sell the Endurance in sufficient quantities. Beta and so on, is nice and all that, but not the same as production. Also while they have aced their crash tests (I am not surprised by that) we don't have anyone driving these things, testing them in any manner or whatnot. Rather we have a mostly useless SF250 result to go with (and mind you they drove 20 mph over 40 miles, when top competitors did that same section between 50-70 mph).\n\nRegarding the down payments, they were very unclear what they meant. So no comment. The M&A is interesting but not sure anyone will buy them without being satisfied that in-wheel motors are a viable approach. This was not addressed at all. In fact they can't address the short-seller report! Does not sound good to me. Jagdeep Singh of QS had no trouble discussing Scorpion Capitals claims by comparison.\n\nAs to the Army looking at them... well NASA looked at Blue Origin and then went with SpaceX, which led to all sorts of suits and politicking by Jeff Bezos. The government will look at many options, does not mean that you are going to get anyplace (anyone recall the US Postal Service and Workhorse group... another company Steve Burns funded... if history repeats does not bode well for RIDE).\n\nBottom line, I did not see much positive in the report. It was not nearly as negative as I thought it could have gone, so will give them that, but the fact is they are looking down the barrel of bankruptcy if they have any trouble getting to production and can't raise funds.\n\nNo clue what this all means for my Puts tomorrow. Stock did not fall too bad in afterhours, but then volume was low so could be sellers were holding back. We find out tomorrow.

Tesla will make a $40K version of the CT with 250 miles of range but one motor. The dual motor will cost $50K and has 300 miles of range (Endurance has 250). The tri-motor CT which costs $70K has a 500 miles of range.  You make an assumption that having 4 in-wheel motors is important, when in fact, based on something like the SF250, it was no benefit at all. A dual motor truck is all wheel drive, just not independent all wheel drive. If anything in a tough situation, the Endurance can only put out max 150 hp to a single wheel whereas the Tesla can transfer most of the 283 hp (assuming Model 3 motors) to a single wheel by simply applying the brake to the opposing wheel (they do this with the Model S). This assumption that 4 in wheel motors gives you better ability off road to move is simply an assumption that very likely does not hold up, hence this argument that 4 in-wheel motors is better than dual-motors is simply flawed.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is a very old a tedious argument dismissed a month ago. Rivian already demonstrated range in sand, and based on Rivian range, endurance scored the 250:40 miles per charge ratio. Range is accurate, LMC over projected the ratio. \n\nIn the SF250, the vehicle was modified with bigger wheels. Also, the wheel hubs rely on the software to perform. Since this was the first time they tested in those conditions with bigger wheels, energy consumption wasn't on par with what they projected. They can make tweaks in the software to improve performance and they'll need to rethink using those super wheels for next year.\n\nThe wheel tech being ‘better’? Better is a word used by uneducated investors to be blunt. It provides lower maintenance costs because the problems that go wrong are easy to get at and the pieces that need replacing are less costly on average. \n\nNo one is saying better, they are saying cheaper. Which is what fleets are after. There is also speculation that it may get better traction in pulling, but ‘most’ of their purchasers are not interested in that. \n\nAlso, having motors in all wheels make each one really independent one from the other.
