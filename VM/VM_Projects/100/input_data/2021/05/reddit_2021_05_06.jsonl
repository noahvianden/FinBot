{"title": "üëÄüëë Opportunity in SKLZ - Hear Me Out", "selftext": "üö®UPDATE: FREE float being gobbled up by Cathie every day and multiple catalysts in Cathie speaking about SKLZ At 3 Pm On CNBC today as well as jobs data disappointment and plummet in yields. Today could potentially be a BIG squeeze day... \n\nORIGINAL POST: \n\nWhether you are a short term trader or a long term investor, I believe there is a huge opportunity in $SKLZ. \n\nüíµ üöÄ üöÄ For Short Term Traders: \n\n1. Short volume ratio was ~54% as of today and short volume was ~33% \n\n2. Cathie Wood has bought &gt;6 million shares in the last 48 hours, which invites hedge funds to short heavily\n\n3. ER was a fantastic catalyst yesterday, with a beat on revenue, a raise on full year guidance, the addition of executives from Airbnb and Beats, 95% gross profit margins, and 83% YOY paying user growth - shorts still won the fight even though it started green today, ending another ~10% down\n\n4. SKLZ is down ~70% from its high in February \n\nThis is the perfect short squeeze candidate in my opinion, with the fundamentals to back it as a long term growth play. Retail loves it, Cathie loves it, and funds love to short it. \n\n‚úÖ üí™üèºFor Growth Investors: \n\n1. SKLZ is the Shopify of mobile gaming. Both are PLATFORM providers for small developers. However, SKLZ provides a platform that allows any game developer to host real time multiplayer cash competitions. Skillz is able to have 95% gross profit margins because they have no game development costs. \n\n2. Mobile game developers are incentivized to partner with Skillz not only because of their 2.7 million monthly active users and growing... but because users on Skillz games are more than EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY to pay than they would be for an in app purchase. On average, 17% of Skillz games users pay to play. The average deposit is over $10.30. \n\n3. SKLZ issued upped full year guidance of 375 million, however, they noted they are EXTREMELY frugal with this. The chance of a HUGE beat on this guidance is very high. The following were left out of revenue projections: \n-Expansion to India in Q3 of this year (Indian mobile gaming market is growing twice as fast as the US and is much larger to begin with. US is only 10%)\n-Tetris and Big Buck Hunter being added to the platform, as well as several additional games with synchronous tournaments being tested\n-Monetization of non-paying players through ads etc beginning Q3\n-The sale of the huge trove of customer data Skillz has acquired, beginning in Q3\n......... ADDITIONALLY: Next year‚Äôs revenue guidance has not been updated but was originally pegged at 560 million, WITHOUT any of the above catalysts. \n\n4. Skillz plans to expand to several additional countries in 2022, which alone could quadruple revenues by 2023E \n\n5. Management plans to partner with exercise companies such as peloton and first person shooter games to allow for real-time competition where Skillz takes a 15% cut of all entry fees. Remember, regardless of who wins a match, Skillz will take 15% of the entry fees. Peloton has specifically been mentioned numerous times by the CEO in interviews. Imagine versing someone through their app and the fastest time wins the payout. Battle royal games in the near future are also a market they are expanding into according to the earnings report. \n\n6. Look at how Shopify grew over a 5 year time horizon. The chart was also ugly to start and people didn‚Äôt understand the small developers e-commerce offering just as they don‚Äôt understand Skillz. Most funds and analysts still think Skillz makes games, while they only provide a platform. However, in the future they could make some of their own like Netflix does. \n\n7. Skillz recently partnered with the NFL for a competition to have a game developer make a viral NFL game that will be cross-marketed by the NFL and Skillz. This submission period ends in May and we can see something by the beginning of next year, and marketing later this year as well as a beta version. Expect tons of additional partnerships to roll out, as SKILLZ will likely partner with additional sports organizations and potentially gambling platforms such as DKNG (shared SPAC management team brought them both forward). \n\n8. 618 million in cash on the balance sheet with ZERO debt and tons of postings on their website looking for strategy analysts with M&amp;A and investment banking experience. I believe they are looking to acquire heavily to grow their pretense internationally in the coming year. \n\n9. Players on average spend ~62 minutes per day playing Skillz games, which is more than the average time spent on Tiktok, Snapchat, Facebook, and Netflix. This is a metric well regarded and shared by management. \n\nListen.... SKLZ is not for the faint of heart, but I strongly and truly believe, in 5 years, THIS can be the next Shopify. I am simply here to let you know why I believe in it. Both short and long term.

I've been an anonymous lurker on reddit for the better part of a decade, finally made an account a few months ago so I could upvote / downvote things, but have never quite gotten the nerve to say anything, largely because of the \"look at his post history!\" replies and because I never felt I had something valuable enough to say or the time to write it up (that should change - if I take then I should give as well).\n\nAs many introverts are; I'm good with numbers. I've methodically slightly beaten the market for years - staying cautious and diversified, avoiding big losses but avoiding big wins as well. After taking a big chunk of that and putting it into my own company, I decided to finally make a big bet. I was highly intrigued by SKLZ when it first shot up to $30+. It had a great growth story and a huge market opportunity. It seemed high risk / high reward, but not purely speculation - it had big backing from Cathie Wood, Motley Fool, Morgan Stanley, etc. Still, I thought the price was too high and couldn't bring myself to jump in. And honestly I don't care for the company name. \n\nAlso no, the games aren't great (yet). As a gamer myself, they're definitely not something I'd sit around at home playing in my spare time. But that's not the target market. Mobile gaming is largely about people (mostly non hardcore games - a bigger market) pulling out their phone as a short distraction at a bus stop, waiting in line for lunch, procrastinating at work, etc. These are things that are going to increase as the world opens back up. And things like Candy Crush and Words with Friends weren't huge because of their impressive graphics or complex gameplay - they were huge because they were addictive, competitive, and simple enough for anyone to play. \n\nAfter the initial surge in Skillz price came insider selling, a secondary offering, and short reports. To me the short reports had some valid points, but were grossly exaggerated and misunderstood the business. The insider selling - well, if I manage to take my company public at that valuation you sure as hell better believe I'm cashing in 10% of my hard work to get some financial security for my family and not be 99.99% all in on one thing. That was perfectly reasonable to me and company leadership is still heavily invested in the company. The secondary offering was very poorly timed, but did provide them with the cash necessary to put out big marketing campaigns and draw in new users. \n\nThe price plummeted and seemed to stabilize at around $18. The price was right for me, and I went nearly all in on 100 December $15 calls (tried to post position, but comment wouldn't go through with the image). Then I watched in horror as the shorts relentlessly pushed it down to $13, then watched in relief as it shot back up to $21. Then the short attacks started again. Even after great ER (for an early stage high growth company) they continued. AH it dropped 8% before numbers even came out, then after release went to +5%, then the next day back down 9%. The price action has been completely absurd, clearly manipulated, and has caused me to pretty well lose hope in a system that allows this to happen to a promising company while CumRocket shoots up like 4000%. \n\nI'm not asking for any help with my bags. That's been another hesitation of mine in ever posting anything - the fear that I would cause someone to make a poor decision and lose big money. So please understand that this is still high risk, but both the short term and long term opportunities are there as the OP laid out so well. If they weren't, I'd unload my bags and at least put them somewhere else. But at this point it's also about more than the loss to me - I'm furious at a system that allows this to continuously happen and want to see it burnt to the ground piece by piece. \n\nAnd yes, I saw where CNBC mentioned it could be a WSB target while WSB was clearly focused on MVIS. But just because CNBC was wrong there, or is usually wrong, or is probably even oftentimes intentionally wrong, doesn't mean that anything they even mention is a bad company. This is a huge opportunity, and one that could absolutely squeeze hard. No, it's not the next GME and is unlikely to get squeezed to $100+ - the float is too high. But it could easily go 2X - 3X if there's enough volume to trigger it.", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "actually really love skillz. been in since it was feac. the growth potential is OFF THE CHARTS. they have guidance for 375m and i think 3 or 4 games make up 80% of that. you add another hit or 2 and boom we growing past 500m.

Can you please explain what did you exactly do over here?", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "What I did was a pure gambling (that's why the name of this sub is wallstreetbets). I bought 10 call contracts of AMZN for $10.678 each around 9:33 am. At that time of my purchase, AMZN stock price was about $3250 and the strike price of the call contracts was $3300 that expires tomorrow. What that means is I speculated that by 4:00 pm tomorrow AMZN will be over $3300 and I paid $10.678 premium per share for that contract. Remember that each contract is my privilege to buy 100 shares of AMZN at 3300 per share. Now if AMZN closes at $3400 tomorrow then I can buy 1000 (10 contracts \\* 100 shares) shares of AMZN for only $3300 per shares. Which means I will profit 100\\*1000=100K minus the total premium of 10.67K (roughly 89.33K). \n\nKeep in mind that, most people do not have that kind of money to buy 1000 shares of AMZN and most don't buy these contracts with an intention to buy the underlying stocks.\n\nNow, around 9:38 am, after 5 minutes of my purchase of these contracts, AMZN stock price moved up to about 3270. That's a increase in $20 per share which caused my contracts to increase their value to $18.69. Which means a $20 increase in underlying stock price increased the value of the contracts by $8. In order to understand why only $8 but not $20 you have to understand how these contracts work. Anyways, at that time I sold them at $18.69 per contracts resulting in a total of 18.69K (10 contracts \\*$18.69 per share\\*100 shares)(remember I paid 10.67\\*) netting a total profit of $8K.\n\nI could also make money by buying 1000 shares of AMZN at $3250 per share but that would need me to invest 3.25 million dollars! With that $20 per share price increase I could make 20K instead of 8K but duh! I do not have 3.25 million dollars. Even if I had I would not just buy that many AMZN shares just to make 20K (That's just 0.61% vs 80% that I made).\n\nSo far what I have wrote was all good but imagine AMZN went down by 20 in that 5 minutes. In that case I could lose around 70-80% in that 5 minutes! And that happened as many times as I made profit if not more. \n\nTlDr: I risked $10.6K for some AMZN options expiring tomorrow and got lucky with timing a.k.a gambling paid off.

Now the difference between the strike price of $3300 and the closing price of $3306.37 is only $6.37. Which means the contract only worth $6.37 because if you buy shares at 3300 when the share price is actually 3306.37, it make sense that you pay 6.37 extra as the premium because that's the actual difference between the true stock price and the strike price. This value is also known as intrinsic value of an option. Now, this scenario is true if the option expire today but he option is expiring tomorrow and no one in this world knows what will be the closing price of AMZN tomorrow. What if AMZN closes at 3400 tomorrow? Which means whoever is selling that option is taking a risk on a speculation that AMZN will lose lower than today. For taking that risk he is charging you an extra $20.2-6.37=$13.83. This extra value of the premium is called the extrinsic value of an option. Which means an option has it's true (intrinsic) value and an extrinsic (mostly premium for taking risk)\n\nOptions have five parameters known as Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega and Rho. The extrinsic value of any contract, be it a call or put, at a given time depends on these five Greeks. When a stock price changes over time, depending on how much change and how fast the change is, these parameters change and hence the option contract price. Every option contract has a expiry date and the most important parameter is the **theta** when the expiry date is close. This is basically how much the contract will lose vale in a single day inherently, if the stock price remain the same a whole day. For instance, the one I traded today expires tomorrow and has the theta value of -$15.53. Which means if AMZN remains at 3306.37 the whole day tomorrow and close at that price, that 3300 call option price will be $(20.20-15.53)=$4.67.\n\nNow consider the person who paid $20.2 for the contract buying 100 shares of AMZN at 3300 per share. He will pay 330K for 100 shares. He already paid $20.2\\*100=$2020 resulting in his net cost for owning 100 AMZN shares at $332020. Now consider the closing actual price of 100 shares at $3306.37\\*100=$330637. A net loss of $1383 per contract. If he bought 10 contract like me then a net loss of $13830 and so on. What is the point?\n\nThe main point is there is no guaranty that AMZN will close above todays closing price tomorrow. What if AMZN closes $3270? The price of your option will be 0. AMZN need to close above $3320.2 (3300 for stock+ 20.2 for premium) just for you to break even. If it closes above $3320.2 only then you can make money. If the expiry date is few days ahead and I am at a small loss then I might wait to see if it recovers because that time theta would be relatively smaller than the one that expires tomorrow.\n\nIn the above example I simplified many things to make it easy to comprehend. I did not consider the inter-relationship between those Greeks while explaining the decay of option value. Hope it was helpful.\n\nEdit: If it did not go my way I would wait few hours to see if it recovers only if the total loss was below 30%.

{"title": "How to cope with RKT losses.", "selftext": "Many of you myself included woke up this morning with worthless calls, or a lot of RKT shares down almost 18 percent. \n\nRather than posting loss porn or crying about it, here are some things you can do to turn the ship around\n\n1. Diversify - there are several good plays always available. Realize that betting the farm on one good play has the very real chance of turning against you. Myself personally, I hate diversification. I would rather just put all my money into a few companies I trust, sit back, and watch what happens. The current market environment right now however is punishing us for portfolio concentration. You don't have to invest in the SPY to be fully diversified, but it would certainly help to have maybe a pool of 8-12 stocks you really like, and try to at least have a little bit of sector diversification so that when all of tech is down you still have something up.  IE.. I love CRSR, ASO, RKT, and TSLA. If you like all these companies about equally, don't feel like a loser for divvying up your money between them. There is no rule that you have to pick one and live or die by their earnings. \n2. If you hold RKT shares, don't sell. It's still a good company. They had one slightly lower than expected quarter (literally missed by 1 penny on the EPS). It's not the end of the world. Most analysts agree that the stock is still undervalued. Right now people are panic selling and trying to make the shareholders feel miserable. If you bought at 23 then you should hold at 18 and tough it out. **AT THE VERY LEAST - if you no longer want to be a long term shareholder, seriously consider chilling out for a bit and waiting for the stock to revert to the mean**. RKT has solid fundamentals. This isn't MVIS, WKHS, SPCE.\n3. Sell covered calls - I would wait 1-2 weeks for the RKT hate to die down. When sentiment is back to \"neutralish\" and the stock has recovered a little bit from the major blow, start selling covered calls to work your way back to cost basis. You might have to keep doing this for a few months but eventually I see RKT going back up to 22-23 range quite easily. RKT is and always has been a great stock to wheel, the earnings report hasn't changed that.\n\n\\- LAST, don't lose hope. If you lost all your money on RKT calls, it's okay. I started out in the stock market very little capital. It took me about a year to reach portfolio value of around 40k. I'm down a bit from there, but I'm in this for the long haul. This is your chance to restart using everything you've learned about the stock market to make better decisions. Also.. think about it this way. You paid for those calls or those shares for the OPPORTUNITY but not the GUARANTEE that the shares would go up. Those calls weren‚Äôt worthless, you made a calculated bet with the hope/expectation of gain.

Let's say that margins go back to historical averages of about say 2-2.5%. What you would need to do to go back to 2020 levels of revenue for RKT is to produce twice the volume as margins are halved, which considering the drop off in refi, does not seem likely. So far, things look bearish and hence the sell-off. So I get that. But now lets consider the following:\n\n\\- Growth in market share to offset some of the drop off\n\n\\- Growth in adjacent verticals\n\n\\- X-selling products to the same customer base which has a 91% retention rate.\n\n\\- for all we know interest rates could go down again. Trying to predict rates is a fool¬¥s errand\n\n\\- surge in inventory/supply over the next coming years + forbearance ending = price stability = more bids = more origination volume\n\nThe thing that makes me bullish on this stock is not how much cash they generated in 2020 or can generate in Q2 of 2021, but rather, it is the amount of cash they can generate 5 years from now as they on-board more and more customers and x-sell more and more products. Sure, the margin on each product sold will be less than what it is now, but the growth in market share and secondary verticals should be more than sufficient to offset that.\n\nBut, let's assume that the market share growth isn't sufficient and RKT will never go back to 2020 levels. Let's assume that in 2024 they manage to generate **only** 2B in profits from all of their revenue streams combined. At 2B shares (D + A class), that is $1 EPS x 20 multiple = 20 dollar per share. That is the WORST case scenario that I can think of. I personally do believe that they can generate way way way more than $1 of EPS in 2024.\n\nYou can be bearish in the short term. That thesis makes a whole lot of sense to me. But I cant for the life of me understand how you can be bearish on the largest player in an industry that is expanding and capturing market share every single quarter.\n\nIf this was a tech stock losing money every quarter to gain market share, we¬¥d all be throwing money at it hand over fist. But somehow because it just so happens that lending isn't sexy, we suddenly throw growth potential out the window? Also, who knows, acquisitions, deals, and a strong balance sheet could potentially propel them for even stronger growth.\n\nThe one and only question you need to answer when it comes to investing in RKT is: **Do you think that the lending market will decline, stagnate or grow a few years out from now?** There is virtually no indication as far as I can tell that the lending market as a whole will decline. In fact, if anything, more and more people go into debt every day in order to purchase a home, car, etc. RKT can serve all of those verticals as their CEO said multiple times over the ER calls.\n\nWhat do you make of this assessment?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is a great analysis, and in no way am I bearish on RKT....I have tons of it, it's the largest stock investment in my portfolio.

I live in Cleveland, where Dan Gilbert is something of a hero (or clown).  He owns the Cavs, and I drive by Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse everyday.   One of my good friends is a senior banker at Quicken, and he thinks they are going to grow exponentially OVER THE NEXT 3-5 YEARS.   Shit, DG said himself when it spiked in March that he thought RKT was undervalued at 40.   I believe in the management team moreso than RKT or the housing market at large.

{"title": "VIAC massively undervalued right now and has had an amazing earnings report", "selftext": "VIAC (ViacomCBS) is massively undervalued following a hedge fund selloff and even after an amazing earnings report. \n\nAs of right now, VIAC has a PE ratio of about 10.5, in a market where all of its competitors in the industry have an average of 44. VIAC's quarterly report just came in today, and earning were beat by a huge 25%. Professional analysts projected and EPS of $1.22, and in their earnings report this morning, VIAC brought in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.52, and a GAAP EPS of $1.42, beating the professional estimates by a lot. It's not just this quarter, VIAC has beat every earnings estimate in the last year. The earnings were driven mostly by their fairly new streaming service, Paramount+, which had a growth of a nice 69% since last year. More and more people are starting to recognize and buy their Paramount+ subscription. Many of the shows they have are geared towards children (or the man childs like me still watching them) such a Spongebob and Avatar, as well as sports, many shows from comedy central, and others. I can honestly see Paramount+ becoming a pretty major competitor with Netflix, Disney+, and Hulu in the future, the rates at which their subs are growing is pretty impressive.\nVIAC also has a decent dividend payout of 2.4% and it should be coming soon following the earnings report, but I do not know the exact date. They are also undervalued based on their price to book ratio, which is 1.6 compared to the industry average of 2.1.\n\nThe most amazing part of VIAC is that the value of VIAC's assets is worth less than the market cap of the company, meaning that if VIAC sold all the assets they own right now and liquidated the company, it would worth more than the stock value of the company itself. VIAC currently has a market cap of $24 billion, and their assets alone dwarf the market cap. Their long term assets alone are worth $39 billion, they have another $7 billion in receivables, and an additional $3.6 billion in physical assets, plus $3 billion o liquid cash on hand right now, which adds up to a total of $52 billion in assets, yet the market cap of VIAC is less that half of that. The one off thing that takes this down is VIAC's $19 billion debt, but  VIAC's value of assets-liabilities ($52B-$19B) brings it to around $33 billion, which makes it 28% undervalued based on assets alone.\n\nThe only reason VIAC is as low as it is right now is because of the massive hedge fund selloff from Archegos, which single handedly drove the share price down from $100 to $40. Knowing the selloff is coming, many investors took short positions on the company, some still are, but in the last month, the short interest on VIAC has dropped almost 40%. Even the shorts know it's undervalued and they're all exiting their positions. VIAC is having the fire sale of a lifetime, in a time where the majority of other stocks are overvalued. My price target for VIAC is $60 short term, and I can see it going back up to $100 by the end of the year. Positions: 20 shares @$41 each\n\nTL;DR: VIAC is on sale and massively undervalued, and dropped so much because of  large hedge fund selloff.

{"title": "Advice to new investors, from a new investor", "selftext": "Advice to New Retards from another relatively new Retard.\n\nI am going to list out a handful of things that even though I had done a fair amount of research before opening up a trading account. It was not nearly enough, and below are things that I in hindsight wish I would have read somewhere or seen advice on.\n\n¬∑ More often than not, when you read news on a company and expect the price to soar because of that news. That news is probably already reflected in the price for that stock. The best example of this is DKNG for my portfolio. The news for this company in Q1 has been fucking outstanding. New partnerships and or exclusive partnerships with almost every major sports organization. New states legalizing Sportsbooks. Cathie Wood buying a large number of shares for her portfolios. Fantastic YoY growth. Purchasing or expanding their media footprint. At face value, all of this news should have them trading at least 40% higher than what they were at for Jan 1. But it isn‚Äôt it is trading at about 15% higher than what it was then. As I mentioned, more often than not all of that news is factored into the stock days if not weeks before any public announcement or article publishing that.\n\n¬∑ Take your fucking profits and cut your fucking losses. The best advice I have ever heard is to set your profit/loss orders. 20% for-profit and 16% for loss. Set it and forget it. Period. Or if you are comfortable taking any profit at all, take your 5% and exit. Whatever you think is best for your financial situation and portfolio. Or if you are long on the stock, don‚Äôt even look at the daily for it. If you know your entry, and you know where you want to exit. The same thing set it and forget it. Looking at the daily will only cause stress. Trust me, I fucking know. RKT is my example of that. I currently have 25 shares in RKT on an AVG entry of $22.8. But I should‚Äôve taken my fucking profit when it peaked at $43 in March. Pocketed my gains, and entered back in after it dropped and averaged out. But no, I held. I held hoping their Q1 earnings would drive it higher than what it was in March. Guess what. It fucking didn‚Äôt. It dropped to a little over $19 per share today. I am long on RKT, as they are going to be an absolute juggernaut for the next 5 years in their industry. BUT I should‚Äôve taken my profits and re-entered\n\n¬∑ I‚Äôm retarded. You‚Äôre retarded. We‚Äôre all fucking dipshits and if you think you‚Äôre not then you‚Äôre probably the biggest dipshit in here. Now that is out of the way. Don‚Äôt invest in a stock/company if you don‚Äôt understand what the fuck they are actually doing. MVIS is that example for me. Read pages and pages of honestly still very good DD. But it might as well of been written in hieroglyphs because I didn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt understand a god damn word of it. Something about LIDAR and some beep boop shit that is going to enable robots and cars to detect shit. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt understand it. But  I invested, and closed a position in a different great company because it was trending in the cesspool of mouth breathers. Entered at $22 and cut my losses at $16 per share. YTD, because of what I threw at it. It is my most significant loss and I am sure they are a great company with a giant upside in the future, but I don‚Äôt understand it and won‚Äôt be opening another position on it unless my low functioning brain can eventually process what they are doing (probably not going to happen). Oh well, it taught me a great lesson.\n\n¬∑ Trying to play earnings is risky, to say the least. Again, RKT is a great example of that. Honestly, their earnings report was overall very good, and they only slightly missed their projections. But because they did miss it, it has fallen around 20%. Also, even if the company beats its earnings projection, it may not increase a whole lot. If any, and for some odd fucking reason it could even go drop. Look at AMD, that ticker confuses me almost as much as DKNG. AMD is a great long stock as well, but good luck trying to predict what the fuck it is actually going to do before, or after earnings. I mean shit, really even daily.\n\n¬∑ Do you own god damn DD. Read every DD post on here, and take it with a grain of salt. More often than not the DD is pretty well written and researched, but it is almost always written by someone who has a large number of shares or portfolio % in that. It‚Äôs like listening to a Wendy‚Äôs employee tell you that they have the best fries, and no other fries compared to theirs. Well yeah, mother fucker you work there and have a vested interest in trying to convince me of how great your fries are.\n\n¬∑ Figure out your own goals with your portfolio. Whether that‚Äôs you being a daily trader and closing and opening positions daily or picking your stocks to go long in. Or split your portfolio in half and do both. Up to you, but you need to know what you are trying to achieve with it and have a clear path laid out of doing so.\n\n¬∑ If you are able to, put everything you can into a Roth IRA, it is exempt from capital gains tax. You can put a maximum of $6,000 in it per year. Do that before you put any money anywhere else. You have to have it longer than 5 years before you should even think about withdrawing any money out of it. But really, you shouldn‚Äôt withdraw anything out of it ever. Have an individual account with fuck around money, or to have access for a rainy day or emergency funds or whatever. You will pay capital gains tax on it yearly, but that just is what it is.\n\n¬∑ ETF‚Äôs are boring as fuck and not sexy, but they keep your portfolio balanced and are really just less risky as you are investing in a wide variety of stocks that you might not be able to afford individually. Take BETZ for example. For most investors, especially as they are starting off you may not have the expendable income to just outright purchase stocks like PENN for example. But you can invest in shares with them by purchasing ETFs that already have shares on them.\n\n¬∑ Paper trading is an underutilized resource. It allows you to experiment in investing without legitimately risking anything financially. Do it. Do it even if you‚Äôve been trading for a while. It is an excellent technique for perfecting or just training yourself on the market.\n\n¬∑ Finally, you‚Äôre not DeepFuckingValue. He researched for months if not years and followed GME as in-depth as he could and read pretty much everything readily available on them. Researched Board members, followed market trends, and ultimately, he had fuck around money where he could throw a significant amount of money at it. Everything, obviously, worked out in his favor but it could have just as easily not. GME could have very easily gone bankrupt as there were a lot of really intelligent people who thought they could and cited them and their business model as very similar to Blockbuster. Chances are you are not going to do the amount of research on any stock, with as much as he did for GME. Don‚Äôt pretend you will, and don‚Äôt lie to yourself saying you will. I joined here in January, and have learned so much. But again, I‚Äôm a fucking idiot and so are you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you have any advice, you wish you would've been told when you first started. Please add it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit Note:\n\n I originally listed TQQQ as an example in the portion of ETFs.
