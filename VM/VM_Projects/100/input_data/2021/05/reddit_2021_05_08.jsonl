Facebook went so far as to take out full-page newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt Facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world. Shortly after, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized Facebook's business model.\n\nNonetheless, Facebook and others have complied with Apple's new rule to avoid being rejected from the iPhone's App Store, though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the Apple-mandated prompt to opt in or out appears.\"\n\nSource:  https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/96-of-us-users-opt-out-of-app-tracking-in-ios-14-5-analytics-find/", "id": "n7eybf", "created_utc": 1620439925.0, "score": 14360, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 1546, "comments": [{"body": "More is coming.

That looks like a data event, so we can see you're having a Skype conversation, for example, but we can't see the contents. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt would also be the same if you had a WhatsApp call. I could tell that you have been using WhatsApp, but I cannot see the contents of the conversation because the contents aren't sent to the telco network, only a stream of data telling me what service you are using to consume your data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDifferent regions have different legal rule, but my region insists we keep the traffic for 2 years and have to share it with the police under certain rules (basically a warrant, it's all extremely official and recorded by providers and the regulator, plus the police, you assume). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeeing what program you're using or what website you're using allows the provider to build rules in mediation and the PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function). As an example, you might be out of data, but I want to give you the option to purchase more from my website (which would typically require data), so I allow you to visit my telco company website, but you won't be charged for it. Likewise make sure if you did have a data bundle, we'd not decrement from it if you visited the website. If I'm a business customer to a telco, I might want my engineers to only access certain sites, and again we can build that logic into systems (both these things are real world examples). We also have options further downstream, with rating (think network > mediation > rating > bill), so I can allow you to call 911/999/112 free of charge, or I can have a premium rate number but see you're phone number and because you are a customer not a rando, charge you differently or not at all. Options are basically endless. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in short, it depends if the usage is going over the network as to whether we can see the contents of it. If it's a standard voice call, or an SMS, absolutely we see that. If it's using a 3rd party tool, we can see what tool you're using, but not the contents of it.

I was personally involved in a police request for a compromised PBX, that turned out to be part of a network of compromised PBXs, and long story short, the people doing this were selling phone cards in 3rd world countries as quasi-legit business people, only the phone systems weren't theirs and they were basically leaving those owners of the phone systems with huge bills for that usage and they just made 100% profit on the sale of phone cards. The scale was almost admirable, the hackers absolutely know their shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Dial Through Fraud\" is also quite common. Again personally involved in a listed insurance company and a 7 figure fraud, where hacker had gained access to mailboxes, routed those mailboxes to premium rate services they controlled, then used another compromised phone system to spam call the mailboxes which routed to the premium numbers and they presumably collected the rebate from that. I literally stood behind our main Mitel engineer with CEO (who was an engineer, and this was our largest customer) as he tried to fix it, and in live time the hackers were still trying to redirect stuff. Was weirdly intense. There are mechanisms in place to try and manage this, but a lot of vested interest and yaawwwn no victims/white collar crime apathy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is also crazy how many people, including PBX engineers, use passwords like 2580 or 1111 or etc. Human vulnerability is definitely a thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did some proof of concept with with an AI provider and large telco to introduce logic into their systems. We accepted that PBXs will often be compromised so looked instead to have controls on the usage. If usage suddenly spiked to a premium rate destination in Nigeria, and the customer never called Nigeria, then we would block that at a network level in near real time. We had a architectural client who often took calls from exotic locations at funny hours though, so we built in much higher tolerances. To be fair, that was almost 10 years ago, and I've never really seen a product from it. But I have seen providers incentivise the upgrading to SIP/hosting and offering toll fraud insurance, presumably they have such a system in the background. To me, detection of fraud at a network level is the best long term approach to stop fraud, as well as things like regulators stepping up as oftentimes there are no reasons for 20$ a minute call charges and niche solutions have been replaced by mobile / standard non-geographic / SIP solutions so they should be phased out.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Everything you send over the internet can be seen by your ISP, OEM (i.e Apple/Google/Microsoft) and any companies clever enough to track you through your browser, IP address, email, or other apps. \n\nEven actions you take but do not send can be recorded.

Then we also get to wonder if (read: when) that stolen information is going to be stolen *again* in a data breach. \n\nWho told people just because you start a business it implicitly means that business is going to survive. I love that this country has a ton of small and medium businesses and I’m in the group that believes we should have more. But the rule has been that it must be a viable businesses. Additionally, every business just doesn’t have the right to do whatever and infringe on peoples rights because the alternative is their bottom line takes a dip or worse they go out of business. If you cant survive, then you don’t. Opening a business is not a guarantee to never see that business fail. Its a risk. Id say if you cannot manage a 10-30% increase in your advertising budget alone then you need to take a look at your business plan and that businesses viability. \n\nIm willing to bet the fucking farm these same people who cant see the good of the individual over the almighty dollar are the same folks that are opting out of being tracked. They don’t want to be tracked EW! Their data is more important than other peoples data. Their data means more than other peoples data. Its just not the same! They have to opt out they cant have their information out there all willy nilly! Or they cant possibly have their data out there because of blah, blah, blah. And they do not see the ocean sized pool of irony when they hit that opt out button after they cry about everything previously mentioned. But they 100% want everyone else to be tracked. This way they can save a few thousand bucks on their business expenses. That way they can precisely target where to display their ads.

Apple tracks some information on how users are using Maps, but they don't log complete trips. Instead they break it up into anonymized chunks. So one chunk of data might show you leaving your house, another might show you making some turns, and another shows you arriving at a location. But it doesn't see the complete route you as an individual took. That's tough when you're trying to improve products. \n\nThe evidence is pretty clear already.

People are willing to pay to not have their fucking data harvested and their every move watched. Apple has proven it. Facebook wants to keep it the way it is because they know if they lose the ability to harvest data they lose money and their product and service isn’t good enough to pay for. Apple doesn’t need to harvest data, people will pay them not to and it’s clear it’s more valuable to let a user purchase their privacy than invade it.

They have not disallowed tracking on their own App Store and within the iOS platform. \nFacebook played this so badly too. \n\nI’ve spent actually HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars on FB ad spend (I’m a small fish too). Since April of last year, ad inventory has gotten like 5x more expensive. Ads on Facebook get inflated by a lot of factors but the one affecting CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) was VC funded companies that sell things nobody wants. The next was the election. Even with all the sophisticated tracking - people would comment “is Facebook reading my mind?” on our ads every day - ads have already been getting way too expensive. Our performance on ads is unusually good. Still, Facebook has steadily raised the price of ad space. They want you to give them every profit dollar knowing you’ll continue to pay for break-even “customer acquisition.” They even say that in their literature  to ad buyers. I’ll search for that link. \n\nThis is actually the perfect smokescreen for Facebook to say, “see it’s apple hurting your business.” Facebook serves a warning on the ad console saying something to that effect. Except Facebook sets the CPMs!! This is not some perfect market where there is no centralized influence. Facebook warns me “your ads will be less effective because of... reasons.” You know what would make ads more effective? LOWER THE COST OF YOUR INCREASINGLY INEFFECTIVE AD SPACE! The iOS14 stuff could not have come at a better time for them. \n\nI don’t know why Apple is doing this. Maybe to sell more iPhones? Honestly that seems like the naïve explanation.

If anything the day has been won by VC funded zombies -that only look like businesses but whose charge is to sell their equity not their product. Because they don’t care if produce a profit on ads. They don’t care is they ever generate a financial profit. So they spend on ads regardless of return just to drive their topline.

Over the last 5 years, online commerce sales increased by almost 500% from 92 billion RMB in 2016 to 436 billion in 2020. To give you an idea, 1 US dollar was roughly 7.08 RMB then so Alibaba's online commerce revenue in 2020 was roughly $61.5 Billion. Revenue is extremely important for business growth so seeing a 35 PERCENT increase is amazing! In fact, this is almost unheard of for businesses of this size which just shows you how unique Alibaba is. Then, the adjusted earnings from online commerce also grew by roughly 22% to 165 billion RMB or $23.4 billion. So, how are they doing THAT well? Simple! They did get the boost in online sales because of the pandemic, but they also have 780 MILLION active consumers on their online marketplaces in China and another 190 millions internationally as of the end of 2020. They also have 846 Million Mobile Monthly Active users. Essentially, they've got more customers that the population of the US and EU COMBINED!\n\nSo, Alibaba's online marketplaces include several websites, but not just any websites. In fact, the company owns 2 of the 10 most visited websites IN. THE. WORLD. Tmall and Taobao. Alipay ranks in 26th place and Aliexpress ranks in 42nd place. The company presence is just mindboggling. And, to top it all off, the business model is much lighter than Amazon's, for example. Why? Well, Alibaba does not sell its own products, it doesn't have any inventory, doesn't have any warehouses, which results in less expenses and a higher net profit. How much higher? Well, Amazon's latest net profit margin is 5.53%. Alibaba's? 24.71%!\n\nSo, the online commerce is the main driver behind Alibaba's amazing performance as currently none of the other business segments are producing any meaningful earnings. In fact, the digital media and entertainment and the innovation incentives and others segments are actually losing money, although the CEO has explained that their purpose is not to be profitable, but rather to augment the Alibaba brand and support the online commerce platform. Now, the cloud computing is different. In the 4th quarter of 2020, it finally broke even! It is an important part of Alibaba's long-term strategy and they are placing a lot of emphasis on growing it. In 2020, cloud revenues grew by almost 62%! Alibaba Cloud is currently the biggest cloud provider in China and they intend to stay that way.\n\nOverall, the company is growing fast, roughly 38% increase in sales YoY with net income rising roughly 70% in the last year! We can see that the core business and the future business of Alibaba are doing well. How are its financials though? Well, it has a lot of cash, roughly 330 Billion RMB and its current assets are enough to cover all of its liabilities so they are looking very healthy. In fact, they've got enough free cash to start repurchasing shares. In the final quarter of 2020, they repurchased roughly $110 million US dollars which is not that much honestly, but they've approved a share repurchase plan of between $6 and $10 Billion. If we see them acting on that plan, investors could get very excited! So, the business is growing fast, the financials look solid, they're starting to return money to the shareholders. What about their price?\n\nWell, the company is relatively cheap right now. Their PE ratio is 25.5 with a forward PE of 20.6. Historically, they have a PE average of 34.5 so we can see that they are on a big discount right now. Their PB ratio is 5 which is normal for them so there's that. Compared to their direct Chinese competitors, Alibaba's PE isn't actually that low, but I'd say that the reason behind it is that most of its rivals are only involved in online commerce whereas Alibaba is also the leader in the rapidly growing cloud computing business. Also, if we compare Alibaba to Amazon which is pretty much the closest comparison we can get in terms of business segments, we can see that Amazon's PE has not dropped below 60 in the last 5 years and their average is 137.2, way higher than Alibaba! Amazon's PB ratio is also roughly 18 or almost 2 and a half times higher than Alibaba's! Their revenues and earnings are growing at roughly the same pace although Amazon had a phenomenal year in 2020.\n\nBut, they've also beaten the last 10 analysts earnings estimates and the last 8 revenue estimates so they tend to outperform although I think that their next quarterly earnings will be a miss due to the fine that was imposed on them. Basically, we can see that investors have not priced in the growth in the share price which essentially means that Alibaba is a great deal, at least in my opinion. It's no wonder that virtually all of the analyst recommendations for this stock are either BUY or STRONG BUY (Yahoo finance screenshot). Also, most of their competitors are focused only on online commerce which means that Alibaba has a better overall offering and competitive advantage than them. It's got better sales, better net profit margin, better brand presence, better long-term strategy AND more users than Pinduoduo, Vipshop, JD. Clearly, it's the better deal, at least in my opinion, but in all fairness even its competitors are doing really well. Some people who agree with me are Ray Dalio whose 3rd biggest stock holding is Alibaba and Charlie Munger who just bought into it with 20% of his Daily Journal portfolio.\n\nNow, this stock just looks to good to be true, right? Sort of. Alibaba does have some issues, but they're of slightly different nature. The main risks involved with the company are more... political. First of all, you have the SEC threatening to delist any companies that are doing business with the Chinese military, that don't provide proper financial statements and reporting, that have a Chinese Communist Party member on their board OR are controlled by an entity of a foreign government. Now, technically speaking, just because a company is delisted doesn't mean that you cannot trade it, but chances are that its stock price will be hurt... A LOT. You'd still be able to trade it over-the-counter, but that brings a lot of problems of its own and also chances are that most normal online brokers won't support it. I know that my broker, eToro, does not. Still, you can easily avoid that by simply buying Alibaba's stock that is trading on the Hong Kong exchange. The ticker is 9988, but it's essentially the same stock. Personally, I don't think that's going to happen, but don't take my word for it. Buying the Hong Kong stock will ensure you are protected from the delisting.\n\nThat isn't all though. Currently, there is also an ongoing regulation crackdown in China aimed at Chinese big tech companies. Alibaba was famously targeted because Jack Ma, its founder, made criticised the Chinese government's approach to financial regulations. As a result, the IPO for Ant Group, which is essentially Alibaba's spin-off that deals with consumer financing and lending, was squashed late last year and restructuring was ordered. More recently, more regulations and restructuring was ordered. While this has affected Alibaba's business model to an extent, the regulations have also affected Alibaba's direct competitors so the company still retains its competitive advantage. The regulators also handed Alibaba a fine of $2.8 BILLION US dollars, the biggest one ever handed... so far. They also ordered the company to stop its anti-competitive practices which involved Alibaba making merchants choose between using only Alibaba or rival platforms. So, are the regulators finished with Alibaba? Well, we can only speculate. The biggest worry that investors have is that the regulators will break up Alibaba into different smaller businesses, which is a possibility although a lot of analysts say that China will not risk destroying one of its biggest and most famous companies. They do seem to have moved on to the other tech companies, but as I said this is not something that you can know for certain.\n\nSo, what's the verdict? Is Alibaba a good investment right now? Personally, I think so. It is undoubtedly risky, but the company offers such amazing prospects that it's just crazy to miss out on. I mean, if you could buy Amazon at such a cheap price, wouldn't you? I'd recommend doing your own research into it, but I believe that it offers a great opportunity right now and that's why it is my second largest holding and almost 10% of my total portfolio. \n\nFinally, Alibaba will be reporting its 2021 quarter 1 earnings next Thursday so check this out to see what could happen. There will probably be a lot of price action before that and likely after it, hopefully in a nice positive green upward trajectory.\n\nThat's my analysis on Alibaba. There's a lot more to talk about, but I wanted to keep it on the short side. What do you think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR; Alibaba is solid and cheap.

{"title": "Why the media hates Tesla - an insiders view", "selftext": "I've worked in the media industry for over 15 years now. I wanted to give an insight of why CNBC & the media in general are so determined to bring Tesla to its knees.   \n\n\nWhether it's stories on crashes that are blown way out of proportion, or bringing on haters every 3rd day such as Gordon Johnson - the media industry is fighting Tesla because if Tesla explodes, it could destroy legacy media brands.   \n\n\nHow would a car company destroy media companies like ComcastUniversal, ViacomCBS, WarnerMedia etc?  \n\n\nMany times in local news markets, the largest advertisers are car dealerships. The will usually take a Ford or Jeep Advertisement from the manufacturer, and slap a \"available at Johnny's CarMart on - just off exit 37\" on the end of the ad.   \n\n\nIt is big money - sometimes huge money, for local TV stations.  \n\n\nDo you know whats even bigger money? National Accounts in Advertising.   \n\n\nCar & Automobile advertising are some of the largest accounts a media brand can have. GM Spends about 3 Billion USD a year. Berkshire / Geico spends about 2.3 billion. Ford - 2.3 billion & Fiat Chrysler - 2 billion. Billions more a spent on advertising by all the auto insurance companies (Tesla Insurance is a risk to those billions as well) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla famously spends zero dollars. Nothing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the extreme bull case is correct, then major programs on all the Network TV show's such as Today Show on NBC, GMA on ABC, CBS This Morning etc will lose significant amounts of money, and sometimes entire shows. If Ford, GM, Fiat Chrysler all die slowly, so will their advertising dollars. Not to mention the cascading effect - ICE vehicle advertisements on the late night shows, on live sports etc. **Tesla's success without spending a dime on advertising is scaring the living shit out of TV executives.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake for example NBC. NBC was gearing up to launch a big new [international channel to take on CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sky_World_News). It was hiring staff all over, and setting up bureaus all over the world to have a really decent crack at the 24/7 Global news game that CNN enjoy a monopoly on.\n\n  \nTheir plan was to use the advertising dollars for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to fund this operation. Olympics got cancelled - and so did NBC's big new news channel. They had already hired and trained people as well - some of them were let go before the job even started. That's just one event axed and they had to cancel an entire News subsidiary because of it cancellation. What happens when entire industries that have been funding you for 50 years are obsolete, and the competitor spends zero on advertising? Catastrophic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think will happen if some of their largest funders, ICE vehicle manufactures, go belly up? Thousands of staff will lose their job within these media networks.    \n\n\nThe curious case of Gordon Johnson makes even more sense now. For those that don't know, Gordon was / is a regular \"super bear\" on CNBC - always talking down Tesla and having a ridiculous valuation on the company. He has been talking down Tesla for almost a decade now - but he let his mask slip this week. He tweeted about his Dad being a senior executive at GM, and his family has been working at GM for decades - I believe the quote \"GM has always been good to my family\". The same GM that pays millions of dollars to Comcast/NBCUniversal in advertising slots on NFL Football, Late night shows, CNBC, Today Show - the list goes on. \n\nIt was in both Gordon's families interest, the interest of NBCUniversal & GM to have him out on TV sets & news articles talking about how shit Tesla is. **EVERYTHING IS ON THE LINE FOR ALL OF THEM.** \n\nTesla for me represents a slow, but catastrophic end to many industries, and those will cascade into the media world where they spend billions on advertising. They are being replaced with a company that spends zero. \n\n**They are all terrified - because Tesla marks a new era for not only the auto industry, but dozens of industries. And if those legacy industries and companies fail, the advertising dollars dry up as well.**", "id": "n7lth2", "created_utc": 1620467353.0, "score": 968, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 168, "comments": [{"body": "Television is also a business that is on the verge of becoming obsolete.

Also bulls retweet articles that are total bs, they also make money for the outlets), getting information from wrong sources (they have OEMs on speed dial and OEMs have good relationships with many analysts, specialists and so on and the media just lives in that same bubble, because that's what they always believed was the whole world).\n\nWill there be malicious individuals in the media? Definitely, and probably also quite some. However, I think quite some just follow the incentive structure and lives in a certain bubble they can't look beyond.

I believe OEMs do create those bubbles intentionally, but I don't think the media necessarily takes the bait intentionally. \n\nI just don't believe in a bigger sophisticated conspiracy than that, without any evidence such thing exists.

Well, let’s put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) – a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover’s business model is so fool proof!***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***\n2. **Competition:** Now let’s talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***\n3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover’s secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***\n4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let’s focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/)in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this…as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn’t….60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover’s [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***\n5. **Customers:** Let’s now put some light on the target demographic…seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.\n6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance…except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money…now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.\n7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock – he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as board member and dem access. Recently they added the former director of Medicare - literally the only possible guy in the world that can get them what they need to continue growth for years to come.**\n8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \\~$3B, which is \\~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover’s valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated…upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond….it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space – TDOC – and a Cathie Wood & ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***\n\nI am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare. It deserves a lot more credit and people rooting for it to succeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6swl0khqxx61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd81da7db75a98f1aad0ab150d7667d7f7c85240\n\nCLOV YOLO\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit 1:** as someone correctly pointed out below, heavy investors such as Vanguard, Blackrock and Bailee Gifford (Tesla mega bulls) all bought in at a mid $8 price point.\n\n**Edit 2:** as requested below, there is also a bear case which simply means CLOV might take time to realize its full potential...which is different than saying it will go into the ground.**B1. Competition:** new competitors trying to enter the fast growing (but boring) MA market with an advanced tech platform ala Clover Assistant could impact growth rate (not growth). I think its highly unlikely but possible specially when Biden announces lowering the Medicare eligibility age. Smaller companies might want to get in on the gold rush. And legacy companies may want to invest heavily into revamping their business model (UNLIKELY - why? read [The Innovators Dilemma](https://www.amazon.com/The-Innovators-Dilemma-audiobook/dp/B06Y4RRGVV/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw7diEBhB-EiwAskVi11l5HeOM_5nz4Z9EMKJHbGR9bSEs5YenWuxP8ykS-TP5AKJo1UhP1hoCiTkQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241921991729&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1018704&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=3239668408352121876&hvtargid=kwd-59432786&hydadcr=24632_10399692&keywords=the+innovators+dilemma&qid=1620501116&sr=8-1))**B2: Management:** management churn might impact the vision on which this company was founded.

I have been reading research reports, financial statements, different statistics, ownership and insider activities about PLTR stock because this is a stock that I bought high, bag held some time and then finally sold even higher in January with some 10K profit. This is also a stock that I plan to invest for a long time (when I start investing and stop gambling in future). The sad story is that I lost almost the same amount with PLTR calls. My overall feeling from the materials I read in last few days was negative. I have never seen a CEO like Alex Karp!

His current holding is less than 6.5 million shares. If you look at other insiders such as Ryan Taylor, Shyam Sankar, Matthew Long, David Glazer, Stephen Cohen, Peter Thiel, they also sold some although not as frequently as the CEO (yes, I know they have less shares comparatively)\n\nNow let's look at some **counter arguments**\\-\n\n**Automatic sell:**\n\nLooking at the number of shares in each transaction, you might argue that they are automatic sell. I know they are but if you believe in your company then why would you sell this kind of large number of shares that frequently? Like 3-5 transactions worth millions of shares every month, so early after the company went public?\n\n**DPO vs IPO:**\n\nYou might say that the company went public via DPO and insiders need to sell the shares otherwise public wouldn't be able to buy them. I am here talking about the shares he kept selling after it went public. On the day they went public, they have already sold much larger shares. For example Peter Thiel sold 23 million shares, Alex Karp sold 13.7 million shares etc. Also, there is no shortage of float in market. On the first day of trading the volume was 338.5 million shares whereas 90-days average volume is only 74 millions. So, no he does not need to sell that frequently to keep the liquidity with demand(!). The price action rather says the opposite is true.\n\n**Stock-based Compensations**:\n\nYou might also say their salary structure is heavy on stock based compensations. The company has been around over 13 years and he waited enough so he deserves some lambos. Yeah bla bla bla whatever as if he did not withdraw any salary each year. Now tell me why wait 13-14 years to go public?\n\n**He needs money like everyone else:**\n\nAnother argument could be he needs to buy a Yacht or a mansion or a jet or whatever. Make the company profitable and cash positive first and then those $20 dollars stock will go to $50 or even $100 and then freaking buy 2 mansion and 3 yacht or whatever. If you keep dumping millions of shares each month when the stock kept tanking, many investors including retail and institutional, are holding large bags. Cathie alone will not be able to save it, she has already bought all the shares you sold since November 2020, and some more.\n\n**TlDr:** Not giving any kind of financial advice. I am not going to touch PLTR unless insiders, specially the CEO stops dumping shares frequently. If he does not like the stock of his company then who the hell am I.", "id": "n7ziwe", "created_utc": 1620511124.0, "score": 344, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 243, "comments": [{"body": "Wow a post on PLTR that’s bearish on WSB?

I would not even look at these MA indicators to buy a stock so that question was invalid.\n\n>Use it as a place to enter and exit a trade is all I'm saying\n\nI entered SPY calls this week when SPY was below both 50 and 200-day MA on both daily and weekly chart. I sold them and make profit when SPY was above 50 and 200-day MA. Which is exactly the opposite of you are referring me to do. \n\nLet me tell you one thing, stock price do not follow any predefined pattern. Once the market closes and the chart is established whether it's a daily or weekly or monthly you can then draw as many pattern as you wish by changing the variable like timeframe and frequency. If a stock price closes above it's 50 and 200 days MA line on both weekly and daily chart. Nobody, I mean nobody in this world can guaranty that that stock price will close higher on the next trading day. Period. A trend is only a trend while it last but the truth is no one knows how long it last. SPY was going up on Wednesday and then it started going down on the same day. What is the trend here up trend? downtrend or dance trend? \n\nTA does not work, ever. Worked, never with any amount of certainty. Give me one indicator that is only 51% correct but that 51% is consistent. If you can give me that indicator then I will bet $1000 in each trade. That tiny difference will make me billions within few years even if I start from just few thousands.", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Dumb comment is dumb", "score": -6, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "He has to sell enough shares to raise money to exercise his options.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Also worth remembering that it's *extremely* common for high net worth / low liquidity folks to borrow against their assets / shares rather than liquidating.
