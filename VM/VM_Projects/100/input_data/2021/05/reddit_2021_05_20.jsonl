Be careful with liquidity with far OTM options, I wouldn't even bother with the short leg, you'll be collecting pennies and there is a high chance it'll go ITM if the long leg does.

There’s a time and place to make these trades but if you’re trying to offset potential 20%+ losses elsewhere, why limit the potential gain of the hedge with a spread?\n\nGoing off that point, I prefer to buy deep OTM calls on the UVXY with 180 DTE and a delta around 10 (no harm in going a bit higher or lower). I allocate 0.5% of my net liq to this position and roll on a quarterly basis until either a market crash of at least -20% occurs *or* the /VX increases at least 150% (specifically /VX futures, not the VIX). At this point, the calls are either ITM or close and have likely increased several thousands of percent from my cost basis. Actual desired target on the /VX increase is discretionary and perhaps arbitrary but I found that this is an acceptable target based on effectiveness of the hedge during each market crash.\n\nI’ve conducted an acceptable level of backtesting on this hedge using historical options prices. Assuming full exposure to the SPY, losses during any crash of 20% or worse were completely offset and in most cases, the portfolio value actually *increased* at least 10% during a crash. Furthermore, I attempt to time market crashes using certain indicators and double the hedge position size to 1% of the portfolio at certain times. Success rate of predicting a crash is ~60% and when correct, the value of the same portfolio (99% SPY) increased 20-60%, which of course, includes unrealized losses on the SPY.\n\nAs for the issue of cost of this hedge, I believe it’s accurate to say it is well covered by the gains over the long term through multiple crashes. Ironically, the worse case scenario is the complete lack of market crashes but that would be fantastic for one, and two, paying 1-3% of net liq on an annual basis is not such a heavy burden considering the proven effectiveness of this hedge. The key is to take a systematic approach (quarterly adjustments) and knowing when to cash out. In reality, it should be obvious to know when to cash out considering the massive increase in the value of the hedge. In other words, this hedge is purely a protective measure against a market crash and is not meant to protect against choppy movement akin to what we’ve witnessed since last June.\n\nTo address your trade diversity question, I would strongly advise that you broaden your trade strategy book. From what I know, ICs perform well enough over the long term but I don’t believe the returns are terribly impressive and frankly, there are better ways to make more money. Adapt to the market based on price direction, implied and actual volatility, and option premiums using different trading strategies and it should be fairly easy to outperform the perpetual IC strategy (less of an adaptable strategy and more of a fixed algorithm, wouldn’t you say?). \n\nHope this helps.\n\nEDIT: Thought I would add that an advantage that UVXY calls have over unit puts on say, the SPY or QQQ is that the put premiums are *typically* higher on those indices than the call premiums on the UVXY are on an expected price movement and payout basis. This isn’t always the case but the basic logic to consider is unit puts become a crowded trade more quickly than deep OTM UVXY calls (case in point, how many people have mentioned index unit puts vs UVXY calls?)", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "I just put your method into TOS and love it.

I buy back the body (shorts) and turning it to two debit spreads (re-writing) with the existing wings and carry on scalping to the expiration (my kind of hedging).\n\n\\*Edit it is more complicating but this is my explanation for a approach of hedging: During an \"imminent\" reversal, If shorts have a profit I might buy them back for and create the spreads. Or I let the butterfly run as is and wait. Main reason I might wait is if the stock price gets closer to the sweet spot of a butterfly and there is just enough time (at or near to expiration) to hit its profit.\n\nButterflies requre the usual adjustments from broken wing butterfly to free risk butterfly, delta neutrality and when the shorts are 'close' to be tested. All these until the shorts have decayed enough for a nice P&L.\n\nMy shorts are usually at a minimum of 1 standard deviation away with approximately 0.16 delta, and I utilize approximately $1000-$1500 for each trade from start to finish.

Also unbalanced butterflies are interesting. 1x3x2 instead of 1x2x1 and of course many other variations you may consider.\n\nHaving fun and staying small is important.\n\nEdit: Advantage is the low maintenance Margin (small drop of the buying power). The max gains is the price to land on the shorts at expiration. That's random. However, the bigger the body (shorts) the more premium you receive. You know the saying the more the gain the higher the risk? It is the same here as well.
