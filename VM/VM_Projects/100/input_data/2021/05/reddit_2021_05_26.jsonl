Ford recognizes that until fully autonomous vehicles become a practical reality for the average consumer, most people will not want their driving experience to change all that much. Most people don‚Äôt want to feel like they‚Äôre in a minimalist spaceship despite what the Tesla circlejerk would have you believe (although I‚Äôm also long TSLA for other reasons which I‚Äôll explain below). Ford‚Äôs electrified vehicles feel more like a typical car. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a radical change in your daily driving experience. Most people don‚Äôt like radical and rapid change. They like what they are familiar with. Ford gets that. The F-150 Lightening shows that they get it.\n\nFord is going all in on electric. So is VW and GM. Through their collective weight, institutional knowledge bases, and economies of scale they‚Äôre going to eventually crush Tesla and all the relatively new automotive manufacturers who all want to fundamentally and radically change people‚Äôs driving experiences. In 2020 Tesla delivered roughly 500,000 vehicles globally. Compare that to Ford delivering nearly 4.2 million (and in non pandemic years Ford is pushing 6 million deliveries annually). Volkswagen Group delivered 9.2 million vehicles across all brands in 2020. I just don‚Äôt think Tesla can stay competitive as a mass market auto manufacturer in the long run despite their impressive growth in production in recent years.\n\nWhere Tesla can excel (and this is why I‚Äôm long TSLA) is by pivoting to becoming an OEM supplier of batteries to major automakers like Ford and VW Group who have gone all in on electric and have the production capacity to drown out Tesla as an automaker. Tesla knows high capacity batteries better than just about anyone. But more importantly, Tesla understands how to produce large quantities of batteries and is constantly pursuing ways to expand their already impressive battery production capabilities. They have the potential to become the go to energy storage solutions provider to everything ranging from the automotive industry to construction/heavy industry and utilities/power producers. Tesla was only able to make the demand for high capacity batteries that currently exists by stimulating the growth of the EV market with their own cars. But they‚Äôve done that, and in the process opened people‚Äôs eyes across a multitude of industries to the potential behind investing in energy storage research and development. I think they‚Äôll eventually back out of the business of building cars and selling them to consumers (at least if they‚Äôre smart). \n\nFord is a great automaker play. Tesla is a great battery and energy storage play. It‚Äôs frustrating for me to see people constantly compare the two to each other as so many have done in this thread.\n\nBest of luck with your investing journey, OP!", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I bought Ford when Biden was insulting them, and it's up 25.36% now.

If you believe in 'Ford the companies' outlook then they need to time to realize that in order to turn your investment into real profit. Companies need time to make products and sell them before they make it to their quarterly results which then makes it into their stock valuation.\n\nYou get higher taxes if you sell less than a year after buying. So there is added incentive to invest long term. I'll add that paying taxes means you're making money so it's not a terrible thing to do.\n\n[https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/investments-and-taxes/guide-to-short-term-vs-long-term-capital-gains-taxes-brokerage-accounts-etc/L7KCu9etn](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/investments-and-taxes/guide-to-short-term-vs-long-term-capital-gains-taxes-brokerage-accounts-etc/L7KCu9etn) \n\nFinally, since I don't know your intentions, maybe you do just want to play short term. If so you might want to skip stocks and go straight into LEAPS. Where you can get better returns with more risk, but not as risky as other options plays. The value of leaps follows more closely with the stock price and gives you plenty of time to sell it at a high point.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pros-and-cons-trading-leaps-2018-01-05](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pros-and-cons-trading-leaps-2018-01-05)\n\nTip: Buy these on red days\n\nTip: Leaps also allows you to lock in a price while you transfer money to exercise the option.

I know that I'm just some guy on reddit lol.. but this is actually something I care about, so let me see if I can provide some details that I see\n\nWhen I was consistently selling covered calls on MSFT, first I was selling weeklies around the .15 delta. The premiums were pretty weak, and sure enough, it blew through what started as a .15 delta, and I learned the lesson of not holding until expiration. No short call with a low premium was worth holding I found.. especially not to expiration. So I modified my strategy and started selling 35DTE calls at about .1-.15 delta, and setting a limit to close it around a 50%-60% gain. Sure enough.. it blew through those too. I always closed them around the 50-60% gain or when there was only 14 days left to expiration. In all instances, when they were blown through.. it undid all of my profits from covered calls.\n\nIf the premiums are small --> not worth holding.\n\nIf the premiums are nice --> way too high probability of failure.\n\nAnd they're priced as such. I sold some covered calls on TSLA for a while, but looking back.. I'd never do it again. It also kinda frustrated me when I put all that effort into a CC strategy, only for it to not be profitable.. but that's just me haha\n\nshort term calls have hella gamma and vega. They're basically ticking time bombs\n\nYou mentioned 15%-25% OTM on a time frame of 1-2 weeks? I absolutely, unequivocally, without a doubt.. believe that TSLA will skyrocket 25% in a few days. In fact, I suspect it could soon.\n\nI think that some covered call strategies can work, but I would \\*never\\* collateralize all of my position to hold covered calls against them, and I wouldn't \\*always\\* have CCs.

TL;DR: never say never.\n\nSecondly, IMO you should _only_ sell short term calls on TSLA.  You _want_ it to be close to expiration. If you look at the premium you get for a call per unit time until expiration, you get more premium in the last week or two the overwhelming majority of the time.  This way you are price agnostic up until the strike.  Assuming you're selling some distance out of the money, you make money if the stock goes up (within limits), stays the same, _or_ goes down.  Even when the price goes up, you have time decay on your side, and time decay changes a lot of short call losers into winners.

Request no bids, review no offers.\n\nIf SpaceX can do it for $3B, they lose nothing. If they can't, or can't do it within the timeframe necessary, there's a plan B.\n\nCompetition is healthy. The original Apollo program cost $28 billion, which would be almost a third of TRILLION dollars today. Getting two, or even ONE for $10 billion would be a monumental feat.\n\nThis isn't something to be upset about.

{"title": "UWMC Margin Warfare 2: Cover or pay me", "selftext": "I must start this with do not touch your AMC for anything let alone a stock that hasnt even cemented itself in this new world - but the memeconemy is having a revival and with Wall St's apparent dislike of this company through shorts I think UWMC may have a nice place in this new order.\n\nEDIT: short TLDR by u/turnerdhr23 \n\n\" The shorts doubled up in May, from 11 million shares in April to 18.5 million shares in May. Up over 50% from April short numbers. They are trying everything they can, but you can‚Äôt fight buybacks, dividend on 6/9, inclusion in MSCI and Russell, and technicals switching to bullish. They are paying insane 70%+ interest on borrowed shares too. It‚Äôs a perfect storm. Got my popcorn ready. \"\n\nPrice action has been very nice the last few days with shorts climbing as price does steadily aswell. Approximately 20%+ of the float is being shorted according to TD. Also with this run up you bet your ass they are all in the red. Like I said in my last post, the company is currently buying back shares as of last week - so the float is likely smaller reported making the short % even higher.\n\nWith ex dividend coming up on 6/9 (match made in heaven) these shorts are sweating bricks because they know they need to cover or they will have to pay out that dividend for each share shorted on a losing position. As you are seeing towards the end of today they were trying to dump the price - likely done with even more shorts probably with the idea once they dump it enough they can cover this shit position and run. Chart below shows how its almost impossible for any short to be in the green.\n\n[Also Schwab is telling me this is hard to borrow \\(high short float\\)](https://preview.redd.it/rbvjtk2zmi171.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=310642d4e17a29527ee49cc3ec4ec3780840d0c0)\n\nDO NOT SELL HERE - the pump hasn't even started to begin Wall ST shits on the company because it was a SPAC so they shorted the fuck out of it and have been having a cash fiesta since the merger crashing the price down to laughable numbers.\n\nTHE ADVANTAGE WE HAVE IS OUR AWARENESS OF OUR RETARDATION THESE AUTISTIC HEDGE FUNDS THINK THEY ARE SMART AND CAN CONTROL PA TO ALWAYS WIN. THEY SOMEHOW THINK THAT WE ARE TO PREOCCUPIED WITH AMC AND GME BUT THEY DONT REALISE NO FUND IS SAFE.\n\nExecute contracts if possible - I dont think there are enough shares out there to cover all these positions\n\nTLDR: UWMC over shorted and they will have no choice to cover or pay out the dividend by 6/9 unless they can crash the price by shorting more.... Sounds familiar\n\nPositions: shit load of shares, 8/20 $6 calls that will be executed before ex dividend. 8/20 $7 calls, the cheap play that i just loaded on are the 6/18 $9 calls.

Blackberry is a growth late stage start up that utilizes the logistics and patents of an old phone company\n\nBlack berry‚Äôs forward revenue will be dominated by two things. Cylance, their cyber security software, and IVY and QNX, their vehicle data hub. Let‚Äôs start with IVY and QNX\n\nQNX is a software for vehicles to compartmentalize all their software and data. It‚Äôs essentially an operating system for smart cars. It is currently in 175 million vehicles, with more being added every day. Any company without proprietary software (almost all of them besides Tesla) rely on QNX to run their cars‚Äô software \n\nIVY is a software that reads and organizes vehicle sensor data being picked up by QNX. This is a software in the process of being rolled out, that will create the early stages of a third party self driving solution for any car company without a proprietary self driving software (almost all of them besides Tesla.) With neural networks, which are what are used to make cars self drive, data is king, and you need a lot of it. It will not be an easy thing for car companies to build themselves. And when it comes time to compete with Tesla‚Äôs self driving cars, they‚Äôll all be clamoring for IVY\n\nCylance - Blackberry Cylance is an AI driven anti virus software. It‚Äôs confusing, but the gist is that there are many variations of the same virus, most being one time use and have never been seen before, and AI anti virus is needed to detect and stop all the variations. Cylance has been able to stop the attack used by dark side, the hack that brought down the colonial pipeline, since 2015\n\nDeep Fucking Value - black berry is currently trading with a market cap of 4.8 billion dollars. It‚Äôs cash on hand is $739 million. Bringing the market cap to $4 billion. It also has 38,000 patents, some of which are in the process of being sold to Facebook for potentially 1-2 billion dollars. On the low end of these patent sales, this puts the market cap at $3 billion.\n\nThat‚Äôs $3 billion dollars for a key cog in the self driving pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) a key cog in the smart car pipeline (a trillion dollar industry) and a key player in the cyber security industry (a $250 billion dollar industry)\n\nThis stock is a deep fucking value", "id": "nlqklx", "created_utc": 1622060630.0, "score": 1266, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 241, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 218, "replies": [{"body": "Do you agree with the premise of this DD then??
