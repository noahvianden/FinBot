{"title": "UVXY spiking this week", "selftext": "EDIT #2:  looks like UVXY is going to have a 1:10 reverse stock split on 5/26 as they frequently do... so it will be $40 instead of $4. They do this quite often when the price drops significantly. Just smoke and mirrors. But just an FYI\n\nEDIT: well, it did EXACTLY what i said it would. That big spike went right back down and made me a $2000 profit (i ended up adding to my initial put position with some 4.5 strike puts which i sold some on Thurs and the rest today..). I still have my initial $1500 still riding the position but siphoned off the $2k profit.\n\nIf you look at the chart, UVXY went from 3.9 on 5/10, all the way up to 6.22 on 5/12 - where i bought my 5 strike puts at the top (good timing), back down to 4.25 today.\n\nI took out my profit as i said and letting my initial investment ride as i don’t see and volatility rising events on the horizon, and UVXY was steadily dropping before that inflation scare/ spike.\n\nFor all of you that thanked me- no problem.. just trying to share with the community, and some of you followed what i said and made money.\n\nFor the people calling me an idiot and saying how wrong i was.. well... really?\n\nI may be new to Reddit but i’ve been trading options for 20+ years and volatility products for at least 10. I know what i’m doing and simple, BASIC technical analysis would show you every spike in the VIX almost always comes back to where it was.  There aren’t any major volatility events like last march.\n\nAnyway- thanks for those that supported my post and i hope you made $$. For the haters, well.. i need more haters! Mean’s i’m doing well!!\n\nPut this on your alert list. Any jump above 15-20% in a day, play the downside. Almost always pays off. \n\n- - - - \n\nJust a little heads up... UVXY, which tracks volatility and is leveraged so moves quite a bit each direction.. is up 50% this week alone.\n\nI did quite well last year around the election buying plain vanilla calls.. it went up 26% today alone, and as i said- this week is up 50%.\n\nIf you check out the chart, you will see it goes up and down all the time. \n\nA big jump like this generally results in a big drop right after.  Good stock to trade options on once things happen like they have this week during an overall market selloff.\n\nThat being said, i bought $1500 worth of May 28 5 puts at a $5 strike price.. assuming the selloff the last few days will reverse in this crazy market and we will see a pull-back from the 50% jump this week. \n\nJust a little FYI for some of you fellow options traders....\n\nWhat goes up, (usually) goes back down.  I’m betting $1500 it will. I know its a gamble but a good one based on historical personal experience!!", "id": "nb0khj", "created_utc": 1620856589.0, "score": 239, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 202, "comments": [{"body": "Went long at market open on Monday.

(if its cheaper than your so far realized profits, then you are above zero no matter what) if you buy the put lower than the call strike it's a strangle. both profit either the price climbs or tanks significantly, but with the strangle your chances are lower (as if the price finishes in between the call/put you dont gain anything).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes that's about it. I apologise for the confusion, actually I'm not very good with the official names. Straddle or strangle etc etc. You are right, if the strikes are different, it's a strangle.\n\nAnd, you are, giving up a sure profit, to cover 95 percent of the board with the strangle or straddle. Actually the strangle is better, both your longs are otm. So if you buy say a 1500 call, when the underlying is at 1400, and move ITM, when the underlying goes to say 1550, you then buy for example a 1440 put. Put  is 110 pts otm, and the call is 100 otm. With the same expiry, you should be able to buy the put for 1/4 to 1/2, the call price.  Note, you haven't locked in profits, but your profit range has increased tremendously, and so has the\n potential size. There are many other adjustments here like if the market starts tanking, you can add to either side, call or put further otm.\n\nBut if you wanna lock it in, them rolling up is the best.\n\nActually a lock in put, is intiated say you are long the stock, at say 100, and you are now at 120, you can buy a 110 put for about 1.50 or 1 (or more or less, depending on expiry) and lock in 8 or 8.50 pts.\n\nBasically, never use stops to exit an overnight trade (long or short equity or futures), you end up leaving early, and morever getting a horrible price, when the market gaps. A set strike price, put or call, is \"set in stone\", so to speak. Never hesitate to pay for insurance, if you have an edge, you can use options to enhance profits, lock them in, or repair a loss to a lesser amount (breakeven or small profit even)\n\nAsk me again, if you need more info, or further clarification.

They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other.\n\nThe aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim—for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives—is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again. For long periods the High seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the High. \n\nPresently a new Middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. Of the three groups, only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims. It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of the Low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters.'\n\n- Emmanuel Goldstein, *THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF\nOLIGARCHICAL COLLECTIVISM*, Chapter 1", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Did you get the you know what?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "People were panic gas buying just like tp and food when covid hit but the pipelines open so trucks should resume hauling asap.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Seems like it’s not much of a problem anymore, but to be fair there’s no way you could have known that ~3 hours ago.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I am [watching VIX, VIX9D, and VIX3M closely](https://youtu.be/s4uEP1WdjSc) to see when to jump in to short VXX or UVXY.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Op is not wrong but buying shares of this could often times be a much better idea because the spread on the options is really wack, usually quite wide and changing erratically", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bro I’m so excited this is about to be a wild ride 🙈🙈", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Source?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> even the official gamestop Twitter account is flat out saying the MOASS is coming now.\n\nThat's impossible.

Plan to let the rest ride.\n\nIf you bought that many calls on Monday but didn’t take your profits, i would. But again- i bought puts based on historical behavior of jumps UVXY does. There is NO “major market reversal” going on. Some inflation fears based on the report that came out and the pipeline hack.\n\nThis isn’t March 2020 when an unexpected event (covid) caused volatility to spike.\n\nThe economy is on the rebound with the vaccines being effective at reducing the disease, and the brief inflation blip isn’t going yo cause the Fed to stop printing money as of today. Maybe in the future. But not right now.\n\nBut hey, believe who you want. My trade made me 50% overnight which is a great return in my book, and the rest ride as that’s my profit.

I need things to do the opposite of what you do.\n\nMy theory for the post (and trades) i made yesterday was that when UVXY (or any stock or ETF , etc) jumps that high in one (or several) days as extreme as it did (again, 25% or so yesterday, and around 50% Mon-Wed), it tends to go back down in the absence of any major market moving info. There was the hoopla from the rise in prices and that pipeline hack, but generally speaking there is good news these days.. virus getting under control, unemployment lowering, supply/demand of materials (which led the inflation fears yesterday), personally i feel is a recipe for the economy getting back on track.\n\nPrices are high because of DEMAND! The economy is accelerating after being shut down from the virus in the last year which is a good thing! Companies generally blew out earnings. A lot of stocks i follow crushed earnings.\n\nSo personally i feel things will get back to green. I cant predict the future of course, just go by what i read and from what i know... \n\nBut again- this original post was from observing what UVXY has historically done which i have profited on quite a bit. Go look at its chart over the last year (exclude Mar 2020 as obviously that is the covid outlier). Almost EVERY time it makes a big 25-50% spike, it retreats back down within a week or so give or take. \n\nYou don’t have to believe all that i say, just look at the charts! Basic technical analysis.  The reason this one got me excited was that huge 50% jump in 3 days!!!   The last time it did a similar jump earlier in Jan, it went right back to where it was pre-spike. Jan 26-29 it spiked 39%! Then Jan 29-Feb 4 - it dropped around 30% back around $10 on Feb 4- LOWER than when it started a week prior!!\n\nSo a round trip spike of 40% and then back down in a week. \n\nPlay that with options as i said, and you can make quite a bit.  I sold half my position and made 50% gain when UVXY dropped $1 today.  Yesterday i got in pretty much at the top and loaded up on 5/21 Puts at $5 strike price.\n\nI left my other half of options there and plan to let them ride until next week or so until the drop goes back to where it started (or maybe lower!)\n\nSorry for long reply- but basically it may not be tomorrow but if this was such a major market move down like that other genius that called me an idiot said, why did the Dow jump by 500? Why did UVXY drop (at least at one point in the day $1)? Because it’s pulling back to where it started like it always does...\n\nAgain- you and i are on opposite sides of this trade. We both have strike prices at $5, but after today any more red and you lost all your gains from earlier this week.  If it is more red for me, i will wish i had not taken half off the table today... but a 50% gain in 24 hours works for my trading goals.\n\nI wish you good luck with your trade(s).

Will the pent up demand out strip supply?\n\nNo one knows. But the median sales price of an existing home has risen 17.2% from last year and they have increased even more in some regions of the country.\n\nSales are higher by 12.3%  from a yr ago when home sales first started to fall due to the pandemic. \nBUT...\nSingle-family home sales decreased to a an yrly rate of 5.30 million in March 2021, down 4.3% from 5.54 million in February 2021, and up 10.4% from one year ago. \n\nSo it’s going to be a wild ride.. no one has been through reopening an economy after a huge year long shut dwn at the same time a massive technology changes are taking place.  Analysts are making their best educated guesses. \n\nBut I think demand will increase from here for a while. Shifts in employment opportunities will cause ppl to move. \n\nThe shift toward new  manufacturing infrastructure products will make places like Texas, North Carolina, and Arizona’s housing costs increase.

{"title": "I analyzed 9000+ trades made by Members of the U.S. Congress in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** The ability of Congress to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is\n\n**Did Congress members** **beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**\n\n**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com\n\nMassive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Congress trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)\n\nWhile Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.\n\nAll the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nA total of 9,676 trades were made by the members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)\n\n**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. \n\na.            One Month\n\nb.            One Quarter\n\nc.             Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)\n\n**Returns made by the Congress**\n\n|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|One Month|2.55%|2.42%|0.12%|\n|One Quarter|8.76%|7.42%|1.34%|\n|Till Date|32.40%|26.40%|5.99%|\n\nAt this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.\n\n**Returns if you followed their trades (after the disclosure)**\n\n|Avg Return|% Change in Price|% Change in SPY|Change over SPY|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|One Month|2.0%|2.48%|\\-0.48%|\n|One Quarter|10.46%|7.89%|2.57%|\n|Till Date|29.62%|23.73%|5.89%|\n\nIf you had invested in the stocks Congress bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Congress usually plays the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.\n\n**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.\n\n1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession\n2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress.\n3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis analysis proves that Congress indeed gets a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader’s judgment.

{"title": "Inflation explained like you're five", "selftext": "I started that as a comment but it became quite lengthy and I decided that it should be a separate post instead.\n\nLet's say, currently the inflation is 0%, a burger costs $1 and a single stock  share of any company costs $20. You can buy 20 burgers if you sell that share.\n\nTomorrow the inflation becomes 10%. Everything is more expensive by 10%. The burger now costs $1.1, the share costs $22. You can still buy 20 burgers for that share. But if you have sold that share yesterday at $20, today you can buy only 18 burgers. Your money lost buying power due to inflation. That's why some people say that during the inflation it's better to have money in the market, you protect your money from losing value by buying stocks. But it's often not that simple, we'll return to this at the end.\n\nThe government doesn't like 10% inflation, it's too high. They like 5% inflation. To achieve that they need to decrease the demand for buying burgers. When less people compete for the goods, the price of those goods decreases. How can government decrease the demand? They do it by increasing the interest rate in banks. Now instead of spending $1.1 on the burger you can put that money into the bank, and over time your money will grow in value, and in 30 years you'll be able to buy 1000 burgers. Not everyone is capable of delayed gratification, so only part of people will put money into the bank, the others will continue buying burgers. Anyway, the demand decreases and eventually the burger price decreases to $1.05, that's 5% inflation, exactly what the government wants.\n\nNow let's talk about the banks. How do they earn money? They do it by offering loans. Let's say, a fancy tech company wants to build SkyNet. They need to hire developers and they need money to pay those developers. The company does not earn anything yet, so the plan is to get money from the bank, build the product, then start earning and then repay the debts. Bank gives the money to that company and asks to return the same amount and 10% extra later. Where did bank get that money? Well, most likely they are just holding your salary on your bank account. Your money is safe, no one can steal it, and at the same time bank can use that money to give loans and earn interest. Everyone is happy.\n\nYou remember that the government increased the interest rate to fight the inflation, right? Previously your money was just sitting at the deposit and doing nothing. But now you started to earn some interest on it. Let's say, it's 5% per year. This makes banks sad, because instead of just using your money and getting extra 10% from the SkyNet company, they now also need to pay you those 5%. Obviously they won't pay it out of their own pockets. They will instead ask the SkyNet company to return not 10%, but 15% at the end of the loan period.\n\nThe SkyNet company now has to pay more to the banks. It's difficult as they have no earnings yet. Where do they take the money to pay banks? They have to issue more shares and sell it to investors. More shares means more supply. More supply means that the price of the good drops, so the shares of that company become much cheaper.\n\nSo, if you're sure that inflation is inevitable, how can you prepare for this? We discussed that a bit at the beginning. One option is to keep money in your account. Your $20 will lose some value, you'll be able to buy only 18 burgers instead of 20. Another option is to buy a share of the SkyNet company. As we've just discussed, it will likely drop in value and will cost like $12, you'll buy only 11 burgers for it. But who knows, maybe in 5 years it'll pay of. And a yet another options is to buy a share of the burger company. Since burgers became more expansive the company also earns more and its share is more valuable. Most likely it costs $25 now, and you can buy more burgers with it.\n\nYou've already figured it out. The burger company is what we call a value stock. The SkyNet company is the growth stock. And since everyone expects inflation, we currently observe the rotation from the growth stocks into the value stocks.", "id": "nazu9q", "created_utc": 1620854657.0, "score": 1348, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 241, "comments": [{"body": "okay now do an explained like you're a fetus", "score": 919, "replies": [{"body": "There is a certain amount of currency and a certain amount of goods in the economy.

He's had some missteps on Twitter (mainly jokes gone awry), but by and large he is really tuned in to public sentiment and knows how to get people to believe in him and support his companies.\n\nOn the surface, this announcement seems like a PR disaster. Crypto has been exploding lately and this is a great way to harness that energy and convert it to pure fury aimed right at Tesla.\n\nSo why?\n\nThere's no such thing as bad publicity. People are pissed, but the crypto world hangs on Elon's every word, for better or worse. This is another step towards placing himself (and by extension Tesla) at the center of that universe.\n\nNow picture it: a near future announcement that Tesla has developed the most green mining solution the world has ever seen. Maybe it integrates with the home storage/solar stack, or the vehicles themselves eventually.\n\nIt lines up perfectly with the company mission statement, capitalizes on the crypto zeitgeist, AND is pretty much the only way I can see out of this current PR nightmare.\n\nThe *genius* of it is that it takes all the current intense rage and transmutes it into overwhelming positive sentiment, once the crypto world sees that Tesla wasn't aiming to hurt Bitcoin. Instead, as with self-driving chips, AI training computers, battery cells, ERP software, etc., they were simply doing what they always do: make it better *themselves* because existing solutions weren't good enough.\n\nEnergy consumption is the one knock against crypto right now. The climate change narrative is a tool the elites would LOVE to use to shut it down and keep their stranglehold on the financial world. If Tesla can put that to rest by developing killer green mining tech, the cryptosphere will LOVE them for it.\n\nTl;dr - Trust Elon and Tesla. This is a gigachad 9001IQ 69D chess move.

Here are the results.", "selftext": "**Preamble:** The ability of Congress Members to trade stocks have been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional [insider trading scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) where Congress Members used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is \n\n**Did Congress Members beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?** \n\n**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com\n\nMassive shoutout to u/rambat1994 for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Senator trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by Congress who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades) \n\nWhile Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately. \n\nAll the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end. \n\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Distribution of Trades**\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/kh4ythn8roy61.png?width=410&format=png&auto=webp&s=c054d4e698ab159a8b4fdd3cdaa88e8a3ea2fb43)\n\nA total of 9,676 trades were made by the Congress Members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made the Congress. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some Congress members are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)\n\n**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. \n\na. One Month \n\nb. One Quarter \n\nc. Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)\n\n**Returns of Congress Members vs S&P500**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j5lejvpdroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4edea1cb42cac7ecab4e9e6c5b034ace5d9ac566\n\nAt this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress members did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark. \n\n**Returns if you followed their trades**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rnuw3kyhroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ea3a1ab53fd502a2968939891bd11e9da84c8a\n\nIf you had invested in the stocks Congress Members bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit. \n\nNow that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted answered was which were the best trades made by Congress Members over the last 2 years. \n\n**Best trades made by U.S Congress Members**  \n\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0xatcb5rroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=d157bba30bcd309db66bd51ababcf36e7c76710c)\n\nBrian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Congress Members were successful as shown below. \n\n**Worst trades made by U.S Congress Members**\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/dfsg5lksroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c41517d7299e6b62cbd6dfa1bbdf42a672d750)\n\nThese are the worst trades made by Congress Members with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period. Brain Mast also makes an appearance in the worst trades making him a prime candidate for some WSB loss porn.  \n\nBut even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered Congress Members having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades. \n\n**U.S Congress Members having the highest returns**  \n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/7yk3wa4wroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad6ae5de91e6ec8ade045378e72983dee356b0c)\n\nJohn Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Congress Members comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. Next thing I looked is the Congress Members that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years.\n\n**U.S Congress Members having the highest amount invested in stocks**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x4vb26xxroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c34019c2a724babc40a9823ec513e7a69e562aaf\n\nThe top 3 Congress Members as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.\n\nFinally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S Congress Members \n\n**Most popular stocks among US Congress**\n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/t4vv63s1soy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=327b56f8cbfff8465b09e797272a45ccde46429c)\n\nAs expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have $100B+ valuation. \n\n**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.\n\na. The time period of analysis is 2 years on which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in market downturn/recession \n\nb. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to it (you can find it in the Google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress Members. \n\nc. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress Members. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range. \n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nThis analysis proves that Congress Members indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader's judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Congress Members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.\n\nWhichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!  \n\nLink to Google Sheet containing all the analysis and trades: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Rg5jMYG-X4I7cidQylzCNc_UpJZGNhGrjAt7g0QkXYs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*", "id": "nanynr", "created_utc": 1620824027.0, "score": 3490, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 275, "comments": [{"body": "Someone needs to make a US Congress index fund.", "score": 1224, "replies": [{"body": "$INSDR", "score": 1478, "replies": [{"body": "They said an index fund name not where your wife’s boyfriend is right now", "score": 450, "replies": [{"body": "It's not everyday you find out you have a wife!", "score": 113, "replies": [{"body": "Comes with the free stock from Robinhood", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "Robi'nTheHood", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It's not everyday you find out you have a wife... who also has a boyfriend!", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Did you even know you got married?

{"title": "The market is giving us an absolute gift with these inflation numbers, it’s time to load up the truck, PSLV", "selftext": "We’ve got a massive overshoot on inflation, coming in at 0.8% month over month versus 0.2% expected.\n\nAnnualized that’s a 10% inflation rate.\n\nYear over year core CPI came in at 3%. The last time we had a yearly core CPI at 3% was 1996 and the fed funds rate was 5%, not 0%.  The last time we had monthly core CPI advancing this quickly was 1980.\n\nSo what is the reaction among gold and silver, the traditional inflation hedge plays? They are selling off and the dollar is rallying.\n\nWhy? The market is now pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike, despite the insistence of the fed that there won’t be one.\n\nOnce they digest that rate hikes won’t happen, this is the next black swan.\n\nWill JPow spit in the face of a market that is fully pricing in a rate hike?  Usually the fed likes to go along with market expectations rather than shock the system.\n\nI believe they won’t raise rates or signal that rate hikes are coming soon.\n\nWe still require massive fed and fiscal support to keep the economy and market from crashing, and they will choose the economy over keeping inflation in check.\n\nWhat happens to the dollar when a 100% priced in expectation doesn’t happen?  Eventually the market is going to realize rates are staying at 0% regardless of inflation.\n\nWhen this sets in, gold and silver are going to uncharted heights.\n\nSilver is essentially levered gold. Look at my profile and find the stickied SLV post, read past the part bashing SLV and you’ll see silver is the investment to dump 20% of your big boy money into to save yourself this decade.\n\nIn most decades equities will massively outperform metals. Every few decades the opposite occurs. In the last two silver bull markets silver outperformed equities by 40x and 25x respectively during their 10 year run ups.\n\nLook at the 50-year cup and handle forming on silver, and tell me it’s not a screaming buy:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6xupqxdkpy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eb86e74f8f534141278fc24ea2041b8b769bd01\n\nLoad up the truck, mortgage the house, buy PSLV\n\nAlternatives: buy physical silver if you don’t care about liquidity (keep premiums below 20%), buy silver miners for even more leverage, buy options on miners for even more leverage. Just don’t touch the scam that is SLV.\n\nPlay it how you like, but please, if you have some ‘set it and forget’ type of money, put 20% into gold or silver through the 2020s. You can sell it at the end of the decade if you want to.  This sub has a habit of pure momentum trading, if someone suggests a ticker, every ape looks it up and if it’s already massively green they jump on the train. This is an opportunity to jump on a train before it’s running.\n\nThere is very little free floating silver in 1000oz bar form, and the [LBMA just spoofed 10% of it out of existence ](https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/ronan-manly/lbma-misleads-silver-market-with-false-claims-about-record-silver-stocks/). Look at lumber, rhodium, palladium. That’s what happens when supply runs out and shorts are forced to continuously cover in a commodities market.  This can easily happen in silver.\n\nIf you read that article you'll realize that when WSB piled into SLV in early Feb, that actually did nothing because SLV didn't go out and buy the silver.  They sold us paper lies and then their authorized participants shorted futures.  We have since learned that SLV is a scam and are buying PSLV and physical.  No more wool over the sheep's eyes.  We are coming for the metal, and taking the little silver that there is.

But for some things like raw materials, demand is skyrocketing because of changes in consumer habits (like buying homes).\n* Supply - Also like demand, it's down in some areas as certain businesses haven't returned to normal production levels. While in others it's unaffected.\n* Job market - It's crowded in some places, which labor shortages exist in others. Especially in low-paid jobs. Labor shortages can drive up costs.\n* Shipping - Almost every product needs to be shipped, often multiple times. But many truck drivers took the pandemic as a time to retire or take a career shift. Since people have been preaching how self-driving vehicles are going to put them all out of work for decades at this point. So shipping costs have skyrocketed.\n\nSo really, if you want to find the true inflation number.

While it's traditionally been measured to monetary inflation, doesn't mean a change in it is directly related to monetary inflation.\n\nThe core of the modern monetary theory is that all money is on loan, and people use money loaned to them more responsibly (namely the banks/businesses, since the feds don't loan money directly to individuals). So the amount of money that contributes to waste is dramatically lowered and thus inflation rates are low.\n\nThis is why the fed has \"printed\" (in actuality loaned at very low-interest rates) money at very high rates since 2008 with almost no inflation. That amount has dramatically picked up, but simply by raising the interest rates the fed lowers the amount of money that's going to be borrowed.\n\nSo one-quarter of high CPI because of the unprecedented supply/demand shake-ups, or is it a refutation of the past 40 years of monetary theory?

It's like in March when the stock market was up to something like 120% year on year.\n\nBut everything that's up high has a reason. For example, used cars are so high because the chip shortage is creating a shortage of new cars. (New cars aren't up because manufacturers set those prices, while used cars are a more open market). When the chip shortage is resolved the price of used cars will drop.\n\nOil has a similar issue, oil companies cut production and it'll take time to ramp back up.\n\nBut CPI isn't the only aspect of inflation. For example, it doesn't account for wages. It doesn't account for material costs. Etc. The idea the CPI is the end all be all to inflation is incorrect.

Building the Keystone pipeline and opening up the Tar Sands will negatively impact national and local economies: Burning the recoverable tar sands oil will increase the earth’s temperature by a minimum of 2 degree Celsius, which NYU Law School’s Environmental Law Center estimates could permanently cut the US GDP by 2.5%. At the same time state and local economies are already buckling under the real-time economic effects of our nation’s dependence on fossil fuels. In the past two years, the vast majority of U.S. counties ““ 67 percent ““ were affected by at least one of the eleven $1 billion dollar extreme weather events. Superstorm Sandy alone caused an estimated $80 billion in damage. The drought that affected 80% of US farmland last summer destroyed a quarter of the US corn crop and did at least $20 billion damage to the economy.\r  \n\r  \n2. The same fossil fuel interests pushing the Keystone pipeline have been cutting, not creating, jobs: Despite generating $546 billion in profits between 2005 and 2010, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and BP reduced their U.S. workforce by 11,200 employees over that period. In 2010 alone, the top five oil companies slashed their global workforce by 4,400 employees “” the same year executives paid themselves nearly $220 million. But at least those working in the industry as a whole get paid high wages, right? Turns out that 40 percent of U.S oil-industry jobs consist of minimum-wage work at gas stations. Instead of bankrolling an industry that is laying off workers and threatening our economic future, isn’t it time to take the billions in subsidies going to oil companies and invest instead in a sector that both creates jobs and protects the planet?\r  \n\r  \n3. Unemployment will rise: According to Mark Zandi, the Chief Economist of Moody’s Analytics: “Superstorm Sandy wreaked havoc on the job market in November, slicing an estimated 86,000 jobs from payrolls.” In the wake of Hurricane Irene, the number of workers filing unemployment claims in Vermont went from 731 before Irene to 1,331 two weeks afterwards. Hurricane Katrina wiped out 129,000 jobs in the New Orleans region “” nearly 20 percent. For the U.S. economy as a whole, 2011 cost US taxpayers $52 billion.\r  \n\r  \n4. Poor and working people will be disproportionately affected: KXL and projects like it result in disproportionately negative impact on already struggling working families. According to a recent report by the Center for American Progress called “Heavy Weather: How Climate Destruction Harms Middle- and Lower-Income Americans, lower-and middle income households are disproportionately affected by the most expensive extreme weather events. Sixteen states were afflicted by five or more extreme weather events in 2011-12. Households in disaster-declared counties in these states earn $48,137, or seven percent below the U.S. median income.\r  \n\r  \n5. Building the sustainable economy, not the Keystone pipeline, will create far more jobs: Our nation is in desperate need of jobs. Approving the Keystone pipeline locks our nation into a trajectory of guaranteed job loss and threatens the stability of the US economy. Why keep the “job-killing” course, when the alternative-energy path is already out-performing other sectors of the economy. For example, the solar industry continues to be an engine of job growth — creating jobs six times faster than the overall job market. Research by the Solar Foundation shows a 13 percent growth in high-skilled solar jobs spanning installations, sales, marketing, manufacturing and software development — bringing total direct jobs to 119,000 in the sector. And according to the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts”“Amherst, investment in a green infrastructure program would create nearly four times as many jobs as an equal investment in oil and gas.\r  \n\r  \nA study by Synapse Energy Economics developed a Transition Scenario for the electric power industry based on reducing energy consumption, phasing out high-emission power plants, and building new, lower-emission energy facilities. The study estimated the number of “job years” “” one new worker employed for one year “” that would be created by the Transition Scenario over a decade:\r  \n\r  \n444,000 job-years for construction workers, equivalent to 44,400 construction workers working full time for the entire decade.\r  \n90,000 job-years for operations and maintenance workers, equivalent to about 9,000 full time workers employed over the decade.\r  \n3.1 million indirect jobs for people designing, manufacturing, and delivering materials and jobs in local economies around the country induced by spending by workers hired in the Transition Scenario.", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "How salty are Rachel Maddow's balls?

It is understandable that higher prices for essential items, such as food, gasoline, and shelter, add to the burdens faced by many families, especially those struggling with lost jobs and incomes. At the same time, inflation that is too low can weaken the economy. When inflation runs well below its desired level, households and businesses will come to expect this over time, pushing expectations for inflation in the future below the Federal Reserve’s longer-run inflation goal. This can pull actual inflation even lower, resulting in a cycle of ever-lower inflation and inflation expectations.\n\nIf inflation expectations fall, interest rates would decline too. In turn, there would be less room to cut interest rates to boost employment during an economic downturn. Evidence from around the world suggests that once this problem sets in, it can be very difficult to overcome. To address this challenge, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation modestly above 2 percent for some time. By seeking inflation that averages 2 percent over time, the FOMC will help to ensure longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.\n\nSource: https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/economy_14400.htm", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "SPY might tank to 200.

{"title": "Don't be fooled, the CPI numbers being spread can all be explained by the Lumber and Semiconductor Shortage", "selftext": "A lot of you have looked at the numbers, but how many of you have actually looked INTO the numbers? I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Shit hasn't changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.\n\n#The month on month data:\n\nThere's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:\n\n- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. \n\n- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.\n\n- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).\n\nAs you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.\n\nThe next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).\n\n- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) \n\nAs you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. \n\n#The Year on Year CPI data:\n\nIf you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're retarded. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. \n\nAnyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. \n\nTLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything.", "id": "nawwd9", "created_utc": 1620847072.0, "score": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "Remember toilet paper...

But! Last time I checked, inflation isn't where asset values deflate, they inlfate. It's the currency that loses value. Not assets, especially assets that are known to hedge against inflation. If inflation is your threat, converting assets into currency seems a bit, ironic to say the least..\n\nConclusion: To me, the market's response is overreactive. We got a lot of new investors and traders out there. Including me. But, the key is understanding the driving force behind inflation along with it's cause/effect.\n\nI don't know about you but, I'm buying the dip. Especially inflation hedges.

What do you think the US Fed will do.. Follow suit with the rest of the Central Banks of the world in Negative Federal rates or go out on a limb and raise the Fed Funds Rate?\n\nPlace your bets accordingly~\n\nI don't believe that the US Fed has the balls to raise rates with how huge the bubble is today. We are way beyond 2008. Think about it.. if you were Jerome Powell would you want to be the guy to pull that trigger? I don't think so. He's probably peeing in his pants right now since the market is forcing his hand to do something. I know I would be pissing into a puddle of my tears if I were him. Talk about pressure!\n\nI think Jerome Powell will more than likely try to buy himself time by increasing asset purchases for the next 8 months and serve his term as safe as possible. Then, pass the buck off to the next face puppet Chairmen. Meaning he'll keep rates the way they are or lower them into the negative by .25%. Or at least adjust assets purchases and a negative rate by how much investors freak out. Powell isn't the type to grab the Bull by the horns, if you will. So, mild fluctuations in Fed policy at best.\n\nI just don't think our Fed is smart nor brave enough to take the controlled fire approach and raise rates. Not yet anyways.. Especially, when we're not seeing rates rising with the Central Banks of the world. If anything, they're willing to go into the negative from what I've seen, not assume. Which, assumption is the entire basis of the argument of those who think they'll raise rates.\n\nJust my two cents though.
