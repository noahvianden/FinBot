Its unwise to compare them directly especially in hindsight. If you go back 2 years then the NASDAQ outperformed SPYG by 15%... should we all buy the NASDAQ now? Probably not though many, obviously, disagree and buy it happily.\n\nIf you go back to between mid 2001 and mid 2008 (omitting the major crashes) you will find the S&P outperformed SPYG by a huge margin and thats without even considering dividends. SPYG divs are about half that of the normal S&P and over time, that will make a big difference. But back to that time frame, SPYG was down about 17% while the S&P was up 8%... again without counting divs so the gap was actually much larger than that.\n\nIn other words, growth doesnt always beat value. Historically, they flip flop.\n\nAs stated above, SPYG is a growth fund. They hold almost no value stocks at all. This is why their divs are so low. They also have some mid caps. Obviously the last 8-9 years have been extremely generous towards growth stocks and current valuations are at all time highs. But are you sure that will continue? Are you ok buying them now when they are at all time highs? As stated above, the prior 10 years were not nearly as generous.\n\nSo in other words, it depends on what you believe is going to happen moving forward. If you are extremely bullish on growth then SPYG is the way to go and maybe a NASDAQ fund is something to consider as well. But if you feel like I do, that you dont trust growth valuations (but you dont want to totally ignore them) and that value stocks (namely div aristocrats) have been criminally ignored, then perhaps a mixed fund is better.\n\nDisclaimer: I dont buy funds at all (lol).

Sure it would have been difficult to get in super early and know what they would become...but just imagine a few years of rapid growth and they had much further to go.  In other words, take all the small cap stocks, find out who traveled consistently far in valuation over n years (idk, 3 years?  5 years? not sure the most ideal value for it) then delve deeper into whichever did the best.  Or which went from small-cap to mid-cap, or from micro-cap to small cap, then analyze price and other metrics.  This would be how you would catch something like \"the next amazon\" if such a thing exists.\n\nAnother way is look back into Amazon's history.  Find consistent patterns between amazon and say facebook, google, etc., or obvious traits or patterns in their history. Then apply to the micro or small cap stocks of today.   Make your picks that way..maybe throw in a couple of other things like intrinsic value or other Buffet strategies.  It's all about reading and research.  I was a day-trader (failing mostly) and then swing trader (failing mostly) but now that I have decided to move on to just investing and running a business to funnel money into my investments, I have found that it's all about reading and research.

I'm not saying fundamental > technical analysis at all.

Learn more about the business side.  Some numbers do help, obviously, but you want to be able to paint the entire picture.

The board pretty had to comply plus at the time, Apple wasnt doing great anyway so its not like shareholders were happy with their board members and they certainly loved Gates at the time.\n\nI was around at the time. What killed Apple was a couple of things.\n\nFirst, back then performance was a huge factor. It became less so over time but back then it was a big issue as was price. Jobs was all about marketing rather than performance or value. MACs were technically inferior machines that were almost 1 generation old by the time they were released. They still are that way today for the most part. Instead of making better machines, Jobs spent the money on marketing campaigns. Marketing is very expensive. It was even more expensive back then than it is now due to dominance of TV and newspapers. This was why they started losing money. He blew millions on marketing and folks were not being fooled.\n\nSecond, he cut off all the guys making clones. This was a monumental mistake because these guys were grass roots marketing and support. Instead of embracing them like Microsoft did, he sued them. This pushed them in MSFT's direction and guess were these guys ended up when they got older? These guys became the future enterprise IT force at big corporations... guess what they bought for business? Which is one reason why Apple was never able to break into enterprise.\n\nThis is just how Jobs wanted to do things and the way he was going with marketing, they would have gone under. He got very lucky when he was brought back the 2nd time because by then, PC's were all able to handle common tasks so performance was less of a problem. Mind you the iMac was still horrible... good luck running a Photoshop filter and playing an MP3 in the background (lol). But most folks just needed an internet browser and a PC that doesnt crash so it was fine. Then a few years later windowsME happened and droves jumped ship for an alternative.\n\nJobs was about as visionary as your local car salesman. He was just in a position where that particular talent was perfect for the job (the 2nd time around). Otherwise, he was the beneficiary of being around the right people, namely Woz. No Woz = no Apple. Steve would have been selling shoes. Thats not to say Jobs wasnt important, he was, but not in the way people think. He was the marketing guy.\n\nIf you go around the companies you will find that most of the CEOs are business men just like Jobs. They all have the same tool set. What they dont have however is a marketable product at the right time and they dont have a someone who can put it together for them in the garage to begin with. They dont have Woz as a partner.

So a young guy picking the correct stocks and waiting a decade could end up a millionaire. \n\nHowever, which firms will dominate is either (i) not obvious or (ii) overpriced. For example TSLA will probably dominate vehicles, taxis, energy storage, etc, whereas Ford and GM are in big trouble. If you had traded on that in  2017, you'd have down well. Now, everyone knows that, so massive future profits are built into the TSLA price while there is a huge bankruptcy factor priced into Fords & GM. Still, there is a lot going for TSLA, as its likely dominance (2030) is still not priced in, esp in automated manufacturing.  \n\nAs a young person, biotech is a good area - as customized medicine will transform the health sector. It is, however, very complex, and regulation heavy. Therefore using an ETF like the ARK can be useful. \n\nNote that these are long term plays as markets tend to be flat for years then jump. So don't follow markets weekly or even monthly, just choose good firms and spend your time working on making $$ to add to it.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Did you just suggest that TSLA, and their 650/1 P/E ratio don‚Äôt have their growth priced in?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "You read that wrong. I suggested that TSLA growth to about 2024 or 2025 is priced in. Growth after that is unpriced. P/E ratios are useless for disruptive tech firms - as sales growth can be extreme. P/E can drop very quickly. You are best to use scenario pricing.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Well you got AI and battery tech right... the rest was less insightful imho. Biotech requires intimate knowledge of the tech and related chemistry to be able to invest properly. I have a degree in bio-engineering and I still avoid it because I dont really work in the industry. Playing in biotech without the knowledge is probably worse than blackjack in Vegas.\n\nTesla will not lead in anything. Mind you like Tesla and I love eV's but its not going to happen and it has definitely been priced in. Tesla's priced in about 10-12 years out and that assumes a very rosy outlook. If a single thing doesnt pan out then it it will fall.\n\nThe eV leader will be the one who makes a reliable car that can be quickly serviced at a reasonable price. It will likely be Ford. Not because I like them or anything but they have a track record of reliability in enterprise and they proved they can make a good consumer eV... the Mustang if freaking awesome and average folks jumping over to eV's will want reliability 1st.\n\nI honestly thought the Mustang was going to suck but its better than the M3 in most ways that matter and cheaper. Meanwhile GM's Bolt eV's have been nothing short of underwhelming which is why I discount them and their ventures with Nikola (fraud) and RIDE (more fraud) tells me they are mismanaged. VW has made nothing but unreliable high ownership cost garbage the last 30 years so I am also discounting them despite the ID3. Toyota and the Japanese are out in left field somewhere sniffing hydrogen cell farts so they are out. So odds are on Ford long term and they also own a chunk of Rivian.\n\nThere is no bankruptcy priced into F or GM. What they have is a margin problem. Thats what you are seeing. They cant seem to peel people away from TM due to their crapolla mobiles back in the 80s-90s. The rep has simply stuck even though its no longer true. But eV's are obviously a trend breaker so only time will tell.\n\nLast bit of advice, avoid ARK funds like the plague. They charge too much in fees and they will under-perform a Nasdaq or S&P fund. If you have to go all in on growth just buy a growth S&P with minimal expense ratio (aka under 0.10%).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, biotech is a very difficult area to pick because of the need for products to go through extensive approvals. That's why I use a specialist fund in this area. Also Biotech has huge future prospects - but more 20-25 onwards than the next few years.\n\nIf a specialist  high-tech fund can produce 30 - 40% return p/a, then a 0.5% extra fee is not an issue. In a transformative environment, a wide index fund can have higher risks than past performance indicates. If you are young enough to ignore the high short-term fluctuations inherent in tech funds, then use of SPY instead of QQQ or ARKK could leave you with regrets.\n\nFord sales and revenue has been dropping since 2017. They have pulled out of sedans and focused on pickups, which could be under threat from Tesla. The latest issue is that their software is full of bugs, and hard to upgrade. With vehicles becoming computers on wheels, Ford needs to attract far better software creator and top graduates  rank Ford well below most other tech firms. Ford stock is priced well below where it should be if you assumed steady profits going forward. The only way to justify Ford's price is to include scenarios of a steady drop in sales or eventual bankruptcy. Ford could survive and do well - maybe a 60% chance of this.  Yes, the F150 Lightening is a great vehicle, but Ford are struggling to get enough battery supply to produce more than 100k p/a. And the advance orders seem to be coming from existing F150 buyers, not new buyers.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There is no such thing as a specialist in investing working at a fund. They literally dont exist. Its just wishful thinking and propaganda. How much do you want to bet that the same people who had 40% last year (which is actually not great) also had portfolios that were negative last year? Anyone can make 5 portfolios of differing feature and then claim they are awesome because one of them outperformed. That is literally what all the investment firms do actually... People who really are that good will not be working for funds.\n\nFurther, just because tech is transformative does not mean companies will be profitable doing it. This is the big mistake people make when projecting forward and this cycle seems to repeat every decade or so.\n\nSolar, for example, is insanely transformative... yet there is actually very little money to be made in it for stock investors. But you couldnt tell that to folks 15 years ago... nope... they jumped on and swore that it will make them rich and we had growth funds with 50% returns (GAAEX) and then 10 new funds come out playing solar growth (TAN, ICLN) and the hype and yadda yadda yadda... Heck the companies in solar were actually profitable too at the time yet those funds are all down 50-75% today. Why? Because most of solar is too easy and margins shrunk to nothing and many companies went under. Unless you are making micro inverters and/or optimizers, odds are, you are still down today from the solar growth peak.\n\nToday we have 200+ new tech companies making the same old stuff we already had and most will never be profitable or just barely profitable. You also discount the fact that we are coming off a huge growth stock bull run for almost a decade. Valuations for growth is very high right now. Not like the .com peak but still pretty high up there. Guess what happened after .com? We had almost a full decade of growth funds being flat or negative. During that time, they were greatly outperformed by value funds.\n\nIm not saying I know the future, nor that this will happen in the next decade, but I am pointing out that people with recent bias need to take a closer look at what most of these new growth companies are doing... Most of them are a joke and likely will never be highly profitable. They may survive, but their valuations are out of line with reality (a la solar). I am from tech, and even I dont see anything obviously great among the new startups. Literally nothing. None of them are really working with AI (they rebranded statistics as AI about 10 years ago) and none of them are making anything that is potentially highly profitable that we dont already have.\n\nBatteries? Nope, I can almost guarantee that those will be thin margin like solar panels. Space flight? Fun but give me a break. EV's? Maybe but its fiercely competitive. Self driving? Not going to happen. Best you will have using statistical analysis is sandboxed solutions which will be nice for last mile retailers but not nearly as big of a deal as people make it out to be. Then you have all those silly apps... they are just that. Silly and rehash things we already had packaged in a different way. Most are fads and will go away. Others will not be as profitable as people think.\n\nI respectfully disagree with your last paragraph. I think you simply got that wrong. Though you are right about them pulling out of sedans, their hold on enterprise trucking is basically like MSFT in IT enterprise. You cant shake Ford and Chevy from there due to legacy and Tesla is not a competitor for that anyway. Tesla is making a hobby truck. Not a work truck. A work truck requires service, easy to get parts, cheap parts, and years of proven reliability. Businesses are not going to buy Tesla, Lordstown, Rivian or GoEV. They are unproven and they have a business to run and cannot afford to gamble. So unless Ford makes monumental mistakes with the Lightning, its their market to lose. But like I said, they proved they can make a great eV already so odds are in their favor.\n\nYou are also generally incorrect about the software issues. This is coming to you from a programmer. Tesla is literally considered the least reliable car on the road right now. They have had ample problems with their own software and have been sued for it as well. Their electronics are a disaster especially the front dash and some of their sensors. And oh yea, its about to get worse as they integrate gaming and video cards into the system. So using Tesla as a barometer for software tells me perhaps you have some bad data. Tesla sucks on reliability. They get away with it because their customer base is giving them a pass for being novel as an eV leader and because eVs really very nice. But this wont fly in enterprise.\n\nThats not to say other companies havent had software issues, they have, but this brings us to the other glaring problem. A Ford breaks, you generally dont lose your car because software is not tied to important systems and it can be fixed for peanuts the same day. Tesla breaks, its more likely to be systemic and would interfere with your business and good luck getting parts and service within a week... This is what I was trying to convey before. This is a killer and its why I still dont have a Tesla even though I wanted to buy one for years. Why do you think insurance is so high on Tesla even with their cheaper cars? This is why.

If you follow Sandy Munro and his teardowns of Teslas, and the competing EVs, you will start getting a sense of how much of a lead Tesla has now, and more importantly, how they are improving their technology and production methods at a rate that nobody else seems able or willing to match.\n\nThere are a few niche markets others can capture, but the opportunity is small, and fleeting.

The geofenced lidar approach is not scalable anytime soon. Equipment is to expensive to be a mass market product and it takes way too long to map the whole world. It also means you have to re-map everything once in a while because streets change, there's construction and new streets all the time, meaning your HD maps are outdated and not reliable.Tesla will have a universal solution way before they even mapped a fraction of the roads.\n\n2/ Why would it be safer? Lidar and geofencing are used for localisation, not for car behavior. Localisation is basically solved now with vision only, rendering lidar pretty much obsolete. How save an autonomous car drives is based on the neural net model and behavior solution, not on the sensor suite.\n\nAbout safe car behavior:\n\nDriving a car autonomously is basically impossible to program explicit, there's to many variables in traffic, therefore only an implicit machine learning algorithm will ever serve as solution. Neural net models are trained and improved with massive amounts of data and supercomputers. Tesla has about 100x the amount of (real world) data to the next competitor and one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.\n\nThis means Tesla can improve their car behavior tremendously faster than anyone else. When they want to train a certain aspect of traffic they can just contact their Tesla fleet on the streets and will have 100s of videos of a situation they need in no time.\n\nI really don't see how anyone would catch up to Tesla. The gap to the next best solution to FSD widens with every month passing, they don't come closer. I also can't imagine some unannouned company having a better solution in a secret lab, again, because of the massive fleet and data Tesla has, used to debug the software and train the model. 1 month of public testing a software is worth more than probably 2 years of closed lab testing. That's why I don't think there is a company which can pull a surprise competitive technology.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Look, I'm a Tesla Bull and investor so I don't need to be schooled on how FSD is a better more universal solution.  That was not my point.  Obviously a universal solution (if it makes it to market in time & is safe) will be far superior and likely more scalable.  But I was trying to get you to think about other complications.... \n\n1/ You say Geofencing / Lidar is less scalable and much more expensive.  Then I guess you'd have everyone believe that Google and all these other corporations are just completely clueless and insane right?  You'd sound like a pretty diluted and brainwashed Tesla Fanatic.  Which I suppose is fine because they do make fantastic cars and technology but no solution is without complications... Not even FSD (as we see that few people using it can drive like a normal human being without being totally on edge about edge cases).  Firstly, Lidar and Geofencing are actually quite scalable (or can be made scalable relatively painlessly).  Waymo or other types of companies are already covering major parts of San Francisco and similar cities.  They basically build a nice large van that carries multiple people extremely safely from point a to point B.  You speak of construction & new streets etc as if these are big monsters... Look, existing navigation systems can already easily find detours so there you go... There's a very inexpensive and easy way to solve any reported or planned construction.  They can simply Detour the damn thing... By no means is an entire remapping (as you suggest) required!  So a bit of an exaggeration on your part to assume that due to \"construction\" or similar developments, that every inch of a city needs to be remapped.  All they do is at the click of a few keystrokes, reprogram their guidance systems to Detour it.  So this renders your argument moot!\nTo say they're not scalable is also a bit exaggerated because if you have a big van or bus like vehicle carrying dozens of people, it's actually far more cost effective and scalable than individual cars, and don't for one minute assume that Tesla is not concerned about some of these realities they're facing.  This may in part also explain why last year (2020)....retail investors and investors in general were far more Gung Ho and diluted about your Universal Solution than they are today (hence the extremely flat and anemic stock price for half this year).   People are not stupid they know what's practical and what's not and many aspects of FSD are yet to be trusted by the larger masses except for the Yuppies who have paid 70k plus dollars to buy their brand new Tesla with a large flashy screen on it to glue their eyes to while the car goes and pulls a deadly surprise move! \n\n2/ You say Lidar and GeoFencing are used for \"localization\" and not car behavior.  This is partly true in that FSD is capable of \"learning\" new situations based on the vast amounts of video footage and subsequent labeling of objects it can do when said data is fed to the neural nets (and as you correctly point out, it's constantly improving).   But localization was never intended to teach car behavior.... In fact in that approach, learning is not a requirement because many of the unknowables of driving are reduced to much simpler calculations.  In fact, Lidar and Geofencing (while not universal nor as visually sophisticated as FSD) are a far simpler means of routing a vehicle extremely safely and predictably through particular streets and areas of a city... And Lidar is able to actually see many objects for blocks around the vehicle (not just what's visible to the camera lense).   So this notion that you seem to be positing so positively... That Lidar and Geofencing cannot be used for driving / transportation is just flat out false... Its already happening and working successfully and extremely safely.  I'd love to hear of one news report about a Geofenced Lidar enabled vehicle killing its occupants or others outside.  I have never seen anything mentioned as such \n\nAt any rate, like I said.... I'm overall a Tesla fan and Bull (and my portfolio is 100% Tsla).  But I'm not so diluted that I will make myself believe there is no other possibility of first mover advantage for consumers using the Lidar approach because if (and this is not likely but there's definitely a chance).... That if the many competing companies using the Geofenced and Lidar approach manage to grab a large enough part of the market before Tesla FSD catches on... \n\nThen what we might see happen is that Tesla owners and Robotaxis will may possibly not have as huge a market share as we are projecting.  Again, I'm talking about major metropolitan cities where a Bus or Van can easily help carry dozens of people every hour, to and from the major points of the city or even from a nearby bus stop to their work and back.  Notice I am intelligent enough to realize that FSD would still be far more scalable and cover more areas... But I am saying that the revenue of so called Robotaxis in major metropolitan centers may not be as great (or a monopoly) like we may be expecting.   And if you're gonna say that 100% of all future mankind transportation will definitely (by necessity be from Tesla Robotaxis)... I'm afraid you're mistaken.

All of the numbers that I‚Äôve seen look good too. I‚Äôm not really sure how you can say it was a failure unless you‚Äôve seen more than me.\n\nThe idea and concept alone is amazing. If your roof gets damaged, instead of replacing the entire roof, you just replace the individual sections of tile that were damaged. After you set up the framework for individual panels can easily and quickly be swapped out. Whereas if you have an asphalt roof, you replace the entire thing any time something happens to it. Hopefully you get 15 years, maybe you‚Äôll get to if there‚Äôs a bad storm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd much rather be able to take out one or two sections of shingles and replace them.

However, I‚Äôve owned a home since I was 23 and I‚Äôve looked at many different roofing systems, and I want solar panels at some point..

{"title": "ONCE WERE AUTISTS.", "selftext": "I truly HATE what has happened to WSB due to the whole FUCKING meme stock revolution.\n\nInstead of just being happy with ourselves for unexpectedly making bank with TSLA, AMC, GME, et al, many of us thought we were suddenly geniuses.\n\nAnd many of those who weren't IN on those parties the first time wanted to be THE NEXT TIME!!\n\nWe also got a reputation in the Media for thinking outside the box AND acting in CONCERT to MOVE STOCKS. (In other words something very close to PUMPING!)\n\nThe sub got FLOODED with new people, many of whom were just plain GREEDY and/or STUPID, and many of whom broke the rules. Who weren't FUNNY. Who didn't have anything of value to share. Who wanted just to PUMP their own stock. Or to find out WHAT was the new meme, because they were too lazy to learn anything first, and then pump THAT!  Mods were busy night and day trying to keep it reasonable.\n\nAll other interesting and often very valuable discussions started to subside. And with them, a very WONDERFUL, and rare good-humor. After calling each other names, we actually REACHED OUT WITH KINDNESS to those of us who were experiencing loss or some other trouble. Increasingly, to me at least, it has become less kind, and interesting, and a lot more venal.\n\nIn the last few days, have you seen what is happening to the AMC subs? Its partisans are all on an **ALEX JONES-LEVEL** **CRUSADE** against all the ***imaginary enemies*** that are ***secretly manipulating*** the prices downward. **NEVER MIND THE STOCK WAS $1.92** on January 1st for good reasons, and could reasonably be expected to return to earth at some point...NOoooo!\n\nThere were 'investigative reports' about illegal naked shorts and fake shares. People started taking it all WAY TOO  SERIOUSLY. They put their student loan money on it, they could barely wait for Friday so they could put their checks on it.  One guy used the fact that he needs to take care of his handicapped mom to put ALL of his money on it.  It now is an ALL OUT WAR against some fuck named Kenny who is supposedly masterminding all this evil. And the only way to fight it is to BUY **MORE** of the **SAME TANKING MEME STOCK!!**  **BRILLIANT!!**\n\nFirst of all, it's NOT a conspiracy. Or if it is, we should acknowledge that WE ALSO ARE A CONSPIRACY, okay?  But even if it were, how is it effective to just SIT THERE AND LET THEM KEEP CONSPIRING AGAINST YOU??!! I mean, the more you prove you can't win, the more you should just LEAVE THE FUCKING GAME, No? But I am actually worried somebody is going to get HURT  by this. It's TOO SERIOUS,  GUYS. IT HAS TO STOP!!    **I don't want**  **Sept 11 NIHILISM IN MY SUBREDDIT, OKAY?!**\n\nHere's what I think...we need to stop being the fucking 'meme stock promoter people' and go back to being the 'hidden opportunity exploiters', the class clowns, the ne'r do wells, etc.\n\nI'm pretty much a permabear anyway and don't try to hide it, but I get yelled at, banned, and called a 'shill' and a lot worse for trying to INFORM PEOPLE who are not experienced that **WE ARE NOT HERE TO ENDLESSLY PROMOTE MEME STOCKS whose time has GONE.**\n\nSo, I PROPOSE we start DELIBERATELY SHORTING meme stocks or buying puts on them. I've made like 60% on my admittedly tiny portfolio in the last 2 days with puts on AMC. I'M  GONNA START RUBBING IT INTO YOUR GREEDY APE ASSES, TOO!!\n\nWhich reminds me.  I am kinda SICK of this WHOLE APE motif, too. It's so OVER-DONE. **Fuck,  when did we vote for THAT!?** Now all the media is calling us that. Okay, you idiots that want to pretend you are too dumb to care about the valuation of stock but want to call anybody who disagrees with you a SHILL, You be the APES!!  I don't even remember what we were BEFORE. OH YEAH....WE USED TO BE AUTISTS, REMEMBER?\n\nBut would we stay on the NEWS, with CNBC counting how many times we mentioned 'blubber' if they had to refer to us a AUTISTS??  NOOOO!! Chad and Veronica would WRITE ANGRY EMAILS to REDDIT. No, we had to TONE IT DOWN. So we became nice, SOFT, friendly apes. Lots of poo and banana joke material there. AH HAHAHAHAHA!! So VERY funny, those apes.\n\nI want Bears, Shorts and AUTISTS to have EQUAL RESPECT. Do you hate Hedge Funds?  GREAT!!! Make a case for us SHORTING THEM and maybe we will do it.  But don't get your damn knickers in a twist if I don't give a shit about your grandma not being able to afford a new colostomy bag because I refuse to help pump your fucking worthless meme stock, **ASSHOLE!!**\n\nAnd if your being TOO DUMB to understand that WHAT GOES UP MUST **EVENTUALLY** GO TITS UP, then good riddance, Monkey Boy!!

The volume on $WISH was insane and was constantly being pumped & dumped. A lot of people who bought this initially at 10$ sold it at 12$ and got back in between $12.5 to $14.5. If you look at Ebay, Overstock, Etsy, Jmia, Amazon - You'll notice a simple trend. All of these stocks got dumpstered really hard before they mooned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EBAY**\n\nIf you look at this chart, you'll notice how in 2009 and 2018 Ebay took a huge dip. Look at the stock price right now. It's at ATH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ispg21dujcb71.png?width=2140&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b6bca9d06747e1ac4f2a43405e77b24b30a7bf3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AMAZON**\n\nAmazon went from being 120$ in 2002 to 25$ in 2006.RIP to those who paper handed amazon. Look where the stock is trading right now. It's at ATH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mfwt8y6nkcb71.png?width=2140&format=png&auto=webp&s=26d35bc9d3e368f0b118bc9e01bbdf79c81c80df\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**JMIA**\n\nAmazon of Africa known as JMIA went as high as 40$ after IPO and then dipped to 15$ ish. This stock went from 15$ to 65$ within a period of 6 months. I know WISH cannot be compared with Amazon, but it can definitely be compared with JMIA. WISH and JMIA have pretty similar chart except WISH hasn't mooned to $69 yet and JMIA has.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fyblai46lcb71.png?width=2136&format=png&auto=webp&s=adddea2c354ae2017d48fbf8445df1ee22f2dcb7\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ETSY**\n\n$WISH can be compared to ETSY as well. This company was trading around $25 after their IPO and then later on went as low as 15$. Look at the current price of ETSY now  - This stock is trading at $182 a piece.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6r69dysllcb71.png?width=2138&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e068c48ea964a0fef3a585fd8087a3e3f59b213\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OVERSTOCK**\n\nThis company was trading at 65$ in 2018 and dropped to 10$ in 2019. This is pre covid by the way so pandemic and covid had no impact on the stock price. I am not taking covid into consideration for any of the dips because it's an outlier. This company is currently trading at ATH as well ($80/piece).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xlbwdki4mcb71.png?width=2142&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f66a40105bfbf2de0fdf07f397855b392f639e0\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now let's talk about Warren Buffet**\n\nA random person from audience asked buffet how can he turn 10K$ into 30B$ in today's world.\n\nMr Buffet replied \"Find small companies and invest in them, make sure to invest in companies that have a good future\". I believe we have found such company and that company is $WISH.Here's the video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy0tXMtZGCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy0tXMtZGCA)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***How do I paper hand? My wife goes for a sleepover to her boyfriend's house everyday because I don't bring enough tendies?***\n\nHere are my few tips\n\n1. You need to forget this stonk for few months.\n2. Think of it as an investment or savings into T bills.\n3. Don't keep looking at your position.\n4. Average down by selling weekly covered calls.\n5. If you have 10K$ invested in WISH then you can probably make around 100$/week selling OTM covered calls. Think of it as a passive income. Let's say you buy a house and the value of the house falls. Do you then instantly end up selling the house? No you don't. You instead rent out a bedroom and constantly collect monthly payments. The idea of covered calls is very similar to that. It's a passive income.\n6. Delete Robinhood\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*Conclusion -\\*\\***\n\nAll e-commerce websites have taken a huge dip after IPO (LIKE HUGE) and then recovered. The dips on the company I mentioned were worse than WISH. I wouldn't be surprised if WISH trades at 6$/piece for a while.\n\nDo not PAPER hand this company.\n\nThe company has a potential to shoot up to 60-100$+ if you have some patience.\n\nIf you're down a lot then consider selling weekly covered calls but make sure your strike price is higher than your avg cost.\n\nThe company has a lot of CASH and a lot of Revenue. I am sure they got something up on their sleeves.\n\nA lot of institutions and top wall street analysts are holding this stonk. There's no way it doesn't go up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE**", "id": "oktb8m", "created_utc": 1626357245.0, "score": 455, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 182, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|113|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|149|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oa8h6w/sjr_shaw_communications_the_mega_acquisition_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgwp6y/virt_thrives_on_volatility/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ojhu07/fhn_a_nice_company_to_play_for_earnings_run_up/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7lx6t/the_slv_dd_you_were_waiting_for_why_this_could_be/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7voyx/why_you_should_get_into_slv_and_why_it_is_a_solid/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb950u/crsr_dd_that_youve_been_waiting_for_why_this/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldx805/snap_play_for_next_2_weeks/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/femzi5/gis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lblyoz/why_ely_will_fly_the_final_dd_and_the_last_ely_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oix1lb/key_a_key_to_unlock_some_tendies/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcfi14/hindenburg_coming_after_chammath_i_guess_they/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o76pbc/psfe_a_solid_play_that_will_power_up_your_wallet/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o77r2c/psfe_power_up_your_wallet/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1u1wi/itub_honest_and_unbiased_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1u7wn/itub_honest_and_unbiased_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7ig1o/tu_an_opportunity_to_print_free_tendies/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o21eid/prpl_primed_to_rebound/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o76zts/psfe_a_solid_play_that_will_power_up_your_wallet/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o77od9/psfe_power_up_your_wallet/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o786ml/psfe_power_up_your_wallet/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lblzw3/ely_dd_that_youve_been_waiting_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fannxu/ewy_printing_tomorrow_kospi_down_225/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/faokiz/ewy_puts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvv7w2/black_friday_sale_on_vldr/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0b5xb/goev_investors_day_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvv9um/vldr_squeeze/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9oyqq/ewy_puts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fco3ss/gild_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fe2iq8/opk_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oktb8m/wish_diamond_hand_dd_why_its_still_a_buy/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Make a $Wish motherfuckers!", "score": 101, "replies": []}, {"body": "All in $WISH with Warren Buffett thanks to this post!!!", "score": 77, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buying and holding WISHüíéüôåüöÄüöÄüöÄ", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "Same!

The option would expire worthless. \n\nVery simple explanation of options:\n\nWhen you buy an option, you have a few important pieces of info. The expiration date, the strike price and the premium are the most basic and important pieces of info.\n\nThe strike price is the price you can buy the stock for. If you do not hit that stock price or better, you dont get to use the option. So for example if a stock is trading at $10 and you buy a $15 call, you need the stock to reach $15 or higher for you to use the option. You need it to hit that price before the expiration date. If it does not happen before the expiration date then you get nothing, you lose the money you paid for the option (the premium). The same is true with a put option, if the stock is $10 and you buy a $5 put then you need the stock to drop to 5 or lower to use the option.\n\nYou also dont need to hold the option until the expiration date. You can sell the option before it expires, assuming someone else wants to buy it. So if you buy a $10 option and the stock moves up to $15, you could sell the option for a profit instead.\n\nThe goal of the person buying an option is to have the stock go beyond the strike price (the price you can first use the option) and the goal of the person selling an option is to sell at a price that they dont think the stock will hit.\n\nOptions are a very risky way to invest because you dont always get anything in return for the investment, you can easily lose everything you invest. There are some \"safer\" methods that you can try to learn, but i would advise not doing anything with options for a while, not until you can do a lot of study into it. Once you do start playing with options, choose a small stock and small dollar amounts to play with to see how they work.
