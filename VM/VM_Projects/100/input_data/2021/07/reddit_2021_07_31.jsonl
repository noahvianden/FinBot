You have to wait 4 months for the highest demand teslas right now. Berlin and Texas will fully ramp and supply will find some parity but guess what happens when everyone around you starts getting Teslas? Word of mouth on steroids as we've been seeing. Demand will continue to iphone effect at which point we're going to see 2 more giga factories and so on. \n\nPeople buying Teslas now is one thing but 80% of people you ask ALREADY say that Tesla will be their next car.\n\nReasoning #2:\n\nThe supercharger network opening up. Elon genuinely wants others to make evs and accelerate sustainability. To me this screams \"You legacy ding dongs can't sell a meaninful # of evs, okay, at least let me help with the range anxiety that plagues ev skeptics, here just make some decent cars and use my network lets go\". Legacy just isn't cutting it, they genuinely can't be helped at this point. Most don't want to commit to evs now and are pushing for 2025 or 2030 because they simply can't afford the transition.\n\nMANUFACTURING IS HARD. It's going to take ages for competition to make progress.\n\nReasoning #3:\n\nTesla has unparalleled agility. Supply chip shortage is killing competition while Tesla managed to swap out different chips and rewrite firmware within a week. I was blown away when I heard this on the call. That level of agility gives legacy managers whiplash just thinking about it. I'll dovetail this with battery innovation and supply as well.

Karpathy **coined** the \"Software 2.0\" concept for heaven's sake...\n- Hotz either never listened to or read Karpathy, or he's being dishonest with his argument. Neither possibility does him any favors.\n\nBut more importantly:\n\n- Hotz is clearly not a physicist and has a simplistic, stereotypical - and fundamentally wrong - notion about how Elon as a physicist is thinking.\n- Just a quick example: in mid-2019 Elon fired most of the Autopilot leadership, because Autopilot was at a local maximum (or Autopilot was at a technological dead-end if you insist on a more dramatic characterization), and they refused to shift the paradigm to \"post-modernist\" Software 2.0 concepts.\n\nThe technological arguments he is bringing up are flawed as well:\n\n- While it's true that humans label a crowd with a generic \"this is a lot of people\" attribute - humans very much count objects when their number is manageable. Up to 7 is the conventional wisdom - not very good, but good enough to keep track of a leopard and a python in the jungle, without getting too close to either.\n- Why on earth does Hortz believe that humans not being able to count a crowd of 20 people is an advantage??? It's a **biological limitation**.\n- FSD Beta tracking 20-30 objects at once is a distinct advantage, because it's very much possible to have this many moving objects on the road ... A system that can track many objects has an advantage at recognizing a hazard arising from any of them: a small child separating from the crowd, or a car swerving out of a column of cars.\n- FSD neural networks do have a certain limit as well - over which they'll fall back to \"this is a crowd, gotta be careful\" simplifications.

And there is no doubt that Hotz understands deep learning better than Elon.\n\nElon's thing is not that he's a brilliant engineer.  It's that he's a CEO with a scientific background who is willing to understand complicated ideas and rethink his entire worldview from the bottom up if necessary.  Elon is often wrong because he's not afraid to be wrong, and that's one of his most exceptional assets.  All the shit about Elon being unwilling to listen to subordinates contrasts with reality.  You can watch his views evolve as they are informed by the scientists and engineers at Tesla (and SpaceX), and he's clearly thinking deeply about these things because he arrives at a pretty fundamental understanding.  That only happens if you ask lots of questions, think critically, and then ask more questions.  And he's willing to be wrong and change directions even when there are billions of dollars at stake.\n\nThe discrepancy between Hotz and Tesla is actually not that big.  It's a matter of where they are in the space.  Nobody believes that prescribing features is a good idea if it can be avoided.  BUT Tesla has to deal with all kinds of practicalities that make a priori feature specification beneficial in the near-term.  They \\*also\\* know that the eventual goal will require solutions that are increasingly end-to-end.  That's why you get periodic ground-up FSD rewrites, and that's why they're building bigger and bigger supercomputers.  That's why they talk about merging the NoA, FSD beta, and smart summon stacks.  They are moving toward end-to-end, but in an incremental way where they take \"one step back, two steps forward\" vs. \"10 steps back, 20 steps forward.\"\n\nAs a simple example, look at driver confidence in the FSD beta.  Drivers allow the FSD a lot more control and leeway when the FSD is able to communicate its intentions.  But a lot of communication is about prescribed features and sharing a common set of analogies.  A full end-to-end FSD system might not be able to clearly communicate its intent to the driver.

The concept of \"a lot of people\" vs \"a few people\" is much easier to learn than the concept of \"an even number of people\" vs \"an odd number of people.\"\n\nSuppose I give you pictures of groups of people with YES/NO labels.  In the first set of pictures, whenever there is > 20 people, the label is YES and when there are < 10 people, the label is NO.  I bet given 20 images with the YES/NO labels, even if you don't know what the criteria is, you will get really good at correctly labeling future examples.\n\nNow suppose I take the same set of images and label them as YES when there's an even # of people, and NO when there's an ODD number.  I bet after 20 images you are going to be really fucking confused.  Is it the average age?  Color of their clothes?  It is based on gender?  Is it some complicated formula involving all these factors?\n\nSo even parity (even vs. odd) is a hard concept to learn.  Certainly counting is even harder.  And this doesn't just apply to your ability to learn.  It's likely that parity is a fundamentally a harder concept to learn.  This can be difficult to specify precisely because of shared inductive bias.   It's likely that that \"few vs. many\" is a concept shared by many driving tasks, while precise counting is not.\n\nNow increase the difficulty of the problem (and the underlying dimension), and this effect is amplified exponentially.  If you're trying to learn concepts that are more complicated than what's needed, you will increase the amount of data you need so much that a billion years of a billion human drivers wouldn't generate enough of it.\n\nThis \\*is\\* a concept that a \"physicist\" would get wrong at first go, because it's counterintuitive given the classical method of engineering solutions by prescribing features and then getting really good at each one.

Some of the decision making is \"embedded\" in the visual cortex - to reduce latencies when handling life-threatening hazards - but most of the higher level functions are separate from the visual cortex. So there's a biological & evolutionary precedent, optimized for power efficiency & survival.\n- **Debuggability:** having a good notion of the 3D object space and having a trace of it is important for visualization - but also for debugging. \"Project Vacation\" is still years away.\n- **Large dev team modularization:** as Karpathy recently explained, it's good to have layers, because different engineers can work on individual pieces separately. An integrated approach would have to be re-tested as a whole after even minor adjustments.\n- **Legal reasons:** auditability & semi-deterministic responses are important when moving a 2-ton block of deadly metal. Tesla wants to be able to have a good trace and a human compatible description for events - and having clear & fine-grained object labels is key to that: \"Your Honor, the car saw a fire truck approaching rapidly from the left and pulled over to yield as required by traffic law, and didn't recognize the drunk plaintiff lying in the ditch with his legs covered in palm leaves.\" is infinitely more preferable to \"Your Honor, the car manufactured by the defendant ran over the plaintiff's legs because FSD submodule back_box_420 was trained extensively and behaved well in a billion simulated and RL scenarios, but mishandled this scenario for unknown reasons.\"\n\nKarpathy made the right call with their design.\n\nBut in general I'd like to stress that this is a **Hotz vs. Karpathy dispute** - not the Hotz vs. Elon dispute Hotz is pretending it is ...", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "These all seem like good arguments to me.\n\nFor what it's worth I would not be surprised if some cases arise where it's very beneficial or even necessary to have perception and planning on the same network.\n\nFrom [https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules)\n\n>Systems that use lookahead search, such as AlphaZero, have achieved remarkable success in classic games such as checkers, chess and poker, but rely on being given knowledge of their environment’s dynamics, such as the rules of the game or an accurate simulator. This makes it difficult to apply them to messy real world problems, which are typically complex and hard to distill into simple rules.  \nModel-based systems aim to address this issue by learning an accurate model of an environment’s dynamics, and then using it to plan. However, the complexity of modelling every aspect of an environment has meant these algorithms are unable to compete in visually rich domains, such as Atari.  Until now, the best results on Atari are from model-free systems, such as DQN, R2D2 and Agent57. As the name suggests, model-free algorithms do not use a learned model and instead estimate what is the best action to take next.  \nMuZero uses a different approach to overcome the limitations of previous approaches. Instead of trying to model the entire environment, MuZero just models aspects that are important to the agent’s decision-making process. After all, knowing an umbrella will keep you dry is more useful to know than modelling the pattern of raindrops in the air.\n\nI guess one use class of cases I'm getting at is: the network could self-learn heuristics about which objects off-road are not necessary to track and fully process and think about every frame (e.g. people walking slowly 20 feet from the curb) and which ones are necessary to track and think about (e.g. people running super quickly 5 feet from the curb and towards the street)), and therefore can perform more detailed box-bounding and in-memory location-persistence on the objects that are necessary to track and less computation on the objects that aren't. \n\nMaybe that is why human vision can only do close tracking and analysis on things directly in our field of vision and rather does rough tracking on objects more in our peripheral vision. It could be that our brain does that to save on computation (some argue we have 20 petaflops available, though obviously not all of that is used in our vision+action networks) (it could also be simply there wasn't enough evolutionary pressure to evolve better eyes for us), which could be precisely why certain triggers (e.g. fast objects moving right to our head) seem to trigger Type I thinking reflexes (e.g. our planning network) before we've even fully analyzed/realized what the object is (our perception network & conscious awareness). I would assume if vision processing and labeling only had trivial computational cost, our consciousness would be aware of what our reflexes are reacting to before the reflex occurs, but I do suppose as well that depends on the computational cost of having conscious awareness. It could be very well be that full perception of the environment happens in humans before reflexes occur and that we aren't skipping any perception and environment mapping before performing our reflexes, and that rather it's the qualia of conscious awareness in our brains that is very computationally expensive that our brain skips out on before a reflex occurs. If vision processing\n\nEspecially with greentheonly's conclusion that FSD is getting seriously compute-bound on the car, I would think such combination of planning w/ perception would become necessary, though at the expense of debugging and explanatory power of decisions, (though you could manually create a few more layers of networks that try to pre emptively do certain planning and perception actions (e.g. there's some large object (which may be a group of people) in front of us ) before completing the rest of planning and perception actions (there are 20 people 10 feet in front of us on the crosswalk)\n\nLet's suppose you can perform certain heuristics on your 360 degree of vision to determine certain areas of vision have a low probability of being relevant for planning. Then rather than performing full computation on those areas every frame(e.g. creating 20 bounding boxes for 20 people on a cross walk 100-feet in front of you and persisting the locations of each of those people in memory, rather than having one large bounding box), you could perform full computation on those areas once every let's say 10 frames, and instead focus more processing power on areas of vision that have a high probability of being relevant for planning.

You have to wait 4 months for the highest demand teslas right now. Berlin and Texas will fully ramp and supply will find some parity but guess what happens when everyone around you starts getting Teslas? Word of mouth on steroids as we've been seeing. Demand will continue to iphone effect at which point we're going to see 2 more giga factories and so on. \n\nPeople buying Teslas now is one thing but 80% of people you ask ALREADY say that Tesla will be their next car.\n\nReasoning #2:\n\nThe supercharger network opening up. Elon genuinely wants others to make evs and accelerate sustainability. To me this screams \"You legacy ding dongs can't sell a meaninful # of evs, okay, at least let me help with the range anxiety that plagues ev skeptics, here just make some decent cars and use my network lets go\". Legacy just isn't cutting it, they genuinely can't be helped at this point. Most don't want to commit to evs now and are pushing for 2025 or 2030 because they simply can't afford the transition.\n\nMANUFACTURING IS HARD. It's going to take ages for competition to make progress.\n\nReasoning #3:\n\nTesla has unparalleled agility. Supply chip shortage is killing competition while Tesla managed to swap out different chips and rewrite firmware within a week. I was blown away when I heard this on the call. That level of agility gives legacy managers whiplash just thinking about it. I'll dovetail this with battery innovation and supply as well. Establishing a relationship with catl/lg/panasonic/etc will be difficult for competition when Tesla has outright promised to buy all your batteries. \n\n\nTLDR: I think if competition doesn't wake the fuck up and fast, then Tesla might be looking at significantly higher market share than the bulliest bulls have projected.

People have terrible standards that they will stick to. Legacy auto wants to ramp fast, we've seen the VW and Ford shortcuts thanks to Munro. By fast I mean existing garbage assembly ICE lines will put inefficient components into the EVs. People will still buy, even if they get more maintenance, because they think they're getting quality.\n\nMeanwhile the short term legacy savings on ramping will have staggering consequences long term.

Test drive.\n\nWarning long. TLDR: I need either more cargo space or less stuff, and less stuff seems possible. WANT!\n\nWent to the local store on Florida Ave by the diner and really close to I-75 too. Having a good day re pain but decided to use my wheelchair, because it would give me an idea of how easy it would be to load/unload things out of the back. Also the store seemed busy so bringing my own chair was nice.\n\nIn the store they had a White 3 dual motor and a black Y dual motor. The M3 had the frunk open and it looked like a huge panel gap, still a little concerned as I couldn't tell if the frunk was popped and just hadn't been opened fully or not.\n\nRolled over to the Y and started playing with doors n stuff. The front doors have a nice satisfying thunk to closing. I did notice there's no \"oh shit handle\"s anywhere on the roof. They can be sometimes useful. The rear hatch is super quiet, my Rav4's electronic lift gate isn't noisy but it sounds mechanical and loud in comparison to the Y's hatch which is very quiet.\n\nI noticed it didn't have running boards and considered asking if I could get some.... we'll get back to that. The rep pull the MY around to the side of the building, I considered taking the chair apart but the rep picked it up and laid it on its side in the back without popping the wheels off- not the way Id have done it, wouldn't hurt anything- just odd.\n\nThey gave me a black with white interior Y Dual Motor AWD \n\nHe showed me how to adjust the side mirrors and said see you in 15 minutes.\n\nImpressions: All the mirrors are significantly smaller than the mirrors in my Toyota and rear viability isn't quite as good. Drove around the parking lot for a little bit as I drove a Model 3 like three years ago and found the regenerative breaking quite intrusive. The breaking on the Model Y I drove today allowed me to coast more and acted more like an ICE vehicle with momentum than the 2018 Model 3- I definitely liked that. I found the Model 3's near stop when you let off the accelerator disconcerting. The selector being a stalk vs in the center between seats 1-2 was nice and made the car feel a tiny bit more spacious. The drivers seat was a nice mix of soft yet firm very comfortable and supportive.\n\nMy Rav4 has an 8 speed transmission and you can hear and feel the engine shift, not the case with the Y but I should have expected that and it totally makes sense being all electric, non-stop linear power delivery is a thing.\n\nDrove a block or two to I-75 and randomly decided to go north not really thinking about it- Got up to highway speeds and stayed in the right lane until I could verify that my mirrors were where I wanted them. The first exit is Bearss only about 1.5 miles away so I decided to go the next exit, which turned out to be a) further away than I expected and b) the Wesley Chapel exit where our local ice rink is. We used to play there a lot. First little thing I noticed, the turn signal kept staying on even after I changed lanes, I had to manually flick it to turn it off or risk driving with them on like a retired snowbird. Not a big deal and something I'd probably figure out eventually. I pulled into the Gate gas station near the rink (which felt odd) and parked.\n\nI knew where I was \\[at the station near the rink\\], knew where I wanted to go \\[back to the Tesla store\\] but not sure how to get from here to there. Messed with the system trying to figure out how to turn on Navigation and couldn't figure it out so I used my phone and Google maps, it took me back down 75 to my old apartment then across Bearss and near my old apartment I finally found the navigation so I pulled over, turned it on and shut off my phone.\n\nGot back to the store. Couldnt figure out how to turn off the Y. \\[LOL\\]\n\nDecided since my car was close by, I grabbed my hockey bag and tossed it in the back. That fit just fine. Normally I carry my hockey bag, and sled side by side with the smaller side of the split bench down for the sled. And my wheelchair folds up. The wheels go next to the bag and the seat on top of the hockey bag in the cargo area of my Toyota.\n\nThe Ys cargo area didnt look wide enough to fit the sled, next to my bag but I didnt try it. This was a just for kicks test drive and I didnt want to scratch anything.  Didnt put my chair on top of my bag either. The slope of the rear hatch has me concerned about getting all of that into the cargo area\n\nThat said. I think it's gonna be a while until I buy a Tesla because I just bought a car, don't have a fantastic job (I make about 16/hr right now) and charging - I cant do at home or work. So for now I'm thinking a year or two and get one when the 4680s are available.\n\nIm working on getting back into shape- slowly- so hopefully I can leave the wheelchair at home, and if I move back to Orlando I may leave hockey. It takes up a lot of weekend time etc etc. Not needing to carry my hockey gear, a wheelchair or both make the sloping rear hatch/cargo capacity mostly if not entirely a non-issue.  Getting out I noticed the low ground clearance and it was very easy to get my feet on the ground from the drivers seat- which is usually an issue, which is why I wondered about running boards earlier.\n\nOverall I was quite impressed. If I was in the market I'd be seriously thinking about getting a Y.
