Calculation is easy you add the lowest option price in 220 days to its premium, for instance the total is $28,,, you check next week calls you see the $28 call is already for a premium of 35c. So it means you already make money even if your option you sold for $28 you make money, you are not loosing anything even if it is called next Friday. Your option may get deeper in money if it is weekly money. You should remember, if for any reason stock price drops your short leg gets ITM, you can sell it. Example, your long option is $28, the stock price go down to $27,,, now you see you can buy your short leg falls to 18-25c. You buy your call back, even if you sell it at 25c in Market price, you still make 10c per share. Of course if you can immediately right another call for another week, once your option go back up. This is the most valuable aspect of leap trading. \nThe other example if you have deep in the money option and all a sudden the share price falls 50%. Now your option is may be $18. You still can sell OTM option of $25 (instead of $28), of course no one call your $25 option while they can buy the stock in the market for $18. But you make money anyway from your premium, since the option expires worthless. \n3- You have to pick up between low option high premium or high option price low premium. The good thing about low option and higher premium is that 1 years from now if the stock price even drops still you may recover some of your investment since it will be exercised if it is 1c in the money. \n4- Your loss compare to stock is minimal and you can buy a lot of contracts, otherwise you can’t afford. I have 2 Apple contract of 117.5 strike, that I paid a lot on premium in hundreds of dollars, but guess what with all the price I paid it is in the money now while it has another year for expiration (a lot of time value). If I purchased $200 stocks of Apple its cost would have been almost 40K, but with option it only cost me $4,695 almost 1/10. If I write 2 contracts next week for $145 my premium even if it is called is 62c + +5 per share otherwise I will keep making money while my option gets deeper and deeper in the money.

Do you follow this rule of converting a credit spread to debit when the underlying moves against the trade? or what is the criteria used to decide whether to convert or take the loss", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ideally you would have some form of external criteria that determines if the original thesis for the trade has changed, such as an earnings revision, etc. That's rare, however, and often you are left with less direct inputs, such as analyst re-ratings, media coverage or sentiment, etc., or barring that - gut.\n\nMechanically, you are looking to make the change while the opportunity still exists for the new trade to be profitable. For example, if you received $5 credit on a $10 bear spread and wish to turn it into a bull debit spread, you obviously can't spend more than $15 on rolling one of the options because then it's a guaranted loss. This often will happen if the underlying breaches a credit spread, for example, so you usually have to make that call while the credit spread is still OTM.\n\nThere are other methods that can help minimize the loss if it's too late to convert, such as pairing a CCS with a losing PCS to make it an Iron Butterfly, locking in a particular level of loss that is going to be less than full loss would have been, but that's a different type of adjustment/defense.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "You can set limits on spreads but it can backfire.

In particular, the rise of ARM platforms in the datacenter, where Intel earns their largest margins - if the wins are big enough in terms of density and power, they might have some real work to do once customers move off x86/x64. The broad market shift to mobile computing means they are also threatened by ARM on the consumer/end-user side, as the remarkable performance of Apple's M1 so clearly demonstrates in its mobile platforms.\n\nI think there's some speculative value in Intel's ownership of MobilEye if you believe self-driving is more than a computing fad, but I doubt it's going to be a substantial portion of their revenue/profits any time soon.\n\nDisclosure: INTC, AAPL, AMD shareholder.

The interest rate and the price of the Treasury are inversely correlated. If the price goes down the yield goes up. When the fed buys treasuries their price goes up and their yield goes down. Look at the chart of TLT\n\nWhen the fed buys treasuries they're buying the debt that the federal government is obligated to repay. So they're indirectly lending to the US federal government.

{"title": "What kind of performance would Tesla have to deliver to justify its share price", "selftext": " \n\nWe’ve built a very simple model for Tesla to see if we can make sense of its valuation.  The model is very simple and has just three forecast variables: revenue growth, operating margin, and capital turns (which measure how efficiently the company utilizes its capital). These three variables are all we need to do our analysis.\n\nWhat we’ve specifically tried to model out is what kind of financial performance Tesla would have to deliver in order to justify its current share price.  This means playing with my three forecasts variables until I get to $600.\n\nI’ve used consensus revenue forecasts over the next two years as a starting point, and then proceeded from there.  Note that consensus revenue estimates for Tesla are $49.1 billion for 2021, and $65.7 billion for 2022.  This is extraordinary, and represents growth rates of 55% and 34% over the next two years. These growth rates don’t seem sustainable, so beyond 2022, I’ve trended revenue growth rates down to 20% and carried this forward.\n\nI should point out that for capital intensive businesses like Tesla, revenue growth, especially at these levels, is never free, because it requires a company to continually reinvest in the business.  For Tesla, it means continually investing in additional production capacity in order to meet production and sales targets.  You will see this reflected in our cash flow forecasts, where annual capex requirements means negative cash flows for the first few years                                             .\n\nIn terms of margins, Tesla has seen steady improvement over the last few years as it scales up, and there’s no reason to think they can’t continue to improve margins further.  Tesla is after all a premium brand, and commands premium pricing. Nevertheless, the EV space is attracting a lot of new players and a lot of new investment, and this will likely put a cap on Tesla’s margin expansion into the future.\n\nFor modelling purposes, our NOPAT margin variable is our key lever, and we’ve had to ramp this up very aggressively to hit our $600 target.  Tesla’s NOPAT margin is currently around 5%, but we’ve had to gradually move this up to 18.5% over the next few years.  Now the comps we’ve selected aren’t perfect, but you will notice that at these levels, Tesla’s NOPAT margin would be well above industry benchmarks.  You will also notice that our forecasts generate an ROIC (return on invested capital) of almost 33% at its peak, again well above industry standards.\n\n### What does it all mean?\n\nI’m not going to take a view here, except to say that Tesla is priced for perfection, and this is reflected in the model numbers. Again, the purpose of the exercise was to see what kind of financial performance Tesla would have to deliver in order to justify its current share price. I’ll let you decide whether you think the forecasts are reasonable or not, and then by extension whether you think the current share price can be justified.\n\nIn the meantime, I am attaching a copy of the model here, so feel free to play around with it for yourself.\n\n[https://thinklikeananalyst-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/theanalyst/EXpJOebEvnFGjBOeQ1mQZm0BARiHpN8-T2dSiItdEDHgjQ?download=1](https://thinklikeananalyst-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/theanalyst/EXpJOebEvnFGjBOeQ1mQZm0BARiHpN8-T2dSiItdEDHgjQ?download=1)", "id": "odjcgs", "created_utc": 1625401154.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Elon needs to make onlyfans to justify tsla stock price", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "I wanna see that dick, fatty.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "They'd probably need a bigger hit than 'Signs'.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I’ve hit a sign once, it fucked up my car. \n\nRIP ‘87 RX7. \n🚙=☠️", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Everyone I've ever met that's had an rx7 crashed it.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I just bought a second one.

The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests. \n\nHappy Independence day to all of you! S&P 500 hit a new high (1.7% WoW increase) following Friday’s strong job report (U.S. economy added 850,000 jobs, the most in 10 months). This marks S&P 500 rise for the 7th straight day, the longest winning streak since last August. Even though the market had a strong rally, almost all the popular stocks took a significant beating in the past week.\n\n**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3q1rkh0my6971.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a33ca58866f42a1a9368919fd3e785ce5b96da4)\n\nThis is the first time where all the popular stocks except SPY ended in red the same week. This week's stock returns also illustrate the need for effective diversification of your portfolio!\n\nWISH continues to be the most discussed stock, but its sentiment took a significant beating following the 17% drop in the stock price in the past week (dropped to 4% from 46%). The best performing stock on the list was BlackBerry which almost recovered all its losses following the company’s earnings report. A newcomer to the top 10 list is Virgin Galactic following the announcement that its next spaceflight test will carry founder Sir Richard Branson.\n\n**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/3aliegymy6971.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=02872056dc3f6f07f18357a616698dae9429ec56)\n\nAbove is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.\n\n**Micron Technology($MU):** MU released its [Q3 quarter results](https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-technology-inc-reports-results-third-quarter-fiscal-2021) on June 30th, beating both revenue and EPS estimates. Even though the company had strong quarterly results, the stock tumbled 5% following the earnings due to raising capital expenditure forecast. Investors believe that this is just a minor blip as the company has reported impressive revenue growth of 36% (YoY) and a gross margin of 42% and MU can expect strong demand from the data center, PC and graphics, mobile markets.\n\n**Virgin Galactic($SPCE):** SPCE had a wild week with the stock jumping 23% on Friday after the company announced that its next spaceflight test will carry Richard Branson. The launch is expected to take place on July 11th and marks an attempt to beat Jeff Bezos after he announced that his company (Blue Origin) will have its first passenger spaceflight on July 20th. SPCE stock, in general, had wild swings this year with the stock climbing above $60 in February and then falling as low as $15 in May.\n\n**Vuzix Corp($VUZI):** VUZI is considered to be at the forefront of the wearable smart eyeglasses industry. The company was generating discussions as it gained almost 8% mid-week before dropping down. Investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock as reflected by its sentiment. The stock has experienced very large swings this year with it starting at $8 in Jan and rallying up to $30 in April before dropping down to its current level of $17. Still, the stock is up 109% YTD.\n\n**Paysafe($PSFE):** Paysafe is a payment platform that enables payment processing, digital wallet, and online cash solutions. The company is trending as it had recently announced its partnership with Microsoft and is now enabling online cash transactions on Microsoft Store. Adding to this, the company also announced an expanded partnership with FOX Bet.\n\n**NIO Inc($NIO):** Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer NIO has now climbed more than 20% in the last month. This strong rally is generating more discussions about the stock. In addition to this, analysts’ recommendation has also become more bullish for the stock with Citigroup‘s Jeff Chung issuing a price target of $72 from the current $50 level. This is predominantly driven by the company’s excellent shipment volume, with NIO confirming they have delivered 8,000+ vehicles in June and 21,896 vehicles for the entire second quarter.\n\n**Honorable Mentions:** ZIM Integrated Shipping($ZIM) got a boost in mentions following [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oakw8w/zim_pirates_of_the_zimmabean_dead_mans_dd/) excellent Due Diligence that was posted on wallstreetbets which showcased the company is a good long-term play. Intellia Therapeutics($NTLA) was also trending following their announcement that they have successfully corrected a hereditary disease ATTR amyloidosis, with a single infusion of CRISPR, a programmable gene-editing tool. The stock jumped 50% on the news but dropped down to a 15% gain over the last week.\n\nThank you for reading and hope you enjoyed this week's analysis! \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*", "id": "odjp8j", "created_utc": 1625402538.0, "score": 966, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 201, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|49|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|166|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n940ns/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o70k70/i_analyzed_the_last_3_decades_of_stock_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kl4fhj/one_more_stock_indicator_to_consider_before_your/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njxv95/a_dd_on_inflation_how_it_affects_stock_prices_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnho9j/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbtp0q/dont_paper_hand_gme_due_to_boomer_bots_real/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsvma5/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1t0yz/i_analyzed_all_the_motley_fool_premium/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Could you do a comment on Clov please?

Have I been guilty of this in the past? Absolutely. In my post history you’ll definitely find me shilling for CLOV. Stupid piece of shit CLOV. \n\nTurns out, you’ll find most of these stocks are shorted FOR A REASON. THEY SUCK ASS. THINK YOU DAMN APES, THINK. \n\nAMC and GME actually did squeeze. But those are RARE exceptions. And they totally poisoned this sub with a bunch of Neanderthals looking for the next short squeeze. Stop. Get help. It feels like we’ve had 5 years worth of short squeezes in the last few months. It’s over. \n\nWhy should you listen to a random nobody yelling at you on the internet? Because. People are making money out there while you baghold these crap stocks. SPY at an all time high. You coulda made more $$ playing Microsoft or Apple. \n\nOr actually, don’t stop. Lose your money please. And then fuck off to your lonely 9-5 daily cocksucking for that $500 weekly paycheck. And never come to this sub again. So I don’t have to read your bullshit. I just want to wake up, pull out my phone, and not see your dumb ass. Your wife/girlfriend however is invited. \n\nSo, want to know why your “short squeeze” DD isn’t working?! Here’s the difference- AMC and GME are household names. If you want retail to pile on? It’s gotta be a household name. Retail loves nostalgia. They love familiarity. \n\nSo is it a retail squeeze, or can you get the big bois on board? Here’s some facts for ya- they don’t need your shit DD. They have Bloomberg Terminals. They have 100x more data than we do, and they see it before we do, in real time, and they play market rotations and earnings. They’re not googling 1 week old short interest data. They got the real time shit. They play this game on another level. And if you can’t get them on board, and the stock isn’t a household name, then you fucked up. \n\nSo this is what I’m saying- I blame all you fucks for missing plays like NKE last week. \n\nCome on. NKE was a fucking given. It was written on the wall in neon letters and most of us missed it. \n\nTL;DR- want to make money? You can be a millionaire without ever touching a short squeeze. \n\nFucking rookie ass bitches.\n\nEDIT MOTHERFUCKERS- \n\nSomehow my rant, which I thought would get me banned or downvoted to hell, has made it to the top in just a few hours. \n\nSure, the comments are trying to wreck me. I also got a Reddit admin notice asking if I need mental health help lmao. Got a good chuckle out of that one. Fucking trolls. \n\nBut you can see this is a place where we can still say fuck this short interest bullshit. And we can still find others who agree. I’m ok with conflict as long as nobody gets banned or their comments deleted. \n\nWhen you try to have a counter opinion on most subreddits you get insta-banned. So I’m just happy we have some freedom to talk shit here and disagree openly. It’s fun. Appreciate it you cunts. \n\nI know it won’t stop the shilling but 🤷🏻‍♂️. Let’s get some real fucking DD in here. Fuck short squeezes. It’s too easy for people to come in and manipulate this crowd on SI news.\n\nFINAL EDIT- mods flair me. What’s it take?

Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the “proof” delivered by the market, and the pool of buyers – for a time – expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop.

The Younger Days are beginning.\"*\n\n― Saruman the White\n\nSince most of you degenerates have joined during the middle days of WSB (post 2M), I thought it might be helpful to remind you the stories of some of the OG degenerate legends.\n\nu/1R0NYMAN, **the master of homeless box spreads**\n\n['no money at risk'](https://preview.redd.it/21yvujixo9971.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=a990f594a9a435a6d80e230bb87550ca2a6fe917)\n\n* Discovered an ancient spell of 'it literally can't go tits up' trading strategy called \"The Box Spread\", a multi-legged options strategy involving both buying/selling calls and puts at the same time.\n* Through his wiseness, he came to the conclusion that Box Spreads, if sold at the right time, can get him credit with 'zero risk' because his blood magic told him so\n* Out of all tickers, he chose $UVXY (because why the fuck not? It's not like Volmageddon ever happened). He was confident that he set up a play that would net him a guaranteed total of $38k of riskless profit in 2 years. With the right amount of leverage he could scale this up nicely\n* Sold hundreds of Box Spreads on Robinhood using margin and got paid a credit for each box spread. His account went [from $5k of his own money to about $200k worth of risk](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/)\n* Proceeded to withdraw $10k in cash, because who woudn't?\n* If a Box Spread gets held till expiry it's risk free, but that's not how option selling works because there is always assignment risk...and 1r0nyman completely forgot about that\n* To make it worse, Robinhood didn’t pick up on the risk level of his box spread trade and actually echoed back to him that there wasn’t a big amount of risk on the trade. Much like other elders here, 1R0NYMAN found a glitch/cheatcode in Robinhood which ultimately added even more fuel to the fire\n* Got assigned short shares, -$58k loss, account closed out. Robinhood banned box spreads after the fiasco and emailed its entire client base about its policy change as a direct result of what happened with 1R0NYMAN\n\nu/analfarmer2, **the paragon of FDs**\n\n* analfarmer2, a 19-year-old became the true paragon of how OGs traded FDs back in the elder days. He somehow got access to about $100k in his trading account (described as ‘online biz and margin’)\n* His first FD was a $110k bet on $ALGN with 2DTE calls. The company announced a share buyback, and shares rocketed the next day gaining him $180k. His account went to $343k\n* A couple of days later our guy dropped $170k on1DTE  SPY puts, and again got insanely lucky as the market tanked after a Trump tweet about the Chinese trade embargo. [**His trading account was up another $277k up to $646k**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cksrsf/spy_puts_277k_profit_in_1_minute/)\n* He took another massive bet the following day, buying $600k worth of SPY calls 1DTE. analfarmer2 sold out of his position at a $500k loss. He made a few more unknown trades and found himself down to $41k\n* [**3 days later**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/co31pq/my_final_yolo_40k_into_cgc_calls_expiring_next/) he bought $40k worth of $CGC calls in anticipation of earnings the following week. This was a more responsible trade -- he had an entire week until expiration, just imagine the possibilities. Earnings were shit, the stock tanked and his FDs were now worthless\n\nu/ControlTheNarrative, **the wizard of GUH!**\n\n* ControlTheNarrative was so wise that he managed to discover the 'infinite money cheat code' deeply embedeed into Robinhood's matrix and as a result redefined what some consider to be beyond their Personal Risk Tolerance\n* He was so genius and so retarded at the same time that through his Robinhood Gold account he took his leverage level to 25x, well beyond the 2x allowed by RH\n* From an inital deposit of $2k (minimum balance to access RH Gold) he bought 100 shares of AMD for $4k or so, with margin. He then sold an AMD Call Contracts with a $2 strike to get almost all his money back. He then used that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles the buying power, then he sold 2 Call Contracts witht he same $2 strike price to get almost all his money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin\n* Robinhood let him buy AMD stock on margin that is collateralized by AMD stock he's already sold. The AMD loop he went through made his buying power go up only because RH was absolutely retardedly (even more so than he was) still counting the AMD stock for his covered calls as part of his margin collateral to buy the options. He rinsed and repeated this process until sufficiently leveraged to his Personal Risk Tolerance (25x leverage)\n* Finally, he used his increased buying power to 'maximize' gains by loading up on $AAPL put FDs to bet against Tim Apple on an earnings play. Unfortunately, $AAPL destroyed earnings and blew his account\n* To make matters worse, [he recorded the market-open and the instant nuking of his account](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/)\n\nu/MoonYachts, **the leverageborn**\n\n* Credit. Debt. Equity. Leverage. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when u/MoonYachts attacked. MoonYachts was a disciple of u/ControlTheNarrative. Through his master's teachings, MoonYachts also understood that when selling covered calls on Robinhood and if he bought the shares, the stock wasn't subtracted from the buying power. The cash balance from the covered call got added to his cash balance – increasing the buying power by the premium he took in.\n* Only the Fed Chair, master of all four elements, could beat him, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. And although his QE skills were great at the time, he had a lot to learn before he was ready to save anyone.\n* So it happened, that MoonYachts' Personal Risk Tolerance was from the netherrealm and not even the Fed Chair could match him at the time. By using the 'infinite money spell', he managed to take his [**Personal Risk Tolerance to 250x leverage (a $1M leveraged position on $4k of initial equity)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drqaro/robinhood_free_money_cheat_works_pretty_well_1/) (on $F stock out of all tickers)\n* To this day nobody knows the ending of his adventures, but legend has it that banks still hate him for showing us the spell of infinite leverage", "id": "odv8ni", "created_utc": 1625440462.0, "score": 2649, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 395, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|91|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1050|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffw2hl/vix_when_to_short/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffwtx6/shortterm_volatility_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l777pk/today_changes_everything_gme_transcends_division/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffsoyj/if_you_havent_bought_spce_puts_there_is_still_time/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7g6w2/all_roads_lead_to_citadel/) [x](https://i.redd.it/490xp34763p41.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msh3w5/the_lucky_clover/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8wna/gamestop_love_letter_from_ryan_cohen/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fewhfm/we_havent_hit_the_bottom_yet_not_even_close/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffutan/vol_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffuucv/volatility_trades_vix_going_stratospheric_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffuwbt/vix_going_stratospheric_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffv638/vix_futures_spike_to_highest_since_2009/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffw1pg/shorting_the_vix/) [x](https://www.newsweek.com/what-hantavirus-man-china-tests-positive-after-dying-infection-spread-rodents-1493924) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ffwlhy/vix_play/) [x](https://www.ft.com/content/0a6c8c14-ca31-47f4-87cd-0c8b841baeb4) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb6r1d/gme_becoming_the_ultimate_destination_for_gamers/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0nz47/citrons_announcement_of_an_announcement_is/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l520sb/implications_of_melvins_bailout_today/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6u96y/gme_price_has_nothing_to_do_with_fundamentals_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqybwx/open_to_35/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msnkc1/the_lucky_clover/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Okay but what about decorative gourd guy?", "score": 689, "replies": [{"body": "Gourd futures are gonna be hit this year", "score": 188, "replies": [{"body": "That's why he already rotated into Rhodium and bees", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dude the first time I read that story I literally cried my eyes out laughing for 3 minutes.
