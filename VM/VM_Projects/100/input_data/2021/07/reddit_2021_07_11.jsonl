{"title": "Branson Completes Virgin Galactic Flight, Aiming to Open Up Space Tourism", "selftext": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/11/science/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space.html?smid=url-share\n\nSPACEPORT AMERICA, N.M. — Soaring more than 50 miles into the hot, glaringly bright skies above New Mexico, Richard Branson at last fulfilled a dream that took decades to realize: He can now call himself an astronaut.\n\nOn Sunday morning, a small rocket plane operated by Virgin Galactic, which Mr. Branson founded in 2004, carried him and five other people to the edge of space and back.\n\nMore than an hour later, a Mr. Branson took the stage to celebrate. “The whole thing was magical,” he said.\n\nMr. Branson’s flight reinforces the hopes of space enthusiasts that routine travel to the final frontier may soon be available to private citizens, not just the professional astronauts of NASA and other space agencies. Another billionaire with his own rocket company — Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon — has plans to make a similar jaunt to the edge of space in nine days.\n\nIn each case, billionaire entrepreneurs are risking injury or death to fulfill their childhood aspirations — and advance the goal of making human spaceflight unexceptional.\n\n“They’re putting their money where their mouth is, and they’re putting their body where their money is,” said Eric Anderson, chairman of Space Adventures Limited, a company that charters launches to orbit. “That’s impressive, frankly.”\n\nAt 8:40 a.m. Mountain time, a carrier aircraft, with the rocket plane, named V.S.S. Unity, tucked underneath, rose off the runway and headed to an altitude of about 45,000 feet. There, Unity was released, and a few moments later, its rocket motor ignited, accelerating the space plane on an upward arc.\n\nAlthough Unity had made three previous trips to space, this was its first launch that resembled a full commercial flight of the sort that Virgin Galactic has promised to offer the general public, with two pilots — David Mackay and Michael Masucci — and four more crew members including Mr. Branson.\n\nThis flight resembled a party for Virgin Galactic and the nascent space tourism business. Guests included Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX; Michelle Lujan Grisham, the governor of New Mexico; and about 60 customers who have paid for future Virgin Galactic flights.\n\nStephen Colbert of the CBS program “The Late Show” introduced segments of the webcast that included some live video from inside the spaceship. After the landing, Khalid performed a new song.\n\nWhen the fuel was spent, Unity continued to coast upward to an altitude of 53.5 miles. The four people in back unbuckled and experienced about four minutes of floating before returning to their seats.\n\nMr. Branson was accompanied in the cabin by Beth Moses, the company’s chief astronaut instructor; Colin Bennett, lead operations engineer; and Sirisha Bandla, vice president of government affairs and research operations.\n\nAs the space plane re-entered the atmosphere, the downward pull of gravity resumed. Unity glided to a landing back at the spaceport.\n\nFor well over a decade, Mr. Branson, the irreverent 70-year-old British billionaire who runs a galaxy of Virgin companies, has said he believes that commercial flights will soon begin. So did the 600 or so customers of Virgin Galactic who have paid $200,000 or more for their tickets to space and are still waiting. So did the taxpayers of New Mexico who paid $220 million to build Spaceport America, a futuristic vision in the middle of the desert, in order to attract Mr. Branson’s company.\n\nAfter years and years of unmet promises, Virgin Galactic may begin flying the first paying passengers next year after two more test flights. But with tickets costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, this experience will, for now, remain out of financial reach for most people.\n\nFounding a space exploration company was perhaps an unsurprising step for Mr. Branson, who has made a career — and a fortune estimated at $6 billion — building flashy upstart businesses that he promotes with a showman’s flair.\n\nWhat became his Virgin business empire began with a small record shop in central London in the 1970s before Mr. Branson parlayed it into Virgin Records, the home of acts like the Sex Pistols, Peter Gabriel and more. In 1984, he was a co-founder of what became Virgin Atlantic, to challenge British Airways.\n\nThe Virgin Group branched out into a mobile-phone service, a passenger railway and a line of hotels. Not all have performed flawlessly. Two of his airlines filed for insolvency during the pandemic last year, while few today remember his ventures into soft drinks, cosmetics or lingerie.\n\nThe spaceflight company was of a piece with Mr. Branson’s penchant for highflying pursuits like skydiving and hot-air ballooning. And unlike many of the Virgin Group’s businesses, Virgin Galactic has been a major focus of Mr. Branson’s.\n\nVirgin Galactic joined the New York Stock Exchange in 2019 after merging with a publicly traded investment fund, giving it a potent source of new funds to compete with deep-pocket competitors — and publicity, with Mr. Branson marking its trading debut at the exchange in one of the company’s flight suits.\n\nThe Virgin Group retains a 24 percent stake in Virgin Galactic.\n\nVirgin Galactic’s space plane is a scaled-up version of SpaceShipOne, which in 2004 captured the $10 million Ansari X Prize as the first reusable crewed spacecraft built by a nongovernmental organization to make it to space twice in two weeks.\n\nMr. Branson initially predicted commercial flights would begin by 2007. But development of the larger craft, SpaceShipTwo, stretched out.\n\nThe first SpaceShipTwo vehicle, V.S.S. Enterprise, crashed during a test flight in 2014, killing one of the pilots. Virgin Galactic was then grounded until Unity was completed a year and a half later.\n\nIn 2019, Virgin Galactic came close to another catastrophe when a seal on a rear horizontal stabilizer ruptured because a new thermal protection film had been improperly installed.\nThe mishap was revealed this year in the book “Test Gods: Virgin Galactic and the Making of a Modern Astronaut” by Nicholas Schmidle, a staff writer at The New Yorker. The book quotes Todd Ericson, then the vice president for safety and test at Virgin Galactic, saying, “I don’t know how we didn’t lose the vehicle and kill three people.”\n\nMr. Bezos’ flight is to take place about 200 miles to the southeast of Spaceport America in Van Horn, Texas, where his rocket company, Blue Origin, launches its New Shepard rocket and capsule.\n\nAlthough Blue Origin has yet to fly any people on New Shepard, 15 successful uncrewed tests of the fully automated system convinced the company it would be safe to put Mr. Bezos on the first flight with people aboard.\n\nHe will be joined by his brother, Mark, and Mary Wallace Funk, an 82-year-old pilot. In the 1960s, she was among a group of women who passed the same rigorous criteria that NASA used for selecting astronauts, but the space agency at the time had no interest in selecting women as astronauts. A fourth unnamed passenger paid $28 million in an auction for one of the seats.\n\nNeither Blue Origin nor Virgin Galactic flights go high enough or fast enough to enter orbit around Earth. Rather, these suborbital flights are more like giant roller coaster rides that allow passengers to float for a few minutes while admiring a view of Earth against the black backdrop of space.\n\nMr. Bezos’ company emphasized the rivalry with Virgin Galactic for space tourism passengers in a tweet on Friday. Blue Origin highlighted differences between its New Shepard rocket and Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo including the fact that New Shepard flies higher, above the altitude of 100 kilometers, or about 62 miles, that is often regarded as the boundary of space. However, the United States Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration set the boundary at 50 miles.\n\nThe company also noted the size of the New Shepard capsule’s windows, and called Virgin Galactic’s Unity “a high-altitude plane” in contrast to New Shepard’s rocket.\nMr. Bezos on Sunday congratulated Mr. Branson and his fellow crew on their flight. “Can’t wait to join the club!” he added in an Instagram post.\n\nBlue Origin has not yet announced a ticket price, and Virgin Galactic’s earlier quoted fare of $250,000 may rise. But on Sunday after his trip, Mr. Branson announced a sweepstakes that will give away two seats on a future Virgin Galactic flight.\n\nJoy-riding tourists will not be the only passengers on future suborbital flights. Both companies are selling flights to organizations including the Italian Air Force where scientists will conduct experiments that take advantage of the minutes of microgravity.\n\nThe era of nonprofessional astronauts regularly heading to orbit may also begin in the coming year. Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire, is essentially chartering a rocket and spacecraft from SpaceX for a three-day trip to orbit that is scheduled for September.\n\nIn December, Space Adventures has arranged for a Japanese fashion entrepreneur, Yusaku Maezawa, and Yozo Hirano, a production assistant, to launch on a Russian Soyuz rocket on a 12-day mission that will go to the International Space Station.\n\nAnother company, Axiom Space in Houston, is arranging a separate trip to the space station that will launch as soon as January.\n\nThe orbital trips are too expensive for anyone except the superwealthy — Axiom’s three customers are paying $55 million each — while suborbital flights might be affordable to those who are merely well off.\n\nBut how many people are willing to spend as much as some houses cost for a few minutes of space travel?\n\nCarissa Christensen, founder and chief executive of Bryce Space and Technology, an aerospace consulting firm, thinks there will be plenty. “Based on previous ticket sales, surveys and interviews,” she said in an email, “we see strong demand signals for multiple hundreds of passengers a year at current prices, with potential for thousands if prices drop significantly.”\n\nMr. Anderson of Space Adventures is less certain.\n\n“Per minute, it’s like a thousand times more expensive than an orbital flight,” he said. “It’s crazy.”\n\nTwo decades ago, Space Adventures did sell suborbital flights including a ticket to Ms. Funk, who goes by Wally. “Wally Funk was one of our first customers,” Mr. Anderson said. “That would have been like 1998.”\n\nThe ticket price then was $98,000.\n\nAt one point, about 200 people signed up for suborbital flights, but none of the promised suborbital rocket companies was able to get their space planes close to flight. Space Adventures returned the money to Ms. Funk and the others.\n\nNow this unproven suborbital market has whittled down to a battle of billionaires — Mr. Branson and Mr. Bezos.\n\n“If anybody can make money and make the market work for suborbital, it’s Branson and Bezos,” Mr. Anderson said. “They have the reach and the cachet.”", "id": "oibdub", "created_utc": 1626033323.0, "score": 2276, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 470, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 297, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 94, "replies": [{"body": "Can confirm.

Basically, like many things in life it's not super cut and dry, but engineers are forced to make design choices and this is what SpaceX and BO have decided to go with. \n\nWhy use methane and not hydrogen?  \nUsing methane+LOX (methalox) as propellants provides a lot of benefits over traditional hydrogen+LOX (hydralox) launch systems. Hydrogen gives a higher specific impulse (>400s), but all of the modifications required to deal with hydrogen negate that gain. Because methane requires much smaller tanks than hydrogen does, it makes the overall design much lighter. Methane is more stable in space over long periods of time vs hydrolox, and doesn't need such highly insulated cryogenic tanks like hydrolox. It also has a boiling point much closer to that of oxygen, allowing a simple bulkhead design. Having a density closer to that of oxygen allows for a simpler turbopump (hydrolox is very hard on a turbopump, see Space Shuttle main engines). Higher thrust level helps first-stage get off the ground easier. In addition, liquid hydrogen causes hydrogen embrittlement, where hydrogen atoms alloy themselves into their metal containers, and so weaken the structure. At high pressures, this can be catastrophic. Liquid hydrogen causes so many problems; Elon once eloquently said that methane \"doesn't have the pain-in-the-ass factor that hydrogen has.\"\n\n  \nWhy use methane and not RP-1(kerosene used in Falcon 9)?  \nMethane also has benefits over SpaceX's current fuel, RP-1. It can be manufactured on Mars by the Sabatier process. Methane also helps their reusability aims, as RP-1 creates a lot of carbon when it burns, coking up engines and slowing their reuse, whereas methane has no such problem. Methane burns hotter and is lighter than kerosene, so it has a slightly higher specific impulse than kerosene; an engine with the same combustion pressure and efficiency will have a 10 second higher specific impulse when using methane instead of kerosene. However, methane is a lot less dense than kerosene, which requires heavier tanks, which mostly offsets this increase in performance. Still, methane is close to being an ideal \"best of both worlds fuel\", and ticks a lot of boxes for SpaceX.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Nice summary!

{"title": "Boring times ahead", "selftext": "Lots of extreme opinions out there on direction these days. It has me thinking that the contrarian view is middle-of-the-road, not in one extreme or the other. Times are actually kinda boring and not much is happening, really.\n\nPopular Bear Case\nThink we’re topping the greatest speculative bubble in history? A Great Depression is around the corner?\n\nThe buzzwords are “debt crash”, or “the money printing machine is out of control.” The typical argument here is that total debt is unsustainable in the current economy.\n\nWell, if you take total US debt, subtract the $6 trillion in gov debt, and $5 trillion in fed debt, you’re left with $17.5 trillion in ACTUAL debt. That’s 80% of GDP. Not the 100%+ which gets tossed around. The net interest expense to GDP is lower than it was in the ‘80s, and even in the ‘80s it wasn’t a problem (linked below).\n\nA secondary reason we’re not bubbling. Prices are NOT detached from reality as many would have you believe. Bubbles are a separation of fundamentals to price. But consensus earnings on the SP500 are ~$200. Compare that to ~$4,300 on the SP500. That’s a 4.7% yield, or a 21.5 p/e. Overvalued? Perhaps. Bubble territory? Far, far from it (also linked).\n\nPopular Bull Case\nThink we’re entering the greatest-speculative-bubble-of-all-time?\n\nThe belief here is usually that lower rates, plus stimulus, are pushing asset prices to South Sea Company territory (thank you Sir Isaac Newton). That the “money printing” is so outrageous and this new money will magically get shoved into assets like real estate or stocks, ignoring the fact that excess liquidity is pulled out by the government proportionally.\n\nThe issue here is that lending restrictions are FAR TIGHTER than they were leading up to ‘08. Even if you could borrow like crazy, institutional investors have their own leverage policies. Individuals are mostly conservative - Average Joe doesn’t refinance his home and buy GME or his wife would go find a boyfriend.\n\nWe are just recently seeing measures taken by Wells Fargo where all lines of credit are deactivated. Here in Canada, stress tests for mortgages are 3x of what the listed rate is.\n\nOverall\nThis way of thinking is in-line with great investors. There is always something to worry about throughout history. All you can do is look at the options available to you and act on the ones you like.\n\n\nDebt to GDP: https://www.cbo.gov/publication/56910\nSnP earnings: https://www.yardeni.com/pub/sp500analycons.pdf", "id": "ohzwnf", "created_utc": 1625987754.0, "score": 120, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 175, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If things are improving, why hasn’t the fed raised rates?

Q2 earnings are coming up the 8/20 expiry is looking juicy. My guess is that with an extremely volatile quarter for internet money, they will blow Q1 out of the water and we'll be above $300 by the end of July.\n\n**This is what I like about the stock:**\n\n1. Their trading commissions blow traditional brokerage houses out of the water\n2. Bid/ask spreads are wider than Strahan's gap tooth\n3. Fees are fat (and scale with transaction size)\n4. They just [unveiled](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/coinbase-expands-prime-brokerage-services-to-institutional-users) an institutional \"Prime\" service on 5/25 catering to corporations looking to diversify their balance sheets\n5. In addition to the \"exchange\" business, they're now lending, offering debit/credit card products, and soon will allow you to generate passive income by \"staking\" your assets (FYI this bullet alone encompasses the entire banking industry, Visa, Mastercard, JPM, BAML, etc.)\n6. Despite the big internet money dump, the key driver to trading activity is VOLATILITY - which causes lots of buying/selling, and we definitely had that in Q2\n\nTheir total addressable market is also massive and faux asset / internet money adoption is beating the trend of the *internet* when it came out.\n\n**This is what I hate about this stock:**\n\n1. There's an existential threat of fake assets flaming out like in 2017, even though this seems less likely with each passing day as more and more institutions hold internet money on their balance sheets and incorporate it into their remittance / payments infrastructure\n2. It's weird that Sat-oshi is unknown and still holds $35B of the core asset, making him the greatest hero but also the greatest threat if he/she/they/zir were to dump\n\nSo it's not necessarily a slam dunk but I'm betting fake assets continue to evolve from meme dog coins to real utility providers in the DeFi ecosystem. Also, this an ancillary business to the trading / brokerage side of the house: which is displacing business from Fidelity, Charles Schwab, CBOE, stock exchanges, etc. as people go digital.\n\nIn my opinion, DeFi is going to completely disrupt the banking system, and CB can take a leading role in monetizing that ecosystem.
