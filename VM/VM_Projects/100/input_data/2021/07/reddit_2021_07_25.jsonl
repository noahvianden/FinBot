Steer Clear. – Market Trading Essentials](https://www.markettradingessentials.com/2021/07/the-robinhood-ipo-is-coming-soon-steer-clear/)\n\n[**Market Trading Essentials**](https://www.markettradingessentials.com/author/markettradingessentials/)  **July 23, 2021**\n\n[ Illustration by Andrea Chronopoulos ](https://preview.redd.it/9expahtdydd71.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbe09510e7215aa251e23ca723b3415ad7e43314)\n\nThere will be no velvet rope at Robinhood Markets’ big debut on Thursday. The company is offering up to a third of its shares [in its initial public offering](https://www.barrons.com/articles/robinhood-ipo-51626693536?mod=article_inline) to the Average Joes who use its app, instead of the Wall Street suits who usually get first dibs. The wisdom of those crowds may validate the $35 billion valuation that the company projected [in a prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm). But its numbers don’t.\n\nMake no mistake, Robinhood is a truly transformational company. Founders Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt took a simple premise—zero commissions—and upended the brokerage industry. Its success forced the other major brokers to eliminate commissions and opened the door to millions of new investors who had never traded before. The company estimates that nearly half of all new brokerage accounts in the U.S. between 2016 and 2021 were opened at Robinhood. That’s even more impressive given that 2020 was a record year for new accounts in the U.S., and 2021 is shaping up to be even better.\n\nRobinhood is on track to generate enough revenue this year to justify a valuation of $35 billion in theory. It reported revenue of $522 million in the first quarter, and the company estimated that it pulled in between $546 million and $574 million in the second.\n\nThomas Mason, an analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, notes that when TD Ameritrade was a fast-growing broker in 1999, it traded at more than 26 times total net revenue. That would value Robinhood, with $1.35 billion in total net revenue for the four quarters ended March 31, at $35 billion.\n\nRobinhood’s problem, however, is [the quality and sustainability of its revenue](https://www.barrons.com/articles/robinhood-ipo-meme-stocks-51625266076?mod=article_inline). At least three quarters of it comes from routing customers’ trades to trading firms that execute the trades and profit off the spread between the bid and the ask, a practice called payment for order flow. During trading frenzies, payment for order flow rises. But when trading slumps, payment for order flow slumps, too. That’s one reason most other brokers rely on other revenue streams for the majority of their revenue. Payment for order flow is also in the crosshairs of regulators, with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler [raising concerns about it](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gary-gensler-says-sec-is-focusing-on-spacs-and-retail-trading-apps-51624460483?mod=article_inline) in recent weeks.\n\n**Robinhood by the Number**\n\n**The online trading platform released second-quarter financial estimates ahead of its initial public offering next week.**\n\n[ Note: The numbers in the filing are preliminary and subject to change. ](https://preview.redd.it/4azuzj2u9dd71.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=501e13fc5f12122fba0bd5be0a4ff531301c335c)\n\nRobinhood is also highly dependent on cryptocurrency trading, another area now getting a close review by the SEC. Trading in Dogecoin, the joke cryptocurrency favored by Elon Musk, made up about 6% of the company’s revenue in the first quarter.\n\nThomas Peterffy, the chairman of Interactive Brokers, which focuses on more experienced traders, has been impressed by Robinhood and its ability to introduce new people into the market. “I’m a little bit talking my own book, because we get five to 10 customers from Robinhood every day,” he says. But he wouldn’t invest in the IPO. “I like to understand the profitability of a business,” he said. “But there is not a simple way to project Robinhood’s profits going forward, or even understand it going backward.”\n\nRobinhood could pivot to other business models—its goal is to branch out into lending and payments. But the company’s forays into new areas have not gone well so far. In fact, they have sometimes flopped in spectacular ways. In 2018, it had to withdraw its plan to offer checking and savings accounts after being called out for misleading marketing and a lack of insurance, and later backtracked on plans to offer trading in the U.K. and to obtain a bank charter. *Barron’s* has followed Robinhood’s twists and turns, [including a cover story last August](https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-is-robinhood-apps-next-act-its-already-mastered-the-stock-market-game-51597451777?mod=article_inline).\n\nThere has been a boom in new IPOs this year, which has created a lot of opportunities for investors. These opportunities also come with great risk. Here’s what you need to know\n\nThe company says in its prospectus that its customers “already trust us with their hard-earned cash and assets,” so they will likely trust it to take care of their other needs as they grow their wealth. The company did not reveal just how much of that hard-earned money the typical customer has put in her account, but the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said in an enforcement letter that the median Robinhood customer had $240 in her account as of February.\n\nMany investors seem to consider Robinhood their “play-money account,” says Hugh Tallents, senior partner at management consultancy cg42, which surveyed more than 1,000 account-holders at various brokers about their habits this year. To justify the valuation, “customers will have to change their financial behavior to integrate a lot of their financial life with a company that has been mired in scandal for a long time. I just don’t see that being likely,” Tallents says.\n\nNearly every financial technology company is now focused on cross-selling customers on multiple services. [Square](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SQ) (SQ), Stash, [PayPal](https://www.barrons.com/quote/PYPL) (PYPL), [SoFi Technologies ](https://www.barrons.com/quote/SOFI)(SOFI) and more all want a bigger piece of your financial life. And some are able to make better first impressions. SoFi is known for refinancing student loans, for instance.\n\nGetting from a student loan to a mortgage is “a bit of a layup,” Tallents says. “It’s far harder to envisage a world where people take a quite basic tool, which Robinhood is by design, and put a lot of their debt-based products or their savings accounts and integrate those things together.”\n\n**Write to** Avi Salzman at [avi.salzman@barrons.com](mailto:avi.salzman@barrons.com)", "id": "orcfdd", "created_utc": 1627222849.0, "score": 645, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 138, "comments": [{"body": "Robinhood - \"...we temporarily prevented our customers from purchasing certain specified securities, including GameStop Corp. and...

{"title": "SBUX massive earnings beat not priced in", "selftext": "You may know me as the shitpost king and/or SPY $440 permabull who timed the recent Monday drop almost perfectly by buying puts the prior Thursday/Friday (can't remember which day).\n\nAfter pretty much being glued to SPY for the last few weeks, I was feeling fatigued and went back to the oldest game in the book, buying risky calls going into an earnings print.\n\nI am from the school of Peter Lynch - buy what you know.  After almost a year of staying at home and brewing my own coffee, I went to Starbucks for the first time in a long time (back in June) and found myself going back again and again.  The wait time was much shorter than I remember and every morning it was quite packed.  In true WSB fashion, I only got interested in SBUX after a massive move of 9.5% in a matter of 5 trading days on the back of a big CMG earnings print.\n\nI debated writing this because I bought SBUX $130c 7/30 as a complete yolo and then found myself thinking about this more and more and realizing that the street may have sized this up wrong.  Is this confirmation bias for myself - maybe??\n\n# Change in average ticket / Massive earnings beat\n\nIn Q2 2021, comparable store sales were up 9% quarter over quarter (Q2 2020).  Easy comps right?  Well, dig a little deeper and we see there was 10% DROP in transactions, but a 22% INCREASE in average ticket (total receipt/sale).  You might think this is some COVID anomaly, but increasing average ticket has been on a positive trend (increased 5% Q2 2020 over Q2 2019).  In the earnings, Starbucks attributed it to more group orders and the high / record 'food attach' (people buying overpriced sandwiches with their coffees).\n\nEnter Mad Money interview, June 24, 2021 ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s6XIujZgzg)).  **The CEO told Jim Cramer that the volume of transactions has hit an all time record and food attach remains high** (at a record? too lazy to listen to it for a 3rd time).\n\nSo to estimate this quarter's (Q3) EPS, I wanted to see what a normalized EPS would have been for Q2 2021 **if the volume of the transactions were flat vs Q2 2019**.\n\n[Grossed up Q2 2021 EPS assuming no change in transactions since 2019 would have been $0.67](https://preview.redd.it/u9palqyln9d71.png?width=1716&format=png&auto=webp&s=302c2b9e1273aafb42335388e715d57446ba91bf)\n\nSo 2021 vs 2019 should have seen a 24% increase in EPS all other things equal (obviously too hard to dissect the financial statements further than this oversimplification).\n\n**What was Q3 2019 EPS?  $1.13.  Grossed up by 24%?**  **$1.40!!**\n\n**Average Q3 2021 street estimate (Yahoo Finance)?  $0.77**\n\nUsually, SBUX beats by about 10-20 cents.\n\n# Chipotle Comparison\n\nThere has been a lot of chatter about SBUX rallying on CMG earnings and earnings are priced in.  I am not sure about this.  CMG is up 38% YTD and SBUX is only up 22%.  If you look at the SBUX chart, it hit $118 in April, then fell thru May and consolidated.  I think there is still a little left here for a move up - but honestly I have no idea and we know price action is fake basically all the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**: Higher average ticket price not priced in.  SBUX $130c 7/30 for a move up.\n\nNOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.  THIS COULD BE TOTALLY DUMB.  I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO.  BUY PUTS IF YOU MUST.\n\nEdit: I think the average ticket thesis is the biggest factor, but there are some other tailwinds for this quarter that I thought were encouraging (supporting revenue trend)\n\nI think I saw drive thru revenue coming in anywhere between 25-35 pct of revenue. \n\nGasoline demand has been up all quarter.

{"title": "Chinese Education Stock Idea - EDU (Time to Long is NOW!)", "selftext": "Hey guys, apologies for this lengthy post. I know it's not well structured, I'm trying to delete a lot of  the less useful stuff to get to the point with the latest news as they come.\n\nJoin: [https://www.reddit.com/r/EDU\\_stock/new/](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDU_stock/new/) for the latest updates! \n\n===\n\nWe all know Chinese education stocks took a beating last Friday on rumor of non profit conversion.\n\nNow the official regulation is out: [http://m.news.cctv.com/2021/07/24/ARTITWxyXnCQlhkq7XY0d21j210724.shtml](http://m.news.cctv.com/2021/07/24/ARTITWxyXnCQlhkq7XY0d21j210724.shtml)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor New Oriental Education, my idea is BUY at the current price of $3, intrinsic value is about $4-5 for a 33% to 66% return in 3-6 months.\n\n(Apologies that I cannot reply directly, quite a few people have messaged me on the upside being low. Obviously we want to maximize the probability of price going up, AND maximize the amt that's the price will going up by. For such as short period of 3 months, I think the probability of getting a 33%-66% return is very high with a 90%+ probability, and personally, I believe this is very attractive risk/return profile because that's the risk/reward ratio I personally look for. Some people have a more aggressive view and target stocks that have a much higher return amt but lower probability, like some have pointed out 50/50, up to $8+ or $0. As I do more work, I believe the key value of this post is to narrow down that 50/50 probability split with price of $8 or $0, to a 90/10 probability split of $5/$3. The goal is to assess short term probability of it going up, I hope my post at least got that pt across. While $2 increase may seem low to some, at high enough probability over a short enough time frame...if my thesis is to be believed, then simply buy calls to boost returns - my pt is, at a high enough certainty both on probability and timing, there's ways to structure the investment financially to lever up the returns.)\n\nRationale:\n\nThe new regulation mentions a few things that are unfavorable to EDU:\n\n1. K9 core (Chinese, Math, Sciences etc) will be not for profit. Rolling out in major cities like Beijing and gradually rolled out across the country, with fees to be set by the government. For EDU, the profit margin of these will be 0.\n2. No weekend/holiday tutoring of any kind. Online tutoring is to be restricted in 30 min intervals.\n3. No tutoring on topics that's too advanced for the student, meaning a grade 6 student cannot do k11 materials.\n4. No new tutoring companies can raise capital on the stock market via IPO\n5. Existing public tutoring companies like EDU cannot acquire other tutoring companies.\n6. Foreign capital cannot acquire chinese tutoring companies through M&A, VIEs, etc...This applies both in the context of a controlling interest AND general share interest.\n\nThe question is, EDU is trading at $3/share. Ignoring #6 above, what is the intrinsic value if EDU spins out the K9 core piece of business into a separate entity that's non profit. What's the remaining worth?\n\nTo assess this, I took EDU's FY2020 revenue breakdown to see how much revenue is left, then applied an EBITDA multiple, finally backed out the net debt to get the per share price:\n\nRevenue Breakdown:\n\nOverseas Test Prep (12% pre, 12% post, no impact)\n\nU-CAN Secondary School (45% pre, 22.25% post, cut by half since this includes k7 to k12, assume k7 to k9 is non profit at a 50/50 split. In reality, this mix is overweight k10-k12 since tutoring mostly done by highschool students for the university exam, this is a conservative assumption on my part, you also have to factor in no holiday, no summer and winter tutoring. But this may lead to more book sales, videos that kids can watch themselves etc...the $ is there to be made if not from direct tutoring, then by other means some $ will flow into EDU.)\n\nPOP Kids (24% pre, 0% post, assume all not for profit. Music and Sports courses are likely able to keep but assume not material)\n\nOnline (4% pre,  1% post, assume online restrictions will have significant impact)\n\nOther courses (5% pre, 5% post, no impact)\n\nBooks (10% pre, 10% post)\n\nOverall, revenue reduced by about 50%.\n\nValuation: Let's use the 2020 annual revenue of $3.5 billion USD as a rough estimate. Reducing by half is 1.75BN x 12.5% EBITDA margin (compression from historical 15%, again to add conservatism about future pricing pressure even on the for profit piece) is about $225 million. At a 10x multiple (implying a 5% annual growth rate at 15% WACC) gives us 2.2BN enterprise value.\n\nCurrent total debt is 2 billion, cash is 6 billion. We have 4 billion excess cash\n\nShare count is 1714 million.\n\nPer share value of the cash only is about 2.4/share.\n\nPer share value of the business is 1.3/share.\n\nImplied value is about $3.7/share. Oversold it seems.\n\nNote this assumes immediate change. In reality, new rules are being gradually rolled out, first in major cities. Which means there's still leftover revenues to be made from now to when it's fully implemented. That might be an additional 0.25/0.5 cents a share, getting us well within the $4-5 range (apparently EDU will have as much time as needed to restructure per latest update [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/china-to-still-allow-ipos-in-the-us-securities-regulator-csrc-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/china-to-still-allow-ipos-in-the-us-securities-regulator-csrc-says.html)).\n\n\\[Also, THIS REDUCTION MATH IS FLAWED, I REALIZED, SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM TO SEE AN UPDATE - basically we cannot just say the k-9 will be 0, since now capacity will be freed up to tutor more highschool students at reduced prices, overall impact on profits is not half since volume will likely increase for k10-k12\\]\n\nNow onto the last piece: Foreign capital cannot acquire chinese entities.  Here is the quote \"外资不得通过兼并收购、受托经营、加盟连锁、利用可变利益实体等方式控股或参股学科类培训机构。已违规的，要进行清理整治。\"\n\nGoogle translate: \"Foreign capital may not control or participate in academic training institutions through mergers and acquisitions, entrusted operations, franchise chains, and the use of variable interest entities. Those who have violated regulations shall be cleaned up and rectified.\"\n\nBetter translation: Foreign capital cannot gain controlling/non-controlling interest in tutoring companies through the four ways outlined (and other ways as applicable but the pt is cannot control & participate via share ownership).\n\nThis entire sentence is to limit control of foreign capital on chinese tutoring companies.  But the fact the chinese government explicitly listed those 4 ways to gain controlling interest (控股) or participate via stock ownership (参股)  ties two points together: First, the four ways explicitly listed are all ways to DIRECTLY inject capital into china, it means giving money to the tutoring company to use to grow. Second, the overall point of that paragraph is to limit the flow of foreign capital into china and halt the growth of tutoring companies (restrict supply), which when combined with no weekend/holiday tutoring, will restrict demand -> free up time for kids.\n\nIn addition, major institutions like Singapore Government's investment fund, Blackrock, JP Morgan, all institutional investors own 85% of total stock. With a significant number being foreign firms. These firms are not currently managing EDU and exert no influence, forcing them to sell or delist the stock would severely restrict all future capital investment into china AND wouldn't really matter in the context of controlling tutor companies in china at this time, since it is done retroactively. Therefore I do not believe existing shareholders of EDU will be directly impacted through a delisting or what not. It matter more if a foreign firm already has control and if a foreign firm is thinking of controlling in the future (currently in the middle of an acquisition negotiation process for example). It's helpful none of the major tutor companies are foreign owned currently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore I see the foreign capital point as more of restricting FUTURE capital investment into china to stem the capital fueled growth and less so to penalize existing shareholders.\n\nTo conclude, it is likely EDU will revert to a conservative intrinsic value of $4-$5 dollars a share in the near term (3-6 months). Longer term, depends on if K10-K12 can be maintained, and if the non profit services will drive the for profit k10-12 business if so, that will drive future growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:  Basically, buy at $3, sell at $4-5 (I personally believe upside is higher but that require a 1 year hold period or more). If the company liquidates today and give you its cash it's worth $2.4/share excluding buildings etc and after paying off debt. This ignores a business with 1 billion enterprise value (0 debt, since that was already netted against cash to get to the $2.4/share) from future operations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Further note on the no foreign ownership part. The full paragraph is as follows: \" 13.坚持从严审批机构。各地不再审批新的面向义务教育阶段学生的学科类校外培训机构，现有学科类培训机构统一登记为非营利性机构。对原备案的线上学科类培训机构，改为审批制。各省（自治区、直辖市）要对已备案的线上学科类培训机构全面排查，并按标准重新办理审批手续。未通过审批的，取消原有备案登记和互联网信息服务业务经营许可证（ICP）。对非学科类培训机构，各地要区分体育、文化艺术、科技等类别，明确相应主管部门，分类制定标准、严格审批。依法依规严肃查处不具备相应资质条件、未经审批多址开展培训的校外培训机构。学科类培训机构一律不得上市融资，严禁资本化运作；上市公司不得通过股票市场融资投资学科类培训机构，不得通过发行股份或支付现金等方式购买学科类培训机构资产；**外资不得通过兼并收购、受托经营、加盟连锁、利用可变利益实体等方式控股或参股学科类培训机构**。已违规的，要进行清理整治。 \"\n\nBolded section is the part I quoted earlier. If we take the words \"curriculum-based tutoring institutions\" it is  \"**学科类培训机构\"**. This is what confused a lot of readers, myself included since that sentence alone seem to mean no foreign ownership in tutoring companies that teach school curriculum.\n\nBut if we look at the start of the paragraph, it defines \"**学科类培训机构**\" as institutions tutoring for compulsory education, meaning k-9. This earlier sentence defines it for us: \"各地不再审批新的面向义务教育阶段学生的学科类校外培训机构，现有**学科类培训机构**统一登记为非营利性机构。\" It means: no more approvals for tutoring companies that serve compulsory education segment (i.e. k-9), existing tutoring institutions (bolded in that sentence) will become non for profit. Therefore, within the same paragraph, the definition of \"**学科类培训机构**\" is the same, meaning foreign capital cannot own tuition services that serves the compulsory education segment. If EDU strips out k-9 related services, the rest should be allowed foreign ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, unfortunately I cannot respond directly since I don't have 100 karma. This is my first DD post after all. To address other questions on the source of my revenue breakdown. Management quarterly press release contains data for specific segments. An example: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-oriental-announces-results-for-the-third-fiscal-quarter-ended-february-28-2021-301272286.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-oriental-announces-results-for-the-third-fiscal-quarter-ended-february-28-2021-301272286.html)\n\nYou also need management call transcripts. What I did was to go through past press releases, transcripts of management calls and looked at analyst reports (historical data only, since forward looking is all opinion) to validate the reasonability of my revenue breakdown.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n===\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: official release from EDU on the restrictions: [https://www.stonkmoon.com/news/EDU/aa602be4ce5e60c32b93ae35c373f162](https://www.stonkmoon.com/news/EDU/aa602be4ce5e60c32b93ae35c373f162)\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Opinion \\[That Chinese link at the very start of the post\\] contains high-level policy directives about requirements and restrictions related to after-school tutoring services, including:\n\n(i) institutions providing after-school tutoring services on academic subjects in China's compulsory education system, or Academic AST Institutions \\[**学科类培训机构** per above\\], need to be registered as non-profit, no approval will be granted to new Academic AST Institutions, and an approval mechanism will be adopted for online Academic AST Institutions;\n\n(ii) foreign ownership in Academic AST Institutions is prohibited, including through contractual arrangements, and companies with existing foreign ownership need to rectify the situation;\n\n(iii) listed companies are prohibited from raising capital to invest in businesses that teach academic subjects in compulsory education;\n\n(iv) Academic AST Institutions are prohibited from providing tutoring services on academic subjects in compulsory education during public holidays, weekends and school breaks; and\n\n(v) Academic AST Institutions must follow the fee standards to be established by relevant authorities.\n\nThe Opinion also provides that institutions providing after-school tutoring services on academic subjects in high schools (which do not fall within China's compulsory education system) shall take into consideration the Opinion when conducting activities.\n\nEDU did a much better job at it than I did. Hope this clears it up for everyone, and again, compulsory education in China is k-9.\n\n===\n\nEdit: I think a lot of people missed this. The importance of EDU's official response is that they cleared up what the foreign ownership restriction relates to: it is for Academic AST Institutions defined as China's compulsory education (k-9) system. Meaning the rest, K10-K12 and areas like books, etc, can still be owned by foreigners AND be allowed for IPO, mergers, acquisitions etc...none of those apply to the non core, non k-9 aspects of EDU's business.\n\n===\n\nUpdate: Another note on the shorter hours. In a market where all competitors cannot tutor during holidays/weekends etc, the supply remains the same, if the market has the appetite to pay for the services, pricing won't be impacted as much. For example, if EDU charged $100 before for a course, TAL charged $95. Now both TAL and EDU cannot tutor as often, it's still EDU and TAL that's doing the tutoring (for example) with the same amount of students, IF price competition does not happen, there's no reason why EDU nor TAL should decrease their price. Tutoring time went down, but not like the consumer can go to another tutor who offers longer hours, since every tutor is restricted.\n\nBut price competition is a separate topic. See below:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSaw Goldman's target of 3.6/share and their model. What GS, and my own flaw is assuming EDU will lose the not for profit revenue. That is true, but they can now have capacity to sell more to K10-K12 at reduced prices (hence get more volume at lower price/student). While margins are lower, the high school enrollment count will increase, hence the overall hit to profitability is not nearly as bad has 1/2.\n\nThink about it this way: before, EDU had 100 students, 50 k-9, 50 k-12. Each student pays EDU $1. EDU made margin of 15%, making a total of $15 for the 100 students. Now, EDU lowers the price for each student by 1/3, making only 10% margin per student. 100 students are now all highschool. Overall profit is 100 x 10% = $10. The actual hit to profitability is only $5, not half of the old $15.\n\nLong-term impact: now it will become a pricing war between the large players, a race to the bottom to offer much cheaper tutoring for non k-9 students and get the volume. BUT they cannot fund raise (near-term even if it's for k10-12, since gov't don't want them to grow via fundraising). So it'll be an interesting dynamic. EDU historically had positive margins, the one education company with the most cash and least debt, so there's room for EDU to decrease their price and take a hit to margin. Especially now is the perfect time to do so, and price TAL and other competitors out of the K10-k12 market, since TAL/others have less cash, and already lost money before, unless they can cut their expenses to match EDU's margins, they will have to deal with EDU who may now significant cut pricing to increase volume and take TAL/Others market share.\n\nLet's look at the numbers:\n\nEnrollment for EDU: middle and high school (7 million)\n\nEnrollment for TAL: 4.6 million or roughly 5 million\n\nGOTU: 5 million.\n\nTotal capacity by student count is about 7 + 5 + 5 million. This is about 17 million of students.\n\nIf we look at the total student count in 2019 ([https://www.statista.com/statistics/227024/number-of-students-at-high-schools-in-china/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/227024/number-of-students-at-high-schools-in-china/))\n\nTotal student count for k-7 to k-12 (7, 8, 9, is junior high, 10, 11, 12 is senior high) is 72.4 million split as 48.27 junior vs 24.14 senior in millions.\n\nLooking at the data, I think my earlier example about 100 highschool students is probably too optimistic. That 72.4 million is for all of China, but tutor companies are more in demand in first tier and second tier cities (where ppl are richer). Plus government restricts expansion and new licenses (if we assume licenses are given out for each teaching center in a city, this means EDU/TAL etc will have a harder time to expand to new cities now). So the total addressable market (or TAM) for highschool students only is (using urban/rural pop split as a proxy - [https://www.statista.com/statistics/278566/urban-and-rural-population-of-china/#:\\~:text=According%20to%20the%20Seventh%20National,million%20in%20rural%20in%202020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278566/urban-and-rural-population-of-china/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Seventh%20National,million%20in%20rural%20in%202020).) 64% urban population x 24.14 million senior high = 15 million.\n\nIf they don't expand to rural China, for urban highschool students there's excess capacity now, this will drive pricing pressure for courses offered.\n\nAverage selling price for K7 to k12:\n\nEDU: about 2k RMB per student (offline), Gross and EBITDA margin of company: 55% and 13-15%\n\nTAL: 3.3k RMB per student (offline), Gross and EBITDA margin of company: 55% and 8%\n\nGOTU: 1.5k RMB per student, Gross and EBITDA margin of company: 74% and negative -20%\n\nTeachers related costs go into gross margin, fixed costs like renting learning centers go into after the gross margin and makes your EBITDA margin lower.\n\nSo now that we know there likely isn't enough capacity for everyone, if pricing war happens, EDU has the most room to move, they can lower their prices by probably 5% and still break even (pricing decrease and EBITDA margin decrease is not 1 to 1, for every 1% of revenue you lose, after paying fixed costs like rent that won't go down as much, you lose more than 1% in EBITDA margin, so for EDU the breakeven pt for revenue decrease is probably around 5%, since I excluded the KIDS segment from EDU's capacity, losing that will lower their margins somewhat. I know we don't have the true margin for each segment of the revenue, this assumes every segment in EDU makes the same 13-15% EBITDA margin). The same 5% decrease cannot be said for TAL and GOTU (TAL, after stripping out k-9, their EBITDA margin is likely much lower than 8%, GOTU is negative so it's a moot pt)\n\nWhat I'm saying is: the total market size is barely enough to account for the excess freed capacity of the 3 players. They'll have to lower prices to get more volume. How much that counteracts the loss of k9 revenues is debatable, but EDU is the best positioned out of the 3.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore: if you want to hedge your bets, the long/short play is probably long EDU and short GOTU. But I prefer to have all of the upside at EDU's current price so I personally went 100% EDU long via a mix of calls and stocks.\n\n===\n\nUpdate: [https://vnexplorer.net/chinas-state-media-moves-to-reassure-rattled-investors-after-rout-wiped-us574-billion-off-stock-market-er2021314452.html](https://vnexplorer.net/chinas-state-media-moves-to-reassure-rattled-investors-after-rout-wiped-us574-billion-off-stock-market-er2021314452.html)\n\nI wasn't able to find the original article on: [http://www.cs.com.cn/](http://www.cs.com.cn/) (the one telling people to buy the dip). If anyone can find the link to the original please paste via response below.\n\nBut if true. The window to buy is probably closing fast. Chinese government usually signals in subtle ways: First, in the official regulation that restricted foreign ownership for k-9, it ended that paragraph with \"you figure out how to comply yourselves\", not directly taking ownership away, not banning k-12, this enables a spinout to take place and gives \"wiggle room\". Second, official regulation was deliberately vague on high school and excluded high school (which is the most intense period of tutoring) from the strictest interpretation of China's new rules. Now the state-run newspaper is telling people to basically view this as a buying opportunity for Chinese stocks in general.\n\nSome pundits may not trust the Chinese government, but so far it has been logical steps from China's government's perspective. 1. Regulate tutoring more as the cost has gone out of control (I agree, EDU's stock price leading up to Feb 2021 is an indication) 2. Timing makes sense cause of the 3 child policy that got announced recently 3. Upcoming IPOs on the education space are in progress (the regulation halts that immediately, investors in the pre-IPO ones are likely the most impacted AFTER EDU's share bounce back of course).\n\nNow, with the massive wipe in value in China's stock market since entire sectors are down, not only EDU obviously (the stock market is where a significant number of Chinese citizens invest their savings btw, they don't have a social benefit system as well as Canada or Europe, so that's literally retirement money). So it's in gov't best interest now to make sure it doesn't go out of control for ALL Chinese stocks.\n\nForecasting timing of moves is the hardest part. Much harder than the intrinsic value calc, business model potential changes etc. After all, the famous economist John Maynard Keynes once said, “the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\"\n\n===\n\nUpdate: I wanted to elaborate a bit more on why China is doing what it's doing. We know birth rates are declining and tuition schools are out of control as of late in China. What the regulation is actually doing is to basically force the industry to consolidate (not rocket science I know). But under normal circumstances usually industries consolidate when market becomes saturated. Given China's student population AND the fact government want 3 kids now, clearly market will grow (or so government hopes). But it also means the tutor industry will grow even more out of control (especially with foreign capital, making money off teaching Chinese kids). How to control the cost aspect (encourage more births), but also control this potentially overheating sector. Some may say it's freedom of thought etc, but I think the more important issue is when one sector overheats (grows so big so fast), it'll suck in more capital and have a very real influence on the overall Chinese capital markets given the size of the industry.  If Chinese government doesn't step in now, the education sector could grow to much larger and will sway the overall Chinese market, that's worrying as well.\n\nIt's actually very smart to simply announce that government is banning tutoring (some elements) AND banning foreign capital (some elements). Capital markets, despite what efficient market hypothesis will tell you, is actually not super smart cause it's still a population of people. Near term everyone will shun education sector in China. No more capital AND government saying they'll subsidize public schools to tutor as well means what? Price competition. Chinese government is using capitalism to work for its own goals of lowering tutoring costs. The Chinese government doesn't have to actually pay any $ to subsidize public schools, way before that happens, due to the efficiency of the capitalist sytem, tutoring companies like EDU/TAL/etc will start to drop prices themselves, saving Chinese gov't having to spend any $ to subsidize public schools to build up their own programs to compete against EDU/TAL/etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVery soon, public tutoring companies won't be able to make a profit cause of price competition amongst themselves, and a few will be left WITH CHEAP COURSES. If at that point the \"survivors\" dare to raise price, it's very easy to control, since foreign capital is gone. Capital within China is easily controlled.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is the cost of doing this from the Chinese govern't perspective: short term stock market goes down, but it may basically stop education industry growth for a very, very long time, since after the \"winner\" comes up on top, there's a monopoly basically, no more new entrants etc. and easy to control. Near-term pain for Chinese stock market, for long term stability and avoid overheat in the education sector. During which China is free to boost population growth via birth rates or whatever, with the possibility of education sector overheating out of the equation.\n\nAll that's needed is a simple announcement of \"k-9 will be not for profit (and ban foreign ownership :P)\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean IF EDU wins in the end? 1. EDU will become more like an \"infrastructure\" investment with margins fixed by the government, essentially working as an extension of the chinese public school system. 2. There'll still be a demand for premium tutors, cause the underlying chinese economy is capitalist, but these premium services will be private and will be super careful to go under the radar, not grow too big or the same investor own like 100 different private companies across all regions in china, so it appears each \"premium\" tutoring company is still small as to not attract attention.\n\nBack to EDU, worst case, long-term it's a publicly traded Chinese \"utilities-like\" company. To be fair those trade at decent multiples due to stability of revenues etc. So essentially China is IPO'ing a part of the public education system through this change (i.e. bringing in EDU/TAL etc into the public education system but publically traded).\n\n===\n\nUpdate: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/china-to-still-allow-ipos-in-the-us-securities-regulator-csrc-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/29/china-to-still-allow-ipos-in-the-us-securities-regulator-csrc-says.html)\n\n\" However, the securities commission’s Fang said the policy was intended to reduce the burden on parents — not shut off foreign investment — and the education companies will have as much time as needed to restructure, according to the source. \"\n\nGood to hear. EDU might go back up to $6-$8 by year end.\n\n===\n\nUpdate August 3rd, 2021: I know the stock has been relatively \"stable\" as of late. No large movements (if you are a long-term investor, current movements are not \"large\" by any means). Unfortunately, I cannot say that I would know, definitively, when the pop will come, nor do I have any real data to share. But, noticed [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3143557/china-names-top-computer-scientist-head-education-ministry](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3143557/china-names-top-computer-scientist-head-education-ministry) head of education got replaced August 2nd, slight \"tweaks\" to policy may come, but most importantly, the key piece of info I'm waiting on is EDU's delayed management call (whenever that may be).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n===\n\nUpdate August 4th 2021: It seems EDU has started setting up separate schools for k-9 segment. ([https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2021-08-04/doc-ikqcfncc0911049.shtml](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/2021-08-04/doc-ikqcfncc0911049.shtml)) Perhaps it may hint as to how EDU will pivot during mgmt call (which is currently delayed TBD)\n\n===\n\nStill do not believe EDU will get delisted at all, CEO is well known in China, demand for EDU's services won't be satisfied near term (public schools simply do not have capacity), and in addition to cash value, the brand of EDU is worth quite a bit as well. Anyways, I do not want to get into too much of the assumptions/hearsay, but I wanted to reaffirm my conviction in this play. If you are still in this, then let's ride it out together.

{"title": "My Top-Secret Stock Options Gambling Strategy (51% of the time, it works every time) (I am not a financial advisor)", "selftext": "Gather around you filthy degenerates, and hear me divulge a strategy that even Michael Burry would give his good eye for. Ever since I was a wee lad, I sought the quickest and easiest way to riches. I scoffed at Tim Ferris and his \"4-Hour Work Week\", \"He'll have my attention once he's written \"The 4-Hour Work Year\"\" I would jeer. My disdain was without prejudice, I thumbed my nose at even the blue-collar lotto players at our local gas station, enduring the stench of week old hot-dogs and dirty mop water was too great an ordeal for even a guaranteed chance at riches.\n\nAs the years went by my young mind began to cower under the looming shadow of a cursed future shuffling papers and hoping my 401k kept ahead of inflation, that was until I discovered an app that changed my path forever. Robin Hood might have once been an English legend of yore, but to me he was a glowing green icon on my cracked iPhone screen, an app whose feathered logo pulled me in with a level of seduction every harlot from the East Coast to the West would kill for. With less effort than it took to give my successful CPA brother the bird, I was able to purchase options in such prestigious firms as the National Bank of Greece and Dryships Inc. The thrill of a lotto ticket and the awe of watching a magician make my college tuition disappear...all in one app, I was hooked. \n\nEventually, the thrill and awe began to feel more like a novelty, and the rumblings of my belly and holes in my underwear began to scream \"priorities\". I decided to take a step back and try my hand at being the respectable son my parents had always wanted. I graduated college, got my masters, and landed a 9-5 job that most liberal arts majors would drag their gonads thru shattered glass for. Still, I was empty. The uncapped profit horizons and bellowing margin call notifications still pulled at my heart, and as I ran in the darkness of my dreaded white-collar maze, I saw a familiar green glow. \n\nAfter re-downloading the app, I decided to study the markets more meticulously. I would learn all about a stock's technicals and fundamentals I told myself. I would discover the next great bubble and someday have Christian Bale portray me in my inevitable biographical blockbuster. Those goals were soon crushed however. I was no Burry or Buffet, I was a gambler who for whatever reason had a knack for turning dimes into dollars short-term, but would lose my house when the numbers and timeline got too big. \n\nI needed a strategy. \n\nEventually, this is the \"strategy\" I settled on, and with fortune thus far on my side, from getting in early on $AMC to making a few years salary from $MRNA (see my thread from last month: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8pahs/why\\_is\\_no\\_one\\_talking\\_about\\_mrna/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8pahs/why_is_no_one_talking_about_mrna/?sort=new)), I plan to stick with it until my inbox fills up with overdraft protections notices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[PART 1: Ticker Picking\\]\n\n*1 - Pick tickers that have at least a couple of weeks of forward momentum. You're not Benjamin Graham, you're a starving fish hoping the river's current takes you to more fertile waters and not the local sewage plant.*\n\n*2 - Pick options that are JUST outside of the money but have at least two months before expiration. Nobody has time to learn what the hell theta is, so just buy the contract that will at least hold enough value to buy you a pizza from Little Caesar's if things go south in a hurry.* \n\n*3 - Don't hold onto an option any closer than a week before expiration. Remember, worst case, pizza money.* \n\n*4 - Get religious. You'll be doing a LOT of praying.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[PART 2: Bankroll Management\\]\n\n*1  - Define your initial bankroll.* \n\n*2 - Define winning.* \n\n*3 - Cash out when you win.* \n\n*4 - Start over with your initial bankroll + 10% of winnings.*\n\n*So  if you decide that 2.5k a year of your disposable income is gambling money that's your bankroll. Define winning as something like \"10x my  bankroll or 6 months of any profit.\" Whenever  you win, cash out, bump your bankroll slightly and start again. If you  find yourself at the start of a new year and you still have your initial  bankroll, you can add the 2.5k designated for the new year to your  bankroll whenever you win and are about to start over - or you can hold  it in reserve in case of a total loss (what I would recommend) - but don't ever just lump a New Years bankroll into a given \"game\" while its  in progress.* \n\nGood luck, and this is not financial advice.", "id": "or7qoy", "created_utc": 1627201004.0, "score": 450, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|29|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is all I ever hoped a post would be.", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "You're not Benjamin Graham", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Who dat?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "This comment has been edited to protest Reddit's decision to shut down all third party apps.

The third party charging network makes it impossible to travel in a very large majority of the country. To charge while traveling you need at least chargers that are rated at minimum 50kw/hour but 150+ is preferable. If you look at Ford's attempt by partnering with Electrify America, buying a MachE today and living on the east coast means you cannot drive much further south than DC as the only chargers south of DC are in North Carolina, Miami and Texas. It doesn't matter if their vehicle is better if people cannot refuel after the 500 mile battery. That makes it limited to an in-city vehicle only, which is a limitation few people will accept seeing as how gas stations are so abundant you don't need to plan where to stop to refuel with gasoline vehicles whereas with EVs that's still necessary. Until the third party network is to the level where Tesla's charging network is today every vehicle manufacturer is going to struggle with gaining critical mass and that looks to be at least 3-5 years out minimum.\n\nAlso it's important to point out, in summer heat or winter cold, all batteries show reduced range. Plus, with an EV you don't want to drive it to 0 miles range like you might do with a gas vehicle since there's such limited availability in charging stations, even with a Tesla which has the best network. I typically like to plan to hit the charger at 15-20% remaining in case the car's projection is off. When charging it also takes the longest to charge the last 20% of the battery, at least with a Tesla (I suspect this is for safety of the battery), that leaves only 60% of the battery to use while traveling.

{"title": "How government created the 08 market crash and is creating the one we’ll see in 2022", "selftext": "Behind every housing boom for the past 30 years is the government through the Federal Housing Administration using its government sponsored entities known as “GSE” (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Housing and Urban Development) to expand the ability for middle and lower income borrowers to be able to buy mortgages that they wouldn’t be able to buy otherwise. This creates artificial demand as more potential buyers are placed into the market which as a result raises prices. \n\nThe increased prices result in a higher valuation of properties meaning the more people pay for their mortgage on each property, and the more people that own homes that are government sponsored the more potential revenue is created. \n\nEver notice how these housing booms always happen shortly after times of excess government spending? This is a good portion of how they pay for it. Mortgage debt is over 10 trillion today making it our largest debt market. The FHA insures 55% plus of that debt making it the worlds largest mortgage insurer. In addition, Fannie/Freddie service 55%+ of those loans collecting the interest on those mortgages. The more your home is worth the bigger your mortgage is and the more interest Fannie/Freddie make and the more people owning homes only increases exponentially more. FHA benefits through hiked mortgage insurance premiums and also has a 1.75% upfront mortgage premium for the total value of each loan. \n\nhttps://www.rocketmortgage.com/learn/fha-mortgage-insurance-premium\n\n\nNow you might ask how exactly does government cause housing prices to skyrocket? \n\nWell first the government created the FHA in 1934 (a year after we went off the gold standard if that tells you anything) to offer federally backed insurance for home mortgages made by FHA approved lenders.FHA insurance protected approved lenders against losses on the mortgages they originated and gave those lenders confidence to lend to riskier borrowers since it was insured removing their risk. FHA insurance gave lenders added security and expanded the pool of potential homebuyers for whom lenders were willing to underwrite loans.FHA financed its operations through insurance premiums charged to borrowers and interest earned on its reserves.The FHA created the GSEs mentioned above for the sake of carrying this out. \n\n“The FHA, or Federal Housing Administration, provides mortgage insurance on loans made by FHA-approved lenders. FHA insures these loans on single family and multi-family homes in the United States and its territories. It is the largest insurer of residential mortgages in the world, insuring tens of millions of properties since 1934 when it was created.”\n\nhttps://www.fha.com/fha_loan_requirements \n\n“Since the early 1990s, the government has been attempting to expand home ownership in full disregard of the prudent lending principles that had previously governed the U.S. mortgage market. Now the motives of the GSEs fall into place. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were subject to \"affordable housing\" regulations, issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which required them to buy mortgages made to home buyers who were at or below the median income. This quota began at 30% of all purchases in the early 1990s, and was gradually ratcheted up until it called for 55% of all mortgage purchases to be \"affordable\" in 2007, including 25% that had to be made to low-income home buyers”\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/how-the-government-caused-the-mortgage-crisis-2009-10%3famp?client=safari \n\nSo government created the largest mortgage insurer in the world, made them responsible for making 55% of all mortgage purchases by 2007 to home buyers who were at or below the median income that banks wouldn’t normally lend to due to excessive risk. Government  did this by insuring all the mortgages made to those higher risk below median income borrowers and making the borrower pay for the mortgage insurance. A year later the housing market collapsed. None of this is coincidence. \n\nWhen this happens at record rates in shortened periods of time (early 2000s and 2020-2021) is when the entire housing market becomes too risky and as a result of risk turns the market into a ticking time bomb. \n\nIt wasn’t the banks that caused the last bubble or collapse. It’s government who created the guidelines that the banks were made to follow that created the subprime mortgages that still exist today and it was government who put us all at risk by insuring those loans to make sure they got approved.\n\n\nFor those saying this time is different due to limited supply reread the first paragraph and then add that they’ve prevented foreclosures for over a year. Millions of homes that should have hit market in past year that didn’t simply because of that.", "id": "orkpum", "created_utc": 1627249414.0, "score": 651, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 374, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|372|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6plwm/hayw_pool_boom_chlorine_shortage/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/niukl9/chlorine_is_the_new_gold_tendie_maker_oln/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/nrl1em) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/orkpum/how_government_created_the_08_market_crash_and_is/) \n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/Visionboard0312, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "He said 2022.
