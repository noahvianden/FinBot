{"title": "15 Options TA - Journey to $1 Million - Remember Me?", "selftext": "# INTRO - I have a feeling this week is going to be another good week for the major indices and tech. I do believe most inflation fears are priced in, have been for some time, and for the most part this is an ordinary summer. The 10 year bond has dropped right around 1.35% which will indicate what sectors we should be investing in. It seems like the lower it goes, the better tech and growth do. Traditionally cheaper money benefits these companies that carry a lot of paper. I'm not expecting any major changes on this front. Yet, I am getting ready to take profits on longer term positions and move somethings around in preparation for a bigger dip in September or August that I've been writing about for some time now.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TODAY** \\- Good start to the week as the markets across the board set fresh all time highs! My portfolio is up over $10k. \n\nYear-to-date gains in the S&P and NASDAQ are at 18% and 15% respectively and even though I am expecting a pull back after the summer, there is still more room to run towards the end of the year.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyshhp5qhva71.png?width=1121&format=png&auto=webp&s=3083deb40b7fda498d29d0a0210c0fae1727e8f2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI do think that $**AAPL** will pull back, unfortunately for my LEAPS, however if it does getting into another position closer to the 180 MA is beneficial. There is no real guarantee that **AAPL** will recede all the way back down, giving up all the gains from the last couple weeks, however September is usually a horrible month for **AAPL**. In case, I will be prepared.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hueebk7gva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=041dbab8f67ee16ac8a4f70f33077a0da02f66fe\n\nNext on the list of new alerts is $**ROKU**. I am not that bullish on **ROKU** and agree with Morgan Stanley giving it a sell rating. If it does rise up to the resistance trend line, it will be almost all time high. I like puts at this point.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zluyryg9gva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=438bd1a0b0657f12fa519bbfcca854a7037cf609\n\n **MSFT,** like AAPL, has ran up a great bit the last few weeks. Currently most indicators are showing levels of over bought. I don't want to buy puts or short **MSFT**, but if it does pull back toward the support, which it has bounce many times before, I'm a buyer.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eizxl02bgva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=dafe6828303bbb45e245d62ce41b5e3b96fddebc\n\n \n\n$**X** is an interesting play that I would consider pretty safe. Of course everyone has heard of lumber and the inflation that is kicking up prices. Housing prices are skyrocketing around the country and possible rents will be too. If **X** can pull back to the 180 MA I believe that is a very good level of support to buy at. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8gfx26ocgva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1182f1a0fe2cb4c0b178b0c7d12dced37615662\n\n**ArcelorMittal,** together with its subsidiaries, owns and operates steel manufacturing and mining facilities in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa. This is another steel and mining play for me. Over the past 10 years August has been the worst month of the year for $**MT**. I'll wait for a dip and hopefully buy mid to long term calls around the strong support, and if that breaks maybe the 180ma.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zj34ylcegva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a5bfcef576a2b806338bcb9c02450be11de0a50\n\n**Vertiv Holdings Co**, together with its subsidiaries, designs, manufactures, and services critical digital infrastructure technologies and life cycle services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments in the Americas, the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. $**VRT** is essentially a data center and tech infrastructure play that I believe is overbought currently. **VRT** seems to be riding up towards the key resistance that it cant seem to cross, dating back to last year, 2020. I prefer puts here and take profit around the 50ma.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zsypjnrfgva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=f33a77fe41d1a3e7dbd7dd023eb713799d92c732\n\n $**AI** is a company that, you guessed it, develops AI products. I think the ticker is really, really cool, but that's about it. I believe most of the hype probably comes from that and we can see that it sold off enormously earlier this year. Once it is up to the resistance, let's play puts back down to the big volume shelf that is providing support.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8mcbb9zggva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=77e515bbde6d723ae5393c1744951a6cf5198818\n\n $**TNA** is a leveraged 3X ETF that follows the Russell 2000 small cap index. Small caps are more risky that large caps, of course, but usually out perform them as well. I would like to add this to my portfolio, most likely, in September to set up for a run into the holiday months. Shares are fine with me since it is leveraged.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2yx6z0igva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e335354f9e074313436e30d2ad0e0a28f955aaf\n\n $**BIDU** alert that triggered late Friday. If $**BIDU** continues an upward push, through the support, I'll pick up some calls a couple months out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwtjr5njgva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bbe7a38958435b63b0b7ceb1e43d8bd514936bd\n\n $**COIN** is my favorite BTC/Crypto stock play. It is the most reliable and regulated crypto exchange in the US. I think all the institutional investors will be using **COIN** for crypto exposure. I also don't think that the stock price should follow that of BTC. Even if BTC is down for the month, there is still selling volume taking place on **Coinbase**, there fore incoming revenue. Overall, I like this stock. If it pulls back to the MA, I think its a good entry and addition to your portfolio if you want crypto exposure.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ymaldxhlgva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=289f1e4d9130c1134ea952d51fa06158bd9c0d54\n\n If you are like me and waiting of a bigger pull back/correction before situating your portfolio for a bigger run toward the end of 2021, I'll be taking profits in some of my positions and needing a place to park the money in the interim. I've identified a few that could be good for this. First is **VTV,** Vanguard Value ETF. It is a ETF that is focused on Value stock play and has a Dividend yield of more than 2%. It is usually considered a 'safe' place to park money. Some top holdings include, BERK, JPM, XOM, JNJ, UNH, and PG.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2dcxclpmgva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=03de8f2f07a832d6042fbbff5c6b5298ad3438b0\n\n Another one is **SCHD**, also has a Dividend yield of over 2%. Some of Schwab Div Yields top holdings are MRK, TXN, HD, PEP, and VZ.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5o5q8nngva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=f597984b4adabd4f6417c313c57576644024f6ee\n\n Another interesting addition to your portfolio could be **XHB**. It is a homebuilders ETF. There has been huge demand for new SF homes in the US, and **XHB** and NAIL have done very well this year with the inflation trade. I don't expect demand to considerably change anytime soon. I always buy on support, so patience is key until **XHB** pulls back a little bit more.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8vck4xogva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9dd3c23232ccdc439a93b7dd9f2d20c7a808955\n\n **DIS** just released Black Widow and did very very well this weekend. Overall I like what the company is doing with **Disney**\\+ and in Shanghai they are raising the ticket prices for the newest Disney theme park. Be careful when buying this for two reasons. One, a lot of good news could already be priced in - and probably is. Two, August through October have been horrible months for **DIS** over the past 10 years. If you are a **DIS** bull, buying on the 180MA is your best bet for now.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lorao9qgva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dc8230c7f288c8d06b14df0d824a8b18bb69346\n\n \n\n**$TASK** provides outsourcing services to Internet companies worldwide. It offers digital customer experience that consists of omni-channel customer care services primarily delivered through digital channels; and other solutions, including customer care services for new product or market launches, trust and safety solutions, and customer acquisition solutions.\n\nAll of the major analysts, except Morgan Stanley have a 'buy' rating for the stock. I personally like their vision and what they are doing. Their IPO wasn't long ago and there isn't much data out so far, however I think there is upside toward $40+. Currently I want to buy commons sub $30 if the opportunity comes, or sell puts if options are enabled on Webull. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8nyyk4gxgva71.png?width=1156&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c0a89f71fe2bc1ecd0fb7aad3ddd8bd81e7574\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Current Weekly Positions\n\n$NAIL \\-6.8% (Ongoing Swing Trade)\n\n$DIDI \\+$550 Sell $10.5p (+45%) (Ongoing)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDisclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.", "id": "oj424x", "created_utc": 1626135373.0, "score": 556, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "One hell of a DD.

Today, after hours they just posted a report saying \"The Company expects its second quarter total revenue to be down approximately 37.5% versus the second quarter of 2019.\" In Q2-2019 the revenue was ~12B.

Started buys at low 53 and kept buying into high 54s. I’m about 16k into this one with a 54.14 avg. I won’t buy any more cause i don’t yolo. Pins reminds me of snap 3-4 years ago. In 2017 if I remember correctly snap came out shot up then quickly retreated to 50% of its high within a few months maybe 6 months max (from 25 to 13). I wasn’t invested ever but I had friends who were. They crashed because even though their growth in monthly avg users was impressive they couldn’t show progress on monetizing. Man I wish I would have bought cause it’s at 75 now. Unfortunately I’m rarely going to invest when the issue is monetization. Pins has the opposite problem. Their mau disappointed but are knocking it out of the park with avg revenue per user. This I can get behind. I think in 3 years it will be over 100.\n\nI also like fireeye (although I guess it’s mandiant in the future). I have a spread of cyber security (panw is my biggest but also have okta, crowd, and zs) in my portfolio. Had wanted to increase my holdings but couldn’t find any mor value until panw went back to 360 recently. Never considered fireeye cause I didn’t love their setup. Bought my fist 100 shares for 18.50 when they announced they were selling off the products business in early June. This is why I didn’t love them. That’s not what they are famous for. I bought another 30k worth of stock and then bought some leaps after this last earnings. My avg price is 17.32 and I have 20 leaps that are currently up 33%. once I read their actual presentation I was sold. Industry leader who is shedding half the company to keep their high growth half.

All they did was hike materials costs to bottlers to \"beat earnings\" and all the restaurants that re-opened their fountains had to replace expired BiBs from being shutdown. BiBs are incredibly profitable for not only bottlers but KO themselves. KO is only as strong as it's customers, the bottlers. Bottlers are moving more and more toward automation in not just physical labor but programming AI to regulate inventory which is going over terribly from a logistic and ethical standpoint. They are likely going to weaken and drive the independent bottlers into the ground so they can consolidate again but that seems more like a 5-10 year plan.\n\nQuote from another comment of mine. Compared to Pepsi, Coke is kind of a dumpster fire right now with KO acting like a vulture over it's independent and private bottlers.\n\nAny boost in earnings from re-equipping restaurants will be gone not to return. KO's support for bottlers has gotten pretty bad. They give them almost nothing and expect bottlers to pay hiked prices in return which then hurts the bottlers' bottom line which makes it worse for the workforce which forces experienced people to leave so fast they can't train new personnel for a niche job that required knowledge of the development of a specific market over the past decade to thrive.\n\nYou get left with personnel with tenure who haven't regularly been boots on the ground in 7-10 years and dumbass burnouts working jobs that used to pay 90k that now pay the same as a head cashier at a gas station. Bottler compliancy to KO standards is flying out the window. I watched an RD truck at a gas station today take 2 hours to do one stop that should have been done in under 45 minutes. It's ridiculous.\n\nKO also has no current interest or the capital to buy back their CCR holdings or they're trying to devalue them so hard that they indys almost go out of business.\n\nNot to mention on top of all of this, core sparkling HFCS, the core of any bottler's and KO's income, is still down 2% YoY. Sure they can come up with a ton of sugar substitute and still innovation but HFCS sparkling pays the bills still primarily. It's just so under diversified compared to the Peppybois.\n\nYou don't see Pepsi shooting 10 lifewater or gatorade flavors out their ass. There's not enough money in the category. KO had the AHA relaunch go for it with the goal of 50%-100% over the PY sales... but it was OOS down to 2/9 flavors for so far almost half it's existence due to can shortages so no fucking shit will it 100%. KO bottlers also still have major supply issues in some places, including $COKE, one of the publicly owned bottlers which $KO still holds a stake in.\n\nI'm glad I'm out of the business because anyone still in a DC/PC/SC there is on the wrong side of operations going forward.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "That sounds pathetic.

Cash is a liability for a money market fund because they have to pay their customers interest.  So they lend their money overnight for an approved safe investment that generates a small return.\n\nThe next day they swap back.  So the Money Market Fund (or whoever) gets to temporarily put an asset on their books instead of a liability, and gets to get its money back quick in case a customer wants to withdraw.  For the Fed this stabilizes the short term Treasury market as they try to keep the yield curve from going haywire.\n\nThe MMF or other participant needs to park cash for a short duration and the FED needs to keep the yield curve intact.  This serves both those purposes.\n\nWhat this also tells you is that there are zero good alternatives because the numbers have been so high.  The fed does NOT want and inverted yield curve and the MMF do NOT want to \"break the buck\".\n\nThis happens when a dollar in a money market fund is worth less than a dollar.

Initially, the MIC M3 used cylindrical batteries for all variants, i.e. SR+ and LR. Then around October 2020 they phased in the LFP SR+ and phased out the cylindrical SR+. My contention was that this was done to free up cells for the Model Y. Now that Tesla is introducing the LFP SR+ MY two things could happen:\n\n* Model Y LR stays at current production levels of \\~15k per month and the SR+ MY is accretive.\n* Some of the MY LR's turn into SR+'s, and in total production doesn't increase as much.\n\nI think we will see both an increase of MY production over the next 3-6 months, and shifting of orders to SR+.\n\nOf the MIC M3 I would estimate \\~80% of the vehicles produced would be SR+. If we assume the Model Y moves to this similar amount, and that total production moves to \\~25k, we would get \\~5k LR MY and \\~20k SR+ MY. This leaves \\~10k LR MY packs to be used elsewhere. Where is there a current battery shortage? Fremont. Where are they building a new Model Y line? Fremont. We have already had rumours that Fremont has used packs from Shanghai, and I think this will become even more the case after this SR+ shift.\n\nAdditionally, I think Tesla is working towards shifting the M3 SR+ lineup in the US to LFP. There are only 2 restrictions on this: 1. LFP availability, 2. pack production capability. I'm not sure on the exact split between LFP/LR in the US, but if we assume 50/50. Tesla could produce \\~30k extra vehicles if they shifted their whole SR+ lineup to LFP.\n\nPutting this all together, if Tesla shifts all of their SR+ globally to LFP they can probably produce an extra \\~40k LR vehicles per quarter. They also can use those cells for other purposes, maybe Semi or energy, but LR vehicles would have the best revenue/margins. Tesla is producing \\~20k short of their 125k per quarter 3/Y Fremont target, and the addition of another line would push them to maybe 150k production volume per quarter. They would need \\~35k more packs. Seems to fit nicely. \n\nTesla could be producing \\~175k from Fremont (S/3/X/Y) and \\~150k from Shanghai per quarter in about 6-9 months. That's 325k per Q, which would be \\~62.5% growth from Q1 without Fremont/Berlin.\n\nTLDR: LFP Model Y -> freed up cylindrical cells -> more cells for US production & China production -> Good growth for the next 6-9 months even without Texas & Berlin.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Great post.

{"title": "Why $CLNE will run the rest of the month (NON-APE ANALYSIS)", "selftext": " \n\nFOREWARNING: I am aware that the great stock CLNE was apeified a little bit ago. This DD isn't about some crazy ladder climb short delta theta jump.\n\nHowdy,\n\nAs we all know, CLNE has been trading flatter than your wife for the better portion of a month now. However, I think that is all about to change. Also, I think it has actually been a good thing that the flatness has been getting tighter and tighter each day (seriously, CLNE moved like 5 cents back and forth today). Before I get into why it's about to run, here's some background on why CLNE is an amazing company (especially at $9).\n\n**WHAT THE FUCK DOES CLNE DO?:**\n\nClean Energy Fuels (CLNE) is in the business of creating Renewable Natural Gas out of organic waste. Cow shit (and other shit!). Renewable Natural Gas is one of the best bridges to move into green energy. EV's, Hydrogen, Solar, all are not prepared to power the worlds trucking fleets, despite their claims. They are in fact years away. It is exponentially cheaper to convert a long haul trucking rig to natural gas than to buy an EV rig. If you're an average trucker, your truck is where pretty much all your money and value is stored. It would be bonkers to buy a new EV vs to spend the $20,000 to convert your current rig to Nat gas.\n\nClean Energy Fuels already fuels more than 250,000 vehicles with RNG daily. This isn't some start up or nonsense gravity truck firm (looking at you NKLA). They have over 570 stations across North America already. CLNE is fervently building new stations at a breakneck pace. What that really amounts to is a substantial lead over any competitor. Which really means that you'd have to either use them or buy them out to try outpace them at their current rate.\n\nRenewable Natural Gas is good for the planet also (I know this is a stock presentation, what is the environment, but hold on). The current administration in the USA, and honestly the next ones too if they want the youth vote, are highly motivate to shift to green solutions. But they have to deal with the people who will drag their feet and won't want to spend millions on all new green solutions. RNG is the perfect bridge between the two. You can convert your trucks, your mail delivery fleet, whatever, all to RNG much cheaper than buying a new one. Renewable Natural Gas reduces carbon emissions, especially on big trucks) by a minimum of 70%. CLNE is committed to reducing that to 0 by 2025. This makes it highly likely to be chosen as a green solution. Methane is 20% of greenhouse gas emissions, so it's a double whammy, stopping two sources of pollution.\n\nFinally, CLNE already has contracts with big companies. The ever so touted Amazon contract is one of them. UPS already has a contract with them. They are the largest provider in California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program. People are coming aboard before they're forced to convert a much higher price (California especially is stopping a lot of non green shipping, but that's a whole other rabbit hole). There has been institutional buying of the stock over the past month and before, as these prices are a steal. WAIT WASN'T THERE A BIG SELL OFF EARLIER OMFG? That was Total taking a profit on their shares they bought for next to nothing years ago. It has already been announced over the twitter that they have stopped, as they just wanted to make sure they got a return on investment.\n\n**WHO GIVES A FUCK, WHY IS IT GONNA RUN?:**\n\nEDIT; I AM SHIT AT TECHNICALS AND THIS IS WRONG APPARENTLY First, the technical. Now I am not the Adeptus Mechanicus, but apparently technical do something so I'll lay some out with my moronic knowledge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ao8wlyqeeva71.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=79372a815c071300a27f39ac88545968e08b6982\n\nJust for fun, here's today. There's a little cup and handle there, I think.\n\nNow, over 6 months, something interesting comes out (yes I took this from Google, not all of us are billionaires who buy fancy crayon software):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5a3uo4nheva71.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=907c6e4bf44319fd07901680144bd82daf2bce02\n\nThere seems to be a cup and handle growing here too. It is also following a similar drop and spike pattern as from May to June, suggesting another upward jump coming.\n\nCLNE has consistently bounced off the 200 SMA, which suggests that that will stay a strong support. So $9 is a pretty safe entry point to buy some long dated options at, and a downright boomer safe entry point if you're buying shares. Over the last 6 months, we've stayed trading above $8, and really actually $8.50. With CLNE consistently growing, I don't see why we would drop past there.\n\nBut in reality, I don't speak stock robot, so technical aren't really my thing. Just my thoughts on the techs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sawts0akeva71.png?width=893&format=png&auto=webp&s=498b5bbd606be4ea2313092614a0f86d95bac941\n\nThere is a large amount of near the money options open on CLNE (someone once told me this doesn't matter because there's not as many as GE or Amazon. If you say something silly like that, you belong in the poorhouse).\n\nNow here is where there becomes two routes for CLNE to run. The first (the more unlikely, and the more ape like option tbf) is that CLNE starts to rally as it did near the June option expiry. This sent CLNE to a spike of $14.60 ish. If CLNE gains the interest of an institution looking to start getting foolish or becomes back in favor to fickle fools, then CLNE would already jump past where we we've been holding for weeks and your investment would already be profitable, or it would set up to become more profitable in the real run to come for July. Expiring option dates have generally been good to CLNE based on past performance.\n\nThe more realistic route is that the options all expire OTM. This seems bad (and indeed is for those option holders) but would actually still be good for CLNE. After we are finally away from an option expiry, CLNE can begin its run to August earnings. It has been announced that there will be a conference call immediately following the earnings report. Now, Clean Energy Fuels usually likes to wait to announce big deals for their earnings. They got very close with their Amazon deal to the May earnings call (15 ish days). That sent CLNE jumping up to the near 20's price. I think there is a high level of anticipation for this earnings call. While I personally believe a new contract will be announced (I think new, expanded UPS deal, but that's pure speculation so is not necessarily relevant in a DD, besides that is SEEMS like it'll happen haha), I think the belief of institutions and the average buyer that CLNE wants to announce a deal will cause CLNE to run up until earnings. CLNE already has received interest as a top trending stock on reddit, among other places, and the CEO went on Cramer and roused some interest there. There is also a suspicion that there might be more to the Amazon deal, as he stated that he couldn't go much more into it, as Amazon wanted to talk more about it. So, I think the belief of an Amazon deal or belief of a new contract will fuel CLNE to run until earnings. After earnings is anybody's guess, especially depending on the conference call. However, it is an easy run up to earnings, as I think most people (including analysts below) expect it to be pretty great. Also, with the temptation of a new contract, it will double the general excitement leading up to earnings.\n\nEarnings will also most likely be good. Most people panic at CLNE's past earnings with just a glance, but they almost always are 0.00 because they reinvest every penny into building more RNG stations, just furthering their lead in the sector. So even if CLNE holds on to 0.01 for the quarter, it will be gangbusters in terms of their earnings, which makes it very easy for CLNE to smash earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xo3of4meva71.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=3363ca2c18ebd48e86c517dde7044826e9808607\n\nAnalysts have high projections for CLNE for the next 12 months.\n\nEven the lowest is $2 above close, and the median is $20. There is clear real belief in the stock besides just WSB think. Most analysts put it at a \"buy\" rating, because it is criminally undervalued.\n\n \n\n**TL;DR:** CLNE will have a a gangbusters run up to earnings after 7/16 options expire (or an even higher climb if they somehow expire ITM) due to sentiment and belief that CLNE will announce new contracts/have an even okay earnings report. CLNE is also an extremely safe bet at these levels as it has consistently held them. Personal price target: $18 the day before August 5th earnings.\n\n**POSITIONS:** 500 Shares, 80 ish September $20 calls, 5 7/16 $13 calls and 5 7/16 $12 calls (the July ones are just for fun FD gambling)", "id": "oj3rpb", "created_utc": 1626134401.0, "score": 713, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 212, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|3563|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great work here!
