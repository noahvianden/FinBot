The Fed is practicing an unprecedented monetary policy with no equivalence.\n\nEvery year both public and corporate debt rises.  This is not something that is utterly sustainable and can go on forever.  Debt needs to be repaid to those who it's owed to. The reason it's seen as sustainable is because, up until now, we've simply been able to roll it over in the public and private sector.  But let's start with the private sector.  What happens if funding dries up or if interest rates rise?  What happens if we have a crisis?  Short-term financing problems *were* a fundamental cause of the Global Finacial Crisis.  More about corporate debt - [source from the World Bank:](https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/570381599749598347/pdf/Growth-of-Global-Corporate-Debt-Main-Facts-and-Policy-Challenges.pdf)\n\n\"The rise of nonfinancial corporate debt, however, also raised concerns. As nonfinancial corporate debt reached historic high levels, policy makers, academics, and practitioners increasingly cautioned that significant firm indebtedness could become a threat to the global economy. In the post GFC period, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recurrently urged policy makers to address the issue of rising nonfinancial corporate debt, as it increased financial stability risks (IMF, 2017, 2019a).\n\nIn 2019, the United Nations (UN) recognized high nonfinancial corporate debt levels as one of the factors that could impair economic growth (UN, 2019). Some analysts predicted that the nonfinancial corporate debt boom could trigger a financial crisis comparable to the GFC (Financial Times, 2017; 2 Bloomberg, 2019; The Guardian, 2019; WEF, 2019). Others were somewhat more optimistic and argued that risks were manageable or that, at least, a possible recession would not be as severe (Powell, 2017; S&P, 2019; The Economist, 2019).\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic that broke out in 2020 raised new concerns about the high levels of nonfinancial corporate debt. As lockdowns and border closures caused a plunge in global economic activity, the question of how firms manage their debt burden has become a central topic in economic discussions. High nonfinancial corporate debt could be the Achilles heel in the global economy thatexacerbates the downturn and hampers economic recovery (The Economist, 2020; Lustig and Mariscal, 2020). In fact, some analysts have argued that corporate debt relief should be a central feature of emergency aid packages (Becker et al., 2020).\"\n\nAs for public debt, the same thing applies.  As long as the US can rollover their debt at low interest rates, no issue.  But what happens if there is an inflation shock, for example, and interest rates need to rise?  What then?  Then the debt burden becomes much larger.  Such high levels of debt, while sustainable at the moment, leave the economy vulnerable to shocks - \"top-heavy\", as posters were saying in this thread.\n\n>I‚Äôd also like to say the 2007 crash wasn‚Äôt so simple as ‚Äúlow interest rates.‚Äù It was a combination of multiple levers which when switched crash like a domino, but low interest rates wasn‚Äôt a big piece to that.\n\nNo, of course it wasn't that simple.  I've actually read a fair bit on the topic.  But you're incorrect to say that it wasn't a big (or at least important) piece of it.  From [the FCIC report:](https://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_full.pdf)\n\n\"In this report, we detail the events of the crisis. But a simple summary, as we seeit, is useful at the outset. While the vulnerabilities that created the potential for crisis were years in the making, it was the collapse of the housing bubble‚Äîfueled by **low interest rates**, easy and available credit, scant regulation, and toxic mortgages‚Äîthat was the spark that ignited a string of events, which led to a full-blown crisis in the fall of 2008.\"\n\nIn and of itself low interest rates weren't enough, not at all, but the housing bubble likely could not have existed without them.  So they were an important piece.\n\n>The truth is that not you me or anyone on Reddit really knows. The policies enacted by the US since 2007 were inspired by the Japanese recession of the 90s.

Munger cited in the BKR meeting his general surprise at how Modern Monetary theory seems to be working. So who actually knows. Not some youtubers. Not some redditors. We‚Äôre all just retail speculators.\n\nThat's the thing.  It works, until it doesn't.  And I'm a Redditer, but I've got my degree in economics, and I get my information from sources which I consider reliable.  Economist and former central banker William White would disagree that MMT is working.  It's working in the short-term, but that's the whole point: it's a crisis response tool.  A crisis, by it's very nature, however, is short-lived.  The problem is that we're using a crisis-response tool as a now permanent feature of economic and monetary policy.  He talks about this in many journals and other sources, here are a couple:\n\n[\"If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.\"](http://williamwhite.ca/2021/04/04/if-something-cannot-go-on-forever-it-will-stop/) (referring to debt and other issues).\n\n[Ultra-easy monetary policy and the law of unintended consequences.](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf)\n\nAs a last note, you're right, nobody *really* knows what's going to happen.  William White would be the first to admit that he could be wrong.  But it seems a bit silly to just throw the dice and let the chips fall where they may, doesn't it?  Although the economy is very complex and difficult to understand, we've got to do our best to make some sense of it, right?  That's what Jay Powell and the Fed are trying to do.  That's what economists who support their policies are trying to do.  So you've got to try and understand things through some kind of framework.\n\nWhat does this mean for us as retail investors?  IMO it means diversify and stay the course.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.  Don't play too risky.  But as long as you're diversified and playing somewhat conservatively, you'll most likely be fine.

When you sell a put contract, you are committing to buy the shares at the strike price if the holder of the contact chooses to exercise.

However, in practice it normally doesn't, as there is no benefit to the holder to exercise early.\n\nSo normally, if the stock price dips below the strike, unless you're approaching the expiration date, you don't have to worry. That's what allows in-the-money puts to exist.\n\nAt the end of the expiration date, if the contract is in the money, it is exercised automatically.\n\nAs a put contract seller, you can buy back the contract anytime before it's exercised or expired. It's considered a good idea to do this as you approach expiry, even if it's out of the money, to avoid being assigned as a result of a surprise dip.\n\nBuying a contract back and simultaneously selling a similar contract is called rolling. If you sold a put that is approaching expiry in the money, you can roll it out to a later date.\n\nThere is a strategy of selling puts to collect premium that involves rolling them each month to the new at-the-money price. In theory you can make money this way when the stock is flat or up, and only lose short-term when the stock goes down.

Retail buy/build these positions not with it's savings but with its paychecks.

For a stock price of a certain company be \"stable\" or to have a consistente uptrend, the company actually has to deliver \"some fundamentals\" for it and institutions have to be invested in it. Otherwise all the price action retail can do, will always fade overtime.\n\nI see you analysis here, and definitely these companies, or many of them, are having some hard days and this will probably continue for a little longer, but make no mistake, some of them will for sure bounce back, and strong.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah options plays are for sure a large part of retail losses.
