For example, if rising interest rates cause tech stocks like AAPL to drop, you'll be hit much harder if you're only holding AAPL compared to if you're holding an S&P 500 index fund, since the index fund will include holdings that won't be hit as hard or might even benefit from rising interest rates. It's true that the reverse is true too, that if AAPL shoots up, you would have been better off holding 100% AAPL, but the point is that diversification decreases the volatility of your portfolio performance, which is consistent with your goal of making money safely - the possibility of a single company tanking is generally much more likely than the possibility of the entire US economy tanking.\n\nAlso, the S&P 500 is an index, not an index fund, so you don't invest in the index itself. Rather, you invest in an index fund that tracks the performance of the index. The most popular index funds for the S&P 500 include mutual funds like FXAIX and VFIAX, as well as ETFs like SPY and VOO. There are differences among all these possibilities, but generally the mutual funds offer lower fees while the ETFs have better liquidity. If you're holding long-term and not planning on making frequent trades, you should go with a mutual fund to minimize fees. If you think you may be making frequent trades, you should go with an ETF to minimize trading costs.\n\nNot sure exactly what you're referring to when you say that people are not fans of the S&P 500, but it's widely used as a market benchmark. Reddit users tend to skew more tech- and growth-heavy, so they may prefer an index fund like QQQ that tracks the Nasdaq Composite index, which has historically had a higher return than the S&P 500 but is riskier from the perspective that it's more heavily concentrated in certain sectors. It mainly comes down to what types of companies and sectors you want to have exposure to, which depends on your outlook and your risk appetite. Fees, liquidity, dividends, etc. can be further considerations. There's also nothing stopping you from investing in multiple index funds, or investing in both index funds and individual stocks if you want to amplify your exposure to particular individual companies.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a lot! \n\nAlso I think what confused me about people critiquing the S&P 500 was that they were actually discussing index funds and not the index itself and I mistook it.

Consumers also come to finance more and more of their spending by borrowing heavily rather than self-financing out of ongoing saving. \r  \n\r***To compound the problem, this inflationary process usually involves the suppression of market interest rates, which distorts decisions about the type and time horizon of business investment projects themselves, beyond simply how they are financed.

Look at the unprecedented heat waves and droughts in the Western U.S., and devastating floods in Germany.  As long as civilization continues to burn fossil fuels for energy, the situation will get worse and worse.  Tesla is positioned to take full advantage of a necessary transition from fossil fuels to a renewable electric economy.\n\nTesla has advantages in:\n\n* Manufacturing technology, including pioneering the use of Mega-Castings that eliminate the need for many production robots in body shops, and vastly simplified electrical systems.  This is going to drive down Tesla's manufacturing costs far more rapidly than anything legacy automotive can accomplish. \n* Batteries.  Between its proprietary 4680 cell architecture and partnerships with Panasonic, CATL, and others, Tesla is likely to have access to the highest volume of batteries at lowest cost.\n* Ecosystem.  Tight integration between Tesla's hardware and software results in unrivaled performance and ease of use.  It's not just the cars either.  Tesla's industrial scale PowerPacks and Megapacks, combined with Autobidder software, make stationary storage more effective and more profitable than traditional peaker plants used by utilities.  Tesla's Supercharger network is far more reliable and easier to use than 3rd party networks relying on a patchwork of hardware and software from multiple vendors. \n* Software.  Tesla's investments in Machine Learning may have applications far beyond self driving cars.  This is a bit more out there than the first 3 points, but it's worth keeping tabs on. \n\nThere's a lot more, and I could probably write a book on what Tesla is doing that most people aren't aware of.  \n\nBut **you should be aware that people are not just \"speculating\" on TSLA stock**.  Investors who have closely monitored what the company has been building over the past 10 years, and where they plan to go in the next 10, know that this is not just an idle gamble.  **Owning TSLA is ownership of an enterprise that is building great products at ever lower cost, for an era where use of renewable energy is mandatory.**", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Preach!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Put your money where your mouth is and short the stock.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Why?
