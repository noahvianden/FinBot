{"title": "Amazon drops 137 billion in marketcap - a record.", "selftext": "Amazon drops 7.5% today after earnings, losing 137.25 billion in one day. This is the biggest marketcap drop in one day. To put in perspective, if markets were flat, amazon alone would contribute 0.3% in sp500, 0.63% in QQQ, 1.65% for consumer disc sector. The drop is enough, in theory, to send 1100 dollars to every us household.\n\n Only 98 companies worldwide (of which 59 is us) have a marketcap of 137 billion+. In terms of marketcap leaders, apple is 2.4 trillion, microsoft is 2.15 trillion, google is 1.8 trillion, amazon is 1.67 trillion. google surpasses amazon in marketcap due to strong surge as earnings beat expectations by more than 40%. amazon missed revenue and guidance was below expectations. this is one of the few times amazon misses earnings, previous miss was in October 2018, and one of the worst % drops for amazon not including 2000,2008 crash. Also jeff bezos fell to 2nd richest after today's drop.\n\nIn my opinion, this drop is exaggerated. most of the drop is because of sales dropping and bad guidance, but most of revenue comes from retail. But most of the profit comes from aws and ads, and both of the business has accelerated this year. Retail is low margin business, usually 2-3% whereas 20-30% for ads and aws. so aws and ads revenue is 10 times more valuable. People pay attention to revenue as a whole instead of the segments making the profits. If i would break down segments by importance it would be: 40% aws, 25% ads/other, 35% store. I think the aws/ads accelerating would increase stock price so if store was its own company, it would be a 22.5% drop. this drop is unjustified.

Not to mention that Amazon warehouse work is actually pretty damn good work for a job that requires no background education or experience - some locations are better than others, true as any other mega-cap corporation.\n\nSecondarily, you responded to the guy above with \"keep choking on that boot,\" the classic and unoriginal \"bootlicker\" insult that a politically aggressive left-wing person calls anyone that doesn't follow their own political philosophy.

There's a fuckton of opportunity in America (which I'm assuming you live in due to site demographics and you're expressing the same half-baked perspective of people arguing against America's economic system, which by the way isn't laissez-faire capitalism), and capitalism is what ultimately allows for socioeconomic migration based on the merit of our individual choices for employment. It's a great system that allows us to live generally fantastic, long lives, retire early if we choose to, and deploy capital as we see fit. Are there problems with capitalism, especially with extreme interpretations of it? Of course, but pragmatically we try to address those shortcomings with *some* social programs and safety nets. Don't like paying taxes to a significant defense budget? Too bad, we have it because we effectively subsidize the entire western international community's defense. Don't like services where the profits go to shareholders? By all means, don't use 'em, nobody cares. Fatalistic comments about being a recluse in your country?

The $15 minimum wage at Amazon (and whether or not that wage pressures other retailers to do the same) is nowhere near an excuse for the horrible working conditions there.

Pegging hourly wages to inflation doesn't work because there are different living standards across the country involving housing/rental rates, taxes, subsidies, and job mobility. If Amazon had to pay their workers $22 hour since the inception of Amazon, Amazon wouldn't exist. In fact, many businesses, if forced to pay $22, wouldn't exist. Please tell me how a mom-and-pop business can afford to pay $22 per hour. Workers would be fired, reduced hours, and many would end up unemployed.\n4. Amazon pays $15 per hour.

So, Don't embarrass yourself in public...\n\n5 months ago, I spent so much time on part 1 and 2 and after posting them, I sadly realized that people are lazy üòÇ Apes don't want to read mountains of DD, They just want a 5th grade level TLDR. This Ape got you, I will try to make this DD a longer version of a TLDR! I'll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible.(5 hours later, I failed at this objective lol)\n\n**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**\n\nFor the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.\n\nOn May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** ‚ÄúFord knows what pickup owners want,‚Äù IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.\n\nThe reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.\n\nNow Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **\"Potential(because they don't exist yet)\"** competitors with superior car features. \n\nIt's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.\n\n**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**\n\n^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)\n\n**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**\n\nFord-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now üòÇ(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.\n\nFarley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** \"but that's not why we invested,\" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.\n\nFarley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**\n\n Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands. \n\nAccording to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$. \n\nI would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**\n\n‚ÄúFord clearly has business and government fleets in mind,‚Äù Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.\n\nFord revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it‚Äôs equipped with a standard battery that‚Äôs good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.\n\nFord's vision to lead the EV market has a ‚Äúno-brainer‚Äù component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford‚Äôs focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company‚Äôs existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.\n\n# 5- Valuation and Price target\n\nYes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.\n\n$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple\n\n(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)\n\nTSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X\n\nNIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)\n\nGM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X\n\nF - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X\n\n**(Important part starts here)**\n\nAs you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.\n\nIf you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.\n\n At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **üá∫üá∏ ü¶Ö**.\n\n**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**\n\n[Ford Price Target Forest illustrated with

{"title": "-THE- Corsair Earnings Play - The Odyssey of How I Found A Way To Stack The Odds In My Favor", "selftext": "Hey guys, it's me again. Instead of gloating about how I was right about Homebuilders, by making a gloat post... I decided to be constructive by writing my greatest work yet. \n\nEveryone has heard about Corsair, and how great its products and growth are, but I don‚Äôt care about the product line when it comes to earnings plays. I care about numbers, the street cares about numbers, and the numbers to note down here are 27.5, 29.95, and 35. But we‚Äôll get to the why, later. \n\nEarnings plays are not necessarily as esoteric as people think. In fact, the efficient market hypothesis is such that you can figure out whether a stock will go up or down, and even get your own estimate of earnings per share that is or can be relatively accurate to do so. \n\nThe Process Is Simple:\n\n* Identify a fundamentally strong company that has lagged its peers for no reason (Vet this) in terms of its current price to earnings ratio, its analyst future price to earnings ratio relative to its sector, or even (especially) historically. \n* Identify whether it has a bright future ahead of itself. The reason for this is that the efficient market hypothesis operates under the assumptions that markets are forward looking. I identified this with home builders generally, and with CCS and M/I homes respectively. \n* Identify the true earnings per share of the company for the upcoming quarter, because with these kinds of companies, analysts are usually wrong. Don‚Äôt bullshit yourself with pie in the sky fantasy. Go as far out as a year with your estimates, or at least FYE. That way you can also analyze whether a company will raise guidance, or even if the CEO and the executive team are playing the earnings beat game where they intentionally under promise and over deliver. \n\n1. Understand that if a company has good earnings, but lowers guidance the stock will tank, so it‚Äôs important to note that you need to project future earnings per share for the full year.\n2. The way you can figure out what the ‚Äútrue‚Äù EPS will be in a company for the quarter and the year (Which, by the way, is the lynchpin of this strategy) is a process that takes hours of work. That‚Äôs the price you must pay for a high batting average: \n\n* You need to first read the latest earnings of the company you are investing in. This can be done at their investor relations website, or by finding their quarterly or annual on EDGAR. Follow that up by sitting down and listening to their earnings call, or by reading the earnings call transcript to add color.\n\n1.  Follow that up by looking at sector peers who have reported for the latest quarter, where your stock has not yet reported earnings. Read their earnings release and delve deeper by looking at their Q‚Äôs/K (depending on what time of the year it is). Then listen in on their earnings call. Don‚Äôt forget to look at sector peers in foreign markets because they have different disclosure rules. For example, the Hong Kong Exchange lets/has companies issue early warning profit alerts before earnings. \n2. ¬∑ Have you done your sector research? Make sure you have. Including sector numbers/economic data. If they aren‚Äôt what the market likes, question if there‚Äôs a reason why. For example, CCS/M/I home and other home builders haven‚Äôt been selling homes until they‚Äôve been mostly constructed and have been metering (or effectively) metering their home sales. This is because they wanted to get fixed costs before they sell their home as opposed to getting a home pre-ordered and having to deal with highly variable prices in commodities. In short, home builders wanted better visibility on their margins. So, the new home sales data for this month didn‚Äôt look ‚Äúgreat,‚Äù but if you know what‚Äôs going on, you know that it was a head fake. \n3. ¬∑ Compare the current P/E to your company‚Äôs peers, and then compare the future P/E? Is it woefully undervalued for no good reason (I‚Äôm talking a material impact here)? Is the projected analyst earnings expectations for the quarter and year just too low?\n\n*  Doing this will allow you to make a more accurate projection of your specific company‚Äôs earnings, and forward earnings. Even then your expectations can be blown, even though they‚Äôre higher than analysts, as occurred to me with home builders I was in.\n* What is the market sentiment towards your stock? If it‚Äôs been red the last week, month, three months? Then that means there is a strong negative sentiment (But it doesn‚Äôt need to be red for all three, you just must recognize the sentiment). If that‚Äôs the case, and you‚Äôve paired this with everything else, the stock will go up. So long as you identify that there will be a beat, raise, or bullish earnings call or a combination. \n*  Be mindful of any obstacles such as the bear case (If only to do like a persuasive argument where you acknowledge the argument then counter it). \n* In certain cases, hedge, by limiting your downside and protecting a large portion of your upside. This can be paired with trimming on a as-needed basis when you are up.\n* The process will take you a significant portion of time running in the hours. This Corsair play took me 5-7 Hours of Research, and I‚Äôm not counting most of my Razer research hours in this. It can be tedious, but it‚Äôs the price to pay for a high batting average. I‚Äôm lucky that I love doing this stuff. \n\n**How I Discovered The Play**\n\nThey way that I am going to describe this DD is by weaving the story of how I came to discover this play in bullet point format. \n\n* The story starts a month and a half ago with a Singaporean-American company listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. I was incredibly bullish on what Razer‚Äôs first half earnings would be, because I was seeing them buy back their stock in real time every single day. Hong Kong has different disclosure rules, requiring a next day disclosure if the company did a buyback the previous day with how much shares had been bought, how much they had retired, and how much they had bought back so far but not retired. They also require a monthly issuance of equity. I had been seeing them buying their stock back every, single, day. So, I knew the first half for Razer would be gangbusters. But another disclosure requirement is the inside information profit alert that the exchange requires them to do before earnings.\n* Looking through it I noticed a few things: [https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/razer/announcement/a210714.pdf](https://doc.irasia.com/listco/hk/razer/announcement/a210714.pdf) \n\n1. There was higher than expected revenue growth (Though I must remember that Q1 is included in the profit alert since the earnings are for H1 and H2.\n2. The operating margin was higher because of a higher gross margin product mix, as well as organic improvement of hardware margins. They had spoken of doing it in their investor presentation for their annual report in 2020. It can be found here: [https://investor.razer.com/pdf/pre210324.pdf](https://investor.razer.com/pdf/pre210324.pdf) (Page 47)\n3. I expect something similar for Corsair where the higher gross margin products are a larger product of their revenue mix. \n4. There was also continued improvement in operating expenses management, which I expect for Corsair as well. \n\n* That‚Äôs not enough color for me, so I move on to Logitech which has reported earnings. They beat earnings expectations, but they did not beat Q1 EPS sequentially. Part of it is expected, in that the area is seasonal, with Q3 and Q4 having the best numbers, but something tells me that‚Äôs not why. You see, Logitech has a lot of segments, of which only gaming is one of them, and I expect their non-gamer peripheral segment (etcetera) has decreased etcetera. I wager that the gaming segment revenue increased sequentially. I must look at their earnings to figure that out and compare their recent quarter to their last quarter.\n\n1.  First I look at the earnings release for last quarter, which can be found here: [Quarterly Factsheet F4Q21.xlsx (q4cdn.com)](https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Logitech-F4Q21-Quarterly-Factsheet.pdf). It shows me that gaming revenue is 323M. \n2.  I then look at the latest earnings release here: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc\\_financials/2022/q1/Logitech-F1Q22-Quarterly-Factsheet.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2022/q1/Logitech-F1Q22-Quarterly-Factsheet.pdf). I can see that gaming revenue stands at 336M. \n3. That equates to a 4.02% sales increase.\n\n*  However, by looking at the fabled Q instead of just the fact sheet itself, I know that gaming doesn‚Äôt represent video cameras for streaming (or streaming accessories), nor the microphone segment for streaming. \n\n1. On Page 8 of the latest earnings found here: [0001032975-21-000034 (d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net)](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001032975/d1c28ef6-b9ef-4a9a-974e-f23b941b1689.pdf), you can find the definition of gaming.\n2.  ‚ÄúOur gaming category comprises gaming mice, keyboards, headsets, gamepads, steering wheels, simulation controllers, console gaming headsets, console gaming controllers, and stream labs services.\n3.  What it doesn‚Äôt say is streaming webcams, streaming accessories, or microphones. \n4.  This means I must go to the web cam section to find sequential gains, as well as audio and wearables section. This is to get a complete picture. \n\n*  PC Webcams decelerated from 145 to 110 in terms of revenues. That‚Äôs a decrease of 31.8%. However, that‚Äôs because of the WFH trends fading, because as the segment states: ‚Äúour PC Webcams category comprises PC-based webcams targeted primarily at consumers, including streaming cameras.‚Äù Furthermore, they say that the 81% increase over a twelve-month period in terms of sales was partly because of organizations adopting remote or hybrid work environments.  \n\n1. ¬∑ I expect the gaming (and higher margin) portion of the webcam side to have increased. However, looking at their earnings transcript will give me some color. \n2. o ‚ÄúWhile webcam growth has started to moderate after more than tripled in last year, sales still grew 73% in the quarter, and we have regained some of the share we lost last year due to supply shortages.‚Äù \n3. ¬ß That‚Äôs interesting. The gaming peripheral and streaming segment is hyper fragmented, and so I suppose Corsair has been eating market share. I‚Äôm expecting the majors to continue doing so.\n4. ¬∑ ‚ÄúYeah, I mean the streaming business has just been a really strong grower underneath these numbers has really kind of lives in different places in the -- in our different categories. But generally speaking, if you look at blue microphones over the past year, it's really just grown tremendously. And we think the long term there is very, very strong. And Streamlabs is also super exciting and it's beating all the expectations we had for in terms of growth, and we're very optimistic ahead, and we're learning so much from our service businesses, it's a pure service play.‚Äù\n5. o Alright, I got that color on the product mix. I‚Äôm thinking that the streaming portion for webcams has continued to grow sequentially. Ergo sales have increased from Q4 to Q1.  \n6. o Corsair seems to be in the entire ecosystem, while Logitech is not: [Elgato Gaming and 45 more pages - Personal - Microsoft‚Äã Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/102f33504555d33bff5c7bed013ce6ee)\\-> [https://gyazo.com/ca119fd050f2adb41c5c882ca1c738ed-](https://gyazo.com/ca119fd050f2adb41c5c882ca1c738ed-)\\> [Blue and 49 more pages - Personal - Microsoft‚Äã Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/77c0e5277ae29824d8e7a173ed47daa1) \n\n*  130 to 117, but a similar story regarding the consumer side dragging down the gamer side for audio and wearables. Hopefully there will be more color in the earnings call transcript. The NPD has been quite clear that Streaming as a segment is going to grow at a strong pace for the next few years. \n\n1. Yeah, I mean the streaming business has just been a really strong grower underneath these numbers has really kind of lives in different places in the -- in our different categories. But generally speaking, if you look at blue microphones over the past year, it's really just grown tremendously. And we think the long term there is very, very strong. And Streamlabs is also super exciting and it's beating all the expectations we had for in terms of growth, and we're very optimistic ahead, and we're learning so much from our service businesses, it's a pure service play.‚Äù\n2.  Well, that sounds bullish for the streaming side of the audio‚Äôs (microphones). Guess that means my thesis regarding this is correct. \n\n* Now, I move on to Corsair. I‚Äôm just going to ignore looking at best sellers lists for pc component parts, because I must take some chill and I think it‚Äôs strong anyway. I know that the graphics card shortage for high end graphics cards is leading to sales increases in pre-built pcs. Ergo, Origin will do well sequentially.  \n\n1. Going to focus instead on what I think earnings will be for Q2 and FYE. I‚Äôm going to use this, and if I need to go to the Q I will: [fd9a3204-b129-4add-8f27-d92f22f17169 (corsair.com)](https://ir.corsair.com/static-files/fd9a3204-b129-4add-8f27-d92f22f17169) \n2. They raised adjusted operating income to be in the range of 235M to 255M from 205M to 220M. Let‚Äôs figure out how to get the net income from that, at the top range.\n3. This is going to be more complicated than I initially thought since the Operating Income on a GAAP basis is 67.289M, and there are some one-time items I can strip out to adjust it. **For some reason Robinhood displays the Adjusted, Non-GAAP EPS of .57. Therefore, my number might be lower, but will be higher on an Adjusted non-GAAP EPS basis. The GAAP EPS is .47.** \n4. Non-deferred IPO and secondary offering costs=1.03M\n5. Acquisition-related and integration-related costs=.208M\n6. Change in fair value of contingent consideration for business acquisition=.072M\n7. That gives us something to start with, and the new tally is 68.6M in **GAAP income after stripping out what I believe to be one-time expenses.** \n8. As a percentage of net revenue that is now 12.95% from 12.7%. The adjusted operating income as a percentage of revenue is 15.2%. \n9. Taking that operating income, and deducting interest expense of 7.39M, and then deducting the effective tax rate of 22% gives you 46.723M as your Net income. (Page 7)\n10. Corsair has debt at $294.3 million after debt repayment of 28M, and they intend to extinguish 100M by the end of the year. The interest payments, as can be seen In Q1 can be material. I expect EPS growth as more and more debt is repaid, and the interest no longer has to be paid. \n11. ‚ÄúWe were able to convert our strong financial performance in the first quarter into an opportunity to further strengthen our balance sheet. We reduced debt by an additional $28 million with outstanding principal now at $299 million and net debt at $177.3 million. We did this while growing quickly and leaving sufficient resources to help us grow further. We continue to evaluate growth opportunities while still expecting to further reduce our existing debt in 2021,‚Äù said Michael G. Potter, Chief Financial Officer of Corsair\n12. I expect that they will outpace the 100M goal they set for by the end of the year, due to stronger revenues, free cash flow, and net income. \n13. No, I refuse to check out the loan terms even though I could. This is already 2451 words. \n\n* Okay, now let‚Äôs go with future projections, okay? I‚Äôm expecting 5-8% in sales growth. I don‚Äôt expect it to be 1/1 as I expect there to be a higher product mix relative to other quarters (Thank you Razer). Therefore, I probably expect 6-8% sales growth, but 7-10% in revenue growth. I‚Äôm basing this off my review of Logitech and Razer. That would mean net revenues of 582.36M. \n\n1. The operating income, therefore, should be 12.9% of that, but I am expecting better. Because of operating expense management primarily, but also because of a higher margin mix. Since I went topline on revenue growth sequentially, I‚Äôll be somewhat conservative and say that I believe there will be a 100 BPS increase. So, 13.9% will be the operating income percentage of net revenue.\n2.  That would give operating income of 80.95M \n3. Then I am going to deduct interest, by copy pasting the last quarter‚Äôs interest expense minus what interest is saved. As I‚Äôm too lazy to dig for it, my assumption will be 4% interest rate on the debt extinguished, which means 280K in interest saved this quarter (And 1.12M over a full year). The new interest expense tally for the quarter is 4.666M. That would turn the net income into 76.284M.\n4. Other Expense, net line I‚Äôll just say will remain neutral which means the net income will turn into 73.86M in net income.\n5. Effective tax rate of 22% means 57.61M in actual net income free and clear, and then divide that by 92.19M shares outstanding **means basic EPS of .6249 for Q2 2021.** \n6. **IMPORTANT ALERT SO READ THIS:** For some reason MarketWatch and Robinhood report the adjusted EPS which is non-GAAP, and they do so for the analyst estimates as well. I‚Äôm just going to give you that number so you don‚Äôt have to do the calculations, and I can save time: **EPS under adjusted net income is .738 EPS.** \n7. **As the adjusted net income EPS is what is going to be reported, and what has been reported, I‚Äôm just going to go with that.** The Price to earnings growth sequentially would be a 27.24% increase. \n8. Analyst estimates of a FY EPS of 1.76 are way too low and would value the company with a forward p/e of 16.59 if matched. However, they will be easily surpassed as the first quarter had a EPS of .47 on a GAAP basis and .58 on its reported non GAAP basis. \n9. Q3 and Q4 are seasonally the best time for these stocks (especially Q3), and I don‚Äôt see how those changes. They‚Äôre going to have even stronger quarters sequentially.\n10.  My EPS estimate on a GAAP basis for the full year is roughly 1.95-2.05, but roughly at or within a cent difference of 2. \n11. My EPS estimate of the adjusted GAP basis (Which is what is reported on brokerages, and finance sites), would have me estimating a FY EPS 2.15-2.55.\n12. Every 28M of debt extinguished, means that 12-month future earnings are boosted by .012. You can divide that by 4 as that EPS is divided over a full year. There will be a snowball effect, and you will start feeling it this quarter, though it will be slight. This estimate is assuming 4% interest on every dollar.\n13. This all means a beat and raise, and a bullish earnings call, or a combination of the three. \n\n* Corsair‚Äôs trailing P/E after earnings will be 12.14. \n\n1. Logitech‚Äôs current P/E ratio is 17.17\n2. Turtle Beach is 10.49 \n3. Razer had turned a net profit of .8M last year, and so the P/E ratio is astronomical, the forward P/E for FY 2021 will be more reasonable.\n\n* Corsair‚Äôs forward P/E for FY 2021 according to analysts who expect 1.76 is 16.55. \n\n1. Turtle Beach‚Äôs is almost 22\n2. Razer is 22 (under my model).\n3. Logitech‚Äôs is 19.07. \n\n* My estimate for forward P/E:\n\n1. GAAP Basis (The non-reported one): 14.57 (2 EPS)\n2. Adjusted Basis (The reported one): 12.69 (2.3 EPS) \n\n* There is strong negative sentiment because the street doesn‚Äôt think the gaming boom in sales can sustain itself, but I think that‚Äôs wrong, and I believe I‚Äôve done the research to prove that is so.\n\n1. The street, if you see the share price, is expecting complete catastrophe. A miss of epic proportions if you look at the charts. The short interest is higher than it should be because short sellers think Eagle Tree will unload at any time, but that‚Äôs not what is going on. Eagle Tree is a rational player in the market, and I do not think they will sell past 35.75, plus whatever value they assign the raised guidance. My guess is that their new sell point will be 37.5-40. \n2. My reasoning for that is if you look here, you can see when they sold, and how much they sold: [CRSR | Corsair Gaming Inc. Profile | MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/crsr/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab)\n3. Aside from the IPO, they only sold once. Eight months later. When the company was pumped to over 40 dollars. They ended up selling all the way down to 35, and then stopped. 35 was their stopping point. \n4. They didn‚Äôt sell until the stock price had moved up 105-140% in the span of 8 months. They are rational actors, and they acted in that manner because they believed that at those price points, they were taking money from you and putting it in their pockets. They haven‚Äôt sold below 35 before earnings because they believe that that would be the equivalent of taking money from their pockets and giving it to you.\n5. The executive team selling is because of RSU‚Äôs recently. If you know about RSU‚Äôs you know that you are taxed the full value of the stock now it is issued at the market price, and that is your cost basis even if you don‚Äôt sell. So, most people just usually buy them, and immediately sell them to pay the taxes and keep the rest as cash to diversify.\n\n**My Strategy**\n\n¬∑ I had bought 6 27.5 Calls and Sold 6 35 calls. I added another pair today to make that 7 for each. These are August 20 Calls, and my debit spread means my cost basis is like 29.95. At the time I bought them yesterday, to break even it would have had to go up 1.6% by August 20.\n\n¬∑ The Delta was .70, versus .20, and Gamma favored me for the first dollar. Thus, the first dollar gain in the share price would have netted me 250% margin roughly.\n\n¬∑ Margin expansion would be there because of the extrinsic vs. intrinsic effect, thus the IV crush would be less for the 27.5‚Äôs than the 35‚Äôs.\n\n¬∑ Theta burn is lower on my 27.5 calls as opposed to the 35‚Äôs due to the same reason (though I don‚Äôt need to do that).\n\n¬∑ I understand an opportunity could come that makes Eagle Tree rationalize selling at prices they don‚Äôt think is suitable for them, so I‚Äôve protected the possibility. Corsair reports pre-market on Tuesday, which means they only have today and Monday to sell before earnings come out. \n\n¬∑ Market sentiment is so low, that anything positive is primed to ligjt a fuse in the company‚Äôs earnings, and I expect a 3-7% raise, and an outside chance of a 10% raise in the share price on earnings. At minimum, I expect there to be parity between Logitech‚Äôs future P/E and Corsairs. \n\n¬∑ Even if it stays flat, I have a week and a half after earnings to see it go up the equivalent of 1.6% (It‚Äôs roughly 2% now, but you get the idea). \n\n¬∑ There is intrinsic value unless it goes down below 27.5. Which means if it ends above 27.5 but below my cost basis, I can exercise those calls, and become a theta beta by wheeling it for September 17‚Äôs at a price of 27.5, 30, or 32.5 and get past break even and into positive territory as the extra two weeks of theta will outweigh my losses. \n\n¬∑ The chances of it going below 27.5 are‚Ä¶ Slim to be honest. \n\n¬∑ I can either sell on earnings runup or keep them and see if there is a pop for the next few days. I will likely hedge my gains by trimming on a -as-needed basis.\n\n**TLDR: Do you ask for ketchup on your spaghetti when you‚Äôre ordering in Italy?

The sentiment around the company, the presentation of returns, and the inevitable rugpull if there's a run-up are the keys to the strategy.

{"title": "Story: I almost lost $802K today and I did it for $4100 in options premium. Don't do that.", "selftext": "I thought I had a brilliant, fool proof strategy that the market didn't know and I was first to discover but I was wrong.\n\nThe strategy:  Find weekly options deep out of the money that yield at least 0.5% of the capital requirement. The shot strike price must be below the 200 moving day average and you leverage up to get decent premiums.\n\nI started this in May 2021 selling deep out of the money TSLA naked puts. Then I realized this uses too much margin, so I learnt about credit spreads but I didn't act on it. Then came big tech earnings week and I decided to lay low and not trade at all, but then my tool scanned and found the AMZN deep out of the money puts are yielding similar returns to TSLA, which is basically almost impossible to find in the market unless it's something like AMC or other meme stocks.\n\nI decided to pull the trigger, so I sold 3280 shot, and bought 3200 long on 7/28 expiring 7/30. AMZN was trading north of 3650. I was certain it wouldn't drop 10% or even get close.\n\nWell after hours happened and I paniced, my life flashed before me, I had levered up $525000 in my account, and I also had levered up my wife's account for $280,000 for a total of $800,000.\n\nThis wasn't a YOLO, it wasn't a double my money scheme. I was thinking I could do this 52 weeks in a year, collect 0.5% yield on $800,000 of collateral and move to Hawaii.\n\nIt didn't work out like that. When the markets opened, I got out of the position with $76K of damage, and wiped out all my gains and then some, but I'm thankful to everyone who helped me here on reddit (elsewhere) and WSB discord, and of course my wife who when she found out we'd lose $800,000 just said, don't worry at least we'll be together.\n\nSo cautionary tale for those selling levered up bull put credit spreads and/or naked TSLA puts, those black swan events you don't think you can get close to ... well you can.\n\nEDIT: I lost $76K closing the position.\n\nEDIT 2: I had all my margin used up, so I needed to wire in more cash, which thankfully my broker makes available immediately, so that's how I actually closed the trade.\n\nEDIT 3: Please note, this was not a YOLO, I was not considering this as a gambling thing, but of course I know how it is now, but I'm not a YOLOer is what I wanted to say.\n\nEDIT 4: I have hundreds of DMs asking me how I found the spread, I will buy a new domain, host my app on that and you can all have at it for free. But I mean I hope you know it's not as good as it sounds given my post.\n\nEDIT 5: Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/HK0D5Yp](https://imgur.com/a/HK0D5Yp)\n\nEDIT 6: Many of you are commenting here, and DMing why I closed the position. I've had more hours to reflect on this, and I think I was worried about being unable to close the trade due to (potentially) diminishing buying power. I closed the trade about 4 minutes into the session so I did think twice about not closing it, but I don't know I made a judgement call. So ultimately, risk management and position sizing were the fatal flaws of this trade. On a side note, I wish broker dealers would let you CLOSE your positions if you have enough collateral even if you have exhausted your buying power due to Reg T rules.\n\nEDIT 7: I've been told this has happened here before, look at this guy: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0l5uw/200k_yolo_on_spy_612_314_312_puts_credit_spread/", "id": "ouuhev", "created_utc": 1627680993.0, "score": 3034, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 909, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|3 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Reminds me of my first time selling csp.
