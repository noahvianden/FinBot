Every major bank has reserves built into their balance sheets and the fed monitors and stress tests these.

They carry alot of risks that followed 2008. I agree that banks and the capital market is very intertwined but by investing into banks your are exposing yourself to more risks than necessary (in my opinion)\n\nSo the explanation for why economist says 2008 never ended is due to 2 things. The economy did not recover truly since 2008 and the other is Banks and their financial engineering.\n\nWhat is an economic crisis? Essentially it is a market condition where demand is insanely low and total spending plunges. Which was what happened in the aftermath of 2008. [According to Economist JW Mason ](https://jwmason.org/slackwire/financial-crisis-and-recession/) the total spending did not increase after 2008, after most crisis there is a bump in growth for the economies as they catch up to lost growth and because of pro-business atmosphere and people regaining their income so they have to reacquire things lost in the crsis. Like houses, cars, investment vehicles. But this was not the case, since ww2 to 2007 the US GDP  increased 2.2% [but since 2007, inflation adjusted GDP growth has flattened off](http://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Monetary-Policy-Report-070617-2.pdf). Why so? Because labour force participation in America has been decreasing. People who are employed or looking for employment is decreasing. Why? Because labour force participation is affected by 2 things, education and age. America is getting older faster than the younger generation is getting educated. Older people are less likely to work and less educated people are also less likely to participate in labour. This leads to less investment and productivity. This could go long but sparknotes version: worker wage share going down, worker spend less, businesses all around get less money. \n\nThis is the environment we are in right now, so how do the feds react to this? They lower interest rate to almost 0 in 2008. This is what you do during periods of crisis, this is to give businesses a line of credit so they can bounce back. And this worked... For awhile until rich people started taking on debt to invest in the stock market and engaged in share buybacks, mergers, special dividend payments. All good for shareholders but don't really do much for the economy as a whole. In short its almost like a money laundering scheme to give money from low interest loans to the shareholders. The Feds then saw this as a sign to taper and increase interest. The market reacted very badly to this in 2013. But they pressed on and they were proven right as the market rebounded but this does not change the fact that there was gross misspending of cheap loans and now people cannot pay.\n\nThis is where banks come in. In the climate of low interest rate, banks gave out lines of credit for free with no regard for the firm's ability to repay the loans. [In this report by the Feds in 2018](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/financial-stability-report-201811.pdf) corporations who took alot of loans during the low interest climate were unlikely to pay them back. $2.25 Trillion of debt was considered Investment Grade. Which is 35% of all corporate debt. In another study in 2019 by the IMF, 40% of all corporate debt would be at risk of default (some brilliant foreshadowing by IMF, dramatic). Knowing this many banks started to package corporate debt together in familiar sounding scheme called Collateral Loan Obligation or CLO. Because debt was so cheap and interest was so low, this CLO packaging allowed them to trade debt and get a better return than if they had service the debt. Familiar sounding?  [Look at this ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/risky-loans-in-the-clo-market-could-be-trouble-for-u-s-companies) CLO is now a major source of income for Banks and they are incentivised to sell CLO to make money. By middle of 2020, 78% of all leverage debt was term \"cov-lite\" or loans that otherwise would not be approved if not for covid. \n\nWhen you collateralize debt together, you are essentially saying that when you group risky debt together, the threat of one defaulting is not as scary or dangerous to the bank servicing the debt. But they had a safety mechanism where if the debtor failed to be above a certain level of credit they would be kicked out. It is estimated 500b of debt will be downgraded from investment grade to junk and kicked out from CLO. This makes people less likely to want to buy CLOs as so many of them have kicked out bad debt indicating that CLOs are bad in general. CLO has dropped from 98.5c a dollar in December to 83.5c a dollar in April. This chokes out more credit from the system. Which makes more debt kicked out from CLOs which makes people less likely to buy CLO which then chokes lines of credit, leading to more debt being kicked out. It's a vicious cycle. With each passing cycle, people are losing their jobs and businesses are shutting down (this is why Small Businesses are struggling to get loans even though Interest Rates are so low now).\n\nAs people lose their jobs they reduce their spending in the economy making the first point even worse, people who have jobs are working from home and haven't left the house in awhile and are spending less. Which leads to businesses having less income, which makes businesses not able to finance their loans which get them kicked out of CLOs which choke their line of credit until they go bust. \n\nMeanwhile everybody that has bought CLOs have seen the value of it drop through 2021. [Moody's estimate that 6.8% of all loans will default this year ](https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1221409), 20.8% if things get back to 2020 level of lockdown. There is 20.8 Trillion of these kind of debt. And these aren't even in CLOs.\n\n\nSo who is the loser holding all the CLOs and bad debt? Banks, insurance companies and credit rating agencies. Nothing was learnt from 2008. Banks stopped CDOs just to redo it in another industry, and now this is a huge ticking timebomb. The Feds look at this and all they see is that businesses that used to be able to get loans to restart their productions aren't being able to and they buy up all the junk debt that was kicked out of CLOs as a way to mitigate it. This is why QE has been so high and the Feds aren't able to taper it. If banks can't provide credit, then the feds have to do it. \n\nFundamentally, the economic environment has not changed since 2008, financial instruments that banks used in 2008 was not changed, rich people used money that was supposed to support their business to line their own pockets. This is why 2008 didn't end.\n\n\nEdit: GDP Growth per person was 2.2% between ww2 and 2007*", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "With all of that said, I don’t see how that leaves banks with outsized risk. What you’re describing is essentially the entire market having outsized risks because if CLOs and risky debt go delinquent it starts a chain that tanks the economy, a la 2008.\n\nI don’t personally ascribe to this belief.

They will regulate where and how companies spend their loans and they will regulate who banks can loan to. The way I see it, if it occurs, banks will never recover to current prices for a couple of years. \n\nSure there economy will crash and everybody will suffer but as we all bounce back from the crash, banks will lag because their hamstrung by their ability to make money and will be tightly regulated.

Thus, prices of water in most locales don't properly reflect the scarcity of water vs demand, in keeping in line with the laws of price and demand.\n\nI was thinking though, this value HAS to be reflected somewhere, and when they talked about agricultural use, which accounts for 80 percent of consumptive water use around the globe.\n\nWhat is the most water intensive crop out there? Typically grown in a place where water is scarce and thus should be expensive.\n\nFirst thought. Almonds. Already expensive. Not a huge crop though, and not seeing huge growth.\n\nSecond thought. Avocados.\n\nHuge resource hog. It takes 75 gallons of water to grow one pound of avocados. That's two large Hass avocados. One bathtub full of water. To make matters worse, avocados are cultivated in semi arid, almost desert climates, in other words, they're water hogs in places without a lot of water.\n\nSo the economics are as follows. Water becomes scarce. Two things occur. Water prices go up and consumption goes down as conservation measures take place. Avocado producers are left with two options. Pay more for water via irrigation and keep yields in line, or give up yield and reduce supply of avocados. Assuming people keep on eating avocado toast and guac and getting takeout from Chipotle, demand stays the same. Both scenarios result in higher avocado prices.\n\nTHIS is where you see the economics of water reflected in pricing. Not in water delivered to households.\n\nOn the demand side: AVO has a two pronged strategy that I think is brilliant.\n\nIncrease avocado demand in China, which has seen [avocado consumption skyrocket as its reputation as the \"butter fruit\" (it's Chinese name) improves as a health food.](https://youtu.be/H3Mvva7rYzc)\n\nIncrease mango demand in Western nations, as US and European mango consumption is miniscule compared to the rest of the world. Mangoes, not apples or citrus, are the most consumed fruit globally. It also has the exact opposite seasonal cultivation cycle from avocados.

By the way, judicial review applies to constitutionality of statutes, not the application doctrine of the law itself; a superior court does not need to make a determination in forum selection, because that's not how court proceedings work; and an index calculation itself is an article of evidence that falls within the forum's evidentiary proceedings, not a basis for evidence admission.\n\nJurisdiction is as important in the determination of a monopoly as the activities of an international business' operations.

The reason intel was able to grab significant market share in data centers was because amd had made a terrible bet in their prior server chip design.  They had assumed power consumption in data centers was important (it is) and designed their chips to be able to turn off cores.  Problem is when virtualization arrived, it increased utilization of processors and the ability to turn off cores became more or less useless.  This gave intel a huge run in the server market… until amds zen server chip arrived.  At that point, the major server oem companies had an incentive to give amd server business to offset intel market power.  I can’t say for sure that’s why q1 2021 was so dreadful in terms of 20% collapse for intel data center business but I’m pretty sure it didn’t help.  So the point here is a bet on data centers saving intels business if pc business goes down is going to be a scary bet.  The old mobileye is less than $1b and could grow, but won’t be able to offset pc situation any time soon.  Other businesses are too small.  \n\nThat’s why the stock trades where it’s at right now.  P/E ratio in this case is a signal of what the work some investors have done are.  Again maybe I’m missing something.  The foundry business works, etc.  but that’s going to take time and there are also structural challenges that intel may have.  So hard to make a bet on that too.

I saw the potential of Tesla in 2017/18 and invested accordingly. I dont have much money, so I stopped investing in shares before the pandemic hit. I play around with very small packages of options, but largely stopped that too. I bought it at around ~$300 pre split (thats $60 now) every few month. I rode it through the \"funding secured\" $180 presplit (about $40 post split) saga and didnt have the capital to increase my position then. I was green too, so not much stock experience. Yet I held through all this and now I am happy.\n\nIf I had bought at any time this year, I would be terrified by now. However, I dont tell you to relax either. The days of 10x in a year or so are over. They are not coming back. We might see the stock go to 1000 this year, maybe 2000 to 2500 by 2025 if we are lucky. Its not a bad stock. Compared to other large companies, it has pretty good potential, which is why I keep holding it! However, one has to realize, its not gonna repeat past performance. And its gonna be erratic more than anything else.\n\nAlso, Its sad to see all the down votes on your post, because you are right. TSLA is not for the faint of heart. You got to have iron guts or a smooth brain to stay in (and I dont know which one I have). Elon will always be controversial. In 2019 it was funding secured. In 2020 it was his opinion on the pandemic. In 2021 it is Bitcoin. But thats part of the package. He is brilliant and will see TSLA through the rough waters. I love him for his brilliance and I agree with many of his opinions. For example, I hate advertising and I love TSLA for not giving in to the black mail of the mass media (advertise or else we publish FUD). This is *my* stock but I guess its not for everyone.\n\nThere is the FUD war going on. TSLA went through this time and again. The industry is fighting Tesla with everything they got. Because Tesla is pressing where it hurts. But we also have to realize, without Tesla, electrification of the car industry would be 10 years away forever. Remember the General Motors EV1? Tesla forced the hand of EVERYONE. Thats why I will get a Tesla too. Its the best car in the market but its also the one that made the world a better place. So yeah, I support it. But again, as for the stock.. its ok to leave if you dont feel comfortable. I will stay, but dont copy me, or anyone on this forum. You are not me. Make your own decisions. Investing is not a religion. You leave the stock for the right reasons. I wish you much success with other investments.\n\nEnd of rant.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "\"If i would of bought this year I would be terrified\" lol ive been buying constsntly for the last 2 years even this year.
