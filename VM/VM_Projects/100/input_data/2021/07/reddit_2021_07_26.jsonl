For example, if AAPL is at $100, the option price is $0.50, and the option delta is 0.15, when AAPL jumps up to $101, the option price should jump up to $0.65. This works in reverse as well; when AAPL moves down to $99, the option price should move down to $0.35. Note that this is assuming implied volatility (IV) stays the same, but that's rarely the case.\n\nDelta also roughly corresponds to the probability of profit, so a delta of 0.15 roughly means 15% (when buying an option) or 85% (when selling an option) chance of success.\n\n>Is 50 delta = .50 delta?\n\nYes, some systems use 0 to 100, while others use 0.0 to 1.0.\n\n>Does an OTM option with 9 delta mean the 9th option strike OTM of current stock price?\n\nNo, deltas don't represent the position of the option in the option chain, they're values calculated using the Black-Scholes model.

When waves hit the band and some reflected waves yields, which can interfere with the original waves. The interfere generates more wave and things get more chaotic(recursive positive feedbacks?). But it is hard to define the very first changes in IV as it is more of a consensus,  so we pick the current option price as the start point to quantify our  analysis and model.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if someone can confirm which one is right, and  what the loophole is in my reasoning if I am wrong. Many thanks.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Also, the higher IV implies a wider range of projected stock prices, in other word, higher risks. So I believe it is IV which drives the option prices.\n\nInvoking u/ProfEpsilon to fact-check me. I may be a little too loose in my terms and interpretation here, so reader be warned.\n\nNo, IV is essentially the variance the actual price represents when compared to the predicted price, based on all the other inputs, like time to expiration and the risk-free rate. You can think of it as the error term in the value that would come from an ideal pricing model.\n\nSimple exaggerated example to make the point. Suppose you have a $100 call on XYZ and XYZ is currently $110 a week before expiration. So the intrinsic value is $10 and all the rest of the value for the call is extrinsic. With me so far?\n\nLet's consider two different possible market prices for that call at the same moment in time (hypothetical, what-if type scenarios).\n\n1. The market (actual) price of the call is $11.\n\n1. The market (actual) price of the call is $1011.\n\nThose are clearly very different values, right? In the first, the extrinsic value is $1. In the second, the extrinsic value is $1001. \n\nSame contract, same intrinsic value, same time to expiration, same risk-free rate, and yet, the actual prices are radically different. Therefore, we need a way to *represent that difference*. If every other input to the pricing model is the same, but the actual price is radically different, we need a number that represents that difference.\n\nThat's what IV is. The second value of $1011 would have a much, much higher IV than the first value. The larger difference between the actual and predicted price of the call *implies* that there is more volatility in the market pricing of the call.\n\nThis is further reinforced by the way that IV is calculated, which is that the *actual price* of the call is plugged into the model and then the model is solved for IV, since all the other inputs are known. Normally the model outputs the predicted price, so if you force the output to be the actual price, the only free variable left in the model is volatility.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">This is further reinforced by the way that IV is calculated, which is that the actual price of the call is plugged into the model and then the model is solved for IV, since all the other inputs are known.

I think I somehow get the point now. I made a mistake to believe that IV would drive the option price. But in reality, only the supply and demand decide the price, right?  \n\n\nSo what I mixed up are actually at two ends of the implication, which goes as: \n\nLarger magnitude of change between predicted price and current stock price\\[I\\] -> more demand of option(to mitigate/limit the risk) -> greater option price(extrinsic value) -> larger IV\\[II\\]  \n\n\nIV\\[II\\] is nothing more than a representation of difference in extrinsic value. In spite of that someone can argue that there is some connection between \\[I\\] and \\[II\\], we cannot saying that \\[II\\] can be used to represent/quantify \\[I\\]. I should not try to transform this liner relation to a circular one.   \n\n\nI really appreciate you advise and samples. Just a little wondering about \\`the model\\` you mentioned that is used to calculate IV, did you refer to Black and Scholes formula?

It's ebb-and-flow of demand -> changes in price (of the contract, not the stock) -> changes in IV. Then larger changes in contract price -> bigger gap between predicted and actual contract price -> larger IV. It helps to remember that the higher the value of IV, the less of a connection there is between the contract price and the underlying price, as vega dominates delta.\n\n> Are traders usually use it reversely to calculate IV by interpolating the known option price?\n\nFinancial institutions like brokers and exchanges rather than traders, and BSM is the starting point, but it is limited to European style options only.

To say that this means all the talk about Lucid or Nio not being competition is a little short-sighted.  For one, Lucid will just now be delivering products to consumers in this upcoming quarter, so we can’t know whether it’s a better product or not until we see it.  Nio for their part is actually doing quite well in China which poses a threat to Tesla’s ambition in trying to gain market share there.  Let’s not forget the fiasco surrounding Chinese customers not happy about the QC in their newly delivered Model 3s.  And with the Chinese government basically saying Tesla spies on Chinese citizens, this could have an impact on sales in the region.  If Nio is able to expand production and penetrate markets beyond Asia, they may indeed be a force to be reckoned with.  And let’s not forget Rivian, GMs electric push, Toyota entering the space next year, and the success of Hyundai/Kia.\n\n2. You mentioned Tesla AI being an attractive feature for the future of autonomous driving, but you failed to mention that Tesla believes in going all in on just using cameras for their autonomous system. This is a HUGE problem as the cameras are only reliable in certain weather conditions and there is no fail safe in place when the system fails.  Why do you think every other major car manufacturer and autonomous driving companies use a host of sensors including LiDAR?  It’s because autonomous driving is only as good as the ability of the system to gain as much information as possible from the environment and be able to process that data.  Not to mention engineering redundancy is a great way to have a fail safe measure in case something happens.  If camera 23 goes bad or no longer functions properly (which camera failures happen in cars a lot), then the LiDAR is able to provide a fail safe to pick up where that camera left off.  Is there a glare preventing camera 11 from capturing data? No worries, the sensors can provide information where that camera can’t. Which brings me to my last point…\n\n3. Tesla is great because of Elon but it also has many shortcomings because of Elon’s ego.  In fact, if Tesla were to fail tomorrow it’s most likely because his ego got in the way.  This is what keeps some investors weary of the company.  Elon said he thought LiDAR was dumb technology that wasn’t needed and is doubling down on cameras only as the solution.  The biggest complaint in the new Plaid models is the steering wheel, with even Marques Brownlee saying it would be a great car except for this and yet Elon Musk is doubling down saying he won’t offer any other type of wheel.

{"title": "My top 5 dividend stocks right now. What are yours?", "selftext": "# How to pick dividend stocks\n\nA classic mistake that investors make when looking for dividend stocks is to just go for the biggest dividend yield. It makes sense, right? Get the most value for your money? Well, not really. This can actually be very misleading. Typically, the stocks with the highest dividend cannot sustain it. Some companies start squeezing as much cash as possible out of their operations, cutting costs, cutting corners to get that dividend to the shareholders. In the process, they bleed their business dry and they end up with a company that is in no position to grow. We don't want that. Personally, I like nothing more than a healthy business with good prospects paying a dividend. Most importantly, I want that dividend to be sustainable and I want companies to have a record of raising the dividend. I do **not** want companies that have lowered or suspended their dividend in the last ten years. This is not a foolproof method, but it increases the likelihood that you will get a company that pays a sustainable, growing dividend. Also, with these types of stocks, it is good to manage your expectations. Chances are that you will not see them double or triple in price over a few months like a hot tech stock, but instead you will get a reliable income year in and year out along with a modest price increase. Right? So, in my opinion, these five dividend stocks are a great deal right now. However, before I share them with you, I want to ask you what are your favourite dividend stocks? Why do you like them? Let me know in the comments below.\n\n# Verizon Communications (VZ)\n\nOkay, so, first off, we have Verizon Communications. Verizon is a telecommunications company and they are currently focusing on building up their 5G capabilities and adoption. One of their flagship services is Fios which is a bundled fiber optic service that provides internet access, telephone and television services. Verizon's wireless network provides the broadest coverage in the industry although their 5G coverage is only half of T-Mobile's, but is still better than AT&T's. Essentially, they are a big, established telecommunications player and they are not going anywhere. Their price right now is decent. Currently, they trade at a PE of 12.2 which has been pretty much typical for the company over the last 5 years and is normal for the industry. They also have a forward PE of 10.9, which is relatively cheap for Verizon so that's good to see. However, Verizon's best selling point right now is their dividend. They currently offer a strong dividend of 4.49%, but the best part about it is that Verizon have raised it ***every single year*** in the last 10 years! Every single year! Plus, the average for the top 25% companies in the US by dividends is about 3.5% so Verizon is offering an above-average dividend for the US! The dividend is covered by Verizon's earnings with the payout ratio being about 55% right now, but it is expected to drop to 49% next year. If you're not sure what the payout ratio is, it is essentially the dividends divided by the company's earnings so, with Verizon, we can see that they pay out 55% of their earnings as dividends. This is relatively high, but Verizon is a dividend company so a 50% payout ratio is expected and normal. Plus, Finbox's discounted cash flow model values Verizon at $72 while SimplyWallStreet values the company at an astonishing $150. I doubt it will go up that much, but my point is that Verizon is undervalued based on its free cash flow so that's another bullish argument for the company.\n\n# Kellogg (K)\n\nMy second favourite dividend stock right now is Kellogg, a classic consumer staples stock. As most of you probably know, Kellogg produces and sells ready-to-eat cereal and convenience foods like crackers, cereal and granola bars, waffles, noodles and so on. Essentially, it is a stock and a company that does well regardless of what situation the economy is in. People buy cereal during recession and during economic boom. Plus, the stock is inflation-proof because Kellogg can pass on increased costs to its customers. Kellogg's earnings are also expected to grow by 5% annually over the next 3 years which is decent for a stock of Kellogg's size. When it comes to the dividend, the company has a stable cashflow and can afford to pay out a consistent and stable dividend. We can see that in their payout ratio which is 61% for this year and expected to be 56% in next year. Most importantly, Kellogg has raised its dividend every year for the last 10 years and right now has a dividend yield of 3.7%. The industry average for food manufacturers is 2.6% and like I mentioned before, the average for the top 25% of dividend payers in the US is 3.5%. Kellogg pays a higher dividend than both, which is really good to see. Also, Kellogg's discounted cash flow is valued at $82.7 by Finbox and $120 by SimplyWallStreet so there is the bullish case for a higher price there. The stock currently trades at a PE of 17 and a forward PE of 15, both of which are under the average PE of 22.1 for the US Food industry. Overall, Kellogg seems like a good deal right now.\n\n# Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA)\n\nThe third favourite dividend stock is the Walgreens Boots Alliance, another consumer staples stock. The company is a pharmacy-led health and beauty retail company and operates over 9,000 stores in the US under the Walgreens and Duane Reade brands. Similar to Kellogg, the Walgreens Boots Alliance does okay regardless of what situation the economy is in. The stock is inflation-proof and it is also a good way to get exposure to the retail and health industries. Again, just like Kellogg, Walgreens have a steady cash flow which enables it to pay a sustainable dividend. Their dividend yield is 4.1%, higher than the average for consumer retailing industry which stands at 1.6% and also places Walgreens in the top dividend payers in the US overall. Like Verizon and Kellog, Walgreens has also raised their dividend every year for the last 10 years. Their payout ratio is 72% this year, but it's expected to drop down to 38% next year. That's because Walgreens experienced a drop in earnings during the lockdown, but their operating and free cash flow remained the same meaning that there are no problems with the business. That's also why they are expected to increase their earnings by 22% annually over the next three years. Right now, they trade at a good price. Their PE ratio is 17.9 compared to the industry average of 16.7, but their forward PE is 9.2 which is really good. They are valued at $69 by Finbox and $120 by SimplyWallStreet so again there is a bullish case for a jump in price. Overall, Walgreens is a low-risk high-paying dividend stock.\n\n# STAG Industrial (STAG) and Medical Properties Trust (MPW)\n\nMy final two dividend stocks today are STAG Industrial and the Medical Properties Trust. Both of these are real estate investment trusts, abbreviated as REITs. STAG Industrial focuses on acquiring and operating single-tenant industrial properties whereas the Medical Properties Trust acquires and develops net-leased hospital facilities. I like these two for several reasons. First, they've got an excellent dividend. STAG has a dividend of 3.6% whereas the Medical Properties Trust has a solid 5.3% dividend yield! The average dividend for REITs is about 2.9% so both of these offer really good dividends! Again, similar to the other three companies before, both STAG and the Medical Properties Trust have raised their dividend numerous times. Plus, they have ***never ever*** suspended or lowered it. They do have a high payout ratio with 68% to 79% for STAG and 65% to 70% for the Medical Properties Trust, but a high payout ratio is typical for REITs. Paying dividends is really what a REIT is meant to do so that's not surprising. Plus, both STAG and the Medical Properties Trust have a high level of occupancy which means that we can expect sustainable earnings and therefore sustainable dividends from them. However, there is another reason why I like these two. Inflation is on everybody's mind right now and buying real estate is the ***perfect hedge against inflation*** because real estate tends to go up in price during inflationary periods. REITs allow you to buy real estate without having to dish out money for a mortgage and tying yourself down for 20 years! It allows you to benefit from rising real estate prices and that is an important benefit of owning REITs. With STAG and the Medical Properties Trust you will not only be getting an amazing dividend stock, you will also be protecting your portfolio from inflation. Two birds with one stone.\n\nWhat are your favourite dividend stocks?", "id": "oryj6a", "created_utc": 1627305503.0, "score": 374, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 243, "comments": [{"body": "Abbvie and Lockheed Martin", "score": 97, "replies": [{"body": "I’m definitely adding to LMT on this unnecessary earnings report dip", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely buying lmt today.

BRK owns KO. KO pays dividends to BRK, so KO has real value, thus BRK has real value because it owns something that has real value, despite BRK never paying dividends.\n\nB.

All dividend payers do this also, but also directly return some of their past growth.\n\nIn some ways you can think of BRK and an IRA-like structure.  Once the money goes in, it can't come back out unless certain conditions are met.  For BRK, it's sell the shares.  For IRA it's age, etc.\n\nWith the IRA, if you get dividends, you can't move them out of the IRA, but you can invest them however you want more or less.\n\nWith BRK, you also can't move the dividends out of BRK, and further, you have to reinvest them how BRK wants to.\n\nBRK has \"real value\" only because it has purchased a revenue stream that comes from elsewhere - and you get the revenue stream, but it's baked into the price/capital gains.\n\nThis is different than TSLA, for instance, that doesn't pay dividends.  The price of TSLA is all about how much money you think will be returned in the fullness of time, but it's not happening yet.\n\nPut it this way, let's say there is a company, KALE, that is $10/share.  For $10 you can own a share.  Let's say KALE comes out and says, \"We don't care how long you've owned a share, we don't care how big we get, we don't care how much money we make, we will NEVER return value directly to a shareholder.\"  You are effectively purchasing a share of something for $10 that will NEVER send you any money that you can deposit into your bank account.\n\nNow yes, over time the price may go up and down, as all things do, but whoever buys it, for whatever price, will only ever realize value if you/they can sell it to someone else for more than they paid.  At a certain point, you have to ask, \"why do I want to buy a thing I can't touch, that I can't enjoy really, and that will never give me any of my money back?\"  And of course, the answer is, you wouldn't.\n\nSo why does AMZN have value, they don't pay a dividend?  The answer is because people believe that at some point they will pay a dividend, and it will be quite sizeable compared to what they paid initially, and they are willing to wait for that day to come.  If AMZN came out tomorrow and said \"we're putting it in our bylaws that we will never EVER return a single penny to any shareholders directly in the form of dividends.\" the price would plummet most likely (or at least it should).\n\nToday you would pay \\~$3700 for much more than that if you hold forever, and are willing to let the company continue to grow without returning value directly because by doing so you are betting that when they do start returning value directly it will be that much better (growth phase).\n\nMany companies do both - return some value now, and keep some to continue growing the business, but the part they keep is only palatable to investors because it means the dividend will grow over time, so while it may be a $0.01/qtr now, next year it will be more, and in 10 years it will be quite a bit more.\n\nBRK again is a special setup, where part of the contract is that nobody gets paid until they leave the group, and then they get their equal share in that moment, and all at once instead of every quarter, but since they are collecting actual revenue streams from outside, that alone props up the share prices.

And think it couldn't possibly be that Tesla was 12x up in a year and rising, the S&P 500 bought a substantial amount of the free floating shares, followed by institutional investors, causing a squeeze putting Tesla up to $900... And, at the same time, Tesla (who was run by Musk who was at the time the richest man in the world) invested in BTC, which gave an asset with questionable value more legitimacy, thus making that asset rise aswell.

A third company, Dynetics, bid $9 billion.\n\nBezos faulted NASA for giving the award solely to Musk's company, noting, 'Instead of investing in two competing lunar landers as originally intended, the Agency chose to confer a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar head start to SpaceX. That decision broke the mold of NASA's successful commercial space programs by putting an end to meaningful competition for years to come.'\n\nTo sweeten the deal, Bezos offered to waive all payments in the current fiscal year and in the next two.\n\n'This offer is not a deferral, but is an outright and permanent waiver of those payments,' he wrote. 'This offer provides time for government appropriation actions to catch up.'\n\nRelated Link: American Airlines Flight Encounters UFO Over New Mexico\n\nWhat Happens Next: According to a report in Space News, Blue Origin and Dynetics filed protests with the Government Accountability Office regarding the HLS contract to SpaceX. The federal agency has until Aug. 4 to rule on the protests.\n\nAs a result of the filed protests, Nelson told a July 21 webinar that the SpaceX contract 'is held in abeyance right now as it is contested. We're expecting an announcement in the next few weeks and, on the basis of that, we will then proceed.'\n\nSeparately, NASA awarded SpaceX a $178 million contract to launch a spacecraft to Europea, one of Jupiter's moons. The mission, known as Europa Clipper, will take off in October 2024 and is scheduled to fly past Europa 45 times.\n\n© 2021 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Much smart. \n\nI made a post the other day laying exactly how predictable SPY has been the last year. There’s an 8+ day correction every single month. So, if the current month hasn’t had a correction and you have 2 red days in a row with decreasing highs, you’re most likely looking at a correction. Sell, wait 5 days, buy back in. Simple. \n\nThe reason most people say to hold through corrections is that most corrections are unpredictable, short lived, and small scale. Without exception, all recessions are predictable, long lived, and large scale. The COVID crash was predictable the previous October. The 2008 crash actually started in 2007. For every recession, there are multiple warning signs preceding it that everyone ignores. Without fail, there’s always someone saying afterwards “there’s no way to have seen this coming!” Bullshit.\n\nGlass-Steagall was passed after the Great Depression. By the 90s, the only main part of it that remained was that commercial banks and investment banks had to be entirely separate. The explicitly stated purpose of that rule was to make it so that no business could become “too big to fail”. Yes, in the 1930s, Congress explicitly passed law to prevent that specific thing from happening. Or rather, happening ***again***. Since that’s pretty much the exact reason the Crash caused the Great Depression. \n\nBut Citicorp and Traveler’s Group wanted to merge. Actually, they literally started the merger when it was illegal. They called up Bill Clinton who promptly repealed Glass-Steagall with bipartisan support. Cue the 2008 crash, allowed by repealing the law explicitly passed to prevent such a thing. Literally predictable. \n\nCredit default swaps were created in the 90s, but they were very limited in scope because of Glass-Steagall. Commercial banks couldn’t do swaps on mortgages. Thanks to Clinton, they know could. Mega banks were using default swaps as a rudimentary form of insurance. If a person defaults, the selling banks pays me off. This allowed banks to over leverage by under reporting risk. To be fair, they didn’t realize they were under reporting risk because they’re all fucking idiots. \n\nDodd-Frank fixed nothing. Literally all it did was limit who could qualify for a loan. No separation between commercial and investment banks. Default swaps still legal. Notably, it added language saying bailouts were essentially illegal. Which was repealed to bailout businesses last year. \n\nNow we have definitive evidence banks are overleveraged. Glass-Steagall is gone. Credit default swaps are legal. Literally the exact conditions that caused the 2008 crash. \n\nWe will continue to have crashes every 10-15 years until credit default swaps are made illegal or commercial and investment banks are separated once again. Glass-Steagall repealed in 1999. Crash in 2008. Crash in 2020. \n\nPotential crash in the 2021-2022 range. It’s actually possible we still haven’t recovered from the 2020 crash and quantitative easing is actually prolonging the recession. Which would track with the mountain of evidence that quantitative easing and low interest rates produces economic stagnation a la Japan. \n\nCue the Bernanke quotes that ignore that the Fed was trying to push the repeal of Glass-Steagall well before Clinton repealed it. The Fed doesn’t give a shit if they crash the economy. They have zero oversight and essentially unlimited authority, which has exceeded that of the federal government more than once.

In his view, rising home prices induced banks to increase their home mortgage lending and, in turn, increased lending helped drive up home prices. Without a check on rising prices, this resulted in a price bubble, which eventually collapsed, resulting in the financial crisis and Great Recession.\n\nNow if we are in a bubble where margin borrowing is at all time highs and those prices collapse there will be a lot of people that will lose a lot of money.

Not sure where it all came from but seems like a lot of hate towards Jews existed and exists today.  Hitler obviously wasn't big on Jews.\n\nWhat I know is that they were a group of peoples.  There was I think Isaac and Ishmael sons of Abraham.  Ones ancestors became the arabs, the other the jews.\n\nThen the Jews got forced out of their land in the diaspora by I think it was maybe the byzanite or assyrian empires.  Something like that.  And they were forced to leave but they seemed to kind of stay in groups.  So as they settled places, they had their own little Jewish communities.  And they preferred families to stay Jewish, so they only married other Jews.  But ya there were places I was reading in Russia called the pale of settlement.  I think.  And this was a fairly large region in Russia where Jews were technically allowed into Russia but only up to a certain distance from the western border.    \nSo I can see how this would foster some xenophobia.  You have your own people that you're used to seeing.  You speak a certain way, you have your culture, your language etc.  Then over that line, theres a big group of people who showed up and are foreign.  Everything is alien.

Its so strange, but this family figuratively invented currency or at least banking.  The biggest Mansions in the EU most spectacular creations were built by the Rothschilds and that was hundreds of years ago too.  Then you have a lot of Jews today who hold powerful positions in companies too like Zuck.  So maybe some of it has to do with jealousy as well.  But I think the reason Jews did good is because they had a history with many rules.  Like the Torah right there are many ways you're supposed to live your life.
