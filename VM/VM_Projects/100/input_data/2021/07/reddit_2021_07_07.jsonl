When trading options, just as when you’re trading stocks, it’s critical to control your emotions. That doesn’t necessarily mean you need to have ice flowing through your veins, but fear and greed should not be the driving force in your trading decisions.\r  \nAlways have a trading plan, and always stick to your plan. And no matter what your emotions are telling you to do, don’t deviate from it.\r  \n**How you can trade smarter**\r  \nPlan your exit on winning trades, and cut your losses when your trades go wrong. You should always have an exit plan, period – even when a trade is going your way. You need to choose your upside exit point, and downside exit point in advance.\r  \nBut it’s important to keep in mind, with options you need more than upside and downside price targets. You also need a keen awareness of time, which is a key factor in options trading.\r  \nRemember that Options are a decaying asset. And that rate of decay accelerates as your expiration date approaches. So if you’re long a call or put and the move you predicted doesn’t happen within the time period expected, get out and move on to the next trade.\r  \nTime decay doesn’t always have to hurt you, of course. When you sell options, you’re putting time decay to work for you. In other words, you’re successful if time decay erodes the option’s price, and you get to keep the premium received for the sale. But keep in mind that this premium is your maximum profit, if you’re short a call or put. The downside is that if you sell naked options, you are exposed to potentially substantial risk if the trade goes awry.\r  \nThe bottom line is that you must have a plan to get out of any trade, no matter what kind of strategy you’re running, or whether it’s a winner or a loser. Don't hang around on profitable trades because you're greedy, or stay way too long in losers because you’re hoping the trade will move back in your favor. Cut your losses and move on.\r  \n**What if you get out too early and leave some upside on the table?**\r  \nThis is the classic trader’s worry, and it’s often used as a rationale for not sticking with an original plan.  The best goal is to try to trade consistently and make a profit. So you need to reduce your incidence of losses, so you can sleep better at night.\r  \nTrading with a plan helps you establish more successful patterns of trading, and keeps your emotions in check. Sure, trading can be exciting, but you don’t trade for excitement, you trade to make a profit. So make your plan in advance, and then stick to it like super glue.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "This is all really great advice! Thank you!

Commodity anything are cyclical as they ramp up production when the expectation is that the economy will grow. This then leads to overproduction and ultimately low prices due to supply and demand. Take a look at the MU chart the past decade (or even longer) to get an idea of this. Granted, the memory industry is now an oligopoly, and some would argue we are in a multi-year up-cycle due to technological advances, so the cycles may be much more contained. \n\nI would advise looking more into the companies you listed. The fact that you list these stocks together kind of hints to me that you don't really understand them other than that they are in the semiconductor industry. I see many posts suggesting a stock because of how great their quarter and guidance are, but please remember the market is forward looking; chances are that great guidance is already priced in. \n\nIn regards to your MU, TSM comment, just realize that there's probably a reason they are lower valued. My two cents for why they aren't trading at multiples like the others are: MU - commodity products as I mentioned in the first paragraph. As such, you can't expect them to trade at a growth premium like AMD since they don't control their price. DRAM by Micron is not better than DRAM by Samsung. People pick which to buy based on price. TSM - may be accounting for the political risk of China invading Taiwan. TSM is also an independent, pure-play foundry. Their entire capacity is already being utilized so you could say their growth is capped and already priced in. For them to grow more, they would have to increase capex and build more foundries. This takes months/years to complete.\n\nTL;DR: Not saying MU, TSM can't rise more, but not for the argument you mentioned.\n\nGood luck!", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Memory demand still an up trend to at least mid 2023, like you said the market is forward looking, do you think Micron 90% forecasted growth next year is already priced in ?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I have no idea how much is priced in. But some things to think about: \n\n1) The memory demand uptrend you mentioned is a view widely held. So I would think that it is mostly priced in, discounted for uncertainty. If this was not a widely accepted belief, then perhaps I would not say it is that priced in. If you want to make safe investments you have to catch things before others know about it, not after. Granted, it could be that in reality the uptrend is actually even greater, in which case you would also be right in investing now.\n\n2) How sure are you of that uptrend all the way to 2023? Can anyone even be that sure? If the uptrend fails to materialize, what is the downside risk? Put simplistically, let's say that 80% of this uptrend is priced in. Yes, there may be another 20% of the uptrend that isn't priced in, but what's the downside risk? It could be pretty significant relative to the additional upside. Why chase this one stock if the risk/reward is not favorable?\n\n3) Let's just say the uptrend holds true. But as a commodity product, it's price (and indirectly its earnings) are set by supply and demand. The memory companies are not going to maintain current production levels if they are confident of that uptrend. So really you also have to consider how much supply will be increased as well. If one of the memory companies overproduce, they can completely eliminate the benefits of the demand uptrend. There is no OPEC equivalent to manage the supply to stabilize prices (not that I'm aware of, could be wrong).\n\nPlease don't take this as me saying not to invest in MU, I have not done the research.

{"title": "Why Biden's Infrastructure Plan is NOT a ticket to tendie town", "selftext": "Im an engineer, but Im also an idiot.  I literally almost flunked out cuz i was too dumb. I ended up in construction because i couldnt do anything else engineering related.  Take this opinion at your own risk because I might be talking out of my ass.  \n\nI'm in construction, specifically on the municipality side (yea im *that* city worker) so I'm the one administering the federal infrastructure funds at the ground level. To date I've administered millions in federal funds on \"infrastructure\". Infrastructure is by definition the least sexiest thing.  Everyone shits, but we'd all prefer to not deal with it, that's infrastructure.  Here are a bunch of very common sense reasons why this isnt going to cash in. \n\n* I see a lot of posts about steel, concrete and other raw materials.  Clearly these are from people who know fuck all about infrastructure.  I'd argue that if you're looking to invest into Biden's infrastructure plan you should be looking at the other end of this supply chain.  Who do you think is more profitable, the no name company that supplies the raw material for 1 component of an iphone or Apple? If youre looking to jump onto the infrastructure bandwagon, I'd be looking at construction companies or engineering firms.\n* But companies are also not a great bet. contractors and trades are specialized.  The company that paves the street is not the same one that does traffic signal upgrades.  An electrician is not going to do laborers work.  Large companies will need(either by choice or requirement) to subcontract out certain specialized portions thus diluting overall tendies. not to mention that profits are capped.  markup % is often literally defined.  \"Oh no Mr. Contractor you have a problem?  fuck you, sucks to be you\" (this is one of my favorite parts of the job). Not to mention that projects are parsed to all the states and from there into certain sizes in order to further dilute the tendies.  State and local governments may have additional requirements that even further dilute the tendies.  The government is trying boost an industry and the economy at large, not a few companies.  The literal idea of the plan is to trickle money across the country.  If you look at this fountain that slowly trickles down, if you place your cup in any one spot you're just gonna get a few drops. \n* Infrastructure means nothing because it means everything.  It could be streetlight poles in which case steel is very very relevant, or it could be a fucking sidewalk in which case steel is not important at all. If you just open your eyes when you go outside (huge ask i know) you will see that infrastructure is extremely varied. \n* Many of us with ties to the industry are feeling delays and back orders, but this is logistics related.  These issues were around before the infra plan and will remain after. I think the idea behind these \"DDs\" on raw materials is because they think this infrastructure plan will increase demand on an already limited supply thus driving prices and profits up.  Nevermind the contracting aspect of this money(a lot of it is fixed for a certain amount of time), Supply and demand still rules, but solving the global supply chain logistics will also increase supply. The supply chain logistical issues are a larger and more importantly, independent, factor.  \n* Also surprise surprise Biden's infrastructure plan, while maybe bigger, isnt special. Trump had infrastructure plans and so did Obama.  Infrastructure is ALWAYS happening.  As i said, everyone shits and it doesnt stop.  Infrastructure never stops, you can try to clench your sphincter closed and it'll work for a lil while, but eventually you shit.  Its the same thing with infrastructure spending.  Biden's plan is not the big demand surge people think it is. \n* I think a lot of people underestimate the timescale of infrastructure.  it takes time to build shit and it takes even more time to renovate shit cuz you cant just blow it up and start over. Most people cannot shit on command and those that can dont do it instantly. This aint China.  We're not gonna build a covid hospital in 48 hours( mostly cuz our work isnt made out of garbage tofu-strength concrete but that is another topic). This shit is going to take YEARS. I will see Biden infrastructure money at my level 1-2 years from now and will start spending it 3-5 years from now. Think about this, after the money is secured someone gotta design the damn thing, someone gotta the draw the picture so my dumbass who cant read can knows what is supposed to be built.  Those assholes always fuck up too and they are the smart ones!!!  This isnt even mentioning how raw material suppliers, product suppliers, construction companies, design firms, are only a part of this timescale. \n* One dude can only use 1 shovel at at time, can operate one piece of equipment at a time. The pipe maker can only make pipes so fast and those pipes can only be installed so fast.  There is no exponential factor in infrastructure like there is in tech.  An app can be downloaded millions of times in a single night. You only shit one poop at a time. \n\nTl;dr.  Infrastructure is like pooping. Everyone does it, it is always happening. Trying to cash in on infrastructure is trying to cash in on pooping. You can only poop so fast and so much, the supply demand is capped. You only shit one poop at a time.  Sure you get diarrhea sometimes but even then it has its limits. You cant cash in on analogous dry heaves. Infrastructure is regular, so in the long term investing in this industry is probably a smart move.  As long as humans are alive they are going to shit and if there are more humans tomorrow than there are today then there will be more shit, but if that is your tendie making strategy why are you even here?", "id": "ofcwca", "created_utc": 1625637222.0, "score": 317, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|11|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So calls on porta potties?", "score": 99, "replies": [{"body": "🤣😂 tldr porta potties and dumpsters?", "score": 20, "replies": []}, {"body": "For a good time, call OP", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not a bad idea if there’s any publicly traded port-o-stonks", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "We must construct additional porta potties", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "I actually LOLed", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "We require more natural gas.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "why would i lie about that", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Not a lot of people would, but on the internet nobody knows you're a dog.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Lol.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Loading up on poop", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "Calls on poop", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "My portfolio is all poop already.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Wow, you're long poop?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I’ve always been long on poop", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This should be re-flaired as a shitpost.", "score": 26, "replies": []}, {"body": "This guy says essentially that if someone needs more money his favorite part of the job is to say fuck you, i need more money so I’m wondering if this post is a big fuck you?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Infrastructure run by unions = no real infrastructure built; just lots of spending into unions to buy the votes from them for the next tally round.", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Not sure why this was downvoted.

If the CCP wanted American and foreign investors to lose the maximum right out of the gate, they could not have timed this move any better. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose substantial risks to the company’s operations or business. Is there any credible evidence to suggest Didi execs were completely unaware the app was at risk of an imminent shutdown when the company filed its 10-K?\n\nSomeone lied. It's either the CCP or Didi itself (which, let's be honest, is likely little more than an alter ego for the CCP anyways, given the usual governmental presence required on boards and the like).\n\nThis lack of reciprocity cannot continue. The US government cannot and should not let Chinese companies list here unless they meet the same disclosure requirements that American companies meet under the prevailing securities acts and implementing regulations. Foreign investors in China must have access to the Chinese courts to litigate securities fraud actions, just as happens here on the flipside in the US (recall that Huawei/CCP was able to judicially challenge the Trump Administration's proposed ban in American court).\n\nUnless and until that happens, the lesson is clear: stay away from Chinese offerings. The CCP shows once again it has absolutely no qualms about deceiving and pulling the rug on foreign investors. This is definitely part of a larger pattern of the CCP flexing on foreign investors (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip\\_jack/gi0cl58/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip_jack/gi0cl58/); [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla\\_gang\\_heavy\\_sigh\\_of\\_relief\\_dont\\_want\\_to\\_get/ghuxevt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla_gang_heavy_sigh_of_relief_dont_want_to_get/ghuxevt/)).

Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. But more to the point, with respect to all of these, the US has securities fraud laws to protect investors here; if they've been injured, and lies or fraudulent statements were made, then the offending company can be haled into court to answer for it, \\*including\\* by foreigners who invested in them. Theranos, like Enron, has even spawned a criminal process in addition to the civil one.\n\nTell me: do you, as a foreigner, have the right to demand a judicial remedy in Chinese court against the CCP or a SOE for, e.g., fraudulently rugpulling the VIE structure? Do you, as a foreign investor, have the right to hale Luckin Coffee into Chinese court for securities fraud?\n\nThere is no reciprocity. And that's the nub of the problem. As a foreign investor in China, you will get burned, and \\*there is nothing you can do about it\\* (unlike foreign investors here in the US).\n\n2. Ohh, silly person, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry. Recall the National Security Law and Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed. The CCP more likely envisions itself as Bruce Willis in this scene from Die Hard 4: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps) . Yes, it injures itself, but it weakens or takes out its foreign competition in the process. The CCP has shown time and again it's more concerned above all else with consolidating its power. It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.\n\nEdit\n\nINB4 no. 3: You and this post are racist. It’s racist to point out that either the CCP or Didi is bilking investors here of all ethnicities and creeds? I think not. Moreover, this is a common wumao tactic often used on social media. They’ve learned they can deflect from the CCP’s misdeeds by crying any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist.\n\nEdit edit:\nHell, let’s go even further! Assume I am indeed a racist (I’m not). How does that factually alter, rebut, or contend with the substance of *anything* I’ve said here?\n\nEdit edit edit: \n\nINB4 no. 4: You can take Chinese companies to Chinese court for securities fraud. All right. Now consider the following: A big reason for this latest Didi fiasco is, the US demanded that Chinese companies comply with typical US disclosure requirements. And this reluctance on China's part to disclose is because of the way the government has permeated the larger companies, so it refuses based on national security grounds. https://www.ft.com/content/feb85200-a7f1-4cab-bc8e-f02cd6fd0590\n\nGiven this linkage between the state and enterprise, and given the state's preoccupation with national security, an injured foreign investor likely wouldn't be able to obtain the information in discovery needed to make his case; it would all be withheld in the interests of safeguarding information related to \"national security\". The courthouse doors may as well be shut given such flimsy process. Not so here in the US, where there is no such outright permeation of the government in publicly-traded companies.\n\nEdit Edit Edit Edit: I do not have a position in Didi--have not bought or sold a single share or contract.\n\nEdit x 5.

There are two chinese guys who own most of the shares outstanding Zhitao He and Fred Chang, owning approximately 60.91% and 35.98%, collectively 96.90% of the company,  so Zhitao owns about  224,394,452 shares and Fred owns about 130,724,530 shares. The shareholders of Newegg before the merger own  1.31% of shares outstanding, so 4,759,564. Leaving the public float  1.79%, aka 6,503,527. In the form they say that they are authorized to issue 6,250,000 common shares with 4,736,111 as Class A (aka the shit we can trade), and 1,513,889  as Class B. As of the filling of this form (May 12 2021)  there were 3,465,683 common shares outstanding. The float directly offered to the public is 2,729,755 out of the 3,465,683 and the float that the underwriter owns is around 735,928.\n\n*Unsure about the chinese risk F-1 & edgar forms getting hard to read only sure about float ---to be continue*\n\n**See below for a summary of the offering**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkcspsllzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd66f13230a50746b85f8202c7c7139a6ac37919\n\n**Shout out to** u/GhostOfGregDoucette **for figuring out the float was funky**\n\n# When does lockup end?\n\nWell according to the SEC form that summarizes the investors rights ([link](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-21-027834/)) lockup ends 180days after the closing of the merge. The [merger was closed on May 20, 2021](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474627/000121390021027815/ea141330ex99-1_neweggcomme.htm), and 180days from May 20th is November 15th. Now my mans Zhitao He is a bitch, straight up owned by the Bank of China, in the filling it explicitly says Zhitao pledged all his shares as collateral so he wouldn’t get double tapped. So that’s 60.91% of the shares that we really don’t have to worry about, even though we never really had to worry since lock up ends in November. Fred Chang is a boss, probably counting down the days when he can sell his shares, travel to Tulum, and start drinking soy milk latte’s, do ketamine, and  meditate and be zen while sporting his Jesus robe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h8313lpmzt971.jpg?width=794&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65cb39022acd9cb74d657c77dcdd30e082bd84c5\n\n# What about the squeeze\n\nSo we have verified that the float is between \\[2,729,755, 3,465,683\\], which is the smallest number I’ve actually ever seen for a company. How squeezy is it? Well I came across this company doing a completely different analysis. I was interested in failure-to-deliver data that the SEC provides and what it could tell me. You see recently there have been alot of seemingly random stocks popping. Me and some others share the opinion that it’s due to NSCC-2021-002 being implemented a couple weeks ago, and rule DTCC-2021-005  being implemented a couple months ago. See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/user/jn_ku/comments/m4fnfg/gamestop_moass_no_tinfoil_hat_required/) to see it’s significance for all the meme’s we know and love. So I got all the FTD data from the SEC from 08/2020 - 06/2021 (1st half of June) from the [SEC’s website](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm), and calculated FTD/Float for all the meme stocks we know and love, and some rando stocks that popped recently as well. For $NEGG I calculated the float to be the midpoint of average of the two number, 3m.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[i meant 6\\/15\\/2021  whoops](https://preview.redd.it/vypk6jmnzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d2574130393469dc40d032dbd92d62d9aff4ef0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[i meant 6\\/15\\/2021  whoops](https://preview.redd.it/a6mvd6nnzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6ede5517207f88c05781718371d6ec37428b6a6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI gave the outliers colors, and all the other stocks grey scale. So yup your hunch is correct shit has become more volatile after cooling down a bit after the GME squeeze. Outliers usually are the most volatile stocks, GME/AMC  ftd data was screaming “look at me” before the actual pop in shortly after. $NEGG is screaming the same thing right now.\n\nLet’s consider Ortex data and its relation to FTDs. Ortex doesn’t have a API and if it did I don’t have time to look at it so I’m doing a spot check. So let’s pick a random stock say $SENS\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnrmnlyozt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4babb5f83a72ccdb9fcf1470c7beb0b6090f8d04\n\nThe average loan age hit one of it’s peaks on June 7th at 54.23days,  so a good amount of loans were taken out on around April 14  (*54days before June 7th*). Go back to the FTD graph search for $SENS, the peak of \\* \\`FTD as a percentage of Float\\` almost exactly lines up\\*. Let’s try another one, $GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf9dy4rpzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4e2186f0090584cb6efa7aa170577533fcc5f18\n\nPeak of average loan age at Jan 25 2021 of 85days, placing the date on Nov 25th, the FTD graph shows this as well. Ok, last one let’s check $UWMC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8jm3pzeqzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2219785964acacb666a42e2e77e707838a59a93\n\n$UWMC had a peak of avg loan age on Jun 10th, subtract 41days from that day and you get April 29th lining up pretty well with $UWMC largest FTD spike.\n\nOk so I’m basically saying that for stocks without data on ortex you can get a sense of where the shorts have opened positions by looking at the peaks of ftds. I only checked stocks with relatively large peaks as a percentage of float idk about others. So basically for $NEGG there has been a considerable amount of short positions opened May 15 - Jun 15, these guys are underwater.\n\nNext notice that GME FTD spike wasn’t the day that the tendie god turned on the money printer that magical January, it was actually in November. Every stock that has reach GME level of \\`FTD % of Float\\` moons later, the spike never really lines up with the dildo to heaven. It could happen a week later, months later, days later, but it seems that for the outliers its going to happen. $NEGG is in the middle of a squeeze and its FTD spike rival stocks that have gone +200 to +400% during the moonshot. The smaller the float and the higher the spike, the more the pop. I haven’t quantified this.\n\nIf you checked interactive brokers during the day you would have noticed that $NEGG had 0 shares available to short, and the borrow rate is >50%. At peak squeeze borrow rate usually spikes >100%. Lastly, in the last two days the short volume ratio has gone up by a factors & volume has gone up as well\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k32u8odrzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8700f42420fd701af7899bffd6551844984163d\n\nOne thing I failed to mention is that the stock is already expensive to buy -- $20 -- ensuring that doubling down on shorting requires substantial capital. Looking at iborrowdesk.com we see that nice juicy slow creep up of borrow rate, and reduction of shares available to borrow, while the price slow bleeds up. So $negg is expensive to double down on and it expensive to borrow. Now look at your fave stock that has squeezed borrow rate   > 100% rn $negg borrow is a moderate \\[50%? Need check\\]. So basically what I’m saying is that $NEGG is in the beginning to mid part of a squeeze. Not a squeeze perpetuated by a hardened group of loyalist and propelled by whales. A squeeze caused by a <3.5m shares float, while all the exchanges having the wrong information, the realization is happening that there were barely any shares to begin with. This will be like a bank run, and I don’t have a logical price target. It could go up to $70.\n\nLastly, for squeezes price instability is needed aka liquidity is drying up. If you’ve been watching the intraday movements at all, with wide bid/ask spreads and limited orderbook. This plus increases in historic volatility indicated price instability/liquidity drying up.\n\nLiquidity/ price instability is one of the main characteristics in which you can identify a squeeze; in general it indicate future volatility either a big move up or down, (too many buyers smashing the ask button, or too many sellers smashing the bid button) but we have enough information to identify the direction\n\nSee this wrinklebrain comments for more info about liquidity:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o37n9h/weekend\\_discussion\\_jun\\_19\\_20/h2idegc?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o37n9h/weekend_discussion_jun_19_20/h2idegc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o83chk/weekend\\_discussion\\_jun\\_26\\_27/h39t83c?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/o83chk/weekend_discussion_jun_26_27/h39t83c?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nNote that if I had something better than thinkorswim I would be looking for the barcoding [candlestick pattern](https://www.google.com/search?q=barcoding+stocks&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS908US908&oq=barcoding+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0j46i175i199j0l7.2849j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) oh well, have close enough approximations that indicate that its happening.\n\n*Asking around for ActiveTick data to see if this pattern exists, to be continued….*\n\n# Technicals\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/as1fpqlszt971.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=513c1003e2662c1276386a8c019371a931b23708\n\nThis Cup and Handle makes me get a little chubby dude.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nThis is the part i care least about,but it feels good to not yolo on a shit company (sorry $RIDE hodlers).\n\nNewegg has been a one stop shop for PC building for years.

I love Newegg as a company, and I'm freaking amped that they're public, so full disclosure, I've got biases. That being said, I think it's a solid buy. It seems only one analyst has really put a price target on it. I don't know who the analyst is, but any google search for a price target pings back the same, beautiful, 44$ prediction, spread across all of our favorite market commentators. (WSJ, Market Watch, Yahoo) If that's not enough to get you excited, we go to their financials. In 2016 they made a measly 13M$. 2017 came around, and they made an abysmal 1M$. 2018, though? 2.15B$. Mind you, they went from making 1Million dollars... to 2.1 BBillion. 2019, and 2020 were both in the 2 Billion dollar range. (Via WSJ) And now? GPU prices are inflated to high hell, son! Despite that, Newegg seems to be able to Earnings announcement is going to be fantastic! Lastly, let's take a look at technicals. Yesterday and the day before, NEGG had a huge run up! Literally having doubled its price at one point. (Ran from 10$ to 21$ before coming back down.) In that time, it showed strong support at 13. I thought we might see 13$ again today. Besides that, it showed support yesterday, at it's first dip, at 15$, bounced from there up to 19.5, before getting rejected. After it's rejection, it showed support at 16.75 for AH/PM, at 15.75$ for the intraday low. AND THEN IT BOUNCED BACK TO 17.75! If we break down under 15$, We might see 13$, again. Right now, it's gearing up to retest 21$. A rejection from that will likely put us back in this 17.75 range. If we break that 21$ resistance? Then we might get a test of 22$. We might see another gamma squeeze as brokers start hedging for the 22.5$ Calls.\n\n*(btw he’s off about the gamma sqz; options just got introduced, everything else is interesting)*\n\nIt also has some recent good news: [https://www.tomshardware.com/news/neweggs-new-pc-building-service-might-hold-stock-on-rare-components-behind-pre-assembly-paywall](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/neweggs-new-pc-building-service-might-hold-stock-on-rare-components-behind-pre-assembly-paywall)\n\n# Positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/no2woixuzt971.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=04fa15e546fc8ae511df1879c0e5833437cdf097\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykjovwnvzt971.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca9370ca929c3ecec2f8b46ad4bbeb70c711442e\n\nI’m risky af probably better positions out there, took out 20k yesterday (Jul 6, 2021), positions above are as of of pre-market July 7.\n\nThe 13 $30 calls bought Jul 6, 2021for about $3 a pop, end of day they were $6.3, high of $8.1.

The Workhorse COO is the former Director of Fleet Operations for Sysco, whose 14,000 vehicle fleet is largely 1000 cubic ft Refrigerated Trucks.  Their HQ is right next to Kroger's HQ btw.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short, I think Workhorse is in the first inning of their growth stage right now. I truly see this stock retesting its highs by early next year. There are a lot of first mover advantages and spaces where there is NO competition. As they continue to develop, go through the legal processes and progress their product line, they will gain market share and big name customers.
