Basically the in person clientele and delivery service clientele are not highly correlated.

McDonald’s and Chipotle wouldn’t be on there if they were getting ripped off. (Obviously economies of scale play a role but the point stands)\n\nLastly, as a consumer, you’re paying for a service. Why would you not expect to pay for the convenience of getting food delivered to your door? And if DD is connecting new consumers and orders to a restaurant, why as a restaurant would you not expect to pay commissions to this middle man?

All that matters at any speed is power. \n\n\nPower = Torque x angular velocity (both at the crank/motor output shaft)\n\n\nFor a mass to accelerate, energy must be added to that mass. The function of velocity with respect to energy input is governed by v= sqrt(2E/m)\n\n\nThe acceleration of mass doesn't care about torque, or angular velocity of the engine. The acceleration of mass is only influenced by the increase in kinetic energy. This energy increased with respect to time is the power input to the system. \n\nThat's not to say the misconception is complete bullshit, though. When an engine/car \"feels\" torquey, what is actually meant is that the power output of the motor at low speeds is quite high. Yes, high power at low RPM means higher relative torque; but my point is that it's the power delivered that matters, not the torque. \n\nDiesel engines tend to deliver good power at lower RPMs due to higher compression ratios (which means they can output more torque at low speeds). It's not the torque causing acceleration though, it's the power. The powercurve (measured in power per rpm) is flatter.  \n\n\nLikewise, a high performance petrol engine with a turbo tends to have lower power at slower engine speeds (less torque output, and turbo lag etc), but higher power at higher engine speeds. The powercurve is more progressive. This is due to several factors - petrol has a faster combustion (higher flame speed), and continues to extract more power as the piston speed increases. Whereas a diesel engine piston starts to reach the diesel flame speed towards max rpm (therefore less force on the piston)\n\n\nVery brief overview, and probably not necessary. I just tire of hearing that torque means better acceleration, which isn't technically correct. \n\n\nAlso, a good clutch can offset some of the lower power at lower RPMs issue by allowing the engine to run at its peak power whilst slipping the clutch- not very efficient as a lot of energy is lost in clutch friction. \n\n\nFinally, an electric motor produces its maximum torque at 0 rpm, and it's maximum power typically much earlier than a combustion engine would (hence the faster acceleration). The electronic motor also has a big drop off in power output towards max rpm, as the torque tends to zero, whilst a petrol engine typically generates peak power close to maximum rpm.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This guy torques.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Performance hybrids… best of both worlds.

There is enough water for the planned start of production in July, state Environment Minister Axel Vogel (Greens) told the ZDF magazine \"Frontal 21.\" According to the report, Tesla will initially consume around 1.4 million cubic meters of water per year from summer 2021.  \n>  \n>\"And if it were to go beyond that, then developments might not happen,\" Vogel explained. That water is a limiting factor for factory expansion is a risk Tesla is aware of, the minister emphasized.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Environmentalists and local residents had already pointed out the water problem. They also see protected animals such as sand lizards and smooth snakes in danger from the car factory. The Brandenburg authorities involved are still examining objections to the project and are also taking into account the arguments presented at a hearing last fall.  \nTesla CEO Elon Musk, who also wants to build the world's largest battery factory on the site, is relaxed about the reservations about his project, particularly the water issue. \"Basically, we are not in a very dry region,\" he told ZDF television. \"Trees wouldn't grow if there was no water,\" Musk said. \"I mean, we're not in the desert here.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso pissing off German bureaucrats is not the smartest move. I can tell you, they are pretty lenient. Normally they would have told Tesla to rip all those pipes out of the ground and wait for the permit. Also handling mineral oil in a water protection area is a huge no-no. From elementary school on it's ingrained in our little German brains how one drop of oil contaminates thousands of cubic meters of water.

Among other things, the city of Sangerhausen had been obliged to initiate a breeding station for the hamsters due to the intervention of conservationists. Otherwise, no permit would have been granted for the new building of the bicycle manufacturer.The construction of the breeding station will cost more than 800,000 euros. In addition, according to the city, there are about 150,000 euros per year for the operation of the station.\n\nThat's north of $1,000,000 just for relocating hamsters. A few years ago, IKEA had to pay 150,000€ to relocate hamsters, a housing project had to pay 350,000€ for relocating hamsters plus yearly fees for the farmers they have to rent the new living area for the hamsters from. And that's just for hamsters. I was baffled Tesla didn't have to relocate those lizards and snakes.\n\nOther issues that could have pushed back the factory for years or even decades:\n\n\\- archeological sites: if they would have found a historical site, they would have had some state-archeologists cartographing the site, preserving items and what not. Plan to build something in a German historical city? A near 100% chance your project gets pushed back several years due to that. Also you cannot prevent archeologists from inspecting your construction sites and for certain areass it is mandatory to include them in the planning process.\n\n\\- WW2 bombs/explosive ordenance disposal: around 100,000 -250,000 bombs have been dropped on Germany during WW2, it's assumed around 10% of them didn't detonate. In high risk areas, it is mandatory that specialists inspect / analyze the whole area. Example: there were several bomb scares while rebuilding the train station in Münster. They found a suspicious object below several meters of concrete. They had to scrape the concrete off without causing any vibrations It took more than one year. In the end, it was just an old upside down bath-tub.\n\nSo yeah, Tesla factory building  is going pretty smooth, for German standards.

Maybe I just got lucky, or maybe the reports are overblown, I can't say. But in my experience:\n\n\\- Handling and performance: When I bought the Tesla, I kept an older Porsche Boxster as my \"fun car\" -- but really, for me the Tesla is more responsive and much more fun to drive. I suspect that if you're a true \"car guy\" who really, truly enjoys driving for its own sake, maybe you'll feel differently.\n\n\\- Fit/finish: Never had any issues. No squeaks or rattles. Visibly, my car looks great both from a distance and up close. It's entirely possible that some panel gaps are a little off, but I've never noticed. I also haven't ever specifically checked or measured. I don't think most people go over their cars with a measuring tool to check things like that, but if you're the kind of car owner who does, you may find something to be unhappy about. :-)\n\n\\- Mechanical things: Nothing has broken on my car, ever. Only abnormal thing I've experienced is that one of the power windows seemed like it had gone \"off track\" for a while, and I had scheduled a service call for them to come to my house and fix it, but then the problem disappeared on its own.\n\n\\- Weird software issues: I've never experienced phantom acceleration or braking, or cruise control suddenly engaging or turning off.

In two years of driving the car almost every day, I've had two instances where the screen turned off and the sofware restarted for no obvious reason. Both were more than a year ago.\n\n\\- Maintenance and such: I don't think people talk enough about this.

No oil (or transmission fluid, or brake fluid) changes, no tuneups, no spark plug changes, no worry about engine coolant.

Massive SG&A spending to push sales through door to door and other high cost methods, PERIODICALLY but not systemically, caused quarters where the cash flow ended up negative after debt service was covered.\n\nMy entire point is that the cash coming in, Solarcity doesn't own and therefore could not be used for SG&A or debt or whatever sort of operational expenditure you want to discuss. It was restricted cash that was collected for and transferred to the VIE entity. That is why Solarcity was on a deathspiral of taking out debt to pay operational expenditures.\n\nMaybe an easier way to understand how non-controlling interests (NCIs) work is using a different example. \n\nLet's go with the example of an asset manager. ArkInvest has cash coming in the door from their clients, but cash must be used to purchase investments on the clients behalf. Ark isn't allowed to use their clients money to pay operational expenditures, it is expected to put that cash in an investment fund. It's a similar concept except instead of using ETFs as the investment vehicle, SCTY was using solar energy systems. Ark may manage $50bil (or whatever the number is) and have $50bil on the balance sheet, but it only owns probably a few billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They would need to raise capital, in an environment where raising capital was trivial (even with that dumb article where the writer polled \"several\" private investors and found them disinterested, Tesla had similar stories, how can they raise no one will buy it - make offering - boom oversubscribed, every time), and they did through an acquisition once it was offered.\n\nTo address this statement, the share price went from $70 down to $16.

I'm not going to spend a shit load of time going back over financials and theseiscrafting for a position that already made me 2000% because I was right at the time.  There was ZERO chance of SCTY bankruptcy.  ZERO.  The market assigned it some percentage higher than 0% and the market was, as usual, wrong.\n\nThe crux of the defense is that start ups are usually run lean during growth and that while cash flow had previously covered costs, it would be trivial to raise capital if they had direct needs of doing so, such as right before the sale when cash flow was temporarily not covering that cost.  Cutting sales spend by 20% or so would have had the same effect, but it would be trailing so they would still need cash, then they get back to meeting their monthly costs.\n\nGo start a business or stfu about steady state finance, consistent comfort is not how businesses in the startup phase work, and it's entirely normal to need cash from time to time if they overextend.

Do you know how to read a financial statement?  \n>  \n>Let's start at the operating cash flow level where it generated negative operating cash flow.\n\nFirst and foremost, SCTY had a lot of complicated financial instruments, tax items and all sorts of complex financing.  Most of the discourse around SCTY at the time was around the difficulty of reading its financial statements, and disagreements about what various items did and didn't mean for it.\n\nAlso, importantly, plenty of discussion about how GAAP rules and general accounting rules assign cash and other costs to things that weren't \"real\" costs, and create even more confusion with their financial statements.\n\nEven the operating cash flow numbers are hard to parse because there are so many investment vehicle effects there.\n\nSCTY built up a TON of debt, but it's incoming cash flow always covered the debt obligations - so no, it wasn't in a death spiral.  Even the leasebacks were just to raise cash to further grow.  Basically, they sacrificed profitability for growth at all costs, and it caused them to have an enormous amount of debt, that was safely being serviced by their guaranteed revenues.  The stock price only dropped from 70 to 16 when Chanos made up some bullshit about the leases being subprime debt.  People still gave a shit about Chanos back then and the stock price dropped 45% in a week after his statements.  It continued to drop after the Tesla deal became public because of short driven \"bailout\" terming.  IT dropped even more when articles about \"sale unlikely to go through\" kept popping up, even though the sale was almost 100% certain to close.  Myself and many other early SCTY and TSLA investors made enormous instant gains on the arb opportunity selling Tesla shares and buying SCTY then, and it's a big reason that I was able to accumulate many more shares than my personal life cash flow at the time would have otherwise allowed.\n\nThe reason his argument was subprime debt rather than insolvency was because the income from the solar installs clearly covered all debt service costs, so his argument was that \"since these are basically just bad loans, they will soon stop being able to service their debt, then it will be bad.\"  This was, of course, nonsense.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Damn, almost like you understand the situation surrounding the whole thing, as opposed to pointing out 10k reports and ignoring the surrounding events.\n\nAlso good point, GAAP is conservative for a steady-state business.

The LFP news is a very good indicator for Tesla's ability to further ramp the output of the Shanghai factory. \n\nAnother interesting point is that CATL recently signed a new supply agreement that was reported as covering not just their Chinese operations. If Tesla could move their M3 SR+ production in Fremont to LFP, that would free up a substantial amount of cylindrical cells to allow them to continue to ramp. Tesla moving their Fremont SR+ to LFP has been speculated on for a while.

{"title": "Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post", "selftext": "So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.\n\nIn 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.\n\nSo, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.\n\nAll data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.\n\nIn 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:\n\nA 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?\n\nAre people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.\n\nIs it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.\n\nIs it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.\n\nIs it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.\n\nSo basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.\n\nSo, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:\n\n**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**\n\nYeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.\n\n**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**\n\nPositions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.\n\nOne last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.\n\nMy date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.\n\nEDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.\n\nI just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are \"housing is up where I live so there's no bubble\"  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.\n\nTo explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.\n\nEDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of \"but people own more than one house\" posts.

If you price your rental properties too high, no one will rent from you if they can rent from someone else at a better rate (all other things being equal).   \n\nSo simply having the investor class buy up all the housing doesn't make sense to me as a driver for prices.

They can buy a home, or they can rent.   If money is an issue, people will tend to make their choice based on affordability.   If buying a home is very expensive relative to renting, people will rent.   If renting is very expensive relative to buying, people will buy.   \n\n(IS this flawed reasoning?)\n\nIn my understanding, not only are house prices rising dramatically, but so are rental rates.   I don't have any figures on this, but I do keep reading it all over the place.   \n\nSo, if we assume, as per the OP's post, that housing is actually up relative to population, how can rent and house prices both be going up?   A competitive market should encourage some rental property owners to lower their price to snag customers away from more greedy rental property owners.   High home prices should encourage more people to rent.   \n\nBasically, the only way I see this working out as you are saying (and again, allowing for the significant possibility that I just don't understand this situation well at all, or am otherwise missing some important information), is if the real estate investors are buying property and just not using it at all, to drive up demand.   That doesn't make sense to me, since there is a big opportunity cost to having empty property - it's not free to buy, it's not free to maintain, and you could either use that money for something else, or be making money off the investment, even if it's not priced really high.   Same reason there is an incentive for Cost-co to sell you the same stuff as any other store, but in bulk.   The profit per unit is less, but at such large scale, you end up making more.   So again, why would a landlord withhold property from possible renters?   Why not lower your prices a bit and attract more renters?   \n\nAgain, in a nutshell, how can people control the market in such a way that you have these 3 things: 1) MORE housing relative to population (the OP's stated fact), 2) house prices going up, 3) rent prices going up.   \n\nI'm not saying there isn't a perfectly reasonable explanation.

Just look back at 08. Canadian Housing prices (at least in the major markets) did not move down much, compared to the large drops that occurred with all other asset classes. The main difference being we did not have a run on defaults. Housing in general is considered \"Sticky\" in that, if your house does go down in value, you just sit on it, and do not sell. Not selling decreases supply on the market, so you don't see large decreases. Housing is basically the OG diamond hands market. \n\nThe only time you see a large decrease is if a ton of people are forced to sell via default, which is fairly unlikely. Firstly in Canada you need 20% for the down payment (go back to the 08 crash and homes where being 95 to 100% financed in the US), there are stress tests in place for interest rates, plus a government that is more likely to jump in head first if something really bad was happening. (Our downside from the US is our debt costs a bit more, and we can't get the 20 to 25 year locked in rates like they can)\n\nNow would this make a house a good investment? Maybe, maybe not, you might see the prices of houses go flat for a long period, given the massive run up we have seen, and/or the potential for markets (stock) in general to have a cooling or crash.

In 2021 it's at 65%\n\nDo you have the slightest idea how many people lost their homes in 2008? Of course ownership would be lower than the past peak. It's only in the last few years people have managed to wipe out their debt and get back on the ladder, if at all. \n\nthen you say:\n\n\\> In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US. In 2021 it's 141 million. US population in 2004 was 292 million. In 2021 it's 331 million.\n\nthen you say:\n\n\\>A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply. \n\nDo you see you are comparing apples to oranges? You are comparing % of houses vs. people.  You yourself say that the increase in population was 39m people and houses increased by 19m, so there's clearly no oversupply of housing when you compare the absolute numbers. Using % is misleading.\n\nThen you say:\n\n\\>Are people making more money? Nope. Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021. So in real terms wages are down.\n\nAgain you pick the wrong %. Ok, so workers share of corp income has fallen, but did corp income increase? What does the data show for the net share, not the %. I don't care if my employer pays me a lower % of his income this year compared to last year, if his income has doubled this year, if you see what I mean. Also, no data source so I assume it was something like this: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006173](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRS85006173) If you pick different years you get different results, e.g. 2015 and 2021 share of income has increased by 5%, so it makes no sense to pluck two random years as you did and reach some arbitrary conclusion.\n\nNext\n\n\\>Is it immigrants? Nope, immigration has been falling for years.\n\nErr..you just said above population has increased by 39m which is more than the housing supply, so you don't need immigration at all.\n\n\r  \nthen:\r  \n\\>Is it inflation? Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.\n\nIs it? or is it not? The fact is that while yields are down and interest rates are still down, banks have started raising their mortgage rates (you can check it out) in the last few months. People are realizing that:\n\na) The rates will not stay low for longer, so this is the best chance to remortgage or buy a house  - if they can, and\n\nb) Those that didn't lose their jobs during Covid managed to put savings on the side, which they can now use to buy a bigger house or pay a deposit etc.\n\nAlso, COVID meant that manufacturing of building materials was virtually stopped due to restrictions in occupancy of factories etc., so the output dropped precipitously. With the market restarting and restrictions remaining the supply is constrained in an unnatural way. Result? building materials have gone through the roof, and I mean they swing 20% week to week. Ask a contractor to give you a fixed price for 3 months from now and see what they say. I know because I am close to the business and I see wild fluctuations in prices. No contractor can keep a price for more than a week, it's that crazy. You've got builders who are cancelling contracts on new constructions and give deposits back to buyers because when they go to order materials they find that the updated prices mean their profit is gone. It's crazy, so naturally house prices are being pushed up.\n\nThen you get every tom dick and harry who think their shitty 40y.old bungalow appreciated in value because new-builts did, and they keep adding to the price push.\n\nAdd to that the fact that builders stopped building spec homes quite a lot during Covid, and there's been a limited stock of new housing coming into the market, and now they can't build them fast enough, so another squeeze in supply.\n\nI personally think that, no, it's not a bubble. Will the prices go down? yes, as soon as the building supply chain normalizes then prices will ease off (already have in some materials), but they won't go down to pre-covid prices (they never do). So as you get more houses coming into the market and material prices dropping the house prices will start normalizing too (oversupply will follow the high demand). So yeah, I think prices will go down but they won't crash. If there is to be a crash it will happen some time after rates start getting hiked and force all buyers out of the market when supply is running at its peak, so we are years away before that happens.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Not in %, but in absolute numbers", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "We are kinda in a bubble, but the fact is it doesn't really matter.

A lot of investors who didn't flip property, have their money locked into properties they owned pre-COVID. So, being that a lot of tennents have NOT been paying RENT throughout the pandemic, most of them will be busy spending money in lawsuits trying to evict the current tennents. \n\nAs for the investors that buy an flip,, the market will be so oversaturated with homes, unless they have a ton of money to buy and hold until the ECONOMY picks up I highly doubt they will buy right away. \n\nIn my opinion after the banks take such a big hit in this inevitable POP, the banks that are left willing to lend will have raised their requirements to get a mortgage.

It had a price to earnings ratio above 12, and if you noticed, it went all the way down to 9 where Lennars P/E was at the time. \n\nIf you look at the 5 year chart for Lennar/KBH vs. M/I Homes and CCS the latter just clearly outperform the former even with Lennars recent run and the latters slide down. \n\nUltimately, i'm just incredibly bullish on M/I homes and CCS (CCS also offers a sixty cent annual dividend), because i think they are so fundamentally undervalued that the highs are higher, and the lows are higher (not lower) too. Their already priced for failure around earnings and for forward guidance.\n\nThe historical price to earnings ratio is 10, but i think the street needs to see some more earnings to be convinced that the cycle is secular and not cyclical. \n\nI wouldn't advise buying LGI homes, as the downside is much higher than the upside.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I saw something I didn't like in here but the user is approved so I ignored it. /u/zjz", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "It's nice to have good company on this journey to hell\n\nI've put all my chips on KBH for this earnings period of builders..
