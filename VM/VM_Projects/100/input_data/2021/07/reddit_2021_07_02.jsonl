{"title": "Anyone else licking their jaws at the semiconductor industry?", "selftext": "Part of me has never been more confident in the future of the semiconductors. At the same time I am worried Wall Street will be unimpressed with future earnings. A company can make a bazillion dollars in profit but if they say one bad thing then Wall Street throws a fit. \n\nRegardless of what Wall Street thinks, the future of technology is dependent on semiconductor chips. \n\nFor example Micron (MU). I thought their earnings call was very positive. They had a huge beat on earnings and it sounds like their future is very bright. The CEO made is clear that as cloud storage and EV vehicle usage increase in the coming years it will be very beneficial to Micron. The future of technology relies on cloud storage and the future of transportation is electric and computerized. Its concerning that MU went down over 5% on heavy volume today. Sure looks like a heavy resistance. \n\nThen you have Nvidia (NVDA). Arguably the industry leader and growing like crazy. They are still waiting on approval on the Arm deal which I would expect to go through. It recently brokeout HUGE. I mean what? Up 21% in one month for a company that size? Thats unreal. \n\nAMD just recently broke its trading range and on its way to 100. I am concerned that volume was not as big as it was when it broke through but the catalyst of the Xlyinx deal going through should be enough? Its apparent AMD is beating Intel in their sub-sector and Intel is over 100 billion large in market cap. Will AMD be able to continue the breakout? I dont know why they wont be able to. \n\nTSM has been consolidating for awhile. I cant see any reason it would break to the down side except for a hostile take over of Taiwan by China. Then either its game on between China or the US or the US backs down like they probably will cause, I mean it would be bad business for Apple, Starbucks, Tesla, Costco, and other American companies trying to grow in China. \n\nHow are all of you approaching this situation? If youre not thinking about this industry as a 6 month to 1 year play then idk what I am doing.

No need to worry about the greeks in this strategy because the long call and short put offset the greeks on each other, but important to know your delta will come out to 1 after you buy the call and sell the put. Opening 1 of these positions with a delta of 1 means you are tracking the gains and losses of 100 shares. That's what gives this strategy the leverage it has, because you get a delta of 1 while sometimes getting paid to open the position.\n\nBuying a call does not take care of the collateral for the written put and this strategy will use some of your available margin.

I think the likelihood is that there is a mixture, more heavily on the fixed rate side (Personally, I think a loan institution would be much more likely to offer them fixed rates as their chance of defaulting is basically null, but I could be wrong).\n\nMortgages are the backbone of their operation as in order to continuously expand they have to acquire new properties, which means that they have to take on interest expense in terms of mortgages. So, all else equal, if they have fixed-rate mortgages it doesn‚Äôt make a difference whether or not the interest rates rise.\n\nI‚Äôd have to take a specific look at NLY‚Äôs fundamentals as every company is different and has different capital allocation structures. \n\nCurrent fiscal policy is low to basically non-existent interest rates which are great for REIT‚Äôs. This allows them to expand at a fraction of the cost when compared to previous operating years. Now, the fed has talked about extending the current interest rate policy sometime into 2022. This allows investment companies to continue to expand at an exponential rate while locking in low-interest mortgages. \n\nOnce the interest rates begin to increase (hoping that the Fed doesn‚Äôt just randomly slap on a huge increase to the current rates, but rather slowly implement new policy) these investment firms will most likely begin to decelerate their natural acquisition of properties and then focus on acquiring larger properties with a higher potential ROI while already having a huge amount of properties with low interest rates.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Verizon is a really solid company with a good dividend.

Even Tesla usually has sympathy with the entire market hitting new highs and tech outperforming and even EVs pumping but it‚Äôs been trading so oddly over the past week. $700 doesn‚Äôt seem like that much of a resistance because it takes hardly any volume to walk it back down to $680 range.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "TSLA is definitely priced to expect significant and consistent growth for a number of years, well in excess of what its competitors or the general market are going to see. So there's a limit to how much of a benefit it can see as the price gets higher, whether that's from slightly better than expected news, or an overall good macro environment.\n\nI also suspect there's a strong \"path dependent\" component. Where the price people bought in at has a big impact on the price they're willing to sell at. So there's some active population of investors/traders that aren't being rational price setters (they almost never are), and instead are buying and selling based on their own past history with the stock. And there's three interesting events that have happened in the past year at these levels:\n\n* The most important is being added to the S&P 500. That was essentially a guarenteed price you could sell at and you knew there would be buyers that had to buy. There was a lot of volume in the 650-680 range that day, with the close being 695 and dropping slightly afterwards.\n* The price dropped down to around 650 the next day, but then went up steadily and broke through the 700 resistance at year end (likely driven by expectations of another record quarter) and hit all time highs and pretty much stayed at that level for a couple months\n* Then when everything went down because of Covid, the stock dropped *a lot* putting a lot of people who were buying at record highs in to an unrealized loss. Before recovering and bouncing around in the high 600s to low 700s for a couple months\n\nI suspect there's a lot of people who bought in the 650-700 range (or maybe slightly higher) because they watched the stock jump up huge amounts and had FOMO. But now are watching a stock bouncing around without any huge breakouts and wished they sold for a profit, or a small loss, already. So when the price gets close to 700 because of random trading events or some news, there's a lot of sell pressure there.\n\nOf course this is all wild speculation.

{"title": "Who needs Diamond Hands when you have Balls of Steel - $CLF - Cleveland Cliffs", "selftext": "You‚Äôve probably recently seen CLF on WSB, CNBC, and all over the place lately? Why is that‚Ä¶? Because Steel is going fucking crazy right now, and CLF is ahead of the curve.\n\nSo, what‚Äôs the play? Why is it a play? How is it play? Buckle up boys: close out of porn hub, grab a beer, and prepare for your smooth brain to gain a half-wrinkle. You‚Äôre going to be here a while.\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the company, Cleveland Cliffs. This company is 174 fucking years old, employs 25,000 people, and it‚Äôs traditionally been the largest and oldest independent iron ore mining company in the USA. They own or co-own five active iron ore mines in Minnesota and Michigan and maintain an annual rated iron ore production capacity of approximately 28.0 million long tons.\n\nOk, so what? Who the fuck cares ‚Äì mining and steel production isn‚Äôt sexy, pink-haired septum pierced hippies hate it, and it‚Äôs barely a blip on Wall Street‚Äôs radar. Guess what- I care, and you should too.\n\nWhen evaluating a company, there are several dimensions to look at - the people and their long-term strategies behind the company are some of the most important.  Let‚Äôs go deeper.\n\nCue in Lourenco Goncalves. **This maniacal son of a bitch joined CLF seven years ago as CEO through a contested proxy battle** and he‚Äôs been transforming the company and telling [Goldman Sachs analysts they are embarrassments to their parents ever since](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/ceo-berates-analysts-you-are-a-disasterthey-will-have-to-commit-suicide.html). The fucking balls on this guy. This is the kind of guy you want on your team. He's nuts, but he's going to prove everyone else wrong and get shit done. In the last seven years, LG‚Äôs entire initiative and strategy has been to completely transform an overleveraged wilting company, into what it is today ‚Äì the USA‚Äôs largest flat-rolled steel company and the largest iron ore pellet producer. But again, big whoop, right? Who the fuck cares? Let's go deeper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTransformation: Operational Strategy\n\nSo, what‚Äôs changed? Just last year, **CLF acquired two major steelmakers: AK Steel and ArcelorMittal USA. THIS IS HUGE** **and what Wall Street hasn‚Äôt seemed to fully process**. With this move, CLF has set itself up to own the entire aspect of the operations process and now they are VERTICALLY INTEGRATED. This means that they own and control everything upstream and downstream ‚Äì from ore in the ground to selling products to end-user customers. This gives them added scale of operations, greater market share through acquired accounts, new markets, less competition, operational leverage, cost savings throughout the supply chain, and more. Imagine if Volkswagen bought Porsche and Audi to gain more market share and leverage efficiencies? Oh wait, they already did that because that‚Äôs what successful & growing companies do to become even more successful. They see a bigger picture and take a short term loss for the much more profitable long term gain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCustomers and Revenues:\n\nCLF‚Äôs main bread and butter is selling steel to the automotive industry. You know, the industry that has been getting fucking insane valuations with EV‚Äôs; the industry that S&P Global expects to grow another 15% this year despite the chip shortages? Yeah, that industry. What‚Äôs great is that **AK Steel, now owned by CLF, had 63% market participation in the auto industry, ‚Äú*****‚Ä¶which no other steel mill in the entire world can replicate***‚Äù, according to Goncalves on CNBC. Taken from CLF‚Äôs 10-K: ‚ÄúDue to the much larger operational footprint we now have, we anticipate synergies of approximately $310 million from asset optimization, economies of scale and streamlining overhead, over half of which has already been set in motion. ‚Äú\n\nRight now, CLF maintains their revenues per vertical as follows (From 10-k):\n\n**Automotive 45 %**\n\nInfrastructure and manufacturing 15 %\n\nDistributors and converters 13 %\n\nSteel producers 27 %\n\nAgain, so fucking what? Why so many numbers? Who gives a shit, what does it mean? Guess what: I give a shit, and you should too. Here's what it means:\n\n\"The exacting requirements for servicing the automotive market generally allows for higher selling prices for products sold to that market than for the commodity types of carbon and stainless steels sold to other markets. As the only North American producer of high-efficiency NOES (Non-Oriented Electrical Steel), which is a critical component of H/EV motors, CLF is positioned to potentially benefit from the growth of H/EVs going forward. Likewise, the growing customer adoption of H/EVs may also increase demand for improvements in the electric grid to support higher demand for more extensive battery charging.\"\n\nFor those who can‚Äôt read good ‚Äì the auto industry in particular needs precision requirements from steel inputs for safety and efficiency. This means CLF can charge higher prices for a more technical product and the players in the space are limited. Who do you think can spin up an iron ore mine, build a factory to roll steel, and sell it to the end customer? Nobody but the players already in the space. It would take Amazon at least 5 years to be ready to capitalize on this market (Mining permits, Ecological Studies, Building permits, Construction, Operational spin up, etc.) The players in the space are all that are it - and CLF just ate two of them.\n\nAce the hole:\n\nAdded onto this, the prices of steel have tripled, and there is no end in sight. Every month, pricing keeps going higher. This translates to pure tendies. This won‚Äôt last forever, but damn‚Ä¶ two good years of boosted profits is a hell of a tail wind coming right off of two huge ground shaking acquisitions. It‚Äôs a great set-up and CLF is taking full advantage of it by paying down long-term debt, de-leveraging risk, and returning money to the shareholders (Goncalves words, not mine). Notice how I haven‚Äôt even mentioned the trillion-dollar infrastructure bill yet ‚Äì which happens to fall under at least 42% of CLF‚Äôs revenue stream. I don‚Äôt know enough about the bill to properly factor in what and how much of a benefit CLF may see from it, but it‚Äôs not hard to imagine how a steel company would benefit from a $1T infrastructure spending spree.\n\nBy now, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre holding that small, yet rock hard banana in your pants and you‚Äôre already thinking of how you‚Äôre going to tell your wife‚Äôs boyfriend Axel that you don‚Äôt need his weekly allowance anymore. Not so fast, we have more work to do.\n\nSo, let‚Äôs assume that CLF is undervalued. Let‚Äôs assume that Wall Street is too focused on tech at the moment and overlooked this small, yet well-established and fast-growing steel maker in Ohio. Let‚Äôs assume that steel prices will maintain their highs for another year. If CLF is undervalued, then what is it actually worth?\n\nJP Morgan thinks $39\n\nUBS thinks $28\n\nBofA thinks $25\n\nGoldman Sachs thinks $20 (fuck Goldman)\n\nRight now, I‚Äôm at $32.25\n\nI‚Äôve combed through their financials, 10K‚Äôs and most recent 10-Q after their Acquisitions to get the best numbers I can and come up and a price which I think is conservative.  **Disclaimer:** I‚Äôm not a professional ‚Äì I believe my numbers are good, but not perfect. I could have missed something or multiple things, it‚Äôs almost certain that I did. This isn't financial advice. My assumptions could be off and my estimates are approximations. If you see something that I missed, overlooked, or think that I'm retarded, please tell me and I'll revise it.\n\nMy Main Assumptions:\n\n\\- Steel prices will continue roaring through end of this year, and maybe until Q3 of 2022.\n\n\\- CLF will use their profits to pay down long-term debt and finalize their newly acquired assets, which is what they have said they will do\n\n\\- Their new business operation will yield new efficiencies and synergies where they can lower their Cost of Goods Sold (historically around 75%). In my projections, I‚Äôve tweaked COGS to be a bit higher in the next couple of years to account for the overall chaos of two crazy big acquisitions, and due to the fact that the reason why the number has been so large in Q4 2020 and Q1 2021, was they were moving all of their new assets and steel inventories around the US, which translates to a lot of shipping cost because steel is heavy.\n\n\\- I‚Äôm assuming that next year they will start to lower their inventories, which I believe are currently bloated from the acquisitions.\n\n\\- I did not factor in any other new broad sweeping strategy plays or acquisitions\n\n\\- Many of my projections are based on trend functions, averages, or general educated guesses.\n\n\\- ‚ÄúHey wait a second, you show that CLF will only show $1.4 billion income for 2021, but they   upgraded guidance to expect $5 billion this year‚Äù. Correct, but that number shown in the pretty graph in the 10-k is ‚ÄúAdjusted‚Äù EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Nothing wrong with that, but I prefer to evaluate via GAAP and Un-Adjusted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Income Statement](https://preview.redd.it/1j3nsxnyet871.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe1b8cca345d2afaea85b1f7cf18148b96a58e32)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Balance Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/yviombd0ft871.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=1269e7d7f1c4e5e6bbac225cde5493a2b25c3f47)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cash Flows](https://preview.redd.it/rycdg4c1ft871.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=41f2fdbf96ff640f09d92a485ca0f12b0579b0a5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[PV of FCF's](https://preview.redd.it/9jhm0oj2ft871.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5dad23e1d6c506f32e7d0e3ea71a3bb8b9081c0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, let‚Äôs re-cap ‚Äì\n\nFor the Apes: Ape Strong. Steel Strong. Ape and Steel Together Stronger\n\nFor the Autists: An old washed-up mining company has transformed into an upgraded steel manufacturer that is ready to play in the big leagues with new assets, boat loads of fresh money, and very few analysts on Wall Street have priced it in.\n\nFor the Retards: Buy high sell low.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, I'm jacked to the tits and ready to \"Invest\". What‚Äôs the play?\n\nLooking at it from a TA perspective at daily candles, the steel sector has been ripping the last 6 months, creating an ascending triangle. What I see happening in the next month or two is another leg up ‚Äì right into that $30 zone and maybe hit $35 by EoY depending on steel prices. CLF earnings are on 7/22, which I think there will be a run-up to, and/or the day of. Hard to say. In addition to that, Steel is a long play in and of itself.\n\nIf you are risk-tolerant and want something short-term, play the earnings call.

CLEVELAND ROCKS", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Here's what's missing from your analysis. This rip on steel follows on the heels of a similar trend for lumber. That's because construction is a larger % than automotive by market segmentation. Steel has been going full blown parabolic after bottoming out about 10 months ago. This dip was preceded by idling of capacity and was an overreaction to COVID, creating a backlog in the mill order books, automotive included. (Turning on blast furnaces is a real bitch, btw.) So, the only saving grace has really been a softening of automotive demand, as a byproduct of chip shortages.\n\nAs a Category Manager for Ferrous Raw Materials (Steel), I conduct business with CLF through several of their mills, but also know what's happening in other regions and with other mill networks. What's unique about CLF aside from their size and reach, is their adoption of a \"value vs. volume\" model; something that was mentioned in the Steel Success Strategies conference back in October of 2020. What this means, is that the mill is willing to artificially constrict capacity or slow walk expansion or bring online new capacity and furnaces, or otherwise restart idled furnaces, to fully relieve the demand issues of the market place. This is actually not good news and the fair market value for steel is not what we're seeing today. These comments were made in front of other mills globally, in front of buyers from all over, and no-doubt wields influence in the market place. If they speak it, others will adopt this same stance.\n\nWhile some of the scarcity issues are real, CLF and many other mill networks are taking this time to right-size their output to keep the current prices sustained. This dangerous calculation has blown up in their faces historically, because this isn't the first time they've done it. 2008 is a perfect example.\n\nSo what are the repercussions of this current market activity and the operating model that the steel supply chain is exploiting? Well, for starters, manufacturers can't modify their price books at a pace that keeps up with the changing price of the steel, which means they are absorbing a lot of the cost over time. This reduces their profitability due to the lag. Eventually, they can't make their products or sell them, and sales begin to recede, businesses begin closing their doors. It's only when customers stop ordering that they'll start to modify their production behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, this overly rapid expansion of actual profits vs. projected profits is very alarming. In the short-term, some people are going to get very rich. However, the blow-back has the potential to be both severe, and impact down stream sectors.\n\nIf you plan to use CLF to make money, be careful.
