The way that NKLA wants to approach the Hydrogen production problem (using solar at every hydrogen fueling station to produce 100% of the hydrogen at the station throught electrolysis)is a great IDEA, but does not work out mathematical. Even based on liberal current solar panel efficiency estimates (40% of energy captured from sunlight), you would need exorbitantly large solar farms at each refueling station. I am talking in the range of multiple square miles of solar panels if you want the refueling stations to be able to handle double digit numbers of NKLA trucks a day.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "The entire point to electric is you can now control the fuel. How else did you think they will save money? You dont save anything if you have to use retail fueling. Might as well stick to ICE. They will not be using public electricity (coal) because that would be financially asinine.\n\nRe solar sizing. Assuming these things have, say, a 500kWh battery, you need about 80-120kW installs to totally fill up a single truck a day. Lets just say thats about 250-350 mid tier 60 cell panels (just because I have the measures on hand). You are looking at 4000 to 6000 sqft... thats not a big deal at all. Basically a single acre can fully fuel 7 semis.... \n\nI seriously doubt you even need that much since most trucks will not need a full fill up at every station and because their batteries arent supposed to be fully filled anyway. My guess is you space these say... 200 miles apart along major high ways and doing so will let handle a good 15-25 trucks a day per acre and thats with solar only. If you are really smart, you will find geographic wind tunnels and use that to your advantage too. This can easily double your energy generation and give you coverage on cloudy days. Or you can simply cut the size of the station in half.\n\nThese stations will keep a truck fueled for at least a decade to as much as 2 decades without much need for maintenance. At some point the inverters will fail and batteries will need to be refreshed but the price of those will likely be negligible in 10 years anyway. They are still expensive now however. I assume these guys will use redox flow batteries rather than lithium as well because those wont last as long.\n\nThe problem is not generating energy. You can forget about needed to supplement with coal, nuclear or whatever long term like some people, who barely know any algebra, believe. Nothing, literally nothing, can beat solar on price. Even if you built the cheapest nuclear plant out in some no regulation zone that actually has some way to cool it (good luck with that and finding qualified workers for it), it still wont be cheaper than solar per kWh in most of the USA. And solar prices keep dropping with no bottom in sight. Batteries especially, have been cut about 40% in just the last 5 years or so.\n\nGenerally speaking, once these stations are set up, which will be a while, fuel costs will be cut 50% to 75% over a decade and by 90% after 2 decades. All the major shippers will build their own stations if they dont already own a bunch of fuel stops already that they can upgrade. In such case, they will be up and running even faster and can start implementing eV routes immediately.\n\nBut this all assumes the semi trucks themselves perform as advertised.... thats the real problem not to mention servicing them... Tesla is literally the least reliable car company in the world right now... do you really want to bet your shipping business on them right now?

This is not a grid where you need to produce extra to make sure you have enough due to uncertain estimates. Plus you have batteries now. Since we are talking businesses, you can easily predict how much you need. Further you can save a ton of money on infrastructure if you are willing to stagger their arrival and departures or even keep fully charges trucks on site to eliminate all fuel times and maintain a staggered charging schedule.\n\nBut honestly it really doesnt matter what size you need. Again the capital costs are the least of your problems and those are still going down. Panels, especially, are really very cheap and incredible reliable. So really there is no reason why you dont greatly oversize panels and for backup add a NG generator. Batteries are still expensive but they are also largely modular.

Otherwise you would not be able to charge 2 semis back to back in an solar system that does not have supplemental power from the grid. \n\nI will concede that I over estimated the land geographic footprint of the solar panels needed to power multiple Tesla semis, but at the end of the day  this is all far more complicated, and infrastructure intensive than using CNG and RNG. \n\nSo you know that RNG can be produced from human waste on a municipal scale right?

You literally just need a few extra per stop to keep them staggered... Remember it only takes about 30 minutes to fill them. So what you need to figure out is how many trucks you expect per 30 minutes. Thats all the extra you need to maintain no down time and even then its optional. The truck only needs 30 minutes to fuel so that is the worst case scenario. But if you are smart, what you do is stagger arrival times and just switch to a full truck. This is very doable. For a stop that might get, say 20 trucks, you really just need about 2 on standby.  \n\nYou are also overestimating the capital cost of solar+wind and underestimating the cost of gas infrastructure which is multitudes higher. The only advantage to it is that we already have it (mostly). Otherwise the cost is multiples higher depending on locations. The further you are away from the refinery, the more costly it is. Why? It requires constant freight transport. And there is no way to mitigate this except with pipes which are far more expensive and have practical limits. \n\nThere is literally no comparison here. In terms of costs, solar+wind is a lot cheaper which is why everyone is rolling out farms. They arent doing it because they are nice people who love the environment... they are doing it because at wholesale and scale, solar produces energy for as little as 2-4 cents per kWh... which means you get to fill up a 500kWh semi for about $10-$20 for a good 300 miles... Compare that to gas.\n\nWe can pretty much calculate the capital costs to all this. USA is about 2400 mi across and about what? 1800 mi wide? So you need 12 x 8 stations... lets just call it 100. \n\nThis is a very gross estimate but lets just assume 1 acre of solar each and no wind for now. Thats about 2500 60 cell panels (not ideal either but lets go with it) and each will run about $100 wholesale (probably cheaper but whatever). Thats about $250k... not much at all. \n\nYou need about 750kW worth of inverters. A 300kW commercial is about $50k retail. Lets just call it $125,000.\n\nYou can get ready made solar parking frames for about $8k for a 10kW system. I assume at wholesale that drops to well below $6k. You need 250 of these so another $150k. You need inverters.\n\nFor battery we probably want at least 2 days of storage so lets just say 750 \\* 5 \\* 2 so 7.5MWh storage. This is when things get ugly because I dont know the price of commercial storage. But what I can do is estimate using price of car batteries which are actually more expensive but lets just go with it. A brand new F150 Lightning is going to be about $40k and will come with a (easily) 100kWh battery if not more. Lets say that the price of the battery is 50% of the car price. Thats $20k for 100kWh. Now x75 = $1,500,000. \n\nSo we are at about $2,025,000. Wires and such are pretty negligible but you do need labor to install so lets add another $200k or so. $2.225m.\n\nObviously you still need the land but thats probably not much for an acre or two. If you want a building then that will be a cost. I also think a backup generator is advisable but again, this is actually negligible cost wise.\n\nWhen all is said and done you are looking at less than $3m per site. Multiply by 100 and thats $300m... that is pretty damn affordable. This is practically nothing for a big company and the savings on fuel will be astronomical. For example, XPO Logistics makes more than that in a single normal year... The problem is not the money. Its rolling them out. How long it will take to buy land and build. Thats the real problem. \n\nNow lets look at semi fuel usage. If each truck uses 20.5k gallons a year (taken from google), and average MPG is 6.5, then you are looking at 133k miles per year. Lets just assume a very cheap gas... say $3 per gallon. Thats $61k per year in gas. \n\nThe electrics are estimated to get 300mi per 500kWh charge. As discussed above, the cost will range but lets play devils advocate here and just assume 4 cents per kWh or about $20 per charge. You need 443 charges per year. Thats $8,866 a year in electricity. So you are saving over $50k per year on fuel if these eV semis behave as promised. Each station can handle about 7.5 semis per day, and you have 100 of them. So you are saving $37m per year on fuel alone and again... I am using $3/gal gas and not factoring in any ICE related maintenance.  \n\nNow lets talk forward estimates. We both know gas wont be $3 in 10 years. Given inflation we are probably looking at $4-$4.50 in a decade. If you build this infrastructure you can complete ignore this inflation. Your price is practically fixed for about 15 years give or take and then you have some upkeep but it will be a fraction of your original cost and equipment will be much cheaper then, especially batteries.\n\nYour payoff is about 8 years and no inflation to worry about...

It includes smaller trucks with smaller GVW capacity and cost far less than $150k. Second - those routes usually originate from or go to distribution centers - serviced by long haul OTR carriers again.With the current range those Teslas might be competitive in local deliveries, but the infrastructure for long haul is non existent - they don't stand a chance in mid-range long-range OTR.

Solar + wind is insanely cheap compared to gas and there is plenty of surface area practically everywhere in the USA to build more than what we need.

If they are super bottom heavy then 500lbs might be nothing. Maybe you can offset it by placing your batteries low? Dunno if thats even possible but its a thought. This is why eV's all have their batteries low btw.\n\nI actually thought about this stuff before because i figured one day I will want a trailer. My idea was to make a foldable array that tucks away nicely inside when moving. Basically attach it to a arm and unfold the thing when parket. You can design this to look nice too. Like the extra shade that many trailers already offer in the fold out areas. Alternatively there is no reason why you cant just assemble and disassemble panels manually by hand when parked... I mean, smaller ones arent really all that heavy. All you need is a stand for them honestly and of course you need to know how they wire, which is fairly trivial.\n\nOne interesting thing too. The reason panels weigh so much is because they need to secured to a roof. If you are making panels for a car, they dont need to be nearly as heavy.

It's actually more. Here's a more accurate rundown from an article written in 2018:\n\n> We add up that bit of information plus what we know about the truck and get an estimated weight. Using the current weight of a Tesla Model S battery pack at 540kg per 90 kWh, we can do some simple math to estimate the Semi’s batteries would weigh about 6,000 kg. We aren’t sure about the new battery weights for the upcoming battery updates, but we can assume a 10-15 percent reduction from several factors (storage density, improvements in chemistry, packaging lightening) without being too aggressive or overly optimistic. Going with the fifteen percent reduction, that 6,000 kg drops to 5,100 kg. That’s about 11,244 pounds.\n\n> A conventional tractor, as we’ve said, has a tare weight of around 32,000 pounds when fully fueled and with a lightweight box trailer in place. Remove the trailer and the truck itself is about 22,500 pounds. It’s difficult to then go to just the weight of the powertrain components and fuel, but they’re considerably less than 11,000 pounds in all.\n\n\n> Tesla Semi spotted doing a tire-shredding acceleration run down in the wild\n\n> Looking at the shipping weight for a crated engine and transmission for a Class 8 truck, we can see that they weigh about 8,000 pounds on average. Add in fuel and other components and another 1,500 pounds (at most) are put on the truck. We then assume that the rest of the truck (framing, braking systems, air compressor, etc) are about the same for the Tesla Semi in order for it to meet Class 8 standards. So we call those a wash.\n\n> That means that the Semi, under our estimates, is roughly two tons heavier than would be a standard day cab big truck in the Class 8 category.\n\n\nSo with todays situation, and assuming the 48,000 pounds of cargo capacity for a diesel truck is accurate (correct me if their data is wrong), that would mean at 2,000 pounds fewer cargo capacity the Semi would be able to do roughly 96% of the cargo capacity of a diesel truck. In other words, you'd need 1 additional truck + driver for every 25 trucks. Even if you hire the world's most expensive driver that will still put the Tesla Semi at a huge cost advantage.\n\nI should also add that this is an old article, and Tesla has since already achieved that 10-15% weight reduction and is working towards another 50% in the next 2-3 years. That would put the battery at around 5,500-6000 pounds or 2,000-2,500 pounds lighter than the engine and transmission of a diesel truck.

They buy prime commercial land, develop it, then get a franchisee to run it. If the franchisee fails, they find another franchisee or sell the property. Prime commercial property rarely has prices decrease, and the market is usually strong thanks to competition.\n\nThey’re effectively a corporate real estate company that uses their burger licensing as a way to get reliable franchisees to pay the mortgages. Their management is on record that if selling something other than burgers from prime commercial real estate made for more reliable franchisee revenue to pay the mortgage payments.\n\nEven when franchisees do fail, they can usually sell the real estate in a couple months. Even if half the franchisees in the US failed due to bad franchisee policy leading to continued staff shortages and poor profits due to bad service, McDonald’s corporate would just have to find new franchisees or sell before their reserves get burnt through on mortgage payments.

If a Subway franchisee goes under, Subway can’t save the space and tell a store GM about the opportunity because the franchisee is paying the location owner directly.

Might have accidentally deleted it. The “then” part is “then we’d sell something other than burgers.”\n\nIf you remember things like the McPizza or the introduction of the Breakfast burritos, these were attempts to test whether McDonalds’ menu would be more efficient if adapted to other popular cuisines. At the time of the McPizza, the idea of hot and fresh instantly ready pizza for fast food (the modern Little Caesar’s Hot-n-Ready hours) was just taking off on a national level, and if Pizza was more in demand than burgers McDonalds didn’t want to be behind. The breakfast burritos were thanks to an explosion of interest in Mexican-style breakfast food in the US; if they were really popular, they would have put more on the menu and scaled back sandwiches.\n\nThey modernized the chicken sandwich when those became popular again, keeping the budget formed-patty McChicken and redoing the Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich to try to be more dairy-allergy friendly (fryers are once again free of dairy because that one sandwich was the only offender) and to try to compete with other brands. If chicken demand keeps up, I’d expect a similar play in nuggets for premium meat-chunk nuggets as an additional option rather than the formed nuggets. (Though they might just call them boneless wings for branding purposes, since that’s what most boneless wings are.)\n\nHowever, it mostly seems to be minor changes that drive the process.  More sauce options, like the spicy varieties, for burgers and nuggets. A too-billed bacon burger to not lose pace against Wendy’s pushing Bacon.\n\nFor the future, if fast noodles becomes the next big thing or Asian stuffed buns become a big thing, expect to see McDonald’s try an offering in that space. And if it’s popular enough, it will become a returning menu item and maybe expand.\n\nPersonally the biggest casualty of the brief explosion of Mexican food was that some McDonalds got nacho cheese dispensers and you could get cheese cups for fries, then when the Mexican craze cooled a bit and they pulled a bunch of menu items most places stopped serving cheese cups. Nacho cheese on fries is great, but there’s currently nobody selling both in my area because the Taco Bell fries are a limited time thing.

Same in hotels too, with some brands having corporate hotels and others being franchisees. It’s really funny when someone says they’ll call corporate on my work as a franchise operation.

KFC did that years ago with Fried Chicken through a good recipe and the pressure-frying process that gets reliable quick results and they can be kept hot for a while without much change.\n\nOr other things change, like the US implements a carbon emissions credit trading scheme that increases the price of beef significantly because of the emissions of cows.  Boom, chicken sandwiches are king because they don’t produce anywhere near as much methane.

That’s what the little “this establishment operated by…” plaque means. Sometimes it’s “owned and operated”, but McDonalds corporate is the mortgage holder.

{"title": "SOFI to Fly - A king of FinTech", "selftext": "# SOFI to Fly Pre earnings 8/12\n\n**I have read so many DD's on this sub regarding SOFI. Many of those DD's were just people trying to pump their position in order get some tendies. I will make sure to only summarize and include some parts of those DD's that were not meant for pump & dump. This is a NON BIASED SOFI DD & Analysis. Let's get started -**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***What is SOFI?***\n\n**Social Finance, Inc aka SoFi** is an American online personal finance company. A mobile-first service based in San Francisco, SoFi provides a suite of financial products that includes student loan refinancing, checking accounts, mortgages, personal loans, credit cards, stock investing and banking through both their mobile app and desktop interfaces. It is an ALL in one app for all your financial and investing needs.\n\nLook at the products sofi has to offer. The company has an amazing easy to use user interface and very smooth app.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1bam7fqzec71.png?width=2658&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ff396904447a22bd4d94af98271f93887d63b1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What separates SOFI from other competitors?\n\nThe one single factor that gains Sofi a lot of revenue and sales is **\"Convenience\".** Because they provide a lot of services, they are able to attract their customers to get different products.\n\nLet's say you decide to buy a car and go to Sofi for a car loan. The Sofi team asks you to provide your Social security, pay stubs, previous bills, etc. and then finally grants you a car loan. Now, let's say after 3 months your friend who has been making a bank trading AMC and GME tells you to invest and you don't have a brokerage account. You eventually would end up knocking SOFI's door and ask them to let you invest because why the fuck would you want to fill out forms and apply at other brokerages. Now, let's say after couple of months of trading, you end up losing all your money because you're an APE who yolo'ed entire savings into 1st ever options play. Now, you need money for that business degree because you suck at investing. What would you do here? Would you go to some student loan company and fill out all the forms, provide credit history, etc. or would you just call up SOFI and ask them to loan you some tendies? The simple answer is **\"Call up SOFI\" because it's convenient.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# SOFI also came up with IPO investing.\n\nYou can now invest in IPO's even before they're traded on an exchange. Cool, innit?Unlike Robinhood, SOFI would never restrict the sale of the securities to the members in secondary markets. However, if you invest in an IPO and sell within 30 days then you might be restricted from IPO purchase for next 30 days or so. More details can be found on their website -\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bcmkpaqrzec71.png?width=2852&format=png&auto=webp&s=afbaa5cff6c608b2262c4ee20a53d4c9fa06893b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# History of SOFI & how did it become such a big company\n\nSoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education. The company's inaugural loan program was a $2 million pilot at Stanford. For this pilot, 40 alumni invested about $2 million in approximately 100 students, for an average of $20,000 per student.\n\nThe founders were soon able to raise $1billion from softbank few years ago. The company is very successful and trading way below their valuation price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Let's have a look at the SOFI's chart this year\n\nThis is 1 year chart for Sofi, it has a very very strong support at 15$. The stock has gone below 15$ only twice in 2021 and then rallied the following 2 weeks. The movement of this stock is like a spring, a huge dip is followed by an insane highs. The earnings are due 8/12 and I strongly believe that this stock will run before the earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na00wbnszec71.png?width=2134&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb97b09ec2f01c7b8085470e82a09c6ac9243ca2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Price Targets\n\nMichael Miller, an equity analyst at morning star said that $20.50 is a Fair Value for this stock. It's currently trading at $15.10 at the time of writing this DD. That's an upside of 25%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vgaq59ntzec71.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=22ec9ef2f9c9302c86e930bd90db0a8641bb7c96\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Summary of why is SOFI a good play?***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* A very strong support at 15$ price, in the last 7-8 months, this stock has rallied after a huge dip. With the earnings coming up for this company, I am positive that there will be a rally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sofi is positioned to be a #1 leader in the fintech sector. They are jacks of all trades and offering different products to their customers all within one app or website.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Convenience of being able to apply for student loans, investing, mortgages will attract consumers because who wants to end up applying at different companies for different needs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Sofi acquired GALILEO which is a very big company. You haven't heard of this company yet because it's a B2B company. Sofi paid about 1.2B$ for it. They're basically a payment processing platform like stripe, square, paypal etc which is used by all top fintech companies around the globe.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The main goal of SOFI is to be able to provide as many products and services they can to their consumers. They are soon going to be a OneStopShop. Their goal is to basically become an amazon of FinTech and provide all the services in one place. By acting as a one-stop shop for its customer’s finances, SoFi intends to create powerful cross-selling advantages that will reduce its cost of acquisition and give it a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* SOFI has acquired Golden Pacific Bancorp and applying to become a national bank in the US.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The company saw its client growth accelerate in 2020, with more than 2.2 million members on its platform by the end of the first quarter of 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The company’s expanded product lineup along with increased adoption of digital banking during the pandemic has helped accelerate SoFi’s growth, with the number of members increasing by nearly 80-90% in 2020. Rapid growth has continued into 2021, and SoFi remains the only company utilizing a digital full-service model, giving it a clear product niche. Source - morningstar\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It is projected that SOFI would get an approval to become a bank in late 2021 or early 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It is projected that revenue will increase at a 43% CAGR over the next five years as the company benefits from its unique product offering as well as the revenue contributed by its 2020 acquisition of Galileo, which is only the one section of SOFI.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* During the company’s SPAC merger, the company issued equity to PIPE investors to raise more than $1.2 billion in capital, on top of the $800 million that was generated by the SPAC merger itself. This along with debt paydown that occurred both immediately prior and during the SPAC merger has left the company in a good financial position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* SoFi has more than $2 billion in cash and over $4 billion in debt, but that entire debt money is used to finance its lending activities. I believe that there is only little financial risk for SoFi, and incase company decides to re strategize their investment decisions then they would have plenty of money to do so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The adjusted Net Revenue and EBITDA are increasing and trending in the right direction, with 151% and 70% growth YOY respectively and the total products used by members has grown by 121% YOY and financial products has grown 273% YOY.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR ;**\n\n**Not a Finance Advice**\n\n**The stock could rally prior to earnings on 8/12**\n\n**$18-$20 calls expiring 8/20**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition-\n\n50 contracts, strike 20$ expiring 8/20\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/auclbtwlzec71.jpg?width=739&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9eb33422179e9b6c0ca93bdb94ff0c177132697b", "id": "oo8iqn", "created_utc": 1626807368.0, "score": 406, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "Loaded up. 1300 shares of SOFI at 15.56 cost basis!
