Don't sell covered calls on stock you want to keep. \n\nExample:  \nSell a call at 160, expiring August 27, at $1.24.  \nIf AAPL does not reach 160, you keep the proceeds; if AAPL rises to, say, 165, you allow the stock to be called away at expiration; or perhaps \"roll\" the position out a month, and perhaps upward in strike price, for an additional very modest credit...so that if AAPL keeps going up, the stock is called away at a higher price. \n\nWith 3100 shares, the proceeds on 31 calls would be 31   times 1.24 times 100 for about $3800.  If AAPL went up, to, say 170, you might lose out on some of the gain, in exchange for the early cash premium, and allow the stock to be sold at 160. \n\n---\n\nA COLLAR is a conservative method to retain the value of stock by buying a put, paid for by selling an option repeatedly above the present stock price.  A collar is a short call above the money (market price of AAPL stock), and a long put. This can conserve the value of the position from down moves in the stock, which this year has ranged from 115 to 145, a 25% increase from the low to the top.  \n\nOne can arrange to reduce the capital at risk to around 10% to 15% of the total holding with the position; it reduces risk, and reduces gains.  You must be prepared to sell your stock via a covered call, and take your gains and pay taxes on the gains. If you are not ready to allow your stock to go, for a gain, don't undertake covered calls.  \n\nAAPL now at 145. \n\nAn example of one variety of a collar, is to (today is July 13 2021) \n\n\nSell a call for 45 days out, expiring about August 27 2021 at about 1.25  \nBuy a put above the money, at 150, for $13, expiring in March 2022.  \nNet cost,  about 11.75  \n\nNet risk:   \nPer 100 shares,   the put at 150 guarantees a potential price of 150 for your stock, now  at 145.   The call reduces the cost.   \n\nNet risk:   \n145 (current stock value)   \nminus 150 (put strike)   \n plus 13 (cost of put)      \nminus 1.25 (premium on the first call)  \n equals $4.75 net  \n\nPercentage of capital at risk:  \n4.75 on 145 stock value is a risk of 5.25 divided by 145  \n\nIf the stock is called away at 160 via the short call,    \nyour gain from the present value of the stock  145:  \n160, less 145, less cost of the options, (13 minus 1.25 = 11.75),     \na net of $3.75     \nYou also  would be able to harvest residual value on the long put.   \n\nReturn on capital at risk 3.75 over 5.25 ,  about 70%.   \nReturn on stock,  3.75 over 145, about  2.5%.  \nThis has reduced gains, for the price of reduced risk.   \n\nYou might   \nContinue to sell calls as they expire;   \nCollect dividends, on the stock, quarterly    \nand as may be appropriate, if AAPL rises,   \n ratchet up the strike price of the put, for a price, paying to roll upwards in strike,    \n to protect the rising value of AAPL stock.      \nContinue to sell calls, for income, to pay for the put.    \n\nAs time passes, you may have obtained, for a limited period, a risk free gain on the stock, protected by the put, paid in part by the call, and you're prepared for further up moves, and protected from down moves.  \n\n---", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 1 day on [**2021-07-15 05:42:32 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-07-15%2005:42:32%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/oipg43/options_questions_safe_haven_thread_july_1218_2021/h54hwdr/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Foptions%2Fcomments%2Foipg43%2Foptions_questions_safe_haven_thread_july_1218_2021%2Fh54hwdr%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-07-15%2005%3A42%3A32%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20oipg43)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I’ve been buying it since 2000.

If you were trading with real money, could you really afford 10 and 20 sized positions? I couldn't, even at $14/share. The rule of thumb is that no one position should be more than 5% of your total account value at risk, including assignment/cash collateral reserves. Your second position cost you 20 x 1.82 x 100 = $3640. If that is 5% of your total account value, your total account is $72,800. Is that a realistic account size for you in real money?

It would be a better option for an options selling play.\n\nThe most important thing to consider for any options trade is the risk/reward trade-off. You said yourself that a higher up-front debit is riskier. So the question is, are you getting compensated for that risk with the $4 strike? Maybe, maybe not. More information is needed. What is your forecast for the stock, like a target price and when it is expected to hit that price? \n\nThe main value of trading long calls is leverage. If you pay more up front, you get less leverage. A $1 gain on the value of the call for a $4 debit is a 25% gain through leverage, while a $1 gain on a $10 debit is only a 10% gain through leverage.\n\nOn the flip side, the more ITM the call is, the higher the delta of the call is. So even though you make less money on a leverage basis (as a % of your initial debit), you might make more actual dollars if the underlying goes up, since delta of the $4 call will be much higher than the $15. For example, if the $4 call has a delta of 80 while the $15 call only has a delta of 30, a $1 increase in the underlying means you earn $.80 on the $4 strike, but only $.30 on the $15 strike.\n\nSo as you can see, it's all trade-offs. No one combination of risks and rewards is \"best\". It all depends on what you are trying to do.\n\nLet me leave you with this final bit of advice: You need a very good reason to trade LEAPS calls over shares. It's almost always better to just buy shares with the same money you would have spent on the LEAPS. You don't have to buy 100 shares. Shares have the advantage of no expiration and 100 delta.

{"title": "Beachbody ($BODY) DD", "selftext": "So, I did a DD on $PTON a few months ago, which brought me to this competitor company. I would’ve included it on my list of competitors in that post, but it hadn’t merged at the time.\n\nI see this company as a potential 2-3x bagger either in the short-term or within 1-2 years, and here’s why.\n\n**Overview:**\n\nBeachbody ($BODY) is a fitness company that’s been operating for 20+ years (founded in 1998). They’ve just recently completed a three-way merger with FRX and Myx Fitness.\n\nBeachbody has brought their digital content, fitness instructors and subscribers, as well as nutritional products to the table. Myx Fitness has brought their fitness equipment.\n\nUnder the name Beachbody, they plan to be a direct competitor of Peloton, but aiming at the “everyman” market as opposed to the health nut/upper-income market like Peloton. For that reason, their subscriptions and equipment are cheaper.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Here’s what makes it look good:**\n\n* 400 million in cash on hand\n* Zero debt and 10% margin EBITDA (This is for Beachbody pre-merger and is according to an [interview](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/interview-beachbody-ceo-carl-daikeler-195052224.html) with Carl Daikeler)\n* 3.2 million subscribers\n* 95.8% month over month digital retention (94.8% average)\n* 1 billion in combined revenue estimated for 2021\n* Has some big names on board – Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James, Shaq\n\n*(In 2018, Congdon co-founded a personalized nutrition programming and tracking app with \"*[*FaceTime*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) *for fitness\" live group classes called Openfit. The company acquired LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Ladder, which develops nutritional products to help athletes with severe cramping after James had issues in the 2014 NBA finals. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, James and Schwarzenegger remained minority stakeholders.  They are model influencers for the app and produce content/workouts for OpenFit and have 21 million and 73 million followers respectively.)*\n\n* Has experienced CEOS directing things, especially in the area of digital content service – Kevin Mayer (ex-CEO of TikTok, and ex-VP of Disney+), Carl Daikeler (CEO and founder of Beachbody), Jon Longdon (CEO of OpenFit and co-founder of Beachbody)\n* Has a relationship with LA Fitness, giving LA Fitness, Esporta  Fitness, and City Sports members the ability add OpenFit to their existing gym membership \n* Carl Daikeler claims he doesn’t plan to sell a single share (this is purely speculative so it depends on whether or not you trust he'd keep his word - I'm not banking on that tbh)\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can read more about the merger and the company’s info in [this article](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/forest-road-acquisition-corp-and-the-beachbody-company-announce-combined-first-quarter-2021-financial-results-for-beachbody-and-myx-2021-05-19-91591019?siteid=bigcharts&dist=bigcharts&tesla=y).\n\nSo, basically, we’ve got a company with experience, seemingly good financials, a massive subscriber pool (many of whom are fanatical like PTON subscribers), and excellent retention rate.\n\nYou can read about the details of expected earnings, their plans and products through the [investor presentation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f75fdc89cf35e7524ec4b54/t/6023f07523d4531acaea9e8b/1612968070409/Beachbody+PIPE+Presentation.pdf).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, with all this promise, why is the price of the stock so low?**\n\nWell, for one thing, it has just merged, and a drop after de-spacing while people lock in profits is common. Also, Beachbody hasn’t had much PR, so there hasn’t been a lot to push this stock up. It’s relatively undiscovered by the wider market and volume is low.\n\nMarket makers have been using this to their advantage, and are having a great time pushing around retail. They’ve been shorting it heavily, taking it as low as it can go to make maximum profit.\n\nFor this reason, buying shares rather than options is the better choice imo. Last month, the MMs took the stock price down to precisely $9.99 at the very end of the day of expiry of $10 calls, so that they’d all expire worthless. The manipulation was blatant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, if MMs are controlling this stock, why am I bullish?**\n\nBecause all it takes is a bit of PR and volume, and this stock could take off. The MMs are controlling this right now because they can, but it’s impossible for that to last forever once there’s PR, earnings and the wider market recognises its value. They’ve shorted it HEAVILY, and last I read it was at approx. 27% short interest percentage, and only 40,000 shares ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/BODy](https://fintel.io/ss/us/BODy)) available to short.\n\nIt's also been the only other NYSE stock on the SSR list along with $AMC.\n\nCatalysts are already starting which is recently pushing up the share price. What are the catalysts? PR, analyst PTs and earnings.\n\nThe first 2 analysts have brought out their PTs – one at **$12** and another at **$16**, so analysts thus far are decidedly bullish on $BODY. Upon the $16 PT, the stock rose approx. 2 dollars. \n\nAlso, this was pre-merger, but when Shaq did a single tweet about BODY, it jumped about 50 cents - $1.00 (I can't remember the exact amount) in a few minutes. \n\nThis shows you how quickly the stock could rise on some good news.\n\nBeachbody’s CEO Carl states they plan to spend a lot of their cash on marketing, so we can expect to hear more and more about Beachbody in the coming months.\n\nNow, I can’t say how much the MMs are allowing this price rise right now, but the fact of the matter is, in this current market and with all the catalysts expected to come, it’s highly unlikely they could maintain this low share price permanently. I believe that at some point they have to cover or reverse position.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short Squeeze \\*(No, I don't think this will happen!)**\n\nSome people are talking about a short squeeze with regards to this stock, which, yes, it’s a potential short squeeze candidate, but if there’s one thing $GME and $AMC has shown us, it’s that you need a LOT of buying pressure to even have a chance of that. It’s pretty rare to have a short squeeze happen, and I’m not hanging my hopes on that. The thing is, in my opinion, we don’t NEED a short squeeze here. The MMs must know that this isn’t a sustainable position for a growing company, but since we’re still early in the game, they can eke as much money as possible out of retail before more big boys and more retail buyers load in.\n\nA lot of people, including myself, aren’t selling because it’s obvious this stock is worth more than its current price. It’s only a matter of time.\n\n**Competitors** (I go into them in more detail in my PTON DD so please read that in my post history if you want to know more about them. Here I'm going to talk about them with respect to BODY)\n\nThere are a lot of up-and-coming competitors, and they are only likely to increase, but I’m going to be looking at the main competitors at this time, or the ones that appear imo to have potential. They are as follows:\n\nPeloton\n\nApple Fitness +\n\nNautilus\n\niFit/NordicTrack\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\n**Peloton**\n\nThere's no denying Peloton ($PTON) is dominating right now. They're doing fantastically with their branding, marketing and innovation. Just recently, they announced a corporate program allowing companies to purchase Peloton packages for their employees. This is an excellent move as we come out of the pandemic, and I expect we'll see more moves like this in the future from Peloton.\n\nI wrote DD on PTON a few months ago, so you can read more about them in my post history. So far (fingers crossed), my DD has been pretty spot on with that, and I'm still very bullish on it. The only thing I can see taking PTON down at this point are market corrections, which will take all our bubbly stocks down. If that happens, I see it recovering eventually since I do believe this is a future tech.\n\nDo I think Beachbody will become as big as Peloton? At this point, no, I don't. Beachbody has had some big hits like P90X and Insanity in the past, and they have a lot going for them with respect to revenue and subscriber base. However, despite being the original \"at-home workout\" brand, they became outdated and in this new tech sector, they're following rather than innovating. \n\nIn my opinion they will need to show some type of innovation to have a chance of investors seeing a long-term future with them. \n\nOne current advantage they have is that they are a well-known name, and they are aiming for a target market that Peloton hasn't covered yet, which is the more casual fitness user/people on a budget. You can read more about their live classes and how they plan to compete with Peloton [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2021/05/19/beachbody-takes-on-peloton-with-bodi-live-interactive-workout-service/).\n\n**Apple Fitness +**\n\nApple Fitness + is a potential threat mostly to Peloton, but only if they decide to produce equipment imo. Why? Because they have a massive subscriber base ready-made, and the ability to link a lot of products together. If it's just the app, it's competing with content only. For this reason, it's important for Peloton to get ahead of them and corner the market fast, especially in the commercial area so that they can become the industry standard.\n\nFor Beachbody, since it is aimed at the \"everyman\" and person-on-a-budget, while Apple could still take some market share, it's less likely to be steamrolled. Why? Because Apple aims at a similar market to Peloton - people with higher incomes. Apple is likely to be taking more market share from Peloton's target market than Beachbody's.\n\n**Nautilus**\n\nThis one is useful to compare with since they are an \"everyman\" competitor with a stock price (sitting at $15.48 at time of writing). \n\nThey originally went public through a reverse merger with Perspective in 1999. Their revenue last year was $553 million (Beachbody = $864 million in 2020).  They currently focus on at-home equipment. \n\nTheir connected fitness service (JRNY) costs $19.99 per montt/$149 per year, or $9.99 per month on your own device. \n\nAgain, they have here the edge in equipment while I believe Beachbody has the edge in content. I couldn't find information on their number of subscribers. However, JRNY was developed last year only, so it's relatively new suggesting a low amount of subscribers at present. Their app has 1,080 reviews with a pretty lousy 2.6 star rating while Beachbody has over 22,000 reviews and a 4.8 star rating.\n\n**iFit/NordicTrack**\n\nThis also aims at the \"everyman\", and is looking to reinvent itself after Peloton's success. \n\niFit and NordicTrack are both owned by ICON Health and Fitness - a company that's been around since the 1970s developing exercise equipment. It developed iFit and pairs it with its NordicTrack equipment. Last year it made revenue exceeding $1.5 billion and has a valuation of $7 billion. Currently, Beachbody made $864 million and is on track to make $1 billion revenue this year. It also has a valuation of approx. $3 billion.\n\nYou could say that ICON is coming from the opposite side, having specialized in equipment and now developing content, while Beachbody has specialized in content and is now using Myx Fitness to develop equipment, as well as combining their content. Beachbody will need to do some catch-up on NordicTrack when it comes to developing equipment since NordicTrack already has treadmills and ellipticals along with their bike. \n\nHowever, bear in mind that the real money-making area is subscriptions. Even for Peloton, equipment only make a small portion of their revenue since most people can't afford or don't have the space for a home gym. Therefore, the real competition is going to be in the content and how well companies can get people signed up to their apps + keeping them there. iFit has a mere 330,000 subscribers in comparison to Beachboy's 3.2 million.\n\nFor comparison equipment-wise, a NordicTrack bike starts from $1,599 and a Myx Fitness (Beachbody) bike starts from $1,299. NordicTracks come with a 1-year free subscription to iFit ($15/mo or $39/mo for a family plan).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Overall, I could see Beachbody competing with iFit/NordicTrack/ICON and Nautilus in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bearish Points:**\n\n1. *This company will fail because it’s got some MLM practices.*\n\nBeachbody has a branch of their business called \"Team Beachbody\". You can become a \"coach\", and as a result, you get discounts on products by helping others workout and by selling products to other people. Beachbody claims it's not an MLM, but imo it clearly is. And there's no doubt that it's brought some bad rep to their company, and stops some people from wanting to invest.\n\nIt doesn't bother me as long as the company's making money, and I completely get if people don't want to invest for ethical reasons, or if they think it will cost the company in future. I could be wrong, but I'm of the opinion that unless they can reform that aspect of their business and pivot away from any MLM or scam-like practices, they don't have a chance of becoming a big contender in the industry long-term. Whether or not they do that, I don't know. \n\nHowever, I personally am not looking for it to become the next Peloton. I'm simply finding that, with its current revenue, subscribers, and projected revenue, it is very undervalued, and **that** I consider an opportunity. \n\nThey have been in operation for 20+ years, much of it trading profitably, so it's a good sign for the future of it in a massive tech growth industry. The fitness industry itself is worth over $100 billion and growing rapidly, so there's a lot of money to go around. \n\nAlso, we can see for comparison, full-on MLM companies like Herbalife and Avon (at its height) that have managed to operate successfully, albeit not at a Peloton-level. \n\nWith their MLM aspect in play, I don't see this as a blue chip, hold-forever type of stock, but to get a good profit from the current stock price? It seems very promising because they CAN operate profitably and they are entering a growth industry.\n\n2) *Things are still speculative. We haven’t seen their earnings yet.*\n\nYep, fair enough. There is still some risk in that regard. There’s also the likelihood this merger and future expenses like R&D and marketing will cut into their profits, possibly making it negative for a year or two like Peloton was. However, this current market is very bullish and forward-looking, so I could see the stock price going up or maintaining anyhow, especially since it’s already so low. At this point, things are still volatile with the stock, and Beachbody needs to prove itself before we can expect the wider market to take notice. \n\nI'm not expecting this stock to launch into space, but providing there are no massive failures, it should come into its value.\n\n3) *This is a pandemic stock. After the pandemic is over, it’ll crash along with Peloton.*\n\nIt certainly looks like we're in a bubble right now, and many are holding their breath for when that bubble might burst, or at least have a bunch of corrections. I can see it happening with Peloton at some point (it’s already had a correction though it’s climbing back up), but this stock price is already so low, it can’t really fall much further, so in that way it’s very low-risk compared to a lot of other investments. Great upside, small downside. Also, the pandemic has changed things permanently, and while I agree it has given stocks like PTON a big boost, I’m of the belief that this technology is going to be the future, so I’d expect both PTON and BODY to recover eventually, even if they happen to be brought down by corrections.\n\n*4) They're not innovative. What is their moat?*\n\nBeachbody has been innovative in the past. In 2015 they created Beachbody on Demand, which was to be the \"Netflix for fitness\". They were also the big name in home workouts, and came up with certain successes like P90x and Insanity. At-home workouts is Beachbody's territory.\n\nHowever, as mentioned before, they have faded out and have become a market follower rather than a market leader. Peloton has taken that space and is doing it well. \n\nDo I think they have a moat right now? Over Peloton, my answer is no. Over other competitors aiming at the \"everyman\" market? Yes. They currently have an edge in their name, their ready-made content, and their ready-made subscribers. They also have in-depth knowledge of the at-home workout industry. How long they can keep that edge remains to be seen.\n\n**Reviews**\n\nTo get an idea of how people see them here are some reviews I found-  \n\n[Beachbody on Demand streaming service](https://www.amazon.com/Beachbody-Demand-Month-Membership-including/dp/B07485JMTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) (appears to be pre-merger reviews)\n\n[Beachbody app](http://www.apprview.com/health-fitness/beachbody-on-demand/)  Here are\n\n[Bodi](https://www.productreview.com.au/listings/bodi) (their drinks)\n\n[TrustPilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.beachbody.com) (the general company so different aspects) - This one is the most bearish sign imo since there have been recent complaints about customers having trouble unsubscribing and being changed. If they can't fix that, they'll be in trouble.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWhile they could always surprise me, based on their past failures in innovation, I'm not expecting Beachbody to be the next Peloton. However, they've managed to operate profitably for many years, and they have some advantage entering into this new take on the fitness industry. Having the ex-TikTok and ex-Disney+ CEO on board is a bullish sign for me since he should be able to help them significantly with their digital pivot. My hope also is that he can help them with innovation and branding. Myx Fitness too should bring in some fresh thinking. \n\nI'm not looking at this stock as being one of the big boys of the future, but as a decent competitor in its respective target market. For this reason, I'm bullish that it can achieve a 2-3 x increase within the next 1-2 years, if not sooner. \n\n**Disclosure:** I currently have 1,100 shares at $10.34. My PT is between $15-18 in the short-term providing the overall market stays bullish, and $25-35 within 1-2 years.

Beachbody can capture a customer who pays just $100 a year, and they then have access to all the workouts and nutritional content (and I don't mean supplements, I mean the portion size education etc). So it's just so different to what most people are thinking. Their main focus is streaming moving forward, an 89% gross margin product.

They have different offerings for different people. I have zero interest in Peleton personally. I like beachbody and have done for over a decade. I will get a Myx, and actually want to get a Tonal too. The assumption people will only use one product and one company are just so wrong. That's ok - I am sure you have a rebuttal for me - but I am not saying one is better than the other. I am just saying why Beachbody is a good option for consumers, and at this point for investors. The revenue and profit are really strong - and as a public company their path to growth is a lot easier. They have operated from cashflow only up till now. If you look at Peleton numbers before going public, you will see how things changed for them when they went public.

That's one of the reasons I invested in BODY, because they're aiming at a different niche. They are still in the same industry and general area though, and competitors with similar products are the best companies to compare to for estimating a stock price  for a benchmark.\n\nThe Beachbody CEO is [quoted](https://newsfilter.io/articles/beachbody-is-going-public-and-ceo-says-the-stock-is-like-a-bargain-priced-peloton-9b7ff6558281b603b3d32720e61ae206) as comparing Peloton's multiple with Beachbody's as a comparison, and is reported to have stated that Beachbody is like a bargain-priced Peloton.\n\nIf you have any other companies that you think it'd be better to compare to, I'll happily look at them too.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Oh whoops - you are the OP. My bad. Yes your DD is great, and thank you for putting it out there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the one thing it missed a bit is the major focus on streaming, and how that is the key catalyst to take the company to the next level (and it's why we have Kevin Mayer on the board - and who knows more about streaming than him?). The simple fact is as it stands, there is no company to compare to directly. The others are going to grow into streaming as a bigger focus from a springboard of hardware. But for now, there is no specific competitor in their exact sector of the at home fitness market. To me, that's part of the point. They are one of the pioneers of at home workouts, and know it better than most. Their millions of loyal subscribers are likely to get into the new products, the cross selling to those subscribers of the Myx will give a huge boost quickly and pretty easily, etc. Myx is still only projected to be 10-15% of revenue. \n\nThe thing I like the very most is the streaming revenue and profit. Projected for this year streaming will be $450m. At the 89% gross margin, that's over $400m of streaming profit. That's a huge number and dwarfs anyone else in the space. Sure other companies will have larger overall revenue - but for a sub $10 stock, that is crazy. It's a sub 2.6x multiple on revenue. Industry avg is 5.6x and some are trading at a multiple of over 10. Crazy. I don't think BB should trade at that multiple as frankly I think it's unrealistic - but at just 5x revenue, share price as it stands without any forward revenue factored should be double what it is right now. It's the best investment in the short term for the industry - it may not appeal to everyone, but value investors will start buying after earnings next month.

Thanks for understanding!\n\nAnd yes - all your points are highly valid and accurate. For an investor like myself, I am looking at where is the best revenue coming from now, what are the main focus points of the business, and how will they help capture market share. The most overlooked thing about Beachbody (and Openfit) in my own opinion is the massive value from streaming, especially when they have 15 years of content available to all, right now. The nutritional videos and meal plans are really great too - portion control, balance of foods to ensure a good diet, recipes etc. That $100 price point can offer an entire household a path to wellness - and it may just be a springboard for them, and sure they might decide to go the Peleton route, or Nordictrack etc from there. So actually, for the entire at home space Beachbody could be the strongest gateway for the uninitiated due to entry price. Plus, implementing streaming in other countries is a lot more straight forward than doing equipment - especially in poorer countries.\n\nThe TAM of the industry is going to be enormous, so I think all these brands will do really well from it. Beachbody is currently very misunderstood, and written off quickly as just one thing - but people are missing a huge part of the business as a consequence. An $8.62 share price right now is an absolute bargain, and presents a chance to double/triple/etc within the next year. Can't see any of the others doing that in the same time frame - one in particular has already made that massive move.\n\nNet profit will be down this year and next due to increased cost to integrate everything together - it's why their EBITDA projections are low for this year. But many of those are one off costs, so long term investors will be aware of that and see the potential. Plus all that cash in hand post merger closing is going to be put to good use.

It is merely by the data that it is only technically a short squeeze candidate, just like any stock that is shorted by over 20%. I have presented that data for people who would like to examine that aspect.\n\nAnalysts haven't raised the PT, but rather have only just started putting out their PTs. Already these have been catalysts for the stock price rising, and as more add PTs, they may continue to be catalysts. Other potential catalysts will include PR. As mentioned in the DD, they have said they're planning to use most of their cash on hand to invest in marketing. Another potential catalyst will be the company's first earnings. At this point, much of the financials are relatively speculative based on information given to us by the company. Should the financials match up or be positive, it could be a big catalyst.\n\nI understand your view on the bearish points. If I had included all that you ask it would have made for an extremely long post since there's so much to address. Here's a quick summary though. Competitors include - Peloton, Apple, iFiit/NordicTrack, FIIT, Nautilus. You can read more about the industry as a whole as well as details on the competitors in my PTON DD post.\n\nI am not in the BODY stock with a view to it becoming the next Peloton, so I think it would be best compared to Nautilus or NordicTrack, and any other competitor aiming at the everyman. I only want it to double or triple in price although others are a lot more bullish than I am for the long-term. I personally don't expect it to dominate in future.\n\nWhere its edge is, is in the fact that it has a big headstart in its combo of subscribers, content and equipment. It also has a relationship with LA Fitness, giving LA Fitness, Esporta Fitness, and City Sports members the ability add OpenFit to their exiting gym membership. In this way, it has a similar advantage to Peloton albeit aiming at the \"everyman\" market rather than the \"health nut/upper class\" market.\n\nOn the bearish side of that, the threat is that if its other competitors can catch up, or if Peloton decides to aim at the \"everyman\" market (which it is likely to do in future), it will probably lose some market share. \n\nAs for what they are struggling with, they previously struggled with moving with the times, and they also have the negative image of their MLM aspects. While they've had some big successes (like P90x), they fell behind in the online fitness market and weren't innovative enough. As to whether their current pivot will succeed, there's no guarantee which is where the risk comes in. \n\nGoing public hasn't changed much yet as far as I can see, as they still need to prove themselves post-merger.

Methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than Co2 - it has a stronger effect and dissipates quicker. Over the timescale of 100 years, 1 kg of Methane is equivalent to \\~ 40kg of Co2 and over a smaller timescale of 20-30 years it's much more than that. Cutting methane emissions wherever possible has a massively disproportionate effect on whether or not we will be able to prevent a tipping point / avalanche effect in the next decade(s) or not. The effect is so strong that burning methane gas (which produces Co2) would have a negative carbon footprint (when compared to releasing it into the atmosphere)\n\nMethane emissions from meat production, particularly from ruminant animals such as cows, are extremely high and dwarf any other food production or transport cost by a significant margin (transport emissions for goods are generally not that high, because you can transport so many products at once that the burden on any individual product is very low. Transport emissions are mainly from transporting people).\n\nFor comparison, if you had to drive 100 miles (and back) in your petrol car to buy a kg of any meat replacement instead of a kilosteak, you would have a smaller carbon footprint than when eating the steak.\n\nNow that's the consumer end, let's look at the production: Animals need feeding and they're not sustaining themselves off grass alone. Food production needed for animals is insane. It varies depending on the animal and region, but 20kg of food per kg of meat is on the conservative side of things. This food needs to be grown like most other food, and producing 20kg of food - even if it is low quality animal food - creates significantly more emissions than the production of 1kg of high quality human food.\n\nLand requirements are also massive: Land requirements for both the food production for cattle and the cattle themselves are **the** reason for the destruction of the amazon rainforest, being responsible for some 80-90% of the deforestation. A common myth is that illegal logging is responsible for the rainforest destruction, but they only make up some 2-5% of the actual loss. No, the amazon rainforest is burned down in huge areas to use the extremely fertile soil for animal food or grazing lands (burned rainforest lands are extremely fertile and quickly become grasslands).\n\nLastly, as some other people here mentioned, there is an environmental component as well (water requirements). It's not a factor when the meat is produced in a wealthy nation, but most of it comes from poorer regions, where water is scarce and necessary for the survival of humans - or their farms at the very least. Oftentimes this means buying the only wells in the area and building a fence around them (or exhausting them), so that the people living in the area can no longer sustain themselves and become refugees. But at least the companies do a nice charity dinner for poor children in Africa once in a while, isn't that nice :)\n\n**tl;dr** Ethical points aside, meat (particularly steak) is extremely bad for the climate and worse than pretty much else you can do by several orders of magnitude.

Those are not boomer numbers. The market is realizing that $MS is not only a bigass bank but also a slut dragon.\n\nBelow are a few reasons why I think this GROWTH STOCK still has tremendous upside ahead:\n\n* PE Ratio of 12 ⁉️\n* Profit Margin of 25% ⁉️\n* Operating Margin of 40% ⁉️\n* $540B of cash on hand ⁉️⁉️⁉️ That's bigger than most companies' market caps\n* Think of how many bold acquisitions this kind of war chest could fund. Especially with a market crash/recession imminent, Morgan Stanley is poised to go on a buying spree that would put my online shopping addicted mother to shame\n* Has recently been making very aggressive investments in fintechs and wealth management platforms (most recently acquired E-Trade and outbid JP Morgan for Eaton Vance). These businesses are poised for growth going forward. Even the shittiest wealth management company out there (Robinhood) is growing more explosively than my Taco Bell diarrhea. And it's not a stretch to assume that more and more users like ourselves will jump from Robinhood to TDA, Merrill, or E-Trade. Everyone offers zero-fee trading now, it's not a moat or anything\n* Literally a bulge bracket bank that the government and Fed will never allow to go tits up\n* We are in an IPO/SPAC boom, and that just means more investment banking revenues. Also, if markets crash, then well-managed companies will start acquiring other businesses like crazy, and that also means more investment banking revenues. The house always wins\n* Recently, certain factions of WSB have been clamoring to buy puts on banks for some reason. Why though? If the Fed makes emergency rate hikes, then banks will moon because higher interest rates are good for them. Or if inflation is only transitory and there are no emergency rate hikes, then banks will moon because lower inflation and an economic recovery are good for them. Inverse WSB\n\nEven if my growth thesis is wrong, I'll still own a healthy, profitable company that has committed to $12B in share buybacks and quarterly dividends of $0.70 per share (3.1% yield at current prices). Come at me bro.\n\nThe earnings report is on Thursday. I predict a blowout\n\nTLDR: Small waist, pretty face, with a big bank.

Now, as people are forced to go back to their offices and wage slave for pennies thanks to the thousands they lost on meme yolo's..... they're going to need new pants to fit over their fat asses that have increased in size due to the cyclical nature of ordering takeout alone and becoming more depressed.\n\nYou all know this too well, but I'll illustrate this complex process for the extra-retarded among us:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdhuc1v6fsa71.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=63fe722521d99bfea65cf3846dca7dfd624dbc9d\n\n*^(I know what you're thinking... \"I'm in this photo and I don't like it.\")*\n\n# Levi's, the pandemic, and recovery:\n\nBasically, in 2020 everyone started staying home all the time and no one wore pants. I can confirm because I personally did not wear jeans for at least 8 months. That new found casual glory was reflected in Levi's sales. **However, Levi's has seen an accelerated recovery** that has beaten even their own already increased expectations, *and exceeded pre-covid performance*. The average weight gain over the course of the pandemic was something like 22 pounds; waistlines are growing faster than the blue jean gods could have possibly anticipated.\n\n**Just today, Morgan Stanley increased their price target by almost 50% to $40 per share.**\n\nLooking at Levi's most recent earnings data, from this past week:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/833fhb2afsa71.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=e80e95bfa4a6128d8b6f19c756c627a0988f952a\n\nHere's a look at 2021 vs 2020:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bnjrv3vbfsa71.png?width=1714&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c61679e31c481cd11846c490f8c1731fb6a11f2\n\nAll over the globe Levi's sales numbers have been soaring:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d6hc3elcfsa71.png?width=1713&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3e112219f06edf7302de1476140678dadd69f08\n\nWhy? This increased fatness (and trust me this surprised me too) isn't just limited to America:\n\n[Leading the fucking way, of course, as is tradition.](https://preview.redd.it/nakbk0wdfsa71.png?width=1516&format=png&auto=webp&s=532d8b5554b58bcc68ba29df9af97f24b7eb1027)\n\n# \"They sell pants and I'm fat, I get it. What's the point.\"\n\nAgain, focusing on earnings, there are some stark similarities in the charts and performance that lead me to believe we are due for a run up here. Let's compare the last 2 earnings cycles and the 10 days immediately following the report. Last earnings on left, this earnings on right (note the chart position relative to the top and bottom channel lines for future reference):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqdt93lgfsa71.png?width=1520&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea3c3f07a76e3cd47c1ae2f253a67b6b24629a62\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62hqxidhfsa71.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=92e507a39733c537dccfb79fbf5a436249376af9\n\nI went with a 10% guess for the run up this time, just because the spike wasn't *as* impressive. However what you also have to consider here is that the stock is currently riding in the bottom of it's channel where's it's been comfortably consolidating for *6 weeks:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aijfi02mfsa71.png?width=2178&format=png&auto=webp&s=b33e10724f9ecce4e86d91b663f64e646948da29\n\nI get an extra boost of confidence by the stock recovering from that dip and settling right back into the previous pattern. This channel actually extends well beyond the last 6 weeks shown above. Below, you'll see the consistency of this ride dating back to October of 2020:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yomw1ymnfsa71.png?width=2185&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9541576632bcc3aa42c2bb5a94959dc6c5ae40b\n\n# \"Stonks go up, duh. How to make money without buying pants?\"\n\nNothing can replace the years of life we've lost ordering door dash every time we get sad. One thing we can do, though, is make decent \"investing\" decisions to print more money and allow us to continue our self-destructive habits. LEVI has a universal buy rating among the analysts who've rated it and price targets range from +12% to +40%. Looking at the charts, again with the earnings cycles as our focal point:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/af8jv0bpfsa71.png?width=2184&format=png&auto=webp&s=61479f4ffe48c16858f25f4c186080b9ad5b67e1\n\nThe horizontal line on that chart is $30. The first 2 vertical lines are earnings reports. The third vertical line is August expiry. I think we see a return to the upper half of the channel before then, and I think we see it in the next 10 days - 2 weeks. **This is not financial advice, my mom only buys me Velcro, off-brand jeans because my brain can't do buttons, zippers scare me, and I soil pants frequently.**\n\n# TL;DR - Levi's smashed earnings again, and is currently riding nice and smooth at the bottom of its long-term channel. Last earnings it ran up 15% after the initial spike/sell off and it's poised to do the same. People got fatter, too much takeout = new pants, calls on cholesterol.\n\nSee you on the moon.\n\nCheers\n\nPositions:\n\n* Active:  \n\n   * Aug 20th $28 C's\n   * Aug 20th $30 C's\n   * Shares\n* Adding:  \n\n   * Jan '22 $35 C's\n   * Shares\n* Risky business  \n\n   * 1-2 steps out of the money, July 16th C's\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uenqqhnrfsa71.png?width=698&format=png&auto=webp&s=a772d0a38b8692df2eed3f4e67cbdcfa0e55e168", "id": "oiru5g", "created_utc": 1626098455.0, "score": 301, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 183, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|39|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|312|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o6cggf/prpl_dd_a_catalyst_awakens_an_ancient_meme/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0udtf/now_that_shit_has_somewhat_calmed_down_here_lets/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o18gs5/itub_dd_come_get_you_some_tubs_of_crispy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o71fun/erecting_a_turgid_empire_in_a_bulging_market_dkng/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1kcq7/for_all_you_newly_minted_clean_energy_addicts_out/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvb9t5/testing_a_theory_that_some_posts_get_through/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1zllo/clne_the_push_to_618_and_the_future/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntu0wi/good_clne_fun_and_discussion_another_dd_lets/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntuczn/another_good_clean_dd_lets_review_some_discussion/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntul8a/another_good_clean_dd_lets_review_some_discussion/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrnu75/your_next_play_weve_taken_from_the_greedy_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nrnyxz/your_next_play_weve_taken_from_the_greedy_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv8z8w/for_fucks_sake_go_outside_have_you_ever_bought/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsdueb/clne_goes_beyond_the_618_event_this_is_great_hold/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvlacw/back_again_for_another_dd_about_mr_clne_fresh_off/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o5307c/crsr_a_growth_play_disguised_as_a_value_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o77m4g/draftkings_erecting_a_turgid_empire_in_a_bulging/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o9nydm/cuck_in_comfort_calls_on_lzb/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oiru5g/2020_people_got_bigger_pants_didnt_levi_dd/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Obvious shill", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Can confirm.
