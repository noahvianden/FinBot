So you are just trading sentiment basically.

I could be totally wrong but that’s just what I see. I like Lisa Su, I’m a believer in her and I think she’s done an amazing job and will continue to do an amazing job. So in that regard, over the next five years I see AMD as being undervalued right now. Who knows intel could turn it around tomorrow, or they could end up never turning it around, I don’t personally think that but for the next five years I see AMD gaining even more market share.  Ask me again in 5 years, my answer could be completely different then.  But for now I see AMD as undervalued if I’m looking 5 years out.

A rich P/E ratio can be justified if you expect a high continued growth rate. I am interested in both AMD and Intel so I wanted to hear what your thesis was. But AMD is richly priced so again if it fails to deliver on that growth there is not a small downward potential. I like a large margin of Safety in my investments because I know usually I wont be able to predict the future with 100% certainty. \n\nAs for Intel people arent really investing due to their semiconductor business, but the new ventures they are creating.

Just to add to this, something that is often overlooked is market maker's role in single stock order flows and how they affect underlying assets flow prior to and after catalysts like earnings. This is especially common in Tech but really remains true for all single stock options.\n\nLet's take TSLA or TWTR for example. They had earnings in the past week and absolutely crushed them. So why did their prices fall after earnings? Well one reason is that some of this is priced in inherently, but they seem to fall consistently and not remain at this strike the market priced them at. As the longs purchase more calls leading up to the earnings, market makers must remain Delta neutral. Market makers begin to hedge the short calls they've written through buying a Delta equivalent of the underlying asset. (Side note: Keep in mind that IV is being pushed higher closer to earnings/catalyst and raises the the contract price...exacerbated by retail traders willing to pay higher prices). \n\nAs the day of earnings, the individual stock has risen because more and more people are buying calls, expecting earnings to be positive, and in turn forcing market makers to buy a ton of the underlying leading up to the day. As the strike rises, more people buy OTM or ATM calls hoping to cash out on the news. When the news hits, like TSLA or TWTR crushing numbers, it is priced in (more likely overpriced in) and a lot of these calls drop in Delta and/or expire. This causes market makers to sell all of their owned shares matching contracts or the Delta that they are exposed to, driving the underlying value down even further. The only way this isn't the case, is that the company kills earnings in such a magnitude (and most likely coincides with another massively positive event) that all of these OTM or ATM calls go ITM and the market makers are forced to buy more shares to remain Delta Neutral. If not, they will sell down as I mentioned before.\n\nThe reason I've mentioned tech is due to the lack of liquidity in the market making this a generally more drastic move. A great way to make money from this is through straddles but I think I'd need to head over to r/options to elaborate on that.\n\nI came here to comment this because most retail traders do not understand how big of an impact market makers and order flow have on individual stocks and they are generally predictable, outstanding black swans.

After that happened, the the squeeze from the S&P buy in and trackers pushed the stock far above were it should have been so it began to decline as people took profits and institutional investors vented off shares to meet percentage requirements in their portfolios. This slowly continued until may may, it began to resist the decline, but decline it still did. In March, it hit a critical point... The upward trend resistance floor that the stock had been following... The exact point that if that upward floor had continued would be... And the stock bounced off of that hard and upward. But then it hit the ceiling of the downward trend from the $900 all time high (ATH). So it went back down... And bounced off the floor of the upward trend. It did that back and forth over a dozen times.. but because one line was trending upward and the other down... any investor that decided to play these lines by selling when it hit the downward ceiling and buying when it hit the upward floor would have more than doubled their money in a time when the price was consolidating, so I imagine many investors did just that, which solidified it. The two lines eventually met at a point like a \">\" That point.. Happened last week... This week we have now broken out of the yearly upward trend lines floor.... But we have also broken out of the almost 7 month downward trendline 's ceiling. Typically in a breakout like this, a stock will follow one trend or the other... But this week we broke out of both.

But Tesla is a massive growth stock, with 2 giga/tera factories about to be complete. It will be breaking out to follow the upward yearly line... And when it does, it will be a massive FOMO catalyst... As there is no more \"ceiling\" for the stock other than it's previous ATH, and we are 6 VERY SUCCESSFUL months into the future of the company that hit that high, so the potential to break it and find a new ceiling seems to not be an \"if\" but \"when\" So look at the chart of the last year, and draw an upward line that hits the bottom point of TSLA (should connect about 9 points, and come close to almost 20) and keep that line moving upward in that same direction.

Examples are AAPL after September 2012, NVDA in 2018, and AMZN in 2018.  After tremendous increases in market valuation, these stocks retraced and remained more or less stagnant for more than a year. \n\nTSLA traded in the 800-900 range in January 2021.  If TSLA follows a similar pattern as other tech giants, we may be waiting for another 12 months, or July 2022, for resumption of upwards movement in share price. \n\nAs long as Tesla keeps making good progress on 4680 cell production and FSD, the markets will eventually reward TSLA with higher valuation.  \n\nWhat I recommend:\n\n* **Either hold shares or accumulate shares** while overall market interest in TSLA is low.  Trading volume is anemic.  \n* **Avoid options**.  Avoid the temptation of fast money on short term calls.  The options markets are a casino, and Market Makers are the house.  The House always comes out ahead.  Buying options puts time on the Market Maker's side, while holding shares puts time on YOUR side.  In a game that's rigged against small investors, it is wise to keep all the advantages possible.\n* **Avoid margin**.  Should the markets unexpectedly crash, which is always a possibility, margin puts debtors at risk of having to liquidate shares at a low price to meet a margin call.  Debt puts volatility on your Broker's side.  Don't give them that advantage. \n\nThere is no way to know in advance what will spark a runup or when this might happen.  If Tesla shows good progress on FSD and subscriptions start to grow, that could push Institutional Investors back into buying TSLA.  \n\nSelling covered calls can be dangerous.  A random event that causes TSLA to rocket upwards again could cause shares to be called away at much lower than market prices.  Covered calls can be a source of income during prolonged stagnation periods, but again, there is no free lunch because we don't know when stagnation might end. \n\nPatient investors in a great business have a high chance of being rewarded.

{"title": "Crying over your heavy $CRSR bags? Then this is the DD for you...sort of.", "selftext": "Alright retards, put down your peanutbutter and tuna sandwiches and listen up.\n\nFor too long there’s been a load of DD about $CRSR on here, a lot of it is just parroting the same old points over and over again, giving only bullish sentiment and rocket emojis without any insight into the actual gaming industry.\n\nHopefully my DD will give you a better understanding of where $CRSR fits into the gaming market. This DD is meant to be balanced, all DD should have bearish points and bullish points imo, so this is not the DD to fuel your conformation bias, sorry, but maybe you'll get slightly aroused at certain points 🚀🚀\n\nAs for my experience - I’ve been gaming for the last 20+ years playing many different types of games. I actually have a degree in Computer & Video Games but don’t work in the sector these days. But I’m still a keen gamer and build gaming rigs, and game on PS5 as well.\n\nI’d also like to point out from the start that I really like Corsair. I own shares and do build PCs using their components. They are not my go-to choice for every component, and i'll explain why later in this DD.\n\nAs always, this isn’t financial advice, it’s the ramblings of someone who’s spent too long scouring the internet for a 3200mhz stick of memory. I’ve also done a TL;DR at the end with nice bullet points for those knuckle-dragging retards who can’t read more than a few paragraphs at a time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Corsair has been smashing earnings\n\nWe’ve seen this so many times before in other DDs so I won’t focus on it too much but it’s good for perspective. The rate at which Corsair has been increasing its revenue is pretty impressive.\n\nIn their Q1 2021 earnings, they reported **net revenue of $529.4 million**, which is a year-over-year **increase of 71.6%**\n\nTheir gamer and creator peripherals segment **net revenue was $175.9 million**. A huge **increase here of 131.9%**\n\nCorsair’s gaming and components segment also grew, with a **51.9% increase to $353.5 million**.\n\nClearly the demand for Corsair products is there, with increasing demand, increasing revenues and profit. Most expect Corsair to beat earnings again in their Q2 report next week.\n\nTheir market share is also impressive, with (by Corsair's own claims and from research from NPD Group) a total component market share of 41.9% and about 20% for peripherals. I can’t seem to find very recent market share figures since IPO, since you need to pay for market analysis and I’m a peasant who can’t afford it, but from what I can find Corsair is:\n\n**1st** in Keyboards\n\n**3rd** in Mice\n\n**4th** in Gaming headsets\n\n**2nd** in Streaming gear\n\n**1st** in High performance memory\n\n**1st** in Cases\n\n**1st** in PSUs (power supplies)\n\n**1st** in Cooling solutions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How does Corsair fit into the gaming market?\n\nAs you probably know, the gaming market is a fucking behemoth. It’s bigger than the music and movie markets combined, and is only getting bigger.\n\nThe pandemic has further fuelled this market, with new gamers joining as they were sat around at home and needed something to do that wasn’t jacking off. So they built epic RGB gaming rigs. I think these new customers will stick around in the industry for years to come. Building a PC is a bit like smoking crack, your current rig doesn’t quite achieve the maximum FPS possible, so you’re always on the look out for the next component that will give you a slight boost, you’re always chasing that high.\n\nThe PC building market and console market vary widely in terms of generational changes. With consoles, you get a change of console generation, most people buy the new one all at the same time or within the same year or two. With PC building, gamers will be constantly upgrading bits and pieces of their rig to keep it up to date, there's no seismic generational shift like there is with consoles. It’s rare for gamers to throw an entire gaming rig away and build from fresh.\n\nCorsair is a mid-tier component maker. Their products fit into the ‘not the cheapest, but not the most expensive’ category. This is the same in terms of quality, performance and reliability - they offer good quality products that have decent reliability and the performance is usually pretty good. In some cases, as I’ll mention later, their products are basically identical to other manufacturers. This mid-level position in the market is probably one of the reasons they make it to the number 1 spot in terms of sales for several component categories. Gamers want good bang-for-buck and decent reliability when it comes to components. They spend hours and hours researching this, and usually know exactly what they are buying, if it's a good deal, and if it's going to perform the way they want it to.\n\nAlso it's important to point out that the term *best components* is a relative and sometime subjective term. Taking price out of the equasion, the *best* component is the one that works in your rig to deliver maximum performance and not cause a bottleneck. Sometimes it's a cheaper one, sometimes it's a more expensive one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Who is the Corsair customer?\n\nThe Corsair customer is a mid-tier (and sometimes high-tier) PC rig builder. Younger teenagers/kids often use Corsair as their marketing and branding appeals to them. They love RGB fans, and Corsair basically puts RGB in absolutely everything, these days even on RAM sticks and built into the GPU cables. Console gamers are also included in this customer base, mostly for headsets and streaming gear.\n\nThe extreme ultra-nerd PC builder who spends hours and hours pouring over spec sheets and benchmarks might not use Corsair unless there was a reason related specifically to their build like compatibility with other components, or perhaps a part was on offer at their chosen retailer. Have a look at some build guides online and a lot of the time their no-holds-barred builds often won’t include Corsair components, or only one or two. There are so many variables that go into building a PC, it’s not just a case of buy whatever components you like the look of. It all has to work together.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The misconceptions of Corsair\n\n**The first misconception of Corsair is that their components and products are the absolute best in the industry** \\- the ultimate in luxury component, the ‘Apple’ of gaming if you will.\n\nCorsair is mostly a mid-tier component maker. Their components are good value for money, work well and are reliable but there are companies out there that make higher quality components, some that make lower quality ones and some that make pretty much identical ones.\n\nThe components market is extremely crowded, there are a lot of companies competing for the same margins on the same products: NZXT, CoolerMaster, Noctua, G.Skill, Fractal are just a few of the dozens of companies in this space. I'll go over the competitors later in this DD.\n\nOnce you start to peel back the surface of the gaming market, you’ll realise that actually a lot of these companies are pretty much the same in terms of the products they sell. In some cases the spec is almost identical and in reality some of the time it doesn’t really matter what brand of component you put in your rig (as long as its not a cheap knock-off), the performance will be roughly the same, or in many cases identical. For example, the Corsair Hydro Hxxxi series are basically the exact same products as the NZXT Kraken X series, just with a different fan arrangement, branding, exterior LED arrangement and exterior shroud.\n\n**This leads me neatly onto my second misconception that Corsair has a massive moat.** Unfortunately it doesn’t have a huge moat against the other companies in the component space in terms of actual products that compete or compare with each other. The acquisition of Elgato was a nice move, though, and in the streaming market does give them an edge over some other competitors with an expanded product lineup. But in terms of their moat over other component manufacturers, in some cases, they don't have one at all.\n\n**The third misconception of Corsair is that gamers have extreme brand loyalty towards specific component manufacturers.** Gamers usually want one thing when building a rig: the absolute maximum performance for their budget. Looks and RGB often come secondary to this.\n\nWhile some gamers do have some brand loyalty (particularly some of the younger kids who are less experienced at building rigs) and Corsair strengths in branding and advertising help this, I don’t think there’s *extreme* brand loyalty amongst gamers who build their own rigs and have spent years doing so. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone who exclusively built their rig with Corsair components because they specifically wanted to out of brand loyalty, except [Linus from Linus Tech Tips on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEIKFxHzzac&t=194s), which was a paid-for sponsor by Corsair.\n\nThe price is an important factor here, and in many cases gamers will just buy a stick of RAM, for example, from one manufacturer over another simply because the price is different, or the specific stick is on offer at the time they build their rig. They also might be limited to what kind of AIO cooler they can get due to the other components they are using such as the size restrictions in their case. There's a lot of variables that go into making a sale right then and there, and a lot of the time Corsair doesn't stand-out as the absolute leader in some components that warrant gamers spending the extra money if their parts are more expensive at that given moment in time.\n\nI would say there is more brand loyalty around core components of a rig - like CPU or GPU.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Some Corsair components aren’t actually made by Corsair\n\nCorsair doesn’t actually manufacturer all its components. Many of their products are actually OEM products, rebranded and built by another manufacturer.\n\nCorsair AIO CPU coolers are all made by either Asetek or CoolIT.\n\nCorsair PSUs are made by Seasonic, GreatWall, Flextronics, CWT or Chicony.\n\nCorsair RAM have chips made by Samsung, Micron or SK Hynix.\n\nSo what does this mean? Generally it means that there is often minimal or no difference between some products that are sold under many brands within the PC component market. Gamers will often say “Look at the underlying product, rather than the brand” when comparing two almost identical products. You could compare a Seasonic PSU to a Corsair PSU, and end up finding that they are actually almost identical, and underneath it’s actually just a Seasonic PSU with a Corsair logo slapped on it.\n\nNow this isn’t always the case, OEM rebrands are not always an identical item, the end brand may  modify the products they take from OEM before selling it to the customer. They can also request specific changes to an OEM part from the manufacturer. In some cases this can change the performance of the component, for example using different fans on an AIO cooler can cause performance increases/decreases depending on how said fans displace air through the radiator fins.\n\nThis is seen a lot with GPUs - for example Nvidia release a ‘Founders Edition’ of all their cards which is basically the standard card. Then all the GPU manufacturers such as MSI, Gigabyte, ASUS, Zotac etc will built their on shrouds and fan arrays onto the cards, with their own branding and brand-specific features. The base card and chip are always the same, but there can be slight performance differences between the cards in terms of active cooling and power consumption.\n\nBut rebranding OEM parts doesn’t mean the quality of the part is reduced, and this doesn’t seem to be the case with Corsair.\n\nWhat OEM parts can do though, in the case of Corsair, is reduce its moat. For some products Corsair has little to no edge over the competition, and often if you go onto some of the PC building subreddits and compare an OEM Corsair PSU (made by Seasonic) and an actual Seasonic PSUs, most of the replies will suggest buying the Seasonic one since Seasonic are the original manufacturer. There are arguably slightly better offerings from Seasonic vs Corsair in terms of PSUs in some instances, even though the underlying product is similar, with better warrenties if something goes wrong in the future. Being the original manufacturer seems to also hold some value amongst gamers.\n\nTo further this, in some cases, you can cut out Corsair alltogether and go direct to the manufacturer to get almost the exact same product - this is the case with AIO Coolers, you can build-your-own direct from Asetek. Gamers don't usually do this, many of them probably never heard of Asetek, they are an OEM so don't really target end-consumers, their customer is companies like Corsair.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Corsair’s branding and marketing\n\nBy this point in the DD you're probably asking why Corsair has some products that have absolutely no moat, but are still best-sellers. And here is one way that Corsair shines over its competition: branding, marketing, collaboration and visability.\n\nThey sponsor eSports tournaments, give away free kit to increase exposure and work with streamers to increase brand awareness. Also just look at their website, it's head-and-shoulders above many of their competitors in terms of functionality, look and feel.\n\nTheir targeted marketing seems to be paying off. With collaborations and sponsorship with YouTubers, targeting younger audiences with their stylish, colourful branding and RGB unicorn puke, I think Corsair can continue to lead the market in terms of sales by continuing their marketing.\n\nCorsair is not new to the gaming space, it was founded way back in 1994, so this long term pedigree in the market place definitly helps with their visability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Corsair’s competitors\n\nCorsair has a lot of competitors. Dozens of companies compete in the PC gaming space. Corsair is somewhat unique in the way that you can basically build an entire PC almost exclusively from Corsair components, so it doesn’t have a direct like-for-like competitor in that sense, but there are many, many competitors who compete with them for specific components.\n\n**Logitech - Peripherals and streaming gear**  \nCorsair and Logitech compete over peripherals and streaming kit. Logitech is often compared to Corsair on this sub, probably because it’s one of the only other companies relating to gaming that trades on the stock market, but they are actually pretty different companies, with different target markets and different products. While Logitech does target gamers for some products, it also has a substantial ‘productivity’ target - peripherals for people working from home or in the office, in creative fields and so on. Personally I don't find the two companies *that* comparable, but they do compete in some product lines so have added them here.\n\n**Razer - Peripherals, cases, pre-built desktops**  \nIn terms of peripherals, Razer, Corsair and Logitech often compete for the top three spots on any ‘Best gaming keyboards/mice this year’ blog post. They make similarly good quality peripherals, but often where Razer falls down is their QA and longevity. They are often slightly more expensive than Corsair, many say Razer is ‘style over substance’. They also compete for the headsets portion of the console market.\n\nPeripherals in general are very subjective, everyone has differing opinions on which one they prefer in terms of quality, usability and comfort so other than looking at sales figures, it's pretty hard to figure out which supplier produces the *best* peripherals.\n\nIn terms of their hardware, though, Razer are allegedly somewhat unreliable in that aspect, with users complaining of poor QA issues. Razer compete with Corsair for PC cases, which they offer two choices - a full sized ATX and a Mini-ATX. Recently Razer also entered the pre-built market, with the Tomahawk Gaming Desktop, a small-form-factor pre-built rig.\n\nRazer in general are pretty expensive, targeting the high-end gamer who has money to burn. You could argue that Razer is the Apple of the gaming world, with stylish ultra-expensive laptops. Judging by user reports online though, their QA and performance doesn't quite live up to the price tag.\n\n**Turtle Beach - Headsets**  \nCorsair and Turtle Beach compete directly with gaming headsets. This is not PC specific, console gamers will also buy headsets from either of these suppliers.\n\nMany say Turtle Beach is massively undervalued, it does trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker HEAR. Personally I find their headsets disappointing, I own one and it was expensive, not comfortable to wear, the audio quality isn’t great and has a cheap plasticy feel. That’s just my opinion though, they are a popular choice amongst many gamers.\n\n**NZXT - Components and pre-built gaming rigs**  \nI feel like NZXT is one of the closer ‘all-round’ competitors of Corsair. While they don’t sell all the products that Corsair offers, they do sell cases, AIO coolers & fans, PSUs, RGB lighting and recently motherboards (which Corsair don’t offer at all).\n\nTheir products are good quality, their cases are nicely designed, popular and easy to build in. NZXT also have started selling pre-built rigs, like Corsair, to add further revenue streams.\n\nIn my opinion NZXT could be one of the main rivals to look out for in terms of a major competitor in coming years, because they could increase their product lines to compete more directly with everything Corsair does.\n\nIn some cases, as I’ve described previously, NZXT and Corsair products are almost exactly the same. The AIOs sold by both companies are actually manufactured OEM by Asetek, with changes to the fans, exterior shroud and so on, but the underlying product is pretty similar/the same in some cases.\n\n**Seasonic - PSUs**  \nAs i've mentioned elsewhere in this DD, Seasonic actually produce some of Corsair's PSUs, they are an OEM supplier. Seasonic make some of the best PSUs in the industry, in terms of quality, reliability and customer support (i.e. warrenties etc). This quality does filter down to Corsair's OEM PSU units, but many gamers will reccomend going to the original manufacturer when buying a PSU.\n\nIt's worth noting that when gamers buy a Corsair PSU, some of the money they pay for it goes directly to Seasonic (depending on model, Corsair gets its OEM PSUs from multiple suppliers depending on the model). I don't know the exact margin figures for these PSUs, so can't make a judgement on if this positive or negative (i.e. does Corsair make a tiny margin on their PSUs becuase they give the OEM manufacturer most of the money of the sale, or do they actually make better margins than manufacturing them in-house becuase it's costly to do so).\n\n**A few other competitors in the component space**  \n**Fractal Design** \\- They make cases and a few AIO CPU coolers which are OEM made by Alphacool.\n\n**CoolerMaster** \\- Makes keyboard, mice, cases, AIO coolers (they are a main manufacturer), air fans, monitors.\n\n**Noctua** \\- They compete directly with Corsair in terms of air cooling. Corsair recently started offering the A500, a fan CPU cooler for those who didn’t want to use AIO cooling, but it doesn’t perform as well as many cheaper or equally priced Noctua or Deepcool competing products. In some instances a decent Noctua air cooler will outperform a Corsair AIO cooler for less money.\n\n**G.Skill** \\- Compete with Corsair on RAM. G.Skill are often used in high-end rigs, with built-in RGB, decent clock speeds and some of their sticks are ultra-low-latency for maximum performance. This RAM is quite popular at the moment, I regularly see it in build videos on YouTube.\n\n**Crucial** \\- Compete with Corsair on RAM. Crucial can be a slightly more budget choice, some of their sticks are bare, without RGB or fancy heatsinks, but their performance and reliability is good.\n\n**Kingston, Patriot, HyperX** \\- Compete with Corsair on RAM at mixed prices and performance levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Revenue increases during the pandemic - a one-off?\n\nOne of the main reasons for Corsairs current sideways trading, in my opinion, is the uncertainty that has come from the pandemic.\n\nSome analysts and investors have taken this huge revenue rise in the last year or so as a ‘one-off’ caused by the pandemic. To a certain extent, I’d argue that this is correct. The pandemic did cause a huge influx of customers into the sector in general.\n\nThe real test for Corsair here will be if they can continue to grow their revenue after the pandemic is completely over. It does look positive, with their revenue continuing to climb in their recent January 2021 earnings report. I feel that in the short-term we may see a slight slow in revenue growth, but over the long term it will continue to increase. The customers that built their first PC during the pandemic won’t go anywhere.\n\nFor that reason, Corsair is a long term hold. It’s possible we will see some sharp rises as the result of earnings announcements, for example if they absolutely obliterate the estimates to the point where no-one expected it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How can Corsair grow?\n\nGrowth (of products, not revenue growth), is something that can hold back the share price. Many of the products Corsair sells might not see any further innovation. For example, a CPU air or AIO cooler is pretty much as good as it gets these days, it's unlikely we will see that many technological improvements in this area, so gamers have less of an incentive to upgrade. Cases is another one - you can literally keep PC cases for a decade without ever needing to change it.\n\nFor other components, however, there are more tech improvements. RAM is one of them - DDR5 memory will be coming out this year. This could offer further incentives to gamers to upgrade other components while they upgrade to DDR5 RAM. However, the changeover for RAM usually takes years, as we saw in the past with DDR4 RAM when it came out, so gamers might not all rush out to buy new sticks as soon as it comes out. Often the clock speeds on launch are often slower than later on in the generational cycle, and the prices are expensive so it's likely those top-tier gamers with high-end rigs who will upgrade their RAM at release but many mid-level gamers will wait a bit before upgrading.\n\nContinuing doing what they are doing in terms of increasing revenue through existing product sales might not cut it in this instance. As i’ve mentioned elsewhere in this post, their moat for many products isn’t big, and in some cases non-existent, and I feel like many institutions and analysts have looked at this during their research, and it's made them uneasy. Future mergers and acquisitions could be the key. They’ve already acquired Elgato, which gave them a foothold in the streaming market, and acquired Origin to be able to sell pre-built rigs.\n\nThey also released the Corsair One a few years ago, a pre-build compact workstation/gaming PC. It has had a pretty decent reception from some of the online reviews. Although most PC custom builders turn up their noses at pre-builts, and yes you can build a superior performing rig yourself, they have a place in the market in my opinion.\n\nThere are plenty of gamers out there who want a decent gaming PC that's simple, compact, good looking and high performing, but don't want the hassle of learning about all the components and figuring out how to put it together. They also want the warranty that comes with a pre-built, and the ease and peace-of-mind that comes with sending it back to Corsair if it breaks. Corsair seem to have a pretty decent returns policy regarding this too - they will pay for the courier service both ways, you can drop it into a physical repair center and will even send you fresh packaging if you threw yours away when you bought the rig initially.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The elephant in the room\n\nYep, the elephant in the room is EagleTree. EagleTree Capital is the major shareholder of Corsair, and has helped them grow for the last 4 years or so. At one point they held over 60% of the shares of the company, and in recent months have been selling off sizable chunks of their position.\n\nObviously this probably isn't good for short term rises in share price, we could see them sell off larger chunks of their position in the coming months. The flip-side of this is that it could just be scheduled profit taking, and may not effect the share price whatsoever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# You can do your research on $CRSR here on Reddit\n\nWe are somewhat blessed to literally have a shit ton of customer insight right here on reddit, something we don't often get. There are several PC building and gaming subs that have millions of members who regularly discuss, at length, the pros and cons of every component and brand imaginable. Here are some of the biggest subreddits: r/gaming r/pcmasterrace r/buildapc r/battlestations r/Corsair r/Games r/pcgaming\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:**\n\n**Bullish points**\n\n* Excellent revenue and profit growth. The fundamentals are super strong.\n* Earnings are expected to grow a further 21% in the coming year.\n* Proactive expansion into new sectors such as streaming (which will likely grow in the future) and pre-built PCs\n* Wide range of good quality, reasonably priced products, many of which are best sellers within the market.\n* Strong marketing and branding that increases exposure and visability of their products globally.\n* Did extremely well during the pandemic, increasing its customer base.\n* In terms of financial fundamentals, very undervalued at the moment.\n* The video games industry in general is only going to increase in size and revenue, and streaming will likely increase with it.\n* In terms of share price, there’s decent support at this level.\n* New generations of products entering the market could be beneficial to Corsair - for example DDR5 memory is just around the corner. This can have knock-on positivity for Corsair in that if gamers want to upgrade to DDR5 RAM, they might need/want to upgrade other components too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Bearish points**\n\n* Some suggest their recent revenue spurts are a ‘one-off’ due to the pandemic. We could see a reduction or slow in revenues in the coming months/years. The uncertainty surrounding the return to ‘normality’ after the pandemic could make investors hesitent to invest.\n* Many of their products are almost identical to others from competitors in the same market, the moat in some cases isn’t significant or even existent.\n* EagleTree dumping shares could have an effect on share price.\n* The margins on many products in the sector are quite small.\n* For some products, there’s a level of innovation that might not be improved upon. A fan is a fan, and that’s it. There’s no growth in some specific lines of products to obtain sales from users ‘upgrading’ when there’s nothing to upgrade to.\n* The PC components market is exceptionally crowded.\n* Corsair has a fair amount of debt, although it is well covered by operating cashflow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nAs I said at the start of this DD, I really like Corsair. They are a well run company, with incredible revenue growth, solid fundamentals, decent products and a good foothold in the market.\n\nPersonally I don't buy the whole 'the pandemic is a one-off' take. We've already seen a continuation in revenue growth into 2021, even after lockdown restrictions are reduced or lifted, so I feel they will continue to make bank. While we might see a slight slow, overall Corsair will just keep growing in terms of revenue and profit. It will grow with the continuously growing gaming industry.\n\nI feel like this is a long term play with somewhat short term uncertainty. But I feel it’s a buy. I only have a small position as am about to go through a divorce, but will be adding to my position as soon as is possible.\n\nI don't suggest calls with short expiries, i've already been burned on this becuase i'm a dumbfuck. If you're gonna do options then leaps are probably ideal, or buy shares and sell covered calls against them. Shares is probably the play in general, but natrually that's jut my opinion, this isn't financial advice.\n\nI’ve tried to be as accurate as possible with this DD, if anything is incorrect, feel free to comment below and I’ll amend it.\n\nGodspeed apes 🚀🚀🚀🚀", "id": "ot8wlv", "created_utc": 1627475337.0, "score": 525, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 113, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|919|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Guys, it’s ok, i read all of this for you.

Also the similar product thing might appear like that on first glance but Corsair does provide, especially with the elgato brand unmatched quality of products(specifically the software), an unmatch product experience. The wave link and also the new camera hub software make the experience so good for these products. There are some webcames that can match the quality of elgatos but not one of those can be fully software controlled down to ISO and shutter speed. Same goes for Corsair, there are other options to buy rgb fans/ram/... it is the iCUE software that makes the experience perfect. It is well made, easy to use and just syncs up everything without a problem and is extremly customizable. Corsair is very clearly playing the apple tactic here. There are many others making phones with similar quality and that for a way cheaper price but people still come back every time to buy an iphone because they know the software is good, the quality is good, it is easy to use and the whole ecosystem works together perfectly, they dont even try to go for cheaper option because paying the premium will payoff with all the listed advantages.

{"title": "How to use side way trading days to your advantage (SPY) and understanding IV", "selftext": "This works for every security in existence but today I’ll talk about SPY and GOOGL. \n\n\nFor those of you that don’t know, in our battle, delta and IV are our friends and theta is the murder-rapist-genocidal-racist hitler. \n\nDelta is easy to understand- it goes from 0-.x-1 and all it means is that every 1 dollar increase in the stock gains you delta*100 dollars. So a delta of .76 means you gain 76$ for every 1 dollar increase. \n\nNow IV is a bit more complicated and it has to do with how big of a movement a stock does. If A stock moves a lot, than the IV will increase and this will make your extrinsic value of the option go up. (Extrinsic basically means potential profit given time compared to intrinsic which is when your option is in the money and so every gain the the stock is intrinsic and cannot be changed with time). Everything is a bit more complicated but this is simplified.\n\nWhile most times, IV is not enough to over ride delta, there are some times when the IV is more important than delta and will actually help you. For example, if GME goes from 150 to 1,000$, there is a very good chance that you will actually GAIN on some of your puts because the IV is adding more value than your delta is taking out. \n\nRecent example: some of you may have realized that GOOGL did 3% last week and the options were up to 1400%. But today, GOOGL did same yet the options are only up 150%. Why? It’s because of IV crush. This is a difference of 7X. IV was almost 7X stronger than the delta here. But this was earnings day so maybe it’s special? No. \n\nIV crush is generally for earnings but it can happen at any time. Same with SPY, you may have wondered why sometimes spy does 1% and options are like 1,000% up but other times spy does 1% and options bearly crack 200%. This is a daily IV change. Playing IV can net you massive returns or loss depending on your understanding. \n\nNow why do side ways trading helps you? Well because SPY has ended its day at -.04%, this is basicly 0. This means the IV is super low. This also means anyone that has bought calls or puts for Friday will see massive returns if spy goes in either direction. \n\nYou may have also wondered why your calls or puts were down 30% or more today when spy closed at -.04%, this has to do with IV dropping causing the theta loss to be multiplied.\n\nPS: I know half you fuckers lost money on TSLA. Why is the loss flair not booming? Stop being cowards and post them.\n\nJust this week, there were 23 posts about TSLA yolo.  Yesterday there were 2 loss porn posts. \n\nStop being a bitch and post them.

Options are the right, but not the obligation to purchase 100 shares of a stock at the strike price. Bet that it goes up = call. Bet it goes down = put.

Option premium price is implied and extrinsic value which means it takes some value from the underlying stock and some value from the stock movements (volatility for example). The greek stuff (delta, theta, etc) the OP posted refers to how options premium pricing radically changes based on how volatile the stock is (wild swings up or down). To purchase an \"option\" you must buy an \"option contract.\" You pick a call or put, then you pay the premium price, say $1.00 times 100 = $100. If the stock price goes up and options premiums for the same contract you bought go to $2.00 then the value would be $200. You can exercise the contract and purchase 100 shares of the stock at the strike price, but you can also just sell the contract and pocket the gains.

Or is it the time decay on my put contract?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Hello, I would like to offer a strategy that helps even everything out so IV doesn't affect your options trade.\n\nLet's say you're still bearish on SPCE and think it will go to $25 by Aug 20.  Instead of buying only a 8/20 $25 put @ .69 (haha *nice*) you should buy a $27 put @ $1.19 *AND THEN* sell a $25 put, this is called a put debit spread (credit spread works too, in reverse, selling the higher strike and buying the lower but you have to put up collateral)\n\nWhy is a debit spread better than your naked put?  Well first, your cost.  1.19 - .69 is only $50, you could buy 10 of these for the same price as what you paid before and if SPCE *does* go down to $25, and you have 10 contracts (cost $500), you'll have 150x10 and end up with $1500 profit.  Second reason a debit spread is better is that you are almost *completely immune* to IV changes, the sold put will limit your profit potential but also limit your exposure to IV and so it is much better to use this strategy around earnings or times when IV is really high.\n\nThis strategy works better the further away from the actual price you are, so if you are expecting a very large move and can predict the range it will go to, you can really make bank.\n\nIf you think SPCE will go to $20 by 8/20, buy a $22 put, sell a $20.  It cost $13 and you could profit $187 if it continues to go down 20.  You could buy 40 of these for $520 and make $7,480 if it goes to $20.\n\nI just want to say, I am not suggesting that SPCE will continue to go down, I haven't researched it at all and I am just looking at the options chain for ideas to trade.", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the actual informative advice.

I do not know what the $31 strike was when you paid $5 for your 33, but pretend it was $3.  You'd have entered your trade for only $200 and you'd be up to at least $336 today.

It’s the trader equivalent of physicist arguing about quantum mechanics. Some think theta does work on week end, others do not think it does, while another camp thinks the theta decay of weekend doesn’t happen *in weekend* but rather is already priced in on Friday or slowly since Monday. While others believe it has to work because trades can still happen on weekends but the theta is so small it doesn’t matter when comes monday. \n\nPersonally from my experience, I think theta does work in weekends but because 99% of traders cannot trade in weekend, and market while unpredictable has to be mathematically consistent, this weekend theta is priced thoughout the week. So usualy a option left at x price will open at x price on Monday. (This makes most sense because if you buy a AMZN option with 9.0 theta, on Friday, you dont wake up with -2k loss on Monday if it opens at 0%)\n\n\n>The Argument That Options Lose Value Over The Weekend\n\n>Some traders argue that options must lose value over the weekend. After all, weekend days are still days. And traders can still trade on the weekend. The major stock exchanges are closed, but they can still do over-the-counter trades with each other.\n\n>Some options brokers even offer after-hours trades as an added service. So even though the volume for options trading is lower, this does not mean that it is nonexistent.\n\n>The Argument That Options Don’t Lose Value Over The Weekend\n\n>Other option traders argue that options do not lose value over the weekend. According to this view, traders who are holding onto options on Friday know that they will lose money if they don’t exit their positions. This makes them want to get rid of their options before the market closes.\n\n>As a result, they are willing to get rid of their options at a lower price than they otherwise would be. This causes the weekend time decay to be “priced in” on Friday. Because of this, no time-decay actually occurs on the weekend.\n\n>The Argument That The Value Lost Doesn’t Matter\n\n>Another argument many traders make is that the value lost by options over the weekend doesn’t matter. According to this view, most of the time-decay is priced in on Friday, and the little bit that is left over is so small that it is a waste of time to try to profit from it.\n\n>These traders often rely on empirical research to support their claims. If we look at price changes on options over weekends and exclude ones whose underlying assets had price changes, we find that these options often open on Monday near the same price they were on Friday. And it’s extremely rare for these options to have price changes of greater than 1%.\n\n>Since the empirical evidence does not show any time-decay over weekends, these traders argue that we have to assume it is either nonexistent or too small to matter.\n\n>Conclusion\n\n>Do options lose value over the weekend? Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to this question. Some traders take one position and others argue the opposite point of view.\n\n>But one thing is clear: if there is time-decay over the weekend, it probably doesn’t matter as much as other factors.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the explanation of time decay and how it works and the believes/non-believers. \n\nEither way you’re right, the most important factors for me to learn  from this was how IV and theta are like Pac man when a put is slowly going down and then one bad day of movement sunk me… 😂", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "You're losing $19/day just to time.
