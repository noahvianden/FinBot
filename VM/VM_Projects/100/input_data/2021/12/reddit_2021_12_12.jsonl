Here's a quick summary of what I saw\n\n*City planning makes Chandler the easiest driving city I've ever seen\n\n*Waymo's service is very smooth and polished.  Easy pickup/dropoff, much better than Uber.  \n\n*Waymo's driving agent is smooth and sure footed.  I spent 45 minutes total riding in it, and never was concerned about safety.  \n\n*Waymo avoids highways and unprotected lefts (UPL).  This caused the ride to be 3 miles and 4.5 minutes longer than the FSD ride.  \n\n*The Tesla navigation required 4 lane changes in a short distance, which FSD couldn't accomplish.  But FSD handled going off route gracefully \n\n*FSD attempted a sketchy UPL across a 45 mph road which was too close for me, so I took over to stop it.\n\n*After resuming FSD handled the rest of the ride without incident. \n\n*FSD took the highway, merged, and exited without incident.  \n\n*FSD is weirdly awkward in seemingly easy situations.  Sometimes even with no traffic whatsoever FSD can be slow and nervous making turns. Waymo doesn't have this issue.\n\n*Waymo is much smoother on steering and turning.  \n\nOverall it was an awesome experience!  It's interesting to see similar quirks of the two systems, as well as the differences.  I put together a YouTube video showing the two rides as well: https://youtu.be/LOKyGmqyL_0\n\nTLDR: FSD was quicker due to the highway and shorter route but failed due to needing an intervention.

Some might argue cash is bleeding value to inflation but it probably depends how you use it, when you use it, why you use it, etc...\n\nYou also dont necessarily have to get assigned. I prefer to roll due to tax issues (In Straya trading on US brokers) but admittedly I have been stuck in badly crashed stock and chosen to bail to get the capital value back to use it elsewhere. (I have a CSP in SWBI entered the day before it dumped, I bought another CSP when it levelled off the day after it dumped this is exactly why I keep 50% cash around. I already closed that one for profit and am confident that SWBI is coming back up longer term.So, I just roll the other one monthly and the value is there to clear 2% on that capital so I am fine with that while I wait for it to return to the strike I sold it at originally, 2% on capital is my monthly target.)\n\nI have also tried rolling out and down while adding contracts to drive the strike down to chase the price, but don't recommend it unless you 100% commit to staying in the trade. When I eventually got tired of doing that it cost me a lot more to close it when I gave up. I prefer to \"Hold the strike\" now (look it up on this sub) and if it is a good company it will recover.\n\nSo I don't even really do The Wheel unless I have to, then usually it would be because I am expecting the company to boom. e.g. MAXR.  I am in it now and likely to take assignment in a few months and sit on the shares (not wheel) as I expect it to go to the moon when they launch their product.\n\nI also will jump out of a trade for a loss if my outlook on the company has changed. PLTR I did this, MAXR I did this breifly but have since come back to it, and CRSR I did this. I lost on PLTR and CRSR but economic outlook had changed for me so I did not stay in hoping for improvement.\n\nBeing able to take losses and move on will often save you from being stuck in mingers when they go bad. Doing this takes practice and learning to listen to your inner voice and let losers go rather than mulling on them. (Learning to trade mechanically in order to override emotion is one of the best/ things to learn)\n\n(CAVEAT: The Wheel is not a guaranteed winner and can go badly wrong, it just seems to work better than most other approaches because your fall back is shares. Hence why choosing long lasting and solid companies with good fundamentals makes the most sense.)\n\nI have tried every weird method for trading options out there and seem to always come back to the CSP and roll  approach i.e. The Wheel. often licking my wounds from losers in other methods.\n\nI'd also recommend diversifying across your choices to add protection. So when one goes down another might not. One thing to look at it is correlation between tickers. choosing those that do not correlate in their movement. e.g. SWBI is a hedge trade for me, if shit goes south economically people will start buying guns in the US (imo).", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just pretend it didn't Happen....", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Western Union is pretty big amongst scammers and money launderers....however, they are also very big among immigrants sending money back to their countries who are likely not very tech savvy.

Television has also been a significant contributor. \n\n[www.wtfhappenedin1971.com](www.wtfhappenedin1971.com)\n\nAnyone who actually thinks either side is on a different coin, you’re buying the propaganda, full stop. The money has been corrupted. The propaganda machine is making more money than ever and politicians are feeding the propaganda machine to their constituency to maintain their position and keep their pockets lined. \n\nWe’re on the same continuing trend for the last 50 years. It’s simply at its breaking point now, but neither side is any good at all. Don’t act like three out of 26 makes the whole side better.\n\nEdit:\n\n[Here’s](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7452432/) a study. Interesting takeaways from their conclusion:\n\n> The role of the media in increasing the power of the president was noticed by legislators at the time. For instance, in 1970 senator William Fulbright told congress that “Television has done as much to expand the powers of the president as would a constitutional amendment formally abolishing the co-equality of the three branches of the government” (Graber and Dunaway, 2017)\n\nNiel Postman was big on this in his book, ***Amusing Ourselves to Death***. \n\n> The analysis also shows that speeches made by Democrat legislators have higher readability index compared to speeches of Republican legislators, and the difference has been becoming larger since the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nWhy is this important? I’m suggesting that politicians are continuing the storyline they sell to their voter base to maintain their position in government (thus acting in their own best interest instead of acting in the best interest of the constituency). If my suggestion were true, you would expect simpler language to be used when communicating with the less-educated GOP supporters and more “scholarly” language to be used with Dem supporters. Hint: the study found that to be true. \n\n> The analysis shows that since 2000, **speeches of legislators from the opposite party of the president at the time the speech was made were more negative than speeches from legislators from the same political party as the president.**\n\nThis one isn’t totally unexpected. Your party isn’t the winning pres, so politicians lash out to let their voters know they’re on their people’s side. But I feel it furthers my point. \n\n> The graph shows that both very positive and very negative sentiments became generally more common in the more recent years.\n\nSentiment, you say? More sentiments, you say? A quick Google tells me sentiment is: “a view of or attitude toward a situation or event; an opinion.” I would think the government would be better off doing what’s best for the people based on sound logic instead of sentiment. But logic isn’t wildly popular and doesn’t have that “feel good”, so it’s not best suited for pandering to a constituency.\n\nIf you’re going to say dems aren’t fueling the propaganda train to pander to their voters, you’d expect more logic in dem speeches and sentiment to flatline or reduce over time, except analysis shows it’s quite the opposite and use of sentiment in dem writing is on the rise just as gop. \n\nI’ve suggested the underlying problem is the corruption of the money.

It has been less than a year of high numbers, and people are freaking out.   That’s not sustained inflation.\n\nOne, wages haven’t kept up with the price increases.  Demand will slow, and we are already seeing that in some sectors.  Inventories are starting to rise because people have over ordered due to supply chain.   \n\nOnce supply chain eases;  a ton of goods will hit shelves and inventories.  When those goods don’t move (which I predict they won’t) -  prices will fall and factory orders will slow (which already has started in some places.). When factory orders fall; so does energy and the economy.\n\nTwo,  inflation can’t truly persist while the money supply is contracting - which it is.  The base M2 has grown; but demand for money is growing faster than M2 - effectively negating its growth.  Couple that with a plummeting velocity of money; and the environment just isn’t ripe for inflation.   \n\nIf people really understood QE,  they would know that we aren’t printing money - we are destroying it.  This is why the dollar is rallying and so is the bond market and no one knows why.  They know what the stock market hasn’t figured out yet; that recession is right around the corner (and maybe sooner if Evergrande spirals out of control.)\n\nBut to your original point; attributing inflation to higher wages is not a new thing.  It’s always been that way.  It’s part of a normal healthy growing economy.   \n\nJust today; the OP and many others are wrong about sustained inflation or labor’s role in it.

The real driver behind rising real estate has been dotcom companies buying up every single property that hits the market.   Given that Zillow has announced that they are stopping those operations and Better.com just announced massive layoffs;  one can safely assume that the real estate market suddenly has to survive at inflated prices with a fraction of the demand.   Not a recipe for growth.\n\nAlso, inflation is a recovery killer.  When inflation hits early in a recovery, it saps discretionary income (which is what is happening now.)  Inflation is supposed to slowly pick up speed after the economy is booming; and the current scenario is really bad for an economy trying to grow.   \n\nInflation needs discretionary income.

And it is meant to be.  By forcing interest rates down, the Fed is trying to get people to borrow more money and the banks to create more loans; which in turn, creates money and expands the money supply.\n\nBut what if banks don't lend and create that new money?\n\nWhen the Fed makes that payment to the banks for the securities, they are simply adding it to the \"reserve balance\" for that bank at the Federal Reserve.  Banks can't really do anything with their reserve balances.  They can trade it with other large banks (only a few) and loan against it; but it's not as liquid anymore.  That money is - effectively - destroyed; because it cannot circulate in the economy.  The money is trapped as a reserve asset, until a loan is created against it.  This is why the velocity of money has been in a downward spiral since QE began 12 years ago and why inflation has basically been negated for a decade.\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V\n\nHere's your lifecycle for a dollar:   Money is printed by either a bank making a loan OR the US Treasury issues debt in the form of securities.  Banks get those securities when issued - often as collateral for consumer's deposits - and money is born.  Then, the Fed's open market operations buys up those securities from banks/primary dealers to drive interest rates lower.  The Fed \"pays\" the bank with \"reserve assets.\"  That dollar is now trapped as a reserve asset and removed from circulation --- aka - destroyed.  \n\n\"Reserve assets\" are not liquid.  They can't be used to cash a check. \n Banks can create loans against that asset, and that would, create money.   But for QE to actually ease monetary conditions, banks have to lend money.   The low interest rates are supposed to make people want to get loans; but low interest rates also have a reverse effect of banks having tighter margins and be less willing to take risks.

The middle class spend their money differently than C-suite CEOs. If I paid $10 million to a CEO, he would invest like 99% of that money, and would still have $100,000 for his yearly spending. Now one CEO can only spend so much money on say, a smart TV, or food, or cars, or any other consumer good. And since the number of CEOs is much lesser than the number of middle class workers, demand doesn't really increase by much. However, if a CEO was paid $5 million and the extra $5 million was distributed amongst 1,000 workers, for $5,000 extra per worker, those workers would spend almost that entire extra $5,000 on consumer goods, so consumer expenditure would increase by about $5 million when paying middle class workers, vs overall consumer expenditure of a C-suite CEO is only $100,000. For example, the middle class accounts for 44.6% of total spending on entertainment, whereas the top 10% only accounts for 24.1%. For example, the average annual expenditures of the broad middle class are $242,008 across all the wage bins. The average annual expenditure of people earning $200,000 or more are $145,502. They spend 39.9% less. The middle class spends a total of $29,185 across all wage bins on food annually, compared to only $14,066 for the people earning $200,000 or more annually. They spend 51.8% less. Giving more to the people earning $200,000 or more isn't gonna increase their overall consumer expenditures a lot, whereas giving more to the people earning say, $50,000 will increase their overall expenditures more. For example, simply a $20,000 increase in income from $50,000 to $70,000 leads to a 58.4% increase in mortgage interest payments, whereas a much larger $50,000 increase in the top incomes from $150,000 to $200,000 or more only leads to a 42% increase in mortgage interest and payments.\n\n>I'm gonna keep insulting you because people that think like you are parasites.\n\nNo, people like *you* are the real parasites, complaining constantly about problems that don't exist.

{"title": "An Objective Look at Jim Cramer", "selftext": ">*Cramer gets a lot of shit around here, and most of it is deserved.  I wanted to take an objective look at why people like or dislike this guy. This is what I came up with. Would love to discuss more in the comments*\n\nJim Cramer is an investor turned stock-evangelist who has probably reached a wider audience with his financial advice than anyone in human history. Unless you consider the biblical forbearance on lending to be financial advice, in which case the list goes: Jesus, Cramer. Or maybe Mohammed, Jesus, Cramer. Regardless, it’s rarified air.\n\n**What’s Cramer’s story?**\n\nHarvard, Harvard Law, Goldman Sachs, launched his own hedge fund, founded a publicly traded media site *The Street*, wrote six books on investing, and of course, hosted 17 seasons of “Mad Money.” On paper, Cramer’s the wet dream of compensating parents everywhere. *I raised a winner, a winner!* \n\n**What’s to like about Cramer**\n\nHe’s fun. He’s like the cool teacher from high school but for stocks. You learn about business, but you also learn about life, and he just gets it the way your parents never could. Sure, his histrionics get annoying, and are possibly a cry for help, but he’s knowledgeable, contagiously passionate, and his show is an entertaining way to keep in touch with the financial markets.\n\n**What’s Not to Like** \n\nA lot of what Cramer does is a disservice to his viewers. He promotes excessive risk-taking under the guise of public education. Cramer purports to be all about empowering Middle America by preaching advanced stock-picking techniques, but he knows the vast majority of his viewers have no chance to beat the market, and those that stand a chance don’t need him anyway. Cramer is to stocks what Dog is to Bounty Hunting. He turns a profession into entertainment. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, there’s just nothing particularly useful about it. Cramer knows this, he even tells his viewers this occasionally, but that message is drowned in a tsunami of ticker-tape and sensationalized minutiae that turns irrelevant ten seconds after Cramer feigns a stroke at hearing it. \n\nSome people don’t like Cramer's personality. Cramer is one of the old guard, a veteran of the investing era before personal computers, when the most confident personalities made the most money. Haters find Cramer jockish, overconfident, condescending, inauthentic, greedy, and creepy. All of those accusations have merit. He's pissed off entire groups of investors (like wsb) because he's an unapologetic hot-take machine. That's his job. He's the Skip Bayless of finance. The difference, though, between Cramer and an ESPN analyst is that people are investing their life savings in the market. Worse, Cramer will occasionally get serious and give high-quality financial advice. He's capable of doing that, but he's also capable of spitting off five terrible stock recommendations. Viewers have to know when he's doing a shtick and when he's being authentic and that can be hard. Should CNBC be held to a higher standard than ESPN? \n\nThis leads to the inherent conflicts of interest. People listen to him - they buy stocks when he says to, which means he has the power to move markets. Do Cramer or any of his cronies exploit this power to manipulate markets and illegally make money? That's difficult to prove but at the very least he doesn't do a good job of avoiding the appearance of impropriety. \n\nLastly, Cramer has a habit of making absurd, disturbing headlines, including but not limited to:\n\n* Repeatedly calling Lenny Dykstra (who Bleacher Report named one of professional baseball’s 25 biggest Sleazeballs) “the greatest mind on Wall Street.” Dykstra was awarded his own column on Cramer’s TheStreet.com, which was revoked after Dykstra was busted by the SEC for fraud.\n* Martin Shkreli, famed “pharma-bro,” was arrested on securities fraud, revealed in an interview that Cramer gave him his first job. Shkreli recalled: “Jim interviewed me and he asked what I did, I said I played guitar. And he asked me to come and play guitar to prove it. And I played all these wedding songs and I started work at Cramer’s hedge fund March1, 2000, when I was 16.”\n* Cramer apparently admitted to securities fraud, although he later clarified he was speaking hypothetically about the behavior of others. Jon Stewart interrogated him on the matter and it’s must-see TV. \n\nIn Cramer’s defense, he has a target on his back (that he put there) and sometimes gets unfair criticism. During the midst of the financial crisis, he encouraged viewers not to withdraw their Bear Sterns savings accounts. Bear Sterns went bankrupt and the press excoriated him, but his advice was spot-on: the savings accounts were FDIC insured.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*TLDR: Cramer is a legitimately good investor with a lot of impressive credentials and a good investing track record. But little of that transfers to the character he plays on TV. He repeatedly puts himself in bad situations, he has  conflicts of interest (or at least appears to and he does little to avoid the appearance), and he can be annoying.

Can the climate change by itself? And if it can, are humans able to stop the climate from its natural change? \nCarbon within the atmosphere has been measured by measuring the amount in air bubbles of ice cores which have been dug up at the poles. One of the best samples extracted was a mile deep. \n\nThis carbon can be measured and dated accurately to before the media existed. Certainly 100 years with accuracy, though the farthest claim is determined to be 2.7 million years.\n\nMy thought is that if people who believe in climate change and people who don’t believe in climate change: \n\n1. are in agreement that the ice cores show a great change in carbon,\n\n2. Can prove that energy from the sun is partly absorbed by matter - this is how we see different colours, interestingly: white light is shon on a material and certain frequencies of it will absorb while others reflect and we see that as a colour (also why black coloured things heat up the most) \n\n3. A climate change believer or refuter can determine how much energy different gasses absorb. \n\nYou could do experiments like these yourself for the most part. It would take a bit of time to build apparatus but the science would be something you could show. \n\nSo what the information these processes found says is that there is more carbon in the air since the last ice age (but especially since around 1950 since the amount of particles has increased a lot from that time on), and the energy that the planet absorbs is higher as a result.\n\nSo if the energy is higher it will mean things are closer to a state change - when you light something on fire you are just giving it more energy until that energy is enough to snap the bonds (free the electrons) holding that objects atoms together. In the case of fire, it’s sort of like putting too much energy through a wire at once, which makes the wire hot and eventually melts it (like in the case of an overloaded fuse in a car or house). This destructive release of energy is what you could call a runaway reaction.\n\nSo my question is, does it matter what the media says if the earth is being primed for more runaway reactions? We all know the media are infuriating idiots who just want to be sensational and cause havoc, but what if the havoc will happen anyway? I don’t think it matters whether people are causing climate change or not, but I do think if people need a name or a blame in order to do what the world needs then that’s fine by me. I believe humanity has the power to keep carbon levels optimal for every situation, and we should control atmospheric energy absorption to levels that work for us, because the risk of too much energy absorption is that humidity turns to rain too soon and clouds don’t travel as far as they have, things light on fire more easily, and air pressure changes due to hot and cold fronts (perhaps because of lack of rain and subsequent humidity in certain areas) are more viscous (tornadoes).", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Clap", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Meh.

So you hurriedly made a edit trying to see if that’s what I was talking about. \n\n\nLet me give you free dictionary definitions so you don’t embarrass yourself again. \n\n1a) delta is the probability of your option being ATM before expiration. \n\n1b) delta is also the gain or loss of option per 1$ change in security. \n\nThis means, a delta of .3 of contract means that there is 30% chance of that contract being ITM and that every 1$ movement will yield 30$ gain or loss. \n\n2)how many contracts, at what strikes, and what expiry, is all known by everyone at all times. This means we know exactly how much options there exist and what their delta is, or what their expected probability of being ITM and thus being exercised is. This means that TSLA price right now is taking into account the potential thread of dilution by the option exercise in the future by hedging. \n\nThis is same as delta hedging by shorters, if you sell 1 contract with .3 delta, institutions may not hold all 100 shares but will hold 30 shares, and as the delta increases or decreases, the holding shares follows. The market does something similar to unexercised option that will dilute the shares of exercised. If there is 100 contracts with .9 delta, the market is already acting and pricing the price of each share of TSLA as if the total float is total float+ 100*90 shares.

Just because a position is hedged doesn't mean you don't lose equity from dilution.\n\nEdit2: I don't believe NSOs work like regular options. When they're excercized the options should pull shares from an option pool. I don't know where that pool dilutes from but it had to at some point dilute from somewhere. Now, likely the dilution doesn't take place at the same time the options are excercized but they definitely dilute someone's ownership.

You are conveniently leaving out the outsized equity compensation package the board gave him and the impact it's hard on his net worth. I'd argue it was not an arms length transaction. It's a public filing and I suggest you read that arrangement.\n\nYou are also conveniently forgetting he used Tesla as a financing vehicle to bailout a quickly imploding SCTY, of which he was a significant owner, lender, and board member. That interest was converted into TSLA ownership. I believe the courts are still reviewing the legality of the transaction given the publicly disclosed series of events that suggests the Musk family were getting margin called and desperately jammed this deal into TSLA to avoid a bankruptcy, despite the board rejecting the proposal several times earlier on the year.\n\nI don't have any sort of superiority complex over Elon.
