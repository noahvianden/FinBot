The leftover options remnant of a merger between the heavily shorted American Torchlight Energy (TRCH) and Metamaterials (MMAT). BUYING and EXERCISING MMAT1 before Jan 21 2022 would give you TRCH shares which aren’t supposed to exist anymore.\n\nFinding MMAT1:\n\nOn Fidelity:\n\nThere are 2 sets for Oct and Jan, in the adjacent for both there are some that have multiple lines for same strike. The top one for each double is the mmat1... this is confirmed by clicking get quote and it shows up top. Mmat1.\n\nFidelity instructions below courtesy of u/bigdeerjr \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MMAT/comments/rhezvj/having_trouble_finding_mmat1_options_here_is_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nOn TD:\n\nHave to call the trading desk. They want to make sure you understand it is an adjusted option. Jan is available.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GQeiyVP\n\n\nPart 1\n\nThe Story:\n\nGather round you crayon-sniffing maladaptive little misanthropic misfits and get your mom’s credit card out. I’m going to tell you the story of how your dad who left you both for strippers and cigs 20 years ago has come back as RoboCop to make you 80s rich.\n\nChapter 1: Them Hoes be Greasy\n\nThe story begins with your dad, John Birdman. He really did leave you and mom for cigs and fast girls all those years ago and decided to -try- to capitalize on his passion by launching a company called Pole Perfect Studios that sold poles to strippers in Texas. Unfortunately, he kinda sucked at business and it looked like Pole Perfect was going under. In frustration John dug a hole in the ground to lay down and die in, but along the way he struck Black Gold! —Oil not a dead stripper that is— And just like that he found hope! Armed with strippers and oil, John set out for The Land of Maple Syrup.\n\nChapter 2: Of Eggheads and Shorts\n\nOn the Canadian side, CEO Jorge Paprika and his crew had spent the last ten years LARPing Mythbusters and making next-Gen light-bending technology. Jorge dedicated his life to the study of Metamaterials, fancy do-hickeys that have a range of applications from shielding people from LAZERS to noninvasive blood glucose testing and MRI optimization. He was so good at this that Canada called his company a unicorn. This made Clivesdale horses feel bad, but we’ll get to that in a bit. \nWhat Jorge didnt know then but painfully learned was that the Canadian mining company he reverse merged his Egghead Group with was heavily shorted and when he went public, his company was shorted into the ground.\n\nAs Jorge sat outside his business on a park bench in Canada staring at his gloomy ticker, the stench of cigarette smoke, cheap perfume and gasoline wafted over him:\n\nJohn Birdman: “Sup tard, want to crush some shorts?”\n\nJorge Paprika: “Fuck yeah let’s do it eh!”\n\nAnd so our story begins.\n\n————-\nPart 2\n\nThe Science Behind a Gamma Squeeze:\n\nWhen a trader buys a call option, it creates a risk for the counterparty who sold the call option. Without further measures, if the shares rise above the strike price, the option seller will have to acquire those shares in the open market, at a loss, to fulfill the contract. \n\nThere are many ways to hedge this risk. The net-net of the process, though, often requires someone to buy a share of the underlying stock, called a covered call.\n\nPositive feedback loop (aka what happened to Gamestonk): As the stock goes up, the market maker will adjust its hedge by buying more stock. Meaning if you BUY AND EXERCISE cheap OTM CALL options, market makers have to buy real shares to keep the option hedged.\n\nThe Escape: Hedgefunds can escape the gamma squeeze -aka rampant OTM call buying- by buying long term OTM PUTS\n\nThe Exception: This DOES NOT work if the Option Chain ITSELF IS GOING TO DIE. Rampant OTM Call buying and exercising cannot be stopped if the options chain of a company is about to expire if it undergoes a merger. In fact, all FTDs of a PRE-merged company are due T+35 days after final Options Expiry.\n\nWe will explore the hypothetical possibility of compounding an FTD due date and a gamma squeeze —aka BUYING and EXERCISING MMAT1 Options—.\n\n—————\nPart 3\n\nThe Trade - How and why BUYING and EXERCISING MMAT1 Options could force a Gamma Squeeze of MMAT\n\nThe Clivesdale Horse Hedgefund:\n- Unicorns are cooler than horses, you can ride them, they can fly and gore people\n- Metamaterials was dubbed a Unicorn by Canada and John Birdman and his strippers left their Clivesdale horses in Texas for The Canadian Unicorn\n- As a result, Clivesdale Horse -AKA KERRISDALE HEDGEFUND- is short shares of Meta Materials Inc (NASDAQ:MMAT).\n\nhttps://www.valuewalk.com/meta-materials-mmat-a-photonics-company-thats-an-optical-illusion-kerrisdale/\n\nPreliminary Facts:\n- Torchlight Energy, which merged with Canadian stock Metamaterials, was insanely shorted, GME level shorted\n- Metamaterials inherited shorts from a Canadian mining company and was insanely shorted\n- When they merged, there were issues with the merger and till this day, Metamaterials (MMAT), which should only be trading in America, continues to trade in Canada under Ticker MMAX, when the latter stops trading, the real float of the stock will drop from 218 million to 109 million. THIS IS LIKELY TO OCCUR BY END OF JAN 2022.\n\nMain points:\n\nPOINT 1:  Hardboiled Shorts\n\nWhen an American company merges with a foreign company, Shorts have to close out FTDs on the merged company T+35 days after a merged company’s legacy option chain ends.\n\nCase-In-Point New Egg and Lianluo LTD:\nOn October 25 2020 when news broke about  the Lianluo Retahd LTD merger with NEWEGG, the stock went from 0.4$ to 4$ the next day, meaning the news caused shorts to start covering. $NEGG then hovered between $4-10 until May 19. T+35 days after the Lianluo options chain ended however, from June 29 to July 7 shorts covered a veritable fuck ton of Lianluo short positions, causing the price to run up as high as $79 intraday.\n\nTie-In:  Metamaterials and Torchlight energy merged in June but the TORCH options chain only closes on Jan 21, 2022, so expect short covering FTDs T+35 days after that date.\n\nPOINT 2: Digital Dividends = Squeeze\n\nIssuing unobtainable dividends can fuck shorts.\n\nOver stock DEEZ NUTZ:\nFrom March 13, 2020 to August 21st 2020, eccentric CEO Patrick Byrne’s company, OSTK jumped like a MOFO. This is because he issued a private dividend that shorts could not cover via Ripto-Flurrency that was inaccessible for six months, forcing short sellers buy Overstock shares on NASDAQ to cover their positions, causing a swarm. Hedgefunds sued over this but ultimately lost with prejudice in 2021 so unobtainable dividends are a legal silver bullet to shorts.\n\nTie-In: Metamaterials is issuing dividends to its investors via its PRIVATE company Oilco, dividends which will be unobtainable by hedgefunds without buying and exercising MMAT1 options or buying MMTLP.\n\nPOINT 3: Egghead Stripper Math\n\nEXERCISING Jan 21 MMAT1 Options, purchasable through Fidelity and TD Ameritrade, could theoretically cause a gamma squeeze by forcing call writers to hedge risk, credit to u/CherryGrapeGorilla for example below:\n\n\nWARNING: EGGHEAD MATH BELOW\n\n“MMAT1 2.5C:\n\n2.5 x100 = $250 exercise + $100 premium (if you buy the contract for $1.00) \n= $350 to exercise. \n\n== $7/share MMAT + 100 MMTLP. \n\nWhich is equivalent to $3/share MMAT + $2/share MMTLP.”\n\nMATH ENDS ^\n\nTLDR: \nIn January, stock ticker MMAT is facing four major catalysts that could cause a short squeeze:\n\n1. MMAX converting to MMAT, cutting the float in half from 218 million to 109 million\n2. An Oilco Special Dividend\n3. Jan 21 2022 TRCH Options Expiry forcing SHFs to deliver TRCH FTDs T+35 days later in March\n4. Investors Buying and Exercising MMAT1 Options through TD Ameritrade and Fidelity, exacerbating the effects of Point 3.\n\nI wrote this as a point of academic curiosity. I absolutely DO NOT want people to do this. I love Clivesdales and I definitely do not want Kerrsidale Hedgefund to be Melvin capitaled.\n\nGod speed Retahds.", "id": "rgr480", "created_utc": 1639544754.0, "score": 524, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 166, "comments": [{"body": "Join the r/smallstreetbets official Discord here - https://discord.gg/E27dUNUwfx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I havent done the calculations yet but just from top of my head we should be at 40% of FF just since merger on the Nasdaq ticker. Even though it have 2 Cusip the oustanding shares are 281 million. No dilution what so ever. I Will message you printscreens of mondays Ortex and yesterdays they took away 19 million shares from CEOs holdings and changed the % of SI % FF. With all this said remember this does not include any of the FTDs from TRCH. Here is a link to the MMAT forum and a member that did DD on this couple of months ago.  I also suspect that there is a shit ton of FTDs from the Canadian ticker. Its an old Canadian mining ticker. Shorting mining companies in Canada is a national sport for the hedgies there. Canadas market is even more corrupt then the US. They can move FTDs between eachother every 10 days and never even get a slap on the wrist. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MMAT/comments/pjiqtc/mmat_a_checkmate_to_the_shorts_the_galactic_bear/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Fidelity isn't giving me a MMAT1 ticker, anybody else have any luck w MMAT1 through fidelity?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yes!

The thing is also that before that MMAT will move the dividend into a new placeholder called oilco that will be a private placeholder. So soon no more trading with the dividend. This will start a buying frenzy. Depending on how this dividend will be laid out cash or cash + shares in the company that buy the assets, iam hoping it will be TPL Texas Pacific Land corporation =TPL with a SP of ~ 1250 dollar. How will they cover that? By buying a shitload of MMAT 😁 If they even can do that...

{"title": "Fed will aggressively dial back its monthly bond buying, sees three rate hikes next year", "selftext": "The Federal Reserve provided multiple indications Wednesday that its run of ultra-easy policy since the beginning of the Covid pandemic is coming to a close, making moves that were even more aggressive than markets had anticipated.\n\nThe Fed will be buying $60 billion of bonds each month starting January, half the level prior to the November taper and $30 billion less than it had been buying in December. The Fed was tapering by $15 billion a month in November, doubled that in December, then will accelerate the reduction further come 2022.\n\nAfter that wraps up, probably around March, the central bank expects to start raising interest rates, which were held steady at this week’s meeting.\n\nProjections released Wednesday indicate that Fed officials see as many as three rate hikes coming in 2022, with two in the following year and two more in 2024.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee’s moves, approved unanimously, represent a substantial adjustment to policy that has been the loosest in its 108-year history.\n\nBoth moves came in response to escalating inflation, which is running at its highest level in 39 years for consumer prices. Wholesale prices in November jumped 9.6%, the fastest on record in a sign that inflation pressures are becoming more ingrained and broad-based.\n\nFor one, the Fed said it will accelerate the reduction of its monthly bond purchases.\n\nFed officials long have stressed that inflation is “transitory,” which Chairman Jerome Powell has defined as unlikely to leave a lasting imprint on the economy. He and other central bank leaders, as well as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have stressed that prices are booming due to pandemic-related factors such as extraordinary demand that has outstripped supply but ultimately will fade.\n\nHowever, the term had become a pejorative and the post-meeting statement eliminated it. Powell telegraphed the move during congressional testimony last month, saying “it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we meant.”\n\nFor the Powell Fed, tightening policy now marks a dramatic pivot off a policy enacted just over a year ago. Known as “flexible average inflation targeting,” which meant it would be content with inflation a little above or below its long-held 2% target.\n\nThe policy’s practical application was that the Fed was willing to let inflation run a little hot in the interest of completely healing the labor market from the hit it took during the pandemic. The Fed’s new policy sought employment that was both full and inclusive across racial, gender and economic lines. Officials agreed not to raise interest rates in anticipation of rising inflation, as the central bank had done in the past.\n\nHowever, as the “transitory” narrative came into question and inflation began to look stronger and more durable, the Fed has had to rethink its intentions and change gears.\n\nThe asset purchase taper began in November, with a reduction of $10 billion in Treasury purchases and $5 billion in mortgage-backed securities. That still left the month buys at $70 billion and $35 billion respectively.\n\nHowever, the Fed’s $8.7 trillion balance sheet increased by just $2 billion over the past four weeks, with Treasury holdings up $52 and MBS actually reduced by $23 billion. Over the past 12 months, Treasury holdings have expanded by $978 billion while MBS have risen by $567 billion.\n\nUnder the new terms of a program also known as quantitative easing, the Fed would accelerate the decline of its holdings until it is no longer adding to its portfolio. That would bring QE to an end in the spring and allow the Fed to raise rates anytime after. The Fed has said it likely would not raise rates and continue buying bonds simultaneously, as the two moves would work at cross purposes.\n\nFrom there, the Fed at anytime could start reducing its balance sheet either by selling securities outright, or, in the more likely scenario, begin allowing the proceeds of its current bond holdings to run off each month at a controlled pace.\n\n\n\n[Link to CNBC article, written by Jeff Cox](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/fed-will-aggressively-dial-back-its-monthly-bond-buying-sees-three-rate-hikes-next-year.html?)", "id": "rh6mv2", "created_utc": 1639595144.0, "score": 237, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 220, "comments": [{"body": "wait, so with news on increased tapering and interest rate hikes both confirmed, the market starts increasing?\n\nim am confused, what am i not understanding?", "score": 189, "replies": [{"body": "People knew this was coming it’s not a surprise.\n\nMarket is satisfied it isn’t worse than expected", "score": 333, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly this. \n\nHonestly, this news isn’t ideal for Wall Street but they already expected it.

Tesla advised Model Y LR RWD reservation holders to revise their orders by choosing a vehicle that it currently produces and pay the additional price, as Tesla’s vehicle prices have increased since then.\"*\n\nIt's legitimate for /u/Setheroth28036 to ask here as well as elsewhere, because people here pay a lot of attention to statements from Elon and Tesla.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for sharing this!  It’s what I was looking for, though not what I was hoping for.  Still wish I could find some quote from Elon somewhere where he promised they would honor the FSD price…", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Many Tesla customers have believed for a long time that reserving a Tesla with an agreed-upon price for FSD (in the notification of the reservation) locks in the price for FSD, as long as the reservation holder doesn't reconfigure. Here's a reference from April 2019 in which the poster believes that to be true: [https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/model-y-deposit-to-lock-in-fsd-pricing.149414/](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/model-y-deposit-to-lock-in-fsd-pricing.149414/)\n\nMy recollection is that the belief in the ability to lock in price of FSD originated in a Twitter discussion with Elon, which would likely have been around the time that raising the price of FSD was (first?) discussed. I think there was at least one time before a subsequent raise of the FSD price when potential customers were advised of a limited time opportunity to order and lock in the price of FSD.\n\nSo those might be good places to search - around the time of the first FSD price raise, and around the time of any subsequent FSD price raises.\n\nI believe it has always been understood that if the customer decides to reconfigure the order, they do not necessarily get to keep the original prices. And from recent discussion, Tesla is no longer allowing customers to lock in FSD or other prices for any new reservations, at least for Cybertruck - that these prices will be set at a time of final configuration, closer to actual production.\n\nThe interesting case, which you are describing, is when Tesla discontinues a configuration and reservation holders will have no choice except to reconfigure (or cancel the order). As a shareholder, it seems to me that it would be better to honor the old FSD price when it was Tesla rather than the customer who forced the reconfiguration, but of course I don't have all the information that Tesla has.\n\nA particularly interesting case comes up with Cybertruck, which recently stopped any lock-in of configuration or prices for new orders, and which will have the new option of a 4-motor configuration, while according to Sawyer Merritt the 1-motor and 3-motor versions may be cancelled entirely. If Tesla decides not to honor FSD price for any of the old configurations, then hundreds of thousands of people who thought they were locking in FSD price will be furious. If they honor the old FSD price on old orders but only if there is no reconfiguration, then the bizarre situation could arise where only holders of the 2-motor version get the old price but holders reservations of the 1- and 3-motor versions lose the old FSD price, which doesn't seem fair. Or they could decide that holders of 1- or 3-motor reservations who upgrade to more motors get to keep the old FSD price but holders of 2-motor reservations have to keep the 2-motor configuration or they lose the old FSD price. Or several other possibilities.\n\nTo repeat, it seems to me that when Tesla makes a change that forces reservation holders to reconfigure, it makes more sense to honor the old FSD price.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I agree it's important, but in general for the investment thread I care a lot more about verified trends than individual experiences. \n\nI'm not putting you down or diminishing your experience, and I do understand your frustration with the situation as you describe it.

Volkswagen was no where near the key targets EU had laid out, and their fines were going to be massive. According to the media's calculations, volkswagen would save 135000 DKK (\\~20500 USD) i climate fines for each electric car they sold in 2020.\n\nIn total 56,118 ID.3s were sold in Europe in 2020, saving VW 8 billion DKK (\\~1.2 billion USD) in fines. \n\nVolkswagen Denmark admits there are massive problems with especially the first model, ID.3 1st. The head of volkswagen Denmark says: \"We have never launched a product that have been plagued by so many faults on the first batch, and I am deeply sorry about that.\" \"We were not ready to handle these thing. Never in our wildest imagination did we think there would be this many tecnical problems.\" The news media goes on interview him and asks whether they launched an unfinished car in order to simply avoid fines. He responds saying that he completely understand why people would think that, but it was never their intention. According to VW Denamrk, 70 of the cars sold in Denmark were so bad they needed replacement of parts. \n\nOne customer, Christian Løfgren, says he signed on to the car having missing features, but never in his wildest imagination would he have believed how terrible the car was. \"I have never experienced anything like it. I wrote down how many problems I had with the car in a 14 day period, and I had problems with the car in all but one day.\"\n\nA second article, also published by the same news media, about the same topic:\n\n[Source](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/penge/kontant/steen-larsens-spritnye-elbil-stod-paa-vws-vaerksted-i-73-dage-det-foerste)\n\nInteresting bits:\n\nOne customer, Steen Larsen, started noticing problems already on the way home from the dealer. It started indicating sensor errors, and the backcamera didn't work. Other small problems came and went the next couple of days. One morning he went outside and the car had all the lights on. The car reports errors on all systems. He calls VW to get it in for repair. After 6 days he comes to pick it up again, but this time the car is completely dead and he has to use the emergencyopening to get into it. Another 6 days passes and he can finally take it home again. After 16 days the car have to be taken in for repair again. It continues this way, and in the first half a year of ownership the car has been in for repair for a total of 73 days. The longest period being 43 days. \n\nAnother customer, Sven Erik Holmberg tells a similar story. When he bought the car, he got access to VW's First mover facebook group for ID.3-owners. A group intended for customers to be able to share experiences and information with each other. However the group has turned into a forum where owners from all of Europe share their frustrations with each other.  Both Sven Erik and Steen Larsen ends up returning their ID.3's and getting their money back, but only after 5 months.\n\nAnother customer, Karina Bøjstrup, experienced problems with the cruise control. The cruise control would sometimes disengage and break, which could be very dangerous on the motorway. Another person said that the car would emergencybreak from 130 km/h to 30 km/h, when he was passing rest areas on the motorway. Another that the car would accelerate to 130 km/h where the speed limit was 90 km/h. \n\nThe head of VW Denmark said the problems with cruise control were due to the cruise control using a premade digital map of speed limits. The cruise control is also being controlled by a camera reading speed signs, but they have experienced challenges with the placement of some signs, he explains.

Current battery innovation is focusing on either reducing graphite in the anode (silicon replacement) or completely removing (anode-less batteries). Does that concern you at all?\n\nClearly graphene in itself has been heralded as a great material but I when I researched this a while back it sounded like there was huge oversupply in the market, with numerous other big players.\n\nInterested in your thoughts, thanks", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah. Its kind of a sad storry. Talga wanted to form a JV with 2 other companies to get the first mine off the ground, one of the companies is a Swedish state owned mining company, LKAB and the other is an international mining distribution network Mitsui. LKAB bailed just before the deadline without clear reasons. Rumors have it, that they didnt want to commit any capital or assets to the JV. But thats speculation.\n\nThe share price rose due to anticipation of good news, since we heard nothing wrong with it. So mid October, Talga released some non-binding MOU with Apple battery manufacturer Foxconn. With market anticipating JV news and getting a non-binding MOU, there was lots of disappointment, hence selling. Following then the bailout of LKAB, the share price took a dive.\n\nThing is, the MOU with Foxconn is pretty good. And Talga doesnt need LKAB for the first mine, anyway. The material is just below the surface and of high grade, they could go out with a leaf blower and a shovel. But its a blow nonetheless because, wouldnt it be nice to know the Swedish government is supporting (by proxy of LKAB) the mining operation? Anyway, thats why the share price behaved like it did.\n\nOn the plus side, Talga is mining material using a trail mine concession and they are almost done constructing a pilot plant for Anode manufacturing (EVA plant) that is geared towards automotive customers. This is supposed to spit out materal in Q1 2022. Potential customers are VW and Tesla (most prominently), so off take agreements might be towards the end of 2022. \n\nNext catalyst would be mining permits, expected Q1/Q2 next year. Until then, there was a series of explorational mining drills done and the cores are now being analysed. Early indications are graphite content in the ground of up to 40%, compared to competitors NMG in north america whos ressource is about 6 to 8% graphite.\n\nPolitically, Talga is getting a lot of support from EU and Sweden. Though, approval is not a political decision alone, as also environmental assessment has to be successful.

{"title": "Federal Reserve Day - My predictions on Powell's moves - 7 hours 30 minutes countdown!", "selftext": "In response to [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgegd6/last\\_minute\\_predictions\\_does\\_powell\\_crash\\_or\\_soar/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgegd6/last_minute_predictions_does_powell_crash_or_soar/) :)\n\nFirst let's take a step back and analyse the world logically and with facts.\n\n1. The Fed has 2 priorities: (1) Maximum employment (2) Price Stability and low inflation. Everything else is secondary.\n2. Markets have priced in a 2x taper by March ish, a 2-3 rate hike in 2022.\n3. Omicron hasn't caused lockdowns YET, except it most likely will due to the 2x transmisibility. Although Omicron is 90% less severe, and vaccines still work 70-75% for hospitalisations, Omicron is a wildcard. The International Energy Agency predicted a reduced demand for oil due to Omicron as well just a few days back.\n4. Pfizer's 89% pill's final data is reasonable. Possible FDA approval end of year.\n5. Maximum employment seems to have been reached since 4.2% (4.5% expected) unemployment was seen. Participation rate is 61.8%, still lower than pre COVID (63.3%), but it's recovering. Jobless claims (ie unemployment benefits) was 2x less than expected, although this seems to be expected since unemployment was lower than expected.\n6. CPI inflation was as expected - 6.8%. PPI sadly was higher than expected 9.6% (9.2% expected). CPI's main culprit was gas prices and used car prices. Gas prices seem to be subsiding. Used car prices are mostly due to the chip shortage. PPI was due to an increase in demand for goods and services. Gas / oil prices actually reduced.\n7. The UK has declared an emergency for Omicron, and will possibly boost everyone quickly until the end of the year. Australia's Omicron cases are skyrocketting due to a recent superspreader event with 150 people infected.\n8. China showed higher than expected inflation, yet retail sales was lower than expected.\n9. The yield curve was not very nice after Omicron, and before inflation, but it seems to have recovered. In fact, recently, the long term yields seem to be going up rather.\n10. The debt ceiling was just passed (Senate 50 v 49, House 221 v 209) a few hours ago and will now be signed by Biden. It essentially delays the issue until early 2023 or late 2022.\n11. The put/call ratio for major indices (CBOE) has declined somewhat, except it's still around 141 puts v 100 calls. On Dec 10 during the Inflation day it was a whopping 204 puts v 100 calls. On PPI day (PPI higher than expected), it was 141 v 100.\n\n|Date / Event|Puts v 100 Calls (SP500 Index)|Puts v 100 Calls (total equity ie individual stocks)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|23 Tue Nov|146|53|\n|24 Wed Nov (Jobless claims 50% less) (Omicron first discovered)|**178**|50|\n|25 Thurs Nov (Thanksgiving)|HOLIDAY|HOLIDAY|\n|26 Fri Nov (WHO variant of concern)|117|56|\n|29 Mon Nov|161|42|\n|30 Tue Nov (FDA voted 13-10 on 30% Merck)|154|48|\n|1 Wed Dec|143|52|\n|2 Thu Dec|**189**|62|\n|3 Fri Dec (US Budget deadline - shutdown averted) (Unemployment better than expected)|143|74|\n|6 Mon Dec|153|54|\n|7 Tue Dec|168|43|\n|8 Wed Dec|148|45|\n|9 Thu Dec (Jobless less than expected again)|158|53|\n|10 Fri Dec (Inflation better than expected)|**204**|61|\n|13 Mon Dec (First UK Omicron death, emergency declared)|**189**|56|\n|14 Tue Dec (PPI worse than expected) (Pfizer 89%)|141|60|\n|15 Wed Dec (Debt Ceiling passes, FOMC)|||\n\nThe table does show a consistent long term high put to call ratio. Inflation Day and FOMC Monday saw elevated 200 puts v 100 calls. Now it has subsided to 141 puts to 100 calls. It's still relatively high though, except it has subsided.\n\nFor updated Fed probabilities from CME:\n\n|Month|Year|Chance of Rate Hike (13 Dec)|Chance of Rate Hike (14 Dec)|Chance of Rate Hike (15 Dec)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|December|2021|1.11|**3.32**|**5.54**|\n|January|2022|8.46|8.12|**10.22**|\n|March|2022|36.84|**33.04**|**38.05**|\n|May|2022|56.42|56.76|**59.31**|\n|June|2022|78.83|78.07|**81.11**|\n|July|2022|85.39|85.92|**86.97**|\n|September|2022|90.65|**91.41**|**92.44**|\n|November|2022|93.17|93.99|94.63|\n|December|2022|97.24|97.71|97.96|\n|February|2023|97.93|98.31|98.45|\n\n**My conclusions:**\n\n1. First if Omicron didn't exist, Powell would be pretty strict, and may even say a 4x rate hike. This is because PPI was higher than expected, and CPI is on point. Likewise, unemployment is at a all time low, and jobless claims are very low.\n2. But here comes Omicron into the mix - Omicron will further exacerbate supply chain issues, cause unemployment to once again tick up (if lockdowns are seen), and will cause some mayhem. Possibly even a dent in consumer demand. Likewise the International Energy Agency forecast a drop in demand for oil due to Omicron, most likely due to decreased travelling and transportation.\n\nDue to Omicron, in my view, if you look at the world logically, the Fed will still taper x2 speed. Maybe even slightly faster. Most likely 2x. Omicron will be with us for 3 months at least (the US only has just started so Jan, Feb, March ish). This most likely the Fed will NOT raise rates in Jan and March, and will raise rates in May due to Omicron subsiding. Maybe even in June, since April / May might be recovering from Omicron. Then another rate hike in July is possible. Then finally November. Maybe even December, but unlikely.\n\n**IMO Powell will most likely say \"We'll adjust our policy decisions as we see fit because Omicron will cause disruptions to the economy, as seen in Europe. This will impact full employment and price stability. However, inflation seems to be elevated for longer than expected, with Omicron further exacerbating the issue, and so we believe a 2x taper until March is necessary.\"**\n\n**I doubt he'll mention any IR increases, but in the dot plot, it'll show at least 3 IR hikes ie around May/June, July, November. Unlikely March, since March will show the full wrath of Omicron.

Then in 2022 he will announce a 0.25% interest rate hike and the exact number and timing is going to depend on how inflation is between now and then, how the supply chain issues are resolving, if Omicron is overflowing the hospitals and killing lots of people / causing shutdowns (whether the gov’t mandates it or not, a good portion of people will choose to stay home / voluntarily shut themselves down if the hospitals are full and tons of people are dying.)\n\nI don’t see how the used car prices will come down any time soon, because the chip shortage is a bottleneck for producing new cars. Also if people are getting big raises because of inflation, businesses will raise their prices (aka cause inflation) and that becomes the basis for more raises. Inflation could get “stuck” around 7% if businesses and employees start expecting that to be the inflation level, which would mean that JPow would eventually need to go full Volker and cause a brief recession to knock out the inflation.\n\nHowever, this economy has been addicted to low rates and QE since the Great Recession, and I’m not sure it could handle the kind of rapid rate raises it would take to tackle inflation. It could put a lot of zombie companies out of business, and those companies employ many millions of people, thus running up against the other half of the dual mandate which is full employment.

You’ll fix one thing, and then two months later, there’s another expensive repair that needs to be made. The car is just wearing out and dying, like a 103 year old human with several types of cancer, the car has just reached the end of its life and we have to accept it.\n\nSo every month, more cars are reaching that “end of life” stage, than there are new cars rolling off of the assembly lines. Meanwhile, a lot of people can’t work from home (waitresses, construction workers, chefs, etc,) and they also can’t walk or bicycle to work, can’t afford to pay $15 each way for a taxi or Uber, and can’t use mass transit because it doesn’t exist in their area. Those people *need* cars to put food on their table, but each month the supply of drivable old cars is dwindling, and there aren’t enough new cars coming onto the market. So the people who would normally trade their semi-old car up for a new car are holding on to their used cars for longer. People who normally like to buy new cars don’t want to sell their current 3 - 5 year old cars right now, since it’s too hard/expensive to buy a new one. They’re just going to ride out the pandemic and wait for production to stabilize and get a new car. The people driving old beater cars don’t have that option once their cars die, they need to get something so that they can continue their jobs, and they have to pay whatever the price is. So this imbalance + shortage is driving prices way up.\n\nI think that’s the problem, more so than software engineers buying a Tesla for normal personal use, a Mercedes SUV for hauling the spouse and kids around town, a Mazda Miata for the midlife crisis, and a Ford F-150 for that imaginary time when they may hypothetically need to haul large objects around (which will never, ever happen.)

Old cars have a short depreciation cycle - ie they'll break faster. I agree.\n2. Transit, Uber etc are expensive, and some cannot do WFH. I agree as well. Sadly the US is a urban sprawl country and car ownership is very high.\n3. Interesting take on people hogging their not so new but not so old cars - essentially people know prices are high for new cars, and so they're waiting it out to buy a new car. This makes sense. I even confirmed with some data analysis (CUUR0000SETA01 New Cars and CUSR0000SETA02 Old Cars). Presuming your theory is correct, that means we need to find the correlation of used car prices to new car prices when new car prices are time lagged (ie if a new car was +50% in Jan, it should filter through making used car prices go up X months later. The R2 without any lag is 0.416, so in general if new car prices go up, old car prices go up 41.6% of the time. If you add time lags of 12 months, the R2 only went up to 46.6% so maybe your hypothesis is right? Though I would have expected a higher R2 number.\n4.

{"title": "Call the $UBER! Destination: Gainsville", "selftext": ">Drive with Uber and you can afford first class like me! – Rose DeWitt Bukater, Titanic Survivor\n\n\\*12/21/21 Update at bottom\n\n\\*12/23/21 Update at bottom (see Chart 2)\n\n# KEY POINTS\n\n* Similar setup to Dec ‘19-Jan ‘20 rebound (1mo return \\~+45%)\n* Analyst EBITDA estimates too low; avg PT of $70! (+85%)\n* Explosive ’22 EBITDA growth on increased op leverage\n* Consistent 2022 Top Pick on Street; screens great for fund managers\n* CEO bought 200k shares, major vote of confidence\n* Wandered desert for '21, Entering promised land '22\n* Calls priced for good upside!\n\n# Company Description\n\nUber is best known for its B2C ridesharing platform, but the variety of logistic-based businesses under its umbrella drive the company's full value. This includes B2B businesses like Uber Freight, which in ‘21 acquired Transplace- a global leader in logistics and supply chain management software- during the early innings of a historic transformation in both industries. Additionally, in markets where Uber could not compete immediately (i.e. China) they invested in leading regional startups (i.e. Didi), allowing them to still profit from the global transportation & logistics transformation while gaining optionality through simple strategic sales. Uber has also developed subscription and loyalty programs, locking in their customer base while taking market share. Best of all, they’re also ramping a high-margin advertising business, practically printing free money from businesses looking to be promoted on their super app. A consistently smart, strategic approach has made Uber one of the great companies to come out of the 2010s tech boom.\n\n# Thesis\n\nUBER has been getting hammered nearly all of 2021 for various reasons, none of which are due to fundamental shifts in the business. It's a far stronger company than pre-covid, as the pandemic era forced Uber to increase efficiency & financial leverage, making them **more profitable on lower bookings**. **Return to full volume = Profits like Splash Waterfalls** (see: Ludacris). Did I mention the CEO just said they had their **best bookings week ever**? Additionally, they should benefit from travel news over the next month as it continues to see strong recovery momentum despite Omicron.\n\nTwo important calendar events happen annually: Entering the new year and the second half. Funds are always for stocks to drive outperformance in that next period, and in the case of Dec, this leads to supply overhangs from tax-loss harvesting (TLH) suddenly being met with swift buying once the “coast is clear”. Like the overhang in ‘19, Uber could rebound out of this period toward the mid-to-high 40s where the CEO purchased 200k shares last month. Market mechanics converging with positive fundamental news should support a near-term multiple rerating.\n\nRecap: This play is taking advantage of a rebound as the coast clears from overwhelming Dec supply (TLH & omicron fears), buying demand re-enters (week of 12/17) helping it break its downward channel, and a sentiment & technical reversal is signaled, leading to further upside momentum.\n\n# Current Valuation & Financials\n\n* Revenue Growth: +49% ’22, +31% ‘23\n   * Fwd P/S '22: 2.9x ... valuation and growth speak for themselves. Name one other company growing at \\~40% 2yr CAGR trading at only 2.9x Fwd P/S.\n* EBITDA Growth: +243% ‘22, +188% ‘23\n   * Explosive growth a direct result of prior investments across their platforms\n   * Does not yet account for CEO’s comments on 12/14 reaffirming 4Q21 EBITDA toward the higher end of the guide (orig: $25m-$75m), which likely flows through to slight estimate raises across the next calendar year as well.\n   * Uber continues to approach full profitability, currently estimated for Q2 ’23. I suspect Uber may pull this expectation forward at their Feb ER.\n* Free Cash Flow Growth: ’22 +190%, ’23 +268%\n   * UBER’s efficiency initiatives have it on the brink of becoming a colossal FCF generation machine, with ’22 expected to be the year they flip FCF positive for the first time in history. Guess what factor should do well in the next phase of this market? My money is increasing FCF will be top of that list.\n* Equity Investments\n   * The primary culprit of their Q3 miss, equity investment revaluation (i.e. Didi stake of 144mil shares) drove the bulk of their -$2.4B net income loss, not losses from actual business operations.\n   * CEO looking to strategically raise cash from these investments as they rebound in the future; with Didi relisting on Chinese markets, it will eventually flow through as a colossal earnings tailwind in the future.\n* Analyst Price Target: $69.50, +86% Upside\n   * The buffer makes it a fantastic candidate to rebound and still have plenty of upside following their February ER.\n   * **UBER named a Top 2022 Pick by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS so far.** What do all these have in common? They comprise the bulk of investable assets and represent a significant portion of sell-side flow. Good PMs drive outperformance by buying early in a price turnaround and that’s roughly where we are.\n\n# Technicals\n\nTechnicals are horrific due to the relentless nature of the TLH in Q4 as managers offset insanely strong gains elsewhere. However, 2020’s resistance level of $37 has become the new support during the December selling and it is very clearly basing; once the TLH subsides this week, we should have a quick zip upward, officially breaking the upper channel of the downtrend, in turn triggering positive momentum signals which leads to fast money re-entering the stock. See Chart 1 in Appendix\n\n# How to Play\n\nNote: All positions assume a rebound to mid-to-high $40s by expiration. Prices as of posting (12/15). Prior resistance highs were $64.\n\n*Gen X/Boomers*: Buy stock! No brainer.\n\n*Risk-Averse*: April ’22 C42.5 currently presents 1-3x upside, expands to 5.5x on sustained momentum to $55 following Feb ER.\n\n*Quasi-Risk Averse*: March ’22 C42.5 currently presents 3.9x upside, expands to 5.5x on sustained momentum to $55 following Feb ER.\n\n*Pump It Up! Junior*: Feb '22 C45 currently presents 4.7x upside on a post-ER rebound to $50, expands to 9.5x on a rebound to $55, 85% of prior highs.\n\n*Pump It Up!*: Jan ’22 C40 currently presents 5.5-9x upside on a rebound toward mid-to-high $40s\n\n*WSB Delight*: Jan ’22 C42 currently presents 6.5-11x upside on a rebound toward mid-to-high $40s\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy positions (12/15): I’m accumulating all of the above, finishing my purchasing over the days ahead as we take advantage of volatility from options expiration and the market holding its breath through the Fed announcement. Instead of posting this write-up on Dec expiration (12/17) as planned, I decided to crank it out earlier due to the attention boost UBER got 12/14 so people could start legging in positions. Keep in mind the current positioning of the options market should create a gravitational pull toward $40 into 12/17 expiration at the same time TLH starts to subside.\n\n# Appendix\n\nRegarding regulation, which I originally cut for length due to it not being relevant to this trade:\n\n>I'm glad you mentioned that as I cut it out for length. As RBC stated in a recent report:  \n>  \n>*We view outcomes similar to Prop 22 in CA as more likely, where driver protections are put in place with an emphasis on those pursuing full-time driving which affects the minority of drivers.*  \n>  \n>As BTIG stated in a recent report titled \"UK Ruling More of a Win Than Headlines Suggest\"*:*  \n>  \n>*UBER reclassified UK drivers as workers in 3/2021 and competitors didn't match, which meant that* ***UBER's costs \\[already\\] went up*** *...The net result should be... a level playing field... and finally a scenario in which UBER could raise prices to offset the higher costs... since the reclassification.*\n\n[Original Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgzg3g/comment/hon7prk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nChart 1:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[UBER found solid support at 2020 resistance levels, leading me to believe this is the bottom. A reversal toward the upper end of the channel should lead to a breakout from the downtrend in price and sentiment.](https://preview.redd.it/7wdisi8kac781.png?width=2421&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb0d0c8f02bfb41b51d732850e15283a4bbdcaa6)\n\nChart 2: (12/23/21)\n\n[12\\/23\\/21 Continued strength has UBER poised to break out of the downtrend channel](https://preview.redd.it/lokpartm7c781.png?width=3834&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9c18ef5157c75d24aea150ca6f912884f663387)\n\n**12/21/21 Update:** UBER showed great strength against 12/20's market-wide selling pressure, a signal that the supply overhang is behind us. With UBER near $42, the $42 strike now becomes the higher gamma play with the 45s being the higher upside play. Given that TLH is generally over and with the Santa Claus rally in play, UBER definitely looks ready to break out of its downtrend channel with a higher probability bursting toward high $40s to $50 by Jan expiration (where it currently has 150k OI on C50, which will either be a wall or an accelerant depending on how quickly it gets there).\n\nGiven recent strength, I made the following rotations:\n\n* 100% of Jan 40s into UBER Jan 45s and another Jan effect play\n* 50% of my UBER Jan 42s into Jan 45s\n* 100% of March 42.5s into March 47.5s\n* Still holding April 42.5s (best reward/risk on run to $55)\n\nAs mentioned in the thread & comments, I had owned every suggested position as they offered the highest return/risk based on my proprietary excel model, and all remaining UBER positions still offer great upside into the month ahead as UBER approaches its breakout.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**12/23/21 Update:** After UBER's strength was called out on CNBC's Fast Money today, this will bring additional attention and flows to the stock. The broad market (S&P) remains supportive as it lifts higher, and itself likely makes a sustained break above Q4 resistance (~4700) into Jan. Both of these factors are supportive of a full breakout for UBER. Still targeting high 40s/50 by Jan expiration (4wks away), especially as the required average daily move to reach $50 has dropped to +0.60%.\n\nCurrent option positioning supports a gravitational pull toward $50 on continued momentum (currently 150K Jan C50 OI); depending on how quickly that strike is approached, that OI would also create a small MM hedging lift on a break above $50.\n\nI've completely exited the Jan 40s and 42s and rolled to Jan 45s which offered over 3x returns on a run to $50.", "id": "rgzg3g", "created_utc": 1639575926.0, "score": 260, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "Didi fucked this stonk hard, def a buying opportunity but  I’d rather buy shares like a boomer", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, great returns to be made no matter how you play it.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Hey what call options are looking at?

In fact, since that peak, the equity has taken a nearly 25% haircut. Despite its shaky performance on the charts of late, investors shouldn't swear off the stock just yet, as it has dipped to a key trendline with historically bullish implications.\r  \n\r  \nSpecifically, TSLA has come within one standard deviation of its 80-day moving average after of trading above the trendline since July. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, at least four similar signals have occurred in the past three years. The equity enjoyed a positive return one month later in half of those instances, averaging a 12% gain. From the stock's current perch of $935, a similar move would put Tesla stock back over the $1,000 mark. Even better, the stock's 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 32 sits just on the cusp of \"oversold\" territory. This indicator typically predates a short-term bounce.\r  \n\r  \n\\[Suppressed Image\\]\r  \n\r  \nPut buying is still all the rage, leaving ample room for a shift in sentiment amongst options traders, that could boost the shares higher. Data from the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) shows the security with a 10-day put/call volume ratio of 1.20, which ranks higher than all other readings in its annual range, meaning puts are being bought at their fastest rate in 12 months.\r  \n\r  \nTesla stock has tended to exceed options traders volatility expectations during the past year.
