It's actually less than 18 since the Thanksgiving market holiday was in that range.\n\n* One of your legs was ITM. That's a high risk delta. Both legs should be OTM and the short leg should be as close to 30 delta OTM as possible. If 37 was the short, the long should have been 36 or 35, depending on the payoff.\n\n* Speaking of payoff, $1.71 credit versus a $5 spread width is just barely break-even at 34%. Ideally, you want the credit vs. width to be **more** than 34%. This is assuming a 30 delta short leg. YMMV if you use a different delta.\n\n* It's a meme stock. Nuff said.\n\n> BBY - Opened week of 11-15. Expiration date of 12-10. Stock was trading at $135. Strikes were $125/$135. Collected $325 in Premium. Closed today as stock dropped to $106. Buy out premium was $1000 - Lost $675.\n\n* Same comments as for the NIO spread, only this time one leg was ATM rather than ITM, but that's still too close to the money.\n\n> ABNB - Opened week of 11-15. Expiration date of 12-10/ Stock trading at $205. Strikes were $190/$200. Collected $370 in premium. Closed today at $186 for ($1000) - total loss of $630.\n\n* Finally, a properly constructed OTM put credit spread, albeit still higher than 30 delta would be my guess. \n\n* This one has a solid credit of 37% vs. the $10 width, so you are okay there, although again the delta is wrong.\n\nOverall, you are playing underlyings that are very volatile. That isn't bad in itself, but it does mean your swings will be wider and you might run losses for a lot longer, even when you do everything right. You have to trade those kinds of underlyings hundreds of times to average out a win.\n\nYour strike selection is way off. You are taking deltas that are too high and getting punished for it. Shoot for 30 delta on the short and 30 to 45 DTE, exit at 50% max profit, 100% credit lost, or 10 DTE, whichever comes first.\n\nYour spread widths are also very wide. While some of your credits were good, the wider the spread the greater your risk of loss. You might try limiting yourself to spreads that are no more than $3 wide for a while and see if that improves your results. If you can't find a $3 spread that pays at least a 34% credit, don't trade it. Sometimes trading is patiently waiting in cash until the right opportunity comes along.

If you think you're losing by closing early is not correct as you are opening a new trade to keep things going, all with much lower risk.\n\nI roll out a week or two when the stock hits the CSP strike price as the premium is the best ATM and my goal is to collect as much premium as possible while giving the trade time for the stock to move back OTM where it will profit.

By extension it just shows that proper money management really is the key to having any sort of long term success at this game.

'Talking' about building new facilities and/or increasing production versus actually 'doing' it are two different things.\n\nIt takes years to build semiconductor fabrication facilities, along with billions and billions of dollars. Manufacturing a chip typically takes more than three months and involves giant factories, dust-free rooms, multi-million-dollar machines, molten tin and lasers. Just one speck of dust can cause havoc. The air is constantly filtered and very few people are allowed in. Even with all those precautions, the silicon can’t be touched by humans or exposed to the air. They travel between machines in cartridges carried by robots that run on tracks in the ceiling. Building an entry-level factory that produces 50,000 wafers per month costs roughly $15 billion. Intel, Samsung and TSMC have factories that are more advanced and cost over $20 billion each. Once you spend all that money building giant facilities or upgrading your current one, they risk becoming obsolete in five years or less. The technological advances within this product, along with the expected increase in demand for these chips, means the gap between the industry leaders versus the rest of the field will only increase. Few will be able to keep up or have the continued capital to do so. It is hard not to see these shortages extend for years.\n\nSo the increase in production that you speak off is not just a 'switch' that these companies can flip and just decide to increase - it takes billions and billions in capital and years to facilitate these new facilities or upgrades.

Although I had decided that these would be longer term investments... I do know that sometimes my family costs run high and sometimes we needs some \"powder\" (cash) to pay for things (including taxes).\n\nSo this past Friday (first week of December essentially)... Tesla stock dropped a significant amount again due to fears of the new Covid Variant Omicron... But more importantly because the Fed has announced concerns with inflation getting more widespread and a tapering of their quarterly 120 Billion dollar bond purchases by 15b.   All of this does not bode well for growth names like Zoom, Tesla and many others and they've all taken a bit of a beating.\n\nAdditionally, fund managers that I follow (like Mr. Gary Black) will be trimming (reducing) their Tesla shares by the time their PT of $1400 is reached.\n\nSo my dilemma is... Deciding whether to sell say half (50%) of my Tesla shares by the time we reach $1400? (if we in fact do reach such a price by say January or early February of 2022)?   Or do I just naively keep holding on to my position for at least several more years?\n\nFor me personally, it's difficult deciding whether to do nothing or sell some shares at $1400?  \nPlus the other complication is that I live in California and my income bracket is quite high This means that if I sell some shares, hoping to buy back after a major correction.... Then I will most likely lose a lot of that buying back power (meaning I will end up with less shares) after I factor in some money that would need to remain in my brokerage account to cover expenses and things in 2022.\n\nSo common sense and a lot of thought about this in November, had led me to believe that since we are not dealing with a lot of shares (like thousands)... It may be best to stomach any major Volatility and hold on to my shares.  But now with all this inflation news and action by the Fed to reduce bond purchases ... I'm not sure what is the wisest course of Action in the shorter term? \n\nDo most of you guys believe we'll be back down to the low 800s again soon and remain their for many months?  Or do you believe that even once Tesla reaches above $1350 by end of January or February of 2022, that we will not be all losing all those gains and drop down to $800s again? \n\nYour thoughts and personal opinion (obviously not taken as financial advice) are greatly appreciated by me.
