This is not actually related to the law of large numbers, but may be a result of the law of diminishing marginal returns or diseconomies of scale.\n\nFor example, in January 2020, the revenue generated by Walmart Inc. was recorded as $523.9 billion while Amazon.com Inc. brought in $280.5 billion during the same period. If Walmart wanted to increase revenue by 50%, approximately $262 billion in revenue would be required. In contrast, Amazon would only need to increase revenue by $140.2 billion to reach a 50% increase. Based on the law of large numbers, the 50% increase would be deemed more difficult for Walmart to accomplish than Amazon.\n\nThe same principles can be applied to other metrics, such as market capitalization or net profit. As a result, investing decisions can be guided based on the associated difficulties that companies with very high market capitalization can experience as they relate to stock appreciation.”\n\nTrees don’t grow to the sky…eventually there will be a saturation point and growth will slow significantly or stop due to scalability and addressable market.

Given the current price of $323, this represents an 18% margin of safety/upside. \n\nNow, what if the bond rates go to what they were a few years ago, say 3.5% like in 2018? Well, in that case the fair price becomes about $282, i.e. an upside of -12%. \n\nSo, whether MSFT is a buy at these prices or not depends on what you think its growth will be in the next few years, and what you think will happen with the interest rates.

And it's only because I'm managing this for my elderly father (whose a senior citizen!)\n\nWe own about 160 shares of Tesla at an Average cost of $861.  Although him and I had agreed that these would be longer term investments... I do know that his costs run high and sometimes he needs some \"powder\" (cash) to make things happen.\n\nSo this past Friday (first week of December essentially)... The stock dropped a significant amount again due to fears of the new Covid Variant Omicron... But more importantly because the Fed has announced concerns with inflation getting more widespread and a tapering of their quarterly 120 Billion dollar bond purchases by 15b.   All of this does not bode well for growth names like Zoom, Tesla and many others and they've all taken a bit of a beating.\n\nAdditionally, fund managers that I follow (like Mr. Gary Black) will be trimming (reducing) their Tesla shares by the time their PT of $1400 is reached.\n\nSo my dilemma is... Deciding whether to sell say half (50%) of my Tesla shares by the time we reach $1400? (if we in fact do so by say January or early February of 2022)?   Or do I just naively keep holding on to my position for at least several more years in the hopes and hype floating around that Tesla will be worth over at least $2000 dollars a share this time next year?\n\nFor me personally, it's difficult deciding whether to do nothing or sell some shares at $1400?  \nPlus the other complication is that I live in California and my father's income bracket is quite high (he's a very successful engineer).  This means that if I sell his shares, hoping to buy back after a major correction.... Then I will most likely lose a lot of that buying back power (meaning I will end up with less shares) after I factor in some money that would need to remain in his brokerage account to cover taxes.\n\nSo common sense and a lot of thought about this in November, had led me to believe that since we are not dealing with a lot of shares (like thousands)... It may be best to stomach any major Volatility.  But now with all this inflation news and action by the Fed...

People are uncertain so they’re withdrawing money even though best strategy (especially for us retail small money) is to hold through any money we don’t need in short term.\n\nIMO we’ve hit peak hysteria. VIX peaked 35.3 on Friday before dropping to 30.6 at close. Hasn’t been this high since end of Jan (37.2 Jan 27) and just before the election last year (40.3 Oct 28).\n\nSo is having a new US president more or less impactful than the Fed flipping on their inflation is transitory statement? Yes this is impactful but S&P has already corrected 4.5% since recent peaks. Ignoring Covid black swan crash, you have to go back to Sep-Dec 2018 for a 15% drop caused by a combination of tariffs, 4x interest rate increases, big tech under congress investigation leading to huge uncertainty, and more. Btw VIX peaked at 36.2 on Dec 26 2018. \n\nAnd Omicron whilst uncertain earlier last week is building more evidence that it may be more contiguous but also less harmful. Most hospitalisation in S Africa (which is where it was first detected due to the great labs they have) are from non-Covid related issues and discovering Omicron in the process. \n\nIMO - general market might be choppy/sideways for another week or two.

The amount of USD in circulation has increased by ~60% in a year. Government spending is only going to go up. Wages won't go down, only up. Interest rates are at 0%. The only way to stop inflation is to raise interest rates. If interest rates rise future cashflow is discounted more heavily, therefore growth stocks down.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">Businesses are starting to raise prices because they see others raise their prices.\n\nThis is called wage push inflation, and is typically the cause of herd-mentality run away inflation. The inflation that we are seeing is not really related to wages. The inflation we see is caused by supply-side shortages.\n\nTo understand why wage push inflation led to a strong feedback loop you have to understand the mechanisms at work.\n\nIn the 70's there was strong unionised labour with collective bargained wages. If the brick layer saw the price of his groceries go up by 5% he would demand a 6% wage rise, which then would lead to the plumber asking for a 7% etc. These groups of people went up in 'chunks'.\n\nThere was also almost no digital technology. Just phones and paper. If you ran a business you had a lot of physical records of your prices. You could not adjust them daily as your costs changed. So you would put your prices up more this week, to cover you for a month lets say. This wouldn't happen now. Prices are digital, and people have a daily accounting of their costs.\n\nThe whole system of commerce is much more efficient than it was in the 70's. It is able to find equilibrium much more quickly. This reduces the chance of 'runaway' inflation, which is just caused by other people raising prices.\n\n>The amount of USD in circulation has increased by \\~60% in a year\n\nMoney supply is composed of two components, volume and velocity. When velocity falls, they increase the volume, and vice versa. They increased the volume to counter the massive decrease in velocity during covid.\n\n>Government spending is only going to go up. Wages won't go down, only up.\n\nGovernment spending has already only been going up, as wages. That is not unexpected. Just because government spending and wages are going up doesn't mean we have to have inflation above 2-3%. Wages typically grow faster than inflation anyway, because of productivity gains.\n\nThe purpose of inflation is to bias the economy towards investments and borrowing. This kind of helps push people to work hard and find ways generate capital. The Fed has two tools: balance sheet size and interest rate, with which to get inflation to around 2%. If we have a lot of deflationary pressures in the economy (from technology and globalisation) interest rates need to be lower to actually generate inflation.\n\nNothing has fundamentally changed from 2 years ago, except for maybe two. The supply chains might be higher cost because they will have larger buffers/more localised, and participation rate won't go back up to the same as before because the break has made it not worth it for the edge case old people. These two things though, are a one-off change. They are not a repeated 6% costs per year, that compounds. Once the supply chain has been 'beefed up' the costs go up on the same prior trajectory.\n\nNow what lasting deflationary changes will there be as a result of COVID-19? The amount of technology used in business has been accelerated maybe 5 -10 years in some ways. Outsourcing of white-collar jobs is going to further accelerate. It's possible that the net impact of all this is actually a deflationary one.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "You've obviously thought about this more than me.
