But, some reasons why a lot of capital in circulation is a bad thing:\n\n* Quantity theory of money states that MV = PQ. The left side of that equation is money * velocity. Increase either of those and inflation increases. That means either price level or quantity of goods/services need to increase. If someone wants to pretend that extra money in circulation will lead to more goods and services, you'd be contradicted by the past several months of data (and, to be frank, much of the past few decades. Each injection of cash led to higher prices, not more stuff).\n\n* When I was a professional poker player, I wanted to play in games where money got passed around frequently. Win or lose, it was better for me  in the long run than it was for them. Why? Because eventually it would get back to me and I am better at holding onto it than most other players. This is why wealth concentrates FASTER in high-velocity environments. If you give a person that makes sound financial decisions money and someone that spends his money foolishly, it looks equal on paper.... but, that person that makes good decisions will spend it on what he needs and put the rest in a safe place. The other person will spend it. That's it. He'll spend it, often indiscriminately. Whatever gets back to person A will be put on lockdown because he already acquired what he needed. Whatever goes to another goofball with poor impulse control will follow the same logic until all the excess money gets concentrated into person A's bank account. Then, person B and all the goofballs like him are going to wonder why there's such a wealth inequality.\n\n* With regards to your question about civil unrest: I'm not a social (psuedo)scientist, but I would think most of that is rooted in petty jealousy. \"I want that! I can't have that! Burn it all down!!!\" So, its not that too much capital in circulation directly causes civil unrest, but the inevitable increase in wealth inequality does.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Okay I understand now.

Stretch out this pace of increase over like 1,000 years to try to get a better visualization. At that point attempting to buy a single share of the S&P would cost more than the entire annual economy can produce or something like that. Similarly, having a single share would be worth more than everything produced by the entire economy. Means if like a single person decided sell a single share, they would have to receive more money than there is literally money actually available. And this would account for inflation as well since the rate of increase is outpacing inflation.\n\nThere is a point (an unknown point) in the real world where the price of the market vs. the value of the market becomes unsustainable, literally base on math.\n\nEdit to add: another way you could look at it is you have a chicken. Let’s make it immortal for fun and also pretend the companies in the stock market will never die (they will, they do).\n\nWow! This chicken is amazing! Someone buys it from you for 1,000.\n\nThey sell it to someone else for 10% more. Because immortal chicken = infinite eggs.\n\nEveryone wants this chicken with infinite eggs, for the value of the infinite eggs let’s say.\n\nIt gets passed back and forth constantly, each time with a 10% increase. Eventually, the chicken will stop getting bought, and probably far after whatever the eggs are worth, as the chicken can still only lay eggs so fast. Eventually the chicken will get sold for less than it was bought for, because someone paid too much. It could take 10 years or 100. But it will happen. Chicken = stock. Eggs= economy.\n\nSome day, the stock market has to stop rising so fast. The longer it rises faster than the underlying value of it, the more likely it is that the market will crash to come back to reality instead of just a steady rise.\n\nP/e is *one way* to get an *idea* of whether the market is going up too fast, or is “on sale”.\n\nEdit to add: the QE isnt in and of itself the issue. It’s what people do with QE that is the questionable part. Chicken and egg again. QE = taking on more debt. Can only take on so much debt before the interest owed on the debt becomes unsustainable, and something has to be done to fix it. Historically (looking at thousands of years, not 30 years), this results in big big problems, like violence and unrest and widespread bankruptcies. Also, it causes inflation (more debt now = more money now = buy more things faster = less stuff available = prices rise). Trying to avoid losing purchasing power due to inflation, people buy assets like stocks and houses faster, and companies go into debt to try to build up faster to make more money to keep their income rising faster than inflation.

But I’ll dig deeper in to some of those points:\n\n-**shrinking revenue**: revenue is actually up 29% YoY and up 77% compared to the same period last year.\n\n-**shrinking market share**: GameStop has captured key partnerships with Microsoft and Nintendo. You can buy many games digitally from GameStop while gaining rewards (Tie this in to your argument with how games are being sold digitally). They’ve actually diversified in to other products/revenue streams as well and formed partnerships with tv manufacturers and began selling more PCs and PC parts/accessories. Note that in their last earnings call they’ve also stated investments in to NFTs & Web3. I’m assuming this will tie in the digital world as well for obvious reasons. These new revenue streams are just starting to make a dent in their revenue. Imagine when they actually start to capture more business from these new and innovative revenue streams. They’ve already gotten a ton of free press this year.\n\n-**no profits and consistent losses**: this I can’t disagree with. The numbers show consistent losses over the years. However, looking forward, they’ve cut down overhead by reducing the amount of physical locations they’ve had. They’ve invested a ton back in to their business (purchasing more inventory to meet demand while reducing the impact of inflation, diversifying revenue streams by bringing in new products, hiring tech savvy staff, customer service reps, purchasing 2 massive distribution centers, and rebranding stores internationally). Also note that GameStop had $1.7 BILLION of cash on hand with no debt in their Q2. In Q3 they finished with 1.3 due to investments and innovations. They reported only a $105 million loss even with all their recent investments.\n\n-**toxic company culture**: not sure where this is taken from. I don’t work there and not sure if you do. But from what I hear and understand the new leadership, that has been there for less than a year, has made it a focus to boost morale and therefore boost customer delight.\n\n-**unique products:** Amazon has no unique products but it was able to capture an audience based on convenience, pricing, and diversified revenue. GameStop is doing the same. The difference is that GameStop will be more focused on a specific industry with a physical location in communities that know GameStop as a household name. With a loyal following and a growing brand with growing revenue streams, new seasoned leadership, and innovation they can definitely call themselves unique.\n\n-**20 competitors:** name one that has the brand recognition, community presence, international presence, and cash on hand that GameStop has with ZERO debt. They are in a prime position to make a move to outmaneuver their competition.\n\n-**forward looking statements**: you have to realize their new CEO was just on boarded last quarter. They are in the midst of changing this company around and building a new foundation while trying to revolutionize the industry and satisfy investors. The turning of any ship this large is slow, but I believe once it’s turned and the business is established then it will flourish. Mind you, this company was a Fortune 500 company before.

Based on your OP I think you yolo like I do lol which is a very dominant % invested the smart way and then some side money actively invested in individual stocks. In the past month I took a bunch of profits and invested or added to four plays. I like them but do your own dd. This is not financial advice.\n\nMandiant MNDT- One of the few cybersecurity stocks without a crazy valuation. Sold off their terrible products division that had 1% growth. What remains had been growing historically at 20-30% but they couldn’t do deals with other products because they had their own. That was gone as of first week of October and have since signed deals with msft and splunk. Their SaaS Helps to automate your cybersecurity monitoring and response. Major lack of cybersecurity experts in the USA atm and this SaaS basically makes your team more efficient and effective. Great financials and growth. Stock tanked after divestiture because wall st didn’t understand the play imo. It was really the smartest move. After stock tanked and they got the money they announced almost half of that money would be spent buying back shares. Insiders also acquired a lot when it pulled back.\n\nHimax HIMX- I’ve been hyping this stock since it pulled back under 11. Started to layer slow then went nuts with it when it hit 10. Taiwanese fabless semi that makes display drivers. Own lots of market share in key verticals. Starting to dominate auto sector. Great comments from continental on their partnership. Amazing financials. Multiple quarters in a row of 20%+ sequential growth and yoy over 75% and yet their trailing pe is 6.14 and forward pe is 4.64. It’s tech growth at value prices. So undervalued one of its chairmen recently announced he was personally buying 10M worth of shares. I went heavy on shares and leaps but wish I would have been more aggressive. \n\nIndie semiconductor INDI - automotive focused fabless semiconductor company. I got lucky on this one. Bought a small amount just above 10 then went crazy with it when it hit low 8s. Their number one money maker atm is the asic that is the brains of car multimedia centers. This asic is in a majority of the CarPlay multimedia centers atm. 2.6B dollar backlog. Each earnings shatters revenue expectations. Looking to be profitable a full year earlier than projected. Have expanded into other profitable verticals.\n\nIf I were to throw that 15gs at one play I’d probably do one of those 3. If you want way higher risk reward than consider the two below.\n\nDraganfly DPRO - Drone company with one of the better market cap to revenue ratios out there that is growing revenue and shrinking losses at a good pace. Has signed some significant deals in the past few months. I think drones are going to be a hot stock sector in 2-4 years so trying to get in early and this is my preferred play. Their recent deal with digital dream labs is huge.reg a+ offering lockup expired at beginning of the month and it sold off hard so even with recent rally it’s still a bargain.\n\nSqueeze SQZ - I’m usually anti biotech mainly because it’s crazy volatile and I’m an electrical engineer so I usually stick to what I know…..semis. Very fascinating technology though. They patented squeezing cells which opens up pores for lack of a better term in the cell wall which they then use to inject genetically modified/coded “stuff” into  (they have different technology platforms that utilize this technology in different ways). In under 24 hours they can code organic material and have it ready to treat a patient. Have multiple ongoing trials in Indi, phase 1, and phase 2.

I feel we will see the Maverick bring in new customers as well, given it's starting price, incredible fuel efficiency, and it's actual and practical utility.\nThe biggest catalyst to SP is of course the transformation of the company, which will take time.  2025 is the longest it will take to get to the next major inflection point (based on expected completion dates for many active projects in the pipeline)....however, all indications are that they are making all the right moves, and that there are opportunities to get there sooner. Transformation is expensive, but Ford has an ace card in the value of their Rivian shares... If they need a billion, they don't need to take on more debt, they just cash in some of the chips.\nI think we will see more partnerships announced and innovations, and spending on tech stacks and filling gaps in supply chain over the coming months, and this will further legitimize the transformation and potential.  This will continue to push the SP up as the market starts to look further into the future and less near term (increase valuation multiplier).\nIt's like getting in at the early stages of an EV giant in the making.

Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges, of any type, in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin *AND* all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. For now, COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict but they are rapidly diversifying their revenue streams (NFT marketplace, custody agent for Facebook's crypto wallet, starting a media arm, etc). Another advantage of COIN is it being the first crypto exchange coming on to a major market exhange is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value. \n\nAs far as the criticism of Coinbase’s business model being eroded by other competitor entrants, COIN isn’t the same as a traditional exchange or broker, whose services are easier to duplicate. Coinbase has more comprehensive services, from custody to exchange to brokerage, and its fees take this larger suite of services into account. Handling cryptocurrencies is much trickier than holding stocks, given that crypto has a history of being hacked or lost.

Not that they won’t profit, but I think they’re up so high comparatively that exponential growth is less likely. Which brings me to my first area of interest: raw materials. The way I see it, you can’t build technology without the necessary elements (literally) and we have a finite quantity of those on earth. So my first thought is to invest in suppliers of natural materials needed for electronics, particularly those that are less common. \n\nMy other thought is to go for medicine/scientific research. People will always get sick. Research will evolve, so will pathogens, and the cycle will continue. I find mushroom-derived therapies very intriguing, as they’ve shown success where other treatments have failed. The likelihood of small therapeutic doses combined with fungi being decomposers makes me feel like overhead for a company producing these types of therapeutics would be small, leaving plenty of room for profit margins, regardless of what happens with healthcare. There are also some biotech companies that provide products that are heavily used or superior that I think will continue to profit but they have less room for exponential growth or aren’t publicly traded. \n\nI haven’t done enough due diligence and don’t quite understand enough yet to comprehend all the stats and suggest a single stock but I think some of the “next big things” will come out of those two areas.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "microsoft", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "NVDA", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "(Tellurian) TELL, but maybe wait till FID is announced.

Once Elon is done selling and the new factories start deliveries, the risk of hitting $750 will be very minimal. \n\nAt this point I’m just trying to get as many shares as possible because once these new factories ramp and 4680 ramp and CyberTruck ramp and so on, TSLA is only going to continue growing and the higher it goes the less I have to worry about margin maintenance.

If they submit before the end of the year (possible not guaranteed), there’s a 30 day delay. Then the FDA starts reviewing the application.
