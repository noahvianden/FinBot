RoboTaxi will completly reshape the way people use transportation. Tesla aims to make it $1 a mile. That's insane. It dramatically increases the amount of people that will be using it. Want to go to a bar 3 miles away AND get back home for $6? A friend's party (where nobody has to be sober before or after) 4 miles away and just spend $8 round trip? Want to go to a grocery store a mile away for $2 round trip? We are talking Bus prices without waiting for a bus that comes every hour OR bus stops... And that runs 24/7. Many low income people will find it cheaper to RoboTaxi around then actually pay monthly gas/insurance costs... Let alone car payment/maintenance. It doesn't just take market from Lyft/Uber/Bus... It actually creates a brand new market due to how cheap it is. \n\nI could come up with hundreds of new implementations for this new market... But I think my favorite is a host of a social gathering and I offer to pay for all transport both ways. Say I want 6 friends over, from 4 households, 1/2/3/4 miles away. That would cost about $100 total before tip. With RoboTaxi, that's $20. I would never spend $100 just on transport to have my friends safely over at no cost to them for a drunken game/movie night. I would absolutely spend $20 on it. I would do that weekly without hesitation.\n\nMusk has been saying that one of the huge reasons we need the Boring tunnels and to increase highway capacity is that RoboTaxi is going to change the way people transport, but that means adding EVs to the road. Tesla will make 20 cents a mile off every RoboTaxi they don't own, but many like Cathy Wood believe when RoboTaxi is online Tesla will make EVs just for RoboTaxi. It's estimated that a RoboTaxi will make 20k-40k a year for it's owner. Let's call it 30k for easy math. \n\nTesla plans to produce 20m EVs by 2030, if that is max capacity... There will be 100m Tesla's on the road by 2033. Let's say Tesla owns 20m of these for RoboTaxi, and another 20m private people allow their Tesla's to be used for RoboTaxi.\n\n20m times 30k is 600b. Add another 20 percent for the 20m private owners, and that's 720b a year... Just in robotaxi income. That's ignoring EV sales, FSD purchase/subscription, and Tesla insurance.  At a 10T valuation, that puts Tesla at a p/e of 14.

The $800 Jan 2024 calls have a breakeven of $1288 on expiration, in January 2024.\n\nIf $TSLA went up to $1288 next week, your option contract would be worth way more than it'll be worth on expiration date with the same stock price $1288. This is due to something known as \"extrinsic value\". Every option has intrinsic value and extrinsic value. The extrinsic value of an option is solely based on the time left on the contract (and volatility etc) (also known as the premium on the contract). The intrinsic value is the rest of value of the contract. If you have a call contract and the stock price is below the strike of the call, the value of the contract is completely extrinsic as the option is not in the money. On the opposite end, deep in the money contracts are almost all intrinsic value and very little extrinsic.\n\nYou will notice on the Jan 2024 deep ITM call contracts that the breakeven is not the strike price you chose, that's because there's still plenty of time for the option to go either way, thus giving the contract a premium. As you get closer and closer to expiration, the premium on the contract will slowly decrease (theta), and eventually become 0 on day of expiration (or sooner if it's very deep OTM or very deep ITM).\n\nWith all that being said, you don't need to sell a call above your breakeven because your long option has tons of time left on it.

{"title": "NVAX - Lambo or Ramen (Part II)", "selftext": "Here's a link to my part I - [LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qezyzx/nvax_the_vaccine_play_so_bad_it_might_just_work/)\n\nA few months ago, a Politico hit piece took this stock from roughly 260, down to as low as 120 almost over night. This created an excellent buying opportunity and I was able to load up on calls and cash in on these over the last couple of weeks.\n\nWithout a doubt, the article was used by a short fund (maybe multiple funds) to crash the price and cash in on their short position. The article cited \"anonymous\" sources within the FDA, stating that NVAX was incapable of producing their vaccine at scale. The company refuted the claims and shortly thereafter, they filed for EUA in multiple countries.\n\nI'm sure there was some truth to the article, but it was clearly overblown as the company has filed for EUA across the world and has already been approved in multiple countries, including the EU and by the WHO, which gives them access to several dozen countries. As their CEO stated, \"you don't filed for EUAs, unless you have solved all your manufacturing problems.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this week, we saw WHO and EU approvals roll in only to see the price peak up to 245 (pre-market) Monday, then fall the rest of the week, all the way down to a close of 177 yesterday. Again, this created another great buying opportunity, as the stock is currently trading as less than 2x 2022 earnings. I believe average in bio-tech is roughly 7-8x.\n\nIf it's so great, why did it crash this week? I think there are 3 reasons.\n\n1. Profit takers. I think a lot of people got in on this when it was trading around 130-150, knowing approval was almost guaranteed (in at 130, out at 230 for a nice $100/share profit in a couple of weeks).\n2. Vaccine sector beat down. A lot of vaccine stocks, and other stocks with high valuations have been getting beaten down in recent weeks. For example, MRNA is down 50% from it's peak in August.\n3. Short selling. It's obvious that NVAX is no fan of Wall Street. It's current short interest is reported at over 10%, according to Fintel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe short sellers took advantage of ideal market conditions, to drive this stock down on positive news. Look at these comparison graphs of MRNA and NVAX, to give you an idea of how manipulated these low float stocks can be. One of these stocks had great news with WHO/EU approval and positive immune results from the Omicron COVID stain:\n\n[NVAX Chart](https://preview.redd.it/078d9tcmtj781.jpg?width=755&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=515155ca4f9997fe99d99a018b183b7325818c76)\n\nThe other stock had poor results with the Omicron stain and is extremely overvalued.\n\n[MRNA Chart](https://preview.redd.it/0r1zo7jptj781.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09fa27be874cbd14aef349cc76d0c2abfd950c5b)\n\nBad news, if you bought in PM Monday morning. However, good news if you had no position in NVAX previously.\n\nI believe this is going to yo-yo back up well over 200 early next week, as they are set to file with the FDA for EUA before Friday (as stated multiple times by the company this week and previously).\n\nMy current position:\n\n* NVAX 1/7/21 200c (100)\n* NVAX 1/21/21 200c (25)\n* NVAX 1/7/21 250c (40)\n* NVAX 2/18/21 250c (20)\n* NVAX 4/14/21 300c (10)\n\nFair warning, these options are expensive and risky. Don't play unless you enjoy pain. A more conservative (ie smarter) route is to buy shares and sell covered calls around the 250-300 strike price. If the stock doesn't moon, you'll collect big time premiums. If it does, fuck it, you doubled your money in a couple of weeks.\n\n**TL;DR - I believe strongly that NVAX will rebound next week due to FDA EUA filing.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo expand on the FDA filing a little. I believe we will see the filing Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning. I think this gives them the most headlines. I believe they had their paperwork ready this week, but held out for their Omicron data to come out. That's why their CEO kept saying \"within a few days.\" They finally released their data Wednesday afternoon, which didn't give them enough time to file Thursday morning. For them to file Thursday afternoon or over the weekend would have totally wasted a golden PR opportunity.\n\nYou can see Stan's wry smile when the reporter asked if it was going to be this week (Thursday) or next week - [https://finance.yahoo.com/video/novavax-ceo-fda-filing-covid-143049344.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/novavax-ceo-fda-filing-covid-143049344.html)\n\nI am also 95% sure they will include their US manufacturing (not just SII). I believe the FDA is requiring this, which caused the extra delay.\n\nThe reason this is important is because this proves that they are able to globally manufacture their vaccine at scale, and it also give them higher margins for the doses they sell. This is currently the last bear case for the stock - they have a great vaccine, but they can't manufacture at scale and the only doses that they will be able to sell are low margin ones via SII.\n\nIf they do include US manufacturing in their filing next week, I'm pretty confident this will add 25-50% to their SP within 2-3 days.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "rnobqt", "created_utc": 1640359110.0, "score": 168, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 115, "comments": [{"body": "I had traded nvax in early 2017.

If they aren't coming in, the approvals don't mean anything, but I am sure there is still enough demand for vaccines. \n\nCOVID is also going to be endemic sooner or later which makes the stock less risky. Especially since Novavax's vaccine has a low production cost and the vaccine can be adapted just as fast as the mRNA vaccines. It's therefore going to be very competitive despite the rather late approvals.\n\nI am curious though on whether or not the Q4 report is going to include the announced orders already or if they will include them in Q1 2022.\n\nEither way, any order, like the order from the EU, will already represent a big chunk of its current market cap. \n\nMarket cap is currently at 13 billion\nEU ordered 100 million doses.\n\nWith a conservative $10 per dosis that one order (with an option of another 100 million doses) can make up 1/13 of the company's market cap which is nuts if you think about the potential there still is.\n\nWhether or not we see another ath is a different question though.

What a joke.\n\nTesla's margins are looking to improve as well thanks to 1 piece casting of the front of cars as well, the structural battery pack, and the 4680 cell form factor, and their own 4680 cells with inhouse developed chemistries, to name a few things.\n\nLet's not forget they own the largest super charging network in the world that they keep expanding and will open up to other brands in the future. Lots of revenue there.\n\nAlso let's not forget Tesla's in-house designed super computer.

But if it's always going up, we're bound to inflation. So there must be two ways to make profits. Short strategy was legalized in 1937. But there's a catch. You can only short when the price goes up. You cannot short if the stock price keeps diving, the mechanism that allows to protect company potential and excessive speculation. But we know that over time, it disappears and shorting can be done indefinitely. \n\nIn a theory of energy conservation, there's only a constant energy but the energy transforms. If the market is limited with those brokers and market makers, if someone makes a profit, there must be others who lost their money. It's the conservation of money supply in the market. However in order to attract external investment or (DCA for retailer), market makers need to give a little sometimes back to retailers. So retailers or some call it retards here in wsb dump their hourly wages or salary to the market. \n\nIf there's a supply, there must be someone raking up those supplies. In a well known case that Goldman Sachs, one of the big IBs always make profits 85% of the time consistently. Remember GS is also one of the market makers (MM). If the economy is down, GS will still make profit. How so? It's because of 2 ways streets that were created even before our grandparents were born, i.e., Shorting. \n\nIn 21st century, retailers can easily invest at the tip of their fingers and all the information available in web. What is the advantages that those MM can wield to make profit? \n\nTraditionally, if the company can make $1 per outstanding share, their share is only worth at $1 (Simply saying). Whoever likes to pay more than $1 is banking on the potential of the company profits down the road and profitability of the company in the near future. So PE ratio gets inflated over time. \n\nIf the PE ratio is set in stone, retailers have the advantage over MMs or those IBs. One the ratio hits 20, retailers can stop buying shares. But in reality it is not. By making the PE ratio varies between different companies and in different times, MMs hold the ultimate power over retailers when to screw those retards and when to give them a little so that their DCA will keep coming into the market. \n\nThat's how IBs, got rich. There's nothing sophisticated about ultra intelligent bankers. They produce nothing. They just create a wave, the wave that most of the retailers cannot predict and only insiders know when to dump, i.e., short or hold the stock. \n\nThe rest are just for entertainment purpose, such as price target. Yes, when they want to pump the stock, all IBs, GS, Morgan Stanley, BoA, etc raised the PT so that retailers can be hopeful. Once the PT is reached, dump. \n\nOf course, you'd wonder when they'd be dumping once the price hits the ATH (All time high)? It's the insider tactics. That's why I said earlier, when I talked about this, no one likes to hear it. \n\nWhat does it to do with TSLA. TSLA is another tulip mania in the US. \n\nTo make it short, in order to pump money into something, you need some tangible entity. US keeps complaining about China this and China that, but in reality China is the biggest economy and MADE in CHINA is more common in your home and mine than our official name printed in our houses. \n\nSo MM cannot pump their forever darlings stock when in reality those stocks might represents nothing but a piece of paper, eg, Hertz. So they need some darling stocks and TSLA represents a good one. \n\nYou know why? SpaceX has a deal with US military. So there's a green light to pump TSLA and include it in SPX within a short span of time. Of course those happens only after Elon SpaceX successfully launched. Otherwise, TSLA will forever be under water. \n\nOf course, you can say this is all pure fantasy or conspiracy. \n\nWe all know why Pelosi bought deep ITM TSLA calls way back. \n\nAnyway....", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You need to understand Investing is about speculating the future not now .\nTesla just started , they can build a whole lot in the ecosystem to make money .

{"title": "China's Currency Trouble.", "selftext": "The Chinese Yuan is a volatile currency and they are highly likely to miss their inflation targets and runaway inflation is a very real possibility.\n\nThe trouble starts with China's distorted economic and demographic data. You will notice that China recorded steady population growth even when the one-child policy was in force. This can be explained away by how some people paid fines for each new child, others used \"birth tourism\" by traveling abroad when pregnant, some abused exceptions made in some localities, and others had their children in secret. However, this does not fully explain the continued population growth as there were still many forced abortions, there's a massive gender skew as families with only one kid prefer a boy who can take care of them when they are old, and many multi-generation families rely on one kid for all their fortunes.\n\nThe answer lies in the perverse incentives inside China's highly competitive hierarchy. Unlike most countries, internal allotment of resources is top down organized with the bulk of government resources going to handfuls of places judged strategically significant. One of the gauges used are rapidly urbanizing areas.\n\nHow the data is falsified is another matter. Much of China's population are migrant workers and Chinese people have provincial citizenship that is as vital as their national citizenship. Many of these are farmers that take temp jobs in the cities, while others simply work far from home and visit family only on the weekends, and yet more have migrated internally but the residency transfer costs money and is long and tedious. BUT you can be sure both local governments will count that person as a full time resident.\n\nThe means, motive, and opportunity to straight up fabricate population data is certainly there, but I am not aware of anyone getting busted for that... Yet.\n\nThe GDP data is likewise skewed, as China's officials are given bonuses, promotions, demotions, and even jail terms based solely on economic data. This highly perverse incentive means men will hide economic problems and there's no real secret about it. However, many creative means of boosting numbers regardless if it makes sense. For instance, some industries boost GDP numbers more than others, and the GDP only measures what it was SOLD for, not it's actual utility or worth.\n\nIn a more or less typical case, local officials may give construction contracts to firms owned by relatives or the lowest bidder. These builders fund themselves by preselling the houses. Construction is quick and cheap, and officials incentivize buying a house (often by making it a prerequisite for transferring residency). Since most local government revenue is from land leases and fees, this becomes very profitable for both the local government and the bosses REGARDLESS IF THE HOUSES COLLAPSE IN A SHORT TIME.\n\nThere's a lot more to this, but one of the reasons China's Housing Bubble was so inflated is due to Chinese officials boosting their GDP numbers. Other schemes involve fake/broken/shoddy green energy installations. A few officials have been busted for straight up fabricating GDP growth. This process is repeated at every level of government, so the numbers at the top have no bearing on reality. Important note is official GDP numbers record twice the yearly growth that tax revenues and stock index returns shown. But you can be sure the GDP will not only be presented as gospel truth but will be advertised all over as the reason to invest only in Chinese.\n\nThis fake GDP data makes their central bank's job very difficult. The People's Bank of China (PBC) once complained the zealous efforts to boost the economy. Gauging how much Yuan must be printed on a given day requires guesswork, and over the past decade the Yuan has increasing volatility with both short and mid term swings.\n\nBut perhaps worse is the very recent corruption bust of an executive from China's money printing company. Little is known about his crime other than he was arrested for \"corruption.\" The implications of this bust are potentially huge, as individual Chinese bankers comment how a corrupt money printer could simply have two printers, one for himself and one for the government, and use the same serial numbers for both. These \"fake real bills\" would simply be impossible to detect even by banks with machines counting serial numbers.\n\nCounterfeit money is a major problem all over the world and in China many large and sophisticated counterfeit schemes have been busted. This scheme, however, enables a limited number of people to access literally unlimited funds.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that corrupt officials heavily prefer cash and personal items/favors that are easy to keep off books and spending the money is just as dangerous as getting it. China's largest corruption bust involved one official was found to have literally THREE TONS of cash. Another lady had a secret apartment full of luxury goods she was given but she couldn't be seen in public wearing. Another official became known as \"comrade wristwatch\" because he was constantly being seen wearing different rolex he couldn't afford. In all cases the guys at the center of corrupt scheme had money they could not risk spending in public.\n\nI bring this up because the fake bills wouldn't have an immediate inflationary effect. Bricks of cash would change hands and sit in hiding places for a long time before getting to the open market. There is no illusion anywhere in China that the full extent of whatever corruption exists will be exposed. The suspects will confess to a minimal amount of crimes to evade punishment and the government would publish a minimal number of convictions to prevent panic.\n\nWe can also see the Chinese censors have exact same concerns as the general public as normally they remove posts and news articles concerning scandals within the Communist party. However, counterfeit money effects all of China equally. This mostly effects China itself as there are major restrictions on how much Yuan can be moved out of China.\n\nBut to be fair, it is not currently known whether or not there was fake real bills going on. In fact, the inciting news was only a few sentences long, but as one Chinese netizen said \"The shorter the article, the more important the news.\"\n\nAll this is very important to those of you invested in Chinese stocks, as we all know when weird stuff happens to currency it tends to go down. Sometimes very explosively. In any case, the PBC is going to struggle to maintain inflation targets even if things aren't as bad as I fear they are.\n\nDisclosure: I'm short CNH/JPY.", "id": "rnw9a8", "created_utc": 1640384572.0, "score": 203, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 209, "comments": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)Two printers))) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4641)", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "Two printers everyone knows the rules", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Where should I stick my toner cartridge?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If one printer going Brrr stimulates the US economy imagine what 2 printers going Brrr Brrr will do.
