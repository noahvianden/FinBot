I've seen some good videos on retirement planning that point out you want to have a good balance of investments that include those that won't impact your AGI (like a traditional 401(k)/IRA disbursement would) until you opt to start receiving your social security checks. This isn't just for your tax bracket, but also where you qualify for affordable healthcare. Taking too much of your living expenses from traditional (also known as qualified investments) can end up costing you thousands of your nest egg just in health insurance if in the US.\n\nAdditionally, provisions in the build back better plan eliminates the ability to rollover from a qualified to non-qualified investment (back door Roth) for all income and wealth levels. This means that where before you could have a controlled income level to report (moving a fixed amount over to still allow you to qualify for affordable care or contribute to your Roth IRA pre-retirement, but below the MAGI cutoff), now you have no way to move the money over and will eventually have to use the required minimum distribution, which could accelerate the burn rate on your nest egg depending on health care costs.\n\nAn example of income provisions can be seen in my mom's prescription for Eliquis. She is on a fixed income and their nest egg is getting smaller. She is applying to get a 90% discount on the pills based on her AGI. Without this, the monthly dosage she needs costs $500 per month just for the one medication.

Or if it goes down it might go down to A.

One of the hardest tasks for an autonomous vehicle is to translate the world from a 2D inputs into 3D. Our brain does this using a combination of evolved brain structure and learning in the world. What those examples show is that our brain isn't perfect, and likely uses 'shorthand cheats' to determine the mapping from 2D to 3D.\n\nWe infer the 3D geometry from the shapes of objects in the world, rather than some inherent 3D data input. The point is that humans learned over time to determine the 3D world state from two 2D inputs. The data to create an algorithm to go from 2D to 3D is in the 2D data space. Humans prove this to be the case. It's just a question of how sophisticated are our synthetic eyes/brains versus the organic ones. This will be the sole determinant of whether we solve autonomy next year, or in 30 years.\n\nThe failure modes of each system will be unique to that system. Humans fail because of lack of attention not comprehension, computers are the opposite. Most people will reason as to why the car failed from a human perspective. This leads them to the wrong conclusions about the progress of the system. This is quite evident even in the FSD Beta drivers like Chuck or others. They are evaluating the performance of the system on human tasks of driving, i.e. can it go from here to there without being annoying. People think that doing X task is easy for them, but the computer can't do it, so it will never be able to do it. Can the human drive for 5 hours without losing concentration once? Can a human see in all 4 directions at once? Can a human respond in 50ms? \n\nAnother point is that people think that if you reach a mid-point to autonomy, that means you're further ahead to the endpoint. That is not at all how the software works, and actually, pushing a product into production before it's ready will burden you with technical debt that will ruin the long term value of your code base.\n\nOne example is the recent Daimler Level 3 on the Autobahn (at less than 37mph). If Daimler was ahead of Tesla they would have a system like Tesla on all their cars. The fact that Daimler is focussing so hard on making a Level 3 highway system, even considering their autopilot isn't anywhere near as good as Tesla's, makes me think they are 'hard coding' it, i.e forcing a product out by writing jank code. They are delaying the arrival of level 5 by working on level 3. This is likely why Tesla hasn't put any effort into a level 3/4 system. It's a distraction from the end-goal of true level 5.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting, my personal perception has been that the actual vision aspect of translating the 2D image into 3D space is the most refined aspect of FSD right now.

The name probably leaked out and people have been calling the whole pilot plant the \"roadrunner plant\" or calling them \"roadrunner\" batteries. But I think there's really at least three parts:\n\n* The battery design. This is the new 4680s, it's a bigger size that's \"tabless\", and it's also got a lot of improvements in chemistry and manufacturing. Although I suspect another company could make a 4680 sized cell that uses all their same old manufacturing lines and chemistry, but they'd probably have to use the tabless design to make it work with the bigger cell.\n* The pilot line. It seems like Tesla made a lot of changes to the way their new cells are assembled, and were also getting things like the dry electrode process to work. This first line was proving out that all these different steps were possible and they could all work together and just ironing out the problems\n* The roadrunner line. I believe this is a second line that's designed to go much faster (hence the name). Once they'd got all the basic steps figured out, they had to speed things up to find the new problems and bottlenecks and fix those. This is also the point where they start making enough cells to actually start putting them in cars. For example, it seems like the roadrunner line(s) at the Kato rd facility might be enough to support the initial ramp up of the Model Y at giga-texas\n\nAnd then on top of all that, there's the structural pack. I'm not sure if they could make structural packs out of 2170 cells or not? It might be possible? Or it might be that the 4680 was designed from the beginning to go in structural packs, so its casing or cooling or something was designed differently? But it seems like it would be totally possible to put 4680s in a non-structural pack. And it seems likely that overtime the EV industry will adopt the 4680 as a standard size and there will probably be some EV makers that don't use structural packs but still use that size.

{"title": "Chewy ($CHWY) DD and 50k put YOLO", "selftext": "Another day, another earnings report. Today we look at Chewy, an ecommerce retailer of pet food, toys, and budding insurance/veterinary service provider. 3 months ago I wrote a DD about their last earnings. Today we deal with their Q3 earnings report, covering August – October 2021. Last quarter, they guided for USD 2.20-2.22 bn in revenue (23-25% yearly growth, 2.3% quarterly growth) and USD 8.9-9.0 in annual revenue (implying Q4 guidance of USD 2.44bn at the midpoints).\n\nAfter they reiterated annual guidance on the last call despite disappointing customer numbers, I think there is a good chance that they will fall short this time and have to slightly cut Q4 and annual guidance.\n\nChewy is a high-flying Covid stock that is down almost exactly 50% from its all time high. Some level of deceleration is clearly priced in, which is a risk for this play. However I believe their earnings report might disappoint for a couple of reasons.\n\n**App downloads and customer numbers**\n\nThe biggest and most obvious problem Chewy is facing is their newly added customers. Last quarters additions of 300k fell well short of expectation. Chewy is currently facing a cliff, as they added more customers than ever all throughout 2020. Their comp for this quarter is 1.2 million, slightly less than the 1.6 million they compared to last quarter, but still a very impressive number. As many customers churn around the 1-year mark, they might have problems adding enough gross customers to offset their churn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6eqapza27j481.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=036c26638f5f8feec13bd85a983a0d3dfd1ea4e2\n\nOne indication for this is the decline in their app rankings, both on iOS and Android. Apps are commonly (not always) downloaded by NEW customers, so they are a decent proxy for new customer additions. For both platforms, rankings are much lower than they have been since early 2019. There is a particularly pronounced drop on Android, starting around August 1 this year and extending until the current day (even though there was a small recovery). Android is a comparatively important platform for Chewy: while iOS is more popular overall in the USA, Chewy has an approximately equal number of downloads between the two platforms.\n\n[Sensortower](https://preview.redd.it/ucer6v647j481.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4ef4e5903ecf8a4c7a94e61bc55a5396f6be9d6)\n\n[Sensortower](https://preview.redd.it/ich6xc067j481.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=3aaf2164386fb1b6fb254ae1805e4989125597be)\n\nNote: Android chart shows overall ranking, iOS chart shows ranking in the Shopping category\n\n**Google Trends**\n\nGoogle search trends for Chewy also aren’t looking too positive. I’m comparing them here to Peloton, and showing how much each week’s search index dropped compared to the same week last year. Chewy was relatively strong during the summer (a time when Peloton was naturally weak), but has softened a lot going into fall and winter, and is about 20% below last year’s search volume.\n\n[Google Trends](https://preview.redd.it/5s4w9bz77j481.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=89f3dfd7a3520d3abbc2bdc337c3c97456c4e89b)\n\n**Pet adoption trend ending**\n\nAdopting pets was a huge trend when the covid pandemic started last year. Some covid trends are sustainable, others are not. Unsurprisingly, Chewy falls into the latter category: if you already adopted a dog or cat last year, as adorable as they are, you’re probably not rushing out to get the next one immediately. Demand was pulled forward, but not extended. Google search trends for “dog adoption” and “cat adoption” (and other related terms, not shown here) are weak and in fact lower than they have ever been in the past 5 years (to be precise, searches for these terms are at their lowest since 2010).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Google Trends](https://preview.redd.it/ww75mekrpj481.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=be25c8bb7312e0228ac367866f051aa4a047d6b3)\n\n[Similarweb](https://preview.redd.it/rxwjrpxc7j481.png?width=653&format=png&auto=webp&s=14c638f0bc5d174d07063d4df758bd4000712db0)\n\nWebsite visits to the biggest USA-wide pet adoption sites are also down significantly in the past months. While some seasonal difference is to be expected going into the winter (in a regular year, adoptions peak in July/August and drop by about 10% by November/December), the decline in search traffic this year is more pronounced than that.\n\n**Website visits**\n\nThe one counterpoint to the above is website visits to Chewy, which are looking solid if not spectacular. As expected there is a solid uptick in November as people prepare to buy their pets Christmas gifts. While Chewy is ahead in the ecommerce game of their main competitors Petco and Petsmart, their share of website visits has actually remained extremely stable since February this year. I think this is actually a somewhat negative sign for Chewy, as they are valued much higher than competitors since they were supposed to take business away from traditional retailers. To me this chart implies that competitors are catching on and Chewy isn’t taking as much business as they used to.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwetzj1f7j481.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b9dfa8d1bde97446ee19a6bdf48b6e3672044d3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/912q8gpg7j481.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=f805459330a6d3250aa13e64822f36550f302a5f\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** In the last week of November, all three websites saw significant upticks in their website views, which is a bit hard to see precisely in the chart above. As a full disclosure, visits to Chewy jumped 36% compared to the previous week. Visits to Petco increased 30%, Petsmart increased by 31%.\n\n**Positions**\n\nPuts at strike 60, expiring this week. I also own additional puts expiring next week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09ie724o7j481.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd076f6b38b7543e1e6a3194f44c9fa211de99fd\n\n**Summary**\n\nChewy stock has been punished quite a lot already but I think there’s a bit more room to drop. Management was pretty upbeat on the last call, which could lead to disappointment among analysts if numbers suddenly look worse this quarter (as I expect they will).\n\nOn the other hand, there are 1-2 bright spots in Chewy’s numbers – website views look solid, they have done very well at converting people to Autoship, and their ARPU is rising steadily and extremely impressive. All this may contribute to a positive earnings report. The stock has also bounced off the USD 60 mark quite a lot (even going back to last year), so there’s a risk it doesn’t drop too much if numbers are somewhat satisfying. IV is also relatively high around 7-8%.

{"title": "$SLDP - Solid Power - Powering next gen EVs and your portfolio", "selftext": "**Why have I not heard of this ticker before?** This was previously a SPAC that merged today and so is now a “real stock”. \n\n**Don’t most SPACs suck?** Yes, most deSPACs suck but the ones that don’t like DKNG, QS, LCID have huge upside.\n\n**Why is this different?** There are only two public companies working on the next generation of solid state batteries to power future EVs and other tech; Quantumscape ($QS) and Solid Power. Solid Power went public at a very attractive price putting it at about 1/5th the valuation of Quantumscape.\n\n**What exactly are Solid Power’s selling points?**\n\nSolid Power is making a “New Breed of Battery”, namely solid state batteries, primarily for Electric Vehicles (“EVs”). They have been in R&D mode for the last 8 years, are now ramping towards production, and will be the first to commercial production using existing lithium battery manufacturing facilities. \n\nThe advantages of moving to solid state batteries are many but some main ones include:\n\n* Double the range of current batteries\n* More than double the life of current batteries\n* Non-volatile (they don’t catch on fire during accidents like current batteries)\n* Cheaper to manufacture at scale\n* Their batteries do not use Cobalt which is currently being cornered by aggressive Chinese acquisitions\n\nWhat is even more exciting are their partners and investors\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fdz3gybqkj481.jpg?width=1204&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac8e84845d0fbba11b2185abd885cf539fad151e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFord has committed to a joint venture with Solid Power and plans to eventually incorporate their batteries into its EVs. Ford is projecting that it will be producing 600,000 EVs by 2023 (Source: [https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ford-plans-to-increase-ev-production-to-600000-vehicles-by-2023/ar-AAQSlV5](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ford-plans-to-increase-ev-production-to-600000-vehicles-by-2023/ar-AAQSlV5)) making Ford the second largest EV producer after Tesla.\n\nBMW may also soon be a completely electric vehicle company with Germany planning to phase out all petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030 (Source: [https://www.lifegate.com/germany-electric-cars](https://www.lifegate.com/germany-electric-cars))\n\n**Does the government have some involvement here?**\n\nGlad you asked. It's not only the private sector that loves Solid Power. Solid Power was spun out of a DARPA project and the government really wants this tech ASAP to counter Chinese control of the battery market. As such the U.S government has given them multiple grants and contracts going back to 2013 to fund their R&D in the hopes of incorporating solid state batteries into future defense and space systems (Source: [https://govtribe.com/vendors/solid-power-inc-dot-6lyk5#related-federal-contract-awards-table](https://govtribe.com/vendors/solid-power-inc-dot-6lyk5#related-federal-contract-awards-table)). The new infrastructure bill also includes $6 billion allocated towards battery infrastructure which is a potential pot of money Solid Power can access to turbo boost their R&D.\n\n**Why is Everyone Excited About Batteries?**\n\nMorgan Stanley has said that “Batteries Are the New Oil” and with our rapidly approaching electric future I can’t help but agree. As more and more of our infrastructure runs off batteries the companies that control this resource will be the new providers of energy in the future replacing the Exxons and BPs of today. The EV market has a TAM of $300B at 50% penetration and $600B at 100% EV penetration as projected to take place in 2035. The most exciting of these companies and the one with the most advanced technology, in my opinion, is Solid Power and we have a real gift being handed to us here being able to get into this thing early and on the ground floor of the future here. Solid Power is already lined up to provide the batteries for future EVs from Ford and BMW as well as the major Korean brands via it’s joint venture with SK (more on that later).\n\n**How does Solid Power compare to the competition** \n\nThe company that most people are aware of in this space since it went public first is of course Quantumscape ($QS). There are two ways to compare Quantumscape and Solid Power, first by their respective technologies and second by how they are currently trading in the market and by both these measures Solid Power is a clear winner.\n\n* Quantumscape only tested their batteries to 800 cycles, while Solid Power tested theirs to 1000, and at 45 degrees Celsius as opposed to Quantumscape’s 25 degrees Celsius while maintaining >80% capacity retention.\n* Solid Power has recorded 650 cycles with a 2C-rate fast charge occurring during every fifth cycle in near room-temperature conditions, whereas most of Quantumscape’s published numbers were only performed at <=1C rates, suggesting that Solid Power batteries are more efficient at quick-charging, as much as twice as efficient. Quick charging is a huge requirement for battery technology.\n* Quantumscape is struggling with at-scale production and rollout strategies, whereas Solid Power is going to market with those problems solved and partners in place to hit the ground running. Solid Power will have its batteries in Ford EVs in 2022 for initial testing.\n\nThe nice thing about Quantumscape going public first is it gives us a look at how receptive the market is to a solid state battery play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jzy56gapkj481.jpg?width=1240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d08d5d01f7c612f37f2147a2e0e14f42714d9b76\n\nI made this chart prior to the merger and am too lazy to update it but as you can see we are following it nicely.\n\nAs we can see from the $QS chart it also meandered along around $12 going into merger before rocketing to a high of $114.77 and then eventually settling in the $20 - $40 range.\n\nSolid Power is going public at a pro-forma enterprise value of $1.2B at $10 per share. That means that $QS post merger valuation is trading at a 10x premium to $SLDP pre-merger and some simple math would then tell us that for $SLDP to trade at market cap parity to $QS the stock would need to rise to **$100 per share, a 10x return** from its merger price. \n\nAnother major competitor to Solid Power is SK Innovation, the battery manufacturing arm of Korean conglomerate SK and the world’s 4th largest battery manufacturer. SK Innovations, however, signed a joint development agreement with Solid Power in October whereby Solid Power will help SK Innovation develop solid state batteries for the Asian market. SK will invest $30 million into Solid Power as well as paying them a licensing fee on all their batteries and they expect this joint venture to cut their solid state battery launch window by 2 years.\n\nSK saw the writing on the wall, that Solid Power is way ahead of the pack and if they want to stay competitive they needed to get access to their R&D.\n\nSK is investing $2.6B in a battery factory in Georgia to build NCM batteries for the initial run of Ford F-150 pickup trucks but you can bet this factory will be designed so that it can easily swap to manufacturing Solid Power’s solid state batteries as soon as they are ready to go to market. Solid Power gets a fat royalty on every battery sold while SK fronts all the capital. I think this is an excellent business strategy by Solid Power versus Qunatumscape trying to do everything themselves. (Source: [https://insideevs.com/news/508616/ford-skinnovation-battery-jv-blueovalsk/](https://insideevs.com/news/508616/ford-skinnovation-battery-jv-blueovalsk/))\n\nThe final major competitors in this space are LG Energy Solutions and Samsung SDI Co., but without access to Solid State’s technology they are not expected to have commercial solid state batteries available on the market until 2027-2030. \n\n**What is the Bear Case?**\n\nI am obviously bullish on this company but no investment is without risks. While Solid Power has so far met all its milestones they are still a year out from initial production and 2 years from large scale commercial deliveries. As with any pre-revenue play these timelines could slip and everything could get pushed farther out leaving you to hold this for longer than you may have hoped for. They may also have issues like many manufacturers do (\\*cough Tesla\\*) ramping up production as fast as they hope.\n\n**Position and Disclaimers:**\n\nI have an economic interest in the success of Solid Power. I am currently long 12,000 commons and 20,000 warrants.\n\n**TL;DR: Solid Power has amazing potential with solid partners and tech. PT $30 low case, $81 midcase, $120 high case**\n\n**References:**\n\nSolid Power Investor Presentation: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844862/000119312521190525/d124653dex993.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1844862/000119312521190525/d124653dex993.htm)\n\nBloomberg Article 10/28/21 SK Targets New EV Battery Technology Two Years Ahead of Rivals:\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-28/sk-innovation-targets-the-year-2025-for-solid-state-batteries](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-28/sk-innovation-targets-the-year-2025-for-solid-state-batteries)\n\nPress Release 10/27/21 Solid Power Partners with SK Innovation to Jointly Produce All-Solid-State Batteries:\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/28/2322267/0/en/Solid-Power-Partners-with-SK-Innovation-to-Jointly-Produce-All-Solid-State-Batteries.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/28/2322267/0/en/Solid-Power-Partners-with-SK-Innovation-to-Jointly-Produce-All-Solid-State-Batteries.html)\n\nSolid Power Federal Contract Awards:\n\n[https://govtribe.com/vendors/solid-power-inc-dot-6lyk5#related-federal-contract-awards-table](https://govtribe.com/vendors/solid-power-inc-dot-6lyk5#related-federal-contract-awards-table)\n\nFord EV projections: [https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ford-plans-to-increase-ev-production-to-600000-vehicles-by-2023/ar-AAQSlV5](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/ford-plans-to-increase-ev-production-to-600000-vehicles-by-2023/ar-AAQSlV5)\n\nGermany all electric by 2030:\n\n[https://www.lifegate.com/germany-electric-cars](https://www.lifegate.com/germany-electric-cars)\n\nSK-Ford battery MOU:\n\n[https://insideevs.com/news/508616/ford-skinnovation-battery-jv-blueovalsk/](https://insideevs.com/news/508616/ford-skinnovation-battery-jv-blueovalsk/)", "id": "rckyt5", "created_utc": 1639066519.0, "score": 284, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "I just love batteries", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Me too but let’s ignore that.

{"title": "FARLEY AND FORD ARE NOT FUCKING AROUND.", "selftext": "First off, I’m in this YOLO straight options (because I want to get rich not invest long term). I posted this in r/stocks, but as you all know they’re a bit pretentious and would rather debate back and forth than actually have the balls to risk on 20% profitability to make half a million dollars. Here is the play I am putting all my eggs in one basket on (as famously said by some douche bag about Tesla in 2019 on WSB). \n\nFord (F). I think we’re several months away from a massive realization that Ford is an EV competitor, but most importantly the potential dominator in a specific EV field: Trucks. With a market cap of 80B I opened a quite aggressive position projecting them to hit 240B by end of 2022. Concept vehicles and speculation drive the EV space with Ford actually having the capacity to do one thing: produce. I’ve consolidated my thesis into 3 major targets. \n\n1. Ford is going to rebrand themselves as a technology company over the next year, they’ve done this with wild statements like getting into semi conductor production, their recent large investment overseas, and just several days ago their pairing with Salesforce, as of today Bill Ford executed 20 million in stock options on Ford. I think Farley and the team recognize that rebranding to a tech company elicits larger valuation beyond being an automaker. \n\n2. Obviously, the F-150 and EV sales. They’ve easily posted YoY doubles in EV sales, the current Mach-E is back ordered and sold out, and Farley announced today that F-150 orders are company capped at 200,000. Meaning they are not actually estimating true pre-order interest as Tesla did with the Cybertruck. Also notably, they’ve launched a new hybrid model of a new smaller truck the Maverick, which is unable to be stocked at dealerships due to demand, and back ordered through 2023. \n\n3. The biggest piece nobody is realizing is Ford supplies the largest adoption of vehicles to the local and federal government. The government has already passed one, and working on the second bill that is designating massive cash to the EV and transportation sector. If you think Ford is not first in-line to access these funds, you’re insane. Additionally Ford EV’s will have access to tax rebates of over 7,000 next year. \n\nFord is going to literally do what Tesla did in 2019, fill the news with monthly reports of how their EV growth month over month, quarter over quarter, is doubling. I’m speculating that competitors as well are not going to be able to transition and offer actual supply to compete until later years, 2023-2024 IF they ever achieve that capacity. Ford and Farley are not fucking around.\n\nPositions (since mod bot keeps fucking deleting them) \n\nF - 20C - JAN 2023\nF - 40C - JAN 2023\nF - 30C - JAN 2024\n\nEdit: my dumb ass forgot what year it was, edited my leap years.", "id": "rcr8bh", "created_utc": 1639083869.0, "score": 171, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 197, "comments": [{"body": "I’m down with the 20 and 30 but not so sure about the 40", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "This is WSB bro, I wasn’t going to DD without a 1/3 of my yolo being extremely OTM options, come on now.", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "True true haha", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Ford makes me depressed :(", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "I’m going to upvote because I don’t know how else to respond to this.", "score": 53, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fords are by far my favorite Mexican made vehicles", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "I’ll probably be driving a Ford Fiesta if this doesn’t pan out.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I would have to sell my fiesta and go back to taping ford logos on my shoes and walking.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Que sueno burracho", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You also forgot that their stake in Rivian is worth like $10 billion, that's like 1/7th their market cap.\n\nBest play is buying 2024 leaps.

I’ve seen a few rivians in person being driven around in San Clemente and besides the “cool new brand” factor which will wear off within the first few months of actual production there isn’t much to be missed.

I think what you're missing is that we both agree the numbers will be very small—like 50k units/year max after a couple years of slow ramping—but that's exactly what they're going for. A startup automaker cannot compete with the Ford F150, it just can't. That's why they have to start with a very high-end demographic with something that's high margin, low volume, and build from there. I have driven a Rivian, and I can tell you it's very well designed and perfectly targeted for its intended buyer. \n\nAnother area where we agree is that they are massively overvalued. They are valued as if they will go head to head with Ford for market leadership in trucks. Ain't gonna happen.

{"title": "There will be no bear market", "selftext": "This is a bold argument I’m going to make, but I’m starting to believe that there will never be a long term bear market like we saw in 2008 or in previous markets. Before 🌈🐻 start commenting please read through my thesis before arguing anything.\n\nFirst, the velocity of money is near an all time low. Here’s a graph from the fed on the velocity of money (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). Velocity is a measure of how many times a dollar changes hands per quarter. Traditionally it’s been well above 1 and sometimes over 2, but nowadays it’s only around 1. This means more people are hoarding cash than ever before because they’re not sure what to invest in. I think because of people’s fears over covid and recessions, they excessively hoard cash which makes the velocity of money so low. \n\nWhy does this matter? Let’s review the quantity theory of money or MV = PQ. For people who can’t do math, money printer go brrr but inflation is not super high because people don’t spend the money. The fed feels comfortable printing money because the velocity of money is so low. If people excessively save and never spend, there won’t be hyperinflation. Therefore I don’t think the fed is ever going to raise interest rates that significantly. \n\nSomeone else pointed out earlier that a record amount of money was put into the market at the last omicron dip— $6.7 billion (https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/investors-buy-the-dip-7-billion-stocks-etfs-omicron-selloff-2021-12?utm_campaign=sf-bi-main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&fbclid=IwAR240epgL9Eb8KrcECzfGfZ-QDVmejAcbrJvCvwNvDTUwfoTa4TuuSRi-1s). I think this is proof to me that the low velocity of money means people are saving and waiting for this kind of opportunity to invest. With the amount of cash lying around in the economy not being spent, people are just going to keep buying the dip at every opportunity forever. The market **can’t** tank because people are saving so much money that they’ll keep buying the dip. \n\nTl;dr people are saving too much money, so the fed can brrr forever and others will always buy the dip, making the bull run last forever", "id": "rcsuak", "created_utc": 1639088359.0, "score": 218, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 236, "comments": [{"body": "Lots of words here.

The sinking velocity of money is directly tied to QE, as it traps dollars in the banking system via reserve asset swaps.

The problems from 2008 never got resolved, just hidden away from sight, and endless QE since then has never caused any inflation, and isn't causing it now. Current inflation is almost all due to massive supply chain imbalances and extremely skewed demand from lock-downs and direct stimulus from congress.\n\nAs for a bear market, that absolutely can happen, as global GDP growth continues to slow and slow under the strain of the debt. Eventually GDP growth will be unable to keep up the ability to service all this debt. Defaults and bankruptcies will start to wipe out debt, which is literal deflation, and the more that defaults happen, the worse economic productivity will suffer. It will cycle down until a ton of debt is washed out of the system. This will take years, and be a deflationary bear market.\n\nEventually the debt levels will reduce enough, and all the shit debt will no longer be dragging everything down, capital will reallocate to all the future innovation, and we will have a global boom the likes of which we have never seen.

Forgive this long winded comment.\n\nDebt isn't deflationary, but extreme debt is. There is a curve that can be calculated from low levels of debt, which is inflationary early on, which slows as the debt grows, and eventually turns deflationary.\n\nWill simplify. If you have a credit card, and use it to purchase something which you can't afford today, you are adding money to the system that didn't exist, and increased inflation, as you bid on goods with newly created money.\n\nNow fast forward, and you have 3 maxed out credit cards. Your interest payments are huge, and you can barely make your payments, or maybe you can't even make payments. You need to take out new cards to just pay your other interest payments, compounding the problem. With so much money going to debt payments, you now have little or no money that you can spend on goods.\n\nThis is the reason the fed/govt try to have consistent inflations targets, and moreso why the past decade has struggled to even meet the 2% targets they have, because they can't even pay the bills without making debasing the currency, and lowering interest rates. If you look at the past few decades, the rates have consistently continued down, just so the system doesn't fall apart. But the more the debt grows, the faster it causes the deflationary pressure. And now interest rates are near zero, and not much room to go lower.\n\nNow assume you are a bank. Someone wants to borrow 300k, but is already heavily in debt. Rates are super low, so you don't make much on the interest, and their risk of default is decently high because of all their debt. You become less likely to loan money, which is the primary source of inflation. \n\nAlso the extreme debt starts to cause people and corps to default and go bankrupt.
