Inflationary pressure forces spending/investment.\n\n2. Money must go somewhere.  People/institutions that sold stocks for cash, which loses value over time, must reinvest the cash back to the market at some point.\n\n3. 401k/Retirement/wealth management automatically purchase investment assets.  A portion of everyone's salary is automatically invested into the market.\n\n4. The US stock market is 55% of the world market and attracts capital from all over the world.  Stocks are being boosted not just by American firms and individuals, but people from all of over the world allocate their wealth in the US market and hedge against their own domestic inflation and uncertainties. \n\n5. QE. Fresh money is printed and put in the stock market.\n\nMost importantly - FOLLOW THE MONEY: Where does the money go when someone sells their stock?  \n\n1. If the money goes in the bank: The bank will invest or lend out that money, which will find its way back to the market.\n2. If the money gets spent: It will find its way back to the market through the producer of the goods and services from 401k of employees, the investment/bank of the producer.\n\n3. Reinvest at the \"dip\".\n\n4. Invest in other assets like Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, or commodities such as Oil, Silver and Gold.  Which arguably carries more risk or lower growth, and doesn't encourage national economic growth at the same level as the stock market. \n\n5. Invest in pre-IPO companies.

But this means society still functions so is a buying opportunity \n- Argentina went through this in the 80s. Venezuela more recently. Eventually people struggle to survive and financial assets of all types devalue because the flow of funds through the economy is disrupted. Political risk kicks in as autocrats try to calm the unhappy populace through nationalization or various confiscatory policies as they try to direct the remaining value in the economy towards their allies.

One index this company created tracks 99.5% of publicly traded stocks and became investable as a fund (mutual fund…) in 2012. \n\nThe stock market has millions of different vehicles, indexes derivatives and methods of investment. A group of stocks that you invest in collectively is called a mutual fund. For example unless you buy the QQQ. Any index fund that tracks the nasdaq is a mutual fund based on the nasdaq index.
