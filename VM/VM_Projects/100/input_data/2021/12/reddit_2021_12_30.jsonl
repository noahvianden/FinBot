Most of the NFTs currently being traded are nothing but worthless hype that might die within a few months to a couple years because they aren't tied to anything.

GameStop on the other hand can offer exclusive limited edition NFT collectibles from big brands such as Pokemon, Halo, Naruto, etc and it will get the attention of gamers, fanatics, collectors, and NFT enthusiasts. The potential is huge if a regular NFT marketplace from unknown artists are generating millions in commissions alone to opensea. I don't think NFT is limited to just collecting a piece of Jpeg art but also tied to something else that can make buying an NFT worth it. For example, preordering a Game comes with an exclusive skin and some people are against preordering games because they usually aren't finished products (cyberpunk). What if instead of preordering, you buy an NFT of a game that gives you first access to the game. Now, not only did you play the game first, but you have a limited NFT art tied to the game that you can resell on the NFT marketplace if the game lives up to the hype and attracts fans. You just made an investment as opposed to just preordering a game and getting nothing out of it if the game succeeds. Imagine owning an NFT art that came with the first Halo series.

It will be more fun for the students, they'll be able to learn better, they can go on field trips both real and impossible, more practical/dangerous lessons can be carried out, and bullying will be less of an issue.\n\n> Hell how long have we had video chat now? 20 years?

Video chat doesn't work well for hanging out because it's a 2D representation of two people, sometimes more, chatting. VR is a 3D representation of potentially many people that don't have to just talk - they can go places and do things.\n\nIt will over time recreate the social capabilities of real life (minus touch etc) making it highly appealing as a psuedo-teleportation device to any friend/family member.

I disagree with your classroom assessment but its a minor quip. To me, VR is the bazooka solution. It wont happen imho save for the limited use cases. So they will have VR, but they will only use it for labs and such. For field trips? Maybe but it wont have much impact without touch. You miss the value of the journey. \n\nI can say the same about the live interaction. VR will stunt social growth in kids. They will not get a proper education on human behavior this way and thats literally the only point to k-12 today. \n\nI have 3 kids in elementary school. Do you know why I let them go to that? Its not the education. The formal education is worthless today. You can replicate it with a couple of apps and my oldest learned to read and write even before K. I have also known plenty of people who didnt even do much schooling (I am Iraqi) because they lived through the war. Guess what? They read and write just fine in two languages. It didnt slow them down at all. One is a HVAC repair guy and the other two are mechanics and work in real estate respectively. Though the k-12 classroom was once useful, tech has largely made it superfluous. It is what it is. \n\nOkay so why even bother with school then? Im still an upmost proponent of schools. Why? Because you need to learn how humans behave. The thing you mention about bullying, well there are flip sides to that coin and you lose those as well with sterile VR environment. Further, bullying is very important. It doesnt go away in adulthood, it just becomes more passive aggressive and hidden from view. If you dont learn how to deal with it as a child, you will not be ready for the real world. In other words, you have to take your bad with your good. This is why I let them go to elementary school. Basically, social maturity, which is ironically something I struggled with because my parents sheltered the hell out of me and we moved around a lot. It ended up hurting me in the long run.\n\nBut again all this is a minor quip. If schools decide to move to VR, I probably will still let my kids participate so its not like I am condeming this idea. I just dont think it will work. \n\nNow the other examples are all just entertainment and if you feel the social VR is the killer apps then I have to ask, are you doing it now? I think its obvious that you are not. So the next question is why arent you doing it if you think its so good?\n\nI work in tech and im an avid gamer. I also loved the idea of VR until I started developing for it (understanding limits) and started using it more often. There are several metaverses out there already. Go try some out. See where we are technologically. Look up Crucible or Netvrk or Sandbox or one of the 100 other nft/linked-list (blockchain lol)/crypto projects. Or just go hang out in an established game like Minecraft, Roblox or a popular MMO since they likely have better support for VR and actually have fun stuff to do. See if you can convince anyone to come and hang out with you in there in VR. Then come back and tell me what you think. \n\n1st thing you will probably note is the experience its not what you think it is. The VR doesnt matter at all if your intent to have a conversation. You might as well be on a phone and in fact, thats what most everyone falls back on. Think of it this way. Why do you go to a persons house to hang out? There is almost nothing fun about that environment. But thats how most people hang out. Why? Because it doesnt matter what the environment is. The experience is the conversation. \n\nNow that said, you can go hang out at a basketball court, cafe, Disney or hike trail. But what happens when you do that? For the most part, the conversation becomes the side attraction and no longer the focus. Though it might add to the fun especially if the activity requires a counterpart a la basketball or any competitive or cooperative activity. But ultimately its about the journey and not the destination, if you will. You want to smell the roasted beans and taste the coffee. You want to feel the G's on the coaster. You want to breathe the cool air, climb over the trees, walk into the streams and waterfalls, see the ants and birds running around and run scared when you hear a rattlesnake. This is what VR is missing. The journey is highly limited. And this is why its not taking off and why its not being used by the majority for social activity. \n\nThat said, it can have value ** IF ** its a great video game that you both enjoy. This is why MMO's were born. But now you are just playing WoW or Fortnite or Sims. Cool but does VR actually make it better than a simple screen? Not for those games because the gampeplay is just better with a screen. Maybe for an on rails story type game, then it might work. Kind of like solving a Sherlock Holmes style mystery with friends. Or an escape room. Or perhaps a haunted house. But this is why I say its very limited. It has to be a very specific kind of environment in order to be fun in a social setting. And really are you just going to sit there and socialize while being chased by demons and zombies while they gnaw on your friends head? Might be funny... but come on.

VR doesnt improve on them.\n\nThere are serious limitations there because you can't actually dance at a concert, you can't actually shoot pool, you can't feel like you're hitting a ball in table tennis, you can't feel like you're at a movie theater, you can't see things up close in a museum, you can't experience the heights of Mount Everest, you can't paint naturally in 3D and walk around/through your paintings.\n\nThis is only possible in VR. Even just the concept of real-time digital communication is improved by VR because it's easier to interpret social cues in VR (aside from the face for now) compared to something like zoom, and the experience just feels more socially engaging.\n\nSo hanging out with friends/family is usually best in VR compared to a regular videogame or a zoom call. \n\n> Point two assumes VR experience somehow fools people into thinking they are outdoor? Respectfully... thats a real stretch. Its not true at all. \n\nIt's common for people to forget they are standing in their room in real life. The brain, being as neuroplastic as it is, makes it a lot easier to trick people than you might think. The visual sense is the most dominant and as such dictates your perceptual experience of the world greatly. Hearing also comes into play with 3D audio.\n\n> Killed people through mental effects? Bro you have gone off the reservation... Anyone that weak in the brain has much bigger problems than pandemics. VR wont help them.\n\nVR has absolutely helped people like this. I know people who have said as much that it saved them. \n\nStatistically, mental health issues have gone up quite a bit due to covid, and even if those people are still alive, you can bet that many of them would have found it much easier if they had used VR, because even if you could go on walks, you were still very limited when seeing friends and family - and that's the most important thing to most people.\n\n > Point three - This is a solid no. Not all 3d games work well in VR. I have developed for VR. They are good for on rail style games and experiences.

I'm not anti-crypto; ether, doge, or any platform that would eventually be PoS or some system that's more scalable and less energy intensive makes sense. I'm also not hugely opposed to Tesla holding the small amount (relative to their size) as an inflation hedge, that's one of the few things it's actually ok for. But it's awfully distracting and any talk of transacting in it scares me.\n\n* I am on the fence with LIDAR. I agree that radar sensor fusion made it obvious to cut, but all the AV companies actually operating L5 vehicles today use LIDAR, and lidar costs and power consumption have come waaaaay down. I get where Elon's coming from in that its a crutch that's not needed from a first principles perspective, but if that crutch accelerates the progression to L5 and means beating competitors to a generalized solution I think it's worthwhile. Imagine what would happen to stock price if Mobileye started doing L5 with lidar & cameras next year and Tesla couldn't get FSD to a comparable level for another 18-24 months. It would be bad. This is an area where I'm putting faith in Elon more than relying on my own assessment, in my eyes he has certainly earned that faith but I understand why others are skeptical.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Mfs on twitter still going around with CeO sELlInG ShArEs bullshit.

A humanoid robot could do many different things. Some things have long since been fully automated, for example a machine that makes metal chains. But many other works require many different tasks, for which the ability of a humanoid robot to do many different things is useful.\n\n- Humanoid robots will be able to use many things that were designed for humans, such as tools, appliances, machinery, means of transportation. imagine a big store (such as the previously mentioned Costco) has a forklift, a vacuum cleaner, a floor polisher, a rotisserie for cooking those roasted chickens, etc. Suppose they can buy one humanoid robot that's capable of operating all of those devices. And think of a homebuilder - instead of an intelligent nail driver, an intelligent saw, an intelligent drywall installer, etc., how about a robot that can use the tools built for humans?\n\n- Humanoid robots may be better at working with humans than some designs of non-humanoid robots. And humanoid robots may also be useful for personal care - there has been great interest in Japan, for example, in development of personal care robots in view of the aging population.\n\nThe cost and capability of course will determine the specific applications for which humanoid robots have an advantage - Elon has mentioned use for tasks that are unpleasant or dangerous. (And of course they should have significant advantages for setting up Moon/Mars bases for later human use.) But over time, costs should come down and capabilities should increase, so humanoid robots should be useful for an increasing number of applications.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "sorry pal.

If it doesn't hit after some time, I remove my buy-to-close order and let it ride for max profit or assignment. \n\nFor calls, I sell as far away as possible and almost always close at 50% profit.
