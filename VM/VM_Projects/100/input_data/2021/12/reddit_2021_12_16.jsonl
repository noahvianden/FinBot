You're the one that doesn't seem to have much a clue, the chip design is only one aspect as it's been relatively clear that smaller fab design has correlated extremely closely to performance. Apple makes HUGE orders thanks to the iPhone and that makes them TSMC's most important customers so Apple gets first access to new process nodes when they come out. This allows Apple to stay ahead of the curve since AMD has to be on older nodes and Intel is floundering with their own fabs. Look at Intel's latest chips and how competitive they are now, how was this possible? Intel finally got a smaller process node - not some great new design. When AMD took the lead how did they do that? They got to be on  a smaller process node than Intel. And now Apple has an amazing chip how is that possible? Well... It's going to be they're on a smaller process node. That's TSMC who's leading the way there (and even then it's because they were able to procure ASML's machines where competitors weren't able to - or in Intel's case simply didn't choose to). \n\n\n>Any of the other numbers you're throwing around regarding 30% this and 10% that you are pulling out your ass.\n\nWe're talking about a growth in valuation of a trillion dollars, 30% of 3 trillion is about a trillion dollars.

Was so fast and fun to drive around in that game.  Young me knew that electric cars were the future.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of 2020 i had just received a decent settlement from being doored on my bike and needing two shoulder surgeries as a result.  I was finally out of 12 years of persistent debt and I actually had a large amount of money to do something with.  I began investing in February of 2020 lol.  What  a crazy wild ride up and down that first year was.  I have a lot of red in my portfolio from the last few months, all companies I do believe in for the long term so I'm not worried, but some of my positions have been getting absolutely gutted, but I'm about 90% tesla.  I started buying when it was 400 pre split and have been buying ever since.  I have my cost basis now of about 375 post split.  Over the past two years there was the run up before the stock split, then the ensuing crash.  There was the run up to 900 in early 2021 and the subsequent crash of almost 45% followed by almost a year of nothing.  We now have the crazy run up to 1250 followed by this crash.  Who knows when we will get back to new ATH, could be a while with this macro environment.\n\nDoes it suck to \"lose\" tens of thousands of dollars over a few weeks or months?  Yes it does, but this is where you hopefully can build the mental strength to make it through these times.  You really need to ask yourself why are you investing in the companies you are?  Hell why are you investing at all?\n\nI just as much would love to see us rocket to 2000+ a share, but I know I wouldn't be selling then, so why get worked up now?  But  I do get worked up. I do check my portfolio and i do say ooooff when I see big red numbers for months on end.  But it is what it is.  You have to believe in the long term.  I hope this is redundant for some of you but I need to say it for myself also lol.  I truly believe in the mission of tesla and I am ready for more pain if it comes.  I know in the long run it will be worth it.\n\nI invest in Tesla because I truly believe that this company is doing good for humanity.  There will be hiccups along the way, but looking at the vision of the company (and the insane financial fundamentals) you need to be buying regularly, regardless of price.

I'm just referring to the profit and loss regions. With a naked call, you only begin to lose money once the stock price goes beyond the strike price + premium received. If the stock ends *anywhere* below the strike price at expiration, you get full profit.\n\nWhen you sell a put to turn it into a strangle, now you need the strike price to be between your short strikes for full profit. So instead of any price below your short call, you actually care about how low it is allowed to go. Yes, you do get more premium, but that's because you're taking on downside risk now. The probability of stock price landing between your put and call strikes is lower than the probability of landing between $0 and your call strike.\n\nThe analogy of credit spreads and condors is the same thing - instead of taking risk only on one side, by turning it into an iron condor you're taking on risk on both sides.\n\nIt's interesting you mentioned lizards - a jade lizard is a short put plus a call credit spread. It is set up specifically to take risk off the call side. By purchasing a long call, you've reduced the premium received, but if you set it up properly you have no risk to the upside. So it is trying to take the middle of the two strategies we discussed above - try to get more premium, but only just enough as to not invite additional risk.\n\nAt the end of the day all these options strategies are just pushing the areas under the curve around in a [profit/loss graph](https://www.optionsbro.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Short-Strangle-Options-Trading-Example-.jpg) to suit your thesis.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Wow this is awesome.

My sum delta exposure on the wheel stocks is 200 (100 FB + 100 MSFT). However, between those 2 companies they eat into 2/3 of my over budget for trading, which limits my options for what I can do with my spreads/strangles as I have less capital left.\n\nAs a result, I open LEAPS on each, using 90+ delta and at roughly a 50% value of the current price (so around 160-170 strike for either).
