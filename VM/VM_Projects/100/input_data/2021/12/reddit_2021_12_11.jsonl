{"title": "Peter Lynch warns against passive investing - after 'The Big Short' investor Michael Burry called it a dangerous bubble", "selftext": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/peter-lynch-big-short-michael-burry-passive-investing-stocks-bubble-2021-12\n\nFabled stock-picker Peter Lynch recently criticized the shift toward passive investing, warning buyers of index funds and exchange-traded funds that they're losing out on superior returns. Michael Burry, the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, has also complained about the trend and cautioned it could be disastrous. \"This move to passive is a mistake,\" Lynch, who delivered an annualized return of 29% over 13 years as the manager of Fidelity's Magellan fund, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview that aired this week. \"People are missing the boat,\" he added, noting that he expects the best active managers to consistently trounce the market.\n\nMeanwhile, Burry called the passive-investing boom a \"bubble\" in a Bloomberg interview in 2019. The Scion Asset Management boss observed that the trend was sapping interest in smaller, undervalued securities around the world. \"There is all this opportunity, but so few active managers looking to take advantage,\" he said. Burry also suggested the dearth of active managers was stifling shareholder activism. Passive managers tend to be less confrontational with company executives, whereas Burry wrote several letters to GameStop's directors in 2019. He called for a board overhaul and criticized its executives' compensation, acquisitions, and lack of share repurchases. The Scion chief revisited the subject of passive investing in a September tweet. He warned the flood of millennial money into index funds and ETFs was fueling unsustainable valuations and putting the stock market in a precarious position. \"Parabolas don't resolve sideways,\" he said.", "id": "rdojvw", "created_utc": 1639187255.0, "score": 294, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 208, "comments": [{"body": "\\>> ... expects the best active managers to consistently trounce the market.\n\nWell, yes.
