Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.", "id": "rsr3jc", "created_utc": 1640946613.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 331, "comments": [{"body": "I like how the meme daily threads on this forum have suicide and gambling addiction hotline numbers at the bottom of the OP thread.", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "The good news for me is I finished in the green today.

{"title": "A message to all of you who earned less than 30% this year", "selftext": "Over the past couple weeks, there have been a number high-horse posts on this sub directed at people who underperformed the S&P 500 index this year. \n\nI am here to tell you this: You might have done everything right and still fallen short of the S&P. That isn't inherently bad nor is it inherently a sign of failure. Lots of great companies' stocks had a bum year (AMZN, V, WMT, DIS, BA, MRK) and some got clobbered (PYPL, telecos, etc.) \n\nDespite popular opinion, investing in individual stocks is not about beating the indexes over an arbitrary short-term period of time. It's about owning shares of strong companies regardless of what the market is doing. Stocks like V and DIS could very feasibly beat the market significantly next year, and may be better positioned to do so if they're seen as a good value. \n\nMeanwhile, many posts and comments on here suggest getting out of every stock immediately (and worse, selling while they're down), and that you're foolish for even trying. This is not helpful advice. This advice is only helpful if you're the kind of person whose portfolio is 100% meme stocks with no earnings and you have no desire to learn anything new or improve your understanding of stocks or companies whatsoever. If this is you, then yes, you should listen to VTI or VT gang. \n\nBut, I suspect this is not most people here. I suspect this is a tired stereotype, and that a large number of people reading this understand the fundamentals of their holdings quite well but still underperformed this year. Big deal. If you're a buy and hold investor, this isn't a problem unless there's really something wrong with the companies. We all know stocks are more volatile than index funds. \n\nThere are lots of other reasons why someone might not be enjoying this 28% ride: Maybe they didn't have much invested at the beginning of the year. Maybe they're actively learning and making adjustments along the way. Maybe their net worth *is* mostly in index funds and they just want to play jazz with their stock portfolio. Maybe they're in VT and bonds, which is arguably more responsible, and had a far lower return than the S&P. \n\nI have learned an incredible amount about stocks this year thanks to this sub and websites like Investopedia, FinViz, OpenInsider, and others, and it has given me much enjoyment to participate in the markets in this way. Posts and comments that demean underperforming stock pickers essentially discourage learning. \n\nOne last point: There is an ever increasing interest in socially responsible investing, and rightly so in my view. However, the S&P is not very ESG. Everybody \"buying the haystack\" is profitting off the fossil fuel industry, war planes, guns, major polluters, animal testing, alcoholism, lung disease, the list goes on. The best performing sector this year was energy, specifically oil and gas companies, the main culprits of climate change. Of course, many people don't care and flout such concerns. But I bet many people in VTI or VT gang don't fully appreciate this relationship and would choose not to invest this way if they knew of a better option. Stock picking allows you to invest in companies you actually support without enriching the insiders of companies you don't. \n\nIn summary, this is r/stocks.

I saw disproportionate weight on megacaps like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, etc., which (in my viewpoint) is risky as companies that seem like they're too big to fail just might.  Other more diversified stocks had offenders like Altria in it, one of my single most detested companies out there, or stocks that I wouldn't be caught dead buying due to poor fundamentals or minimal growth potential.\n\nI dropped those ETFs, and instead did a ton of research, substantially diversified my stock holdings, and put in place good systems to help weed out poor performers from getting bought or staying in my holdings.  I have faith in my system, but I'm constantly learning and tuning my approach to account for factors I hadn't considered before, rather than just giving a few funds 100% of my money and trusting them to buy on my behalf.\n\nIf things go poorly for my portfolio, at least I'll know that my research was inadequate or my systems lacked proper consideration or safeguards for certain types of risk.

If the market feels that the real floor of the wedge was $1050 and are correcting to $1000 due to the 15.7 free floating shares Musk added to it then we are right in the center of the wedge...
