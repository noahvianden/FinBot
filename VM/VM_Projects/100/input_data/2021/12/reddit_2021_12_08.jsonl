Not only does it not fit culturally to a lot of regions, but also many consumers in even the most developed nations don’t have the disposable income to go-out and buy three weeks of food and other goods in a single outing. Many consumers shop at grocery stores more frequently as their paychecks dictate that sort of spending behavior. \n\nNot to mention that many other countries don’t have the physical space for Costco, and I mean this in three ways:\n\n1) houses are generally smaller and therefore consumers have less room to buy more items. Even fridges and freezers are significantly smaller, so that value pack of 19 chicken breasts won’t have anywhere to go. For example, the idea of a fridge and freezer in the garage is a purely American concept\n\n2) cars are smaller. SUVs, minivans, pickups, and trucks are way less common everywhere else in the world. In fact, car ownership is significantly lower in the rest of the world compared to the U.S. The United States ranks 3rd in number of cars per 1000 people. If you exclude the micro countries (Monaco, Lichtenstein, San Marino, Luxembourg, etc), then the U.S is #1, Iceland #2, Australia and New Zealand #7 & #8, and Italy #10.\n\n3) not many other countries have the lot sizes and geographical area to accommodate a massive warehouse that can serve as both a distribution center as well as consumer-facing shopping outlet. \n\nI only see Costco having a chance in Canada, Germany, Australia, and maybe Japan. Don’t get me wrong, those are huge, affluent markets, but I still see international expansion being a massive challenge for Costco. \n\nI believe this anecdotal take applies to South America, Latin America, Western and Southern Europe, and South Asia.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Already Costcos in Australia and doing well.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "\\> houses are generally smaller and therefore consumers have less room to buy more items.

SUVs, minivans, pickups, and trucks are way less common everywhere else in the world.\n\nAgain, look at Costco's consumer demographic. However take S Korea for example public transportation is incredibly cheap and super common (ran by their govt at cost) and taxis are much cheaper for the average person to do a Costco run if they don't want to take the metro.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> not many other countries have the lot sizes and geographical area to accommodate a massive warehouse that can serve as both a distribution center as well as consumer-facing shopping outlet.\n\nMany \"smaller\" countries have massive regional distribution hubs because it is more cost efficient.

I could not sell those without triggering substantial CGT, so best thing is to keep diversified and let the margin at 2.25% work its magic. \n\nDiversification saves in a crisis because, on a well diversified portfolio of 20 or 30 titles, you will likely not experience much disruption. In a Portfolio of 1, if that 1 goes bust it's a 100% loss.

Design of EV is based on one of the basic principles of physics - Law of conservation of energy. Energy can be neither destroyed nor created, it can be only moved from one form to another. 100KW battery will have same amount of energy whether its Teslas or GMs or Fords.  You have to allocate this energy across multiple competing parameters. FSD/Entertainment, Passenger comfort (more cabin space means more energy needed to the move the car), Safety (more safety means heavier structures), Aerodynamics and still make positive margins on top. Tesla has found the sweet spot that balances all of the above parameters perfectly. If anyone wants to compete with tesla, they have to do exactly what tesla has done. Else, they will have to compromise on one of the factors above which will lead to a subpar product which means a lack of pricing power. This is what happened in the airline industry with only Boeing and Airbus left as same principles apply to aircraft design.\n\nWhy there will be no competition to tesla is that no other Auto CEOs seems to understand this including the clean sheet auto companies like Lucid and Rivian (Rivian CEO is supposed to be MIT PhD).

Why? \r  \n\r  \nIn 2021 (and beyond presumably), the IRS gives index options preferential treatment. Listed under section 1256 of the tax code, the gains and losses on certain exchange-traded options (like SPX) are entitled to a tax rate equal to 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gain or loss. \r  \n\r  \nThe profits and losses on ETF options (like SPY) are typically treated completely as short-term capital gains. Here’s what the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) says about these taxes:\r  \n\r  \n\"Many traders use a variety of ETF options products, such as SPY, to gain exposure to the S&P 500. What they may not realize is that capital gains from ETF options may be considered short-term gains and taxed at the ordinary income rate, which in 2019 ranged from 10-37%. Depending on individual trading and your tax bracket, that could be a big hit to your income.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe added tax-benefit of index options will of course depend on an investor’s tax profile, but, generally speaking, index options are more monetarily beneficial when it comes to tax time than equity and ETF options. Another win for SPX!\"\n\nIt is no small thing to have 60% of your earnings automatically classified as long term capital gains.  I am trained as a tax lawyer but I no longer practice, for me in my tax bracket this matters.  Why?\n\nLong-term capital gains are derived from assets that are held for more than one year before they are disposed of. Long-term capital gains are taxed according to graduated thresholds for taxable income at 0%, 15%, or 20%. The tax rate on most taxpayers who report long-term capital gains is 15% or lower.\r  \n\r  \nShort-term capital gains are taxed just like your ordinary income. That’s up to 37% in 2021, depending on your tax bracket.  100% of the proceeds from SPY will be taxed the same as your ordinary income.

There is a lot of uncertainty because of things like potentially more variants, potential instability in China's real estate market, Russia and Ukraine, when the fed is going to taper, supply chain bottle necks and a stock market that has been doing very well recently. Given all these factors I think it's reasonable for people to put some cash on the side and not want to jump fully in...\n\nThat said I don't think the recovery from Covid is over yet and the biggest issues seem to be that everyone has more money than they can spend. Everyone 5 and up is eligible for a vaccine. More people are investing, people are making more money, unemployment is down, productivity is up and the world seems to be getting back on track.\n\nOverall I understand why people wouldn't want to throw caution to the wind and go all in but I'm optimistic about long term growth.

{"title": "Why I am putting 80% of my portfolio in FSR with stock, calls, and LEAP and think it will hit $167 a share by YE 2023, $559/share by YE 2024, and $900/share by YE 2025", "selftext": "**Summary**\n\n* I got a chance an up close and personal view of the Fisker Ocean at the recent LA auto show. It will be an absolute game changer in the industry and will drive sales much higher than street expectations \n* My updated model suggests Fisker could we worth $167/share by YE 2023, $559/share by YE 2024 and over $900/share by YE 2025 \n* Board members had been buying stock in the last few weeks in meaningful amounts \n* Soros just bought a large stake in Fisker \n* On 11/25/21, the CEO tweeted that after the recent LA auto show, “We r sold out until mid-2023. After reviewing with Magna, I think we can exceed 7,500 production volume (previous 5,000) per month to second ½ of 2023, to for fill increasing demand!”. This implies 25% more production capacity for the full year of 75,000 units vs previous guidance of 60,000.\n\nThere have been many great articles on Seeking Alpha about the history of Fisker, what makes Fisker unique (using MAGNA and FOXCONN as contract manufacturers much like NIO has done), and some of the troubled history of the failed Fisker Karma. I will not focus on those details here. Suffice to say that Fisker was one of the early pioneers in the EV race and launched his iconic Fisker Karma BEFORE the Tesla Model S. Yes, he ran into some issues with his battery supplier and yes, his previous company did go belly-up. But America is all about comebacks and I believe Henrik will be coming back stronger than ever. I like the fact that he has failed in the past, because that will just make him hungrier to prove himself and learn from his mistakes.\n\n**Specifications from the LA auto show indicated features are class leading at their price poin**t\n\nYou will not find any EV with this range, feature set and dynamic style in this price class (please check [www.fiskerinc.com](http://www.fiskerinc.com) for more details and to reserve one with a $250 deposit). It’s a class leading SUV that starts at $37,499 ($29,999 with current federal subsidies - likely to increase).\n\n**“Delivery” of cars is really only 4 months away**\n\nMost people think the company is 1 year or more behind Rivian or Lucid, but that is simply not the case. In the recent earnings call on Nov 3rd, 2021, Henrik Fisker said that “well over eight months before we launch the vehicle” that Fisker will be “building two vehicles a day”. With SOP (Start of Production) slated to be on November 17th, 2022, this implies that they will be building 2 cars/day starting around March 2022.  Assuming approximately 261 days until SOP, that means 522 cars that will be built before the official SOP.\n\nWhat will Fisker do with these 522 cars? It’s just way too many for crash-testing and homologation. As a point of reference, Lucid said it plans to deliver only 520 cars by the end of 2021 and only 20,000 Lucid Air sedans in 2022. On December 1st 2021, Henrik stated after the auto show “we are well over 20,000 \\[reservations\\] and the numbers go up every few minutes.” Difference in their respective market cap? How about $6 BN in market cap for Fisker and over $80 BN in market cap for Lucid - 10x as much! Yes, Lucid is delivering 20,000 cars in 2022 vs Fisker delivering (in my model) 75,000 cars in 2023, but is that valuation differential warranted?\n\nAlso, Lucid reservations holders have recently been alerted to expect delays and it looks increasingly unlikely that the 520 delivery number for 2021 will actually materialize. Lucid also announced yesterday that it is being investigated by the SEC for its SPAC deal with Churchill Capital. Fisker announced on the same day that \"Our merger with Spartan Energy Corp, completed in October 2020, was reviewed by the SEC and other relevant regulatory authorities, To date, we have not received any requests for additional information from the SEC relating to the merger transaction and, to our knowledge, we are not under any investigation by the SEC regarding our SPAC merger”.\n\nI know where I would rather put my money.  What happens if Fisker delivers some of these pre-production cars to employees or “friendlies” much like Rivian has done? We have to realize that the start of production means different things to different people. Simply because Rivian owns their own plant, their definition of start of production is very different than FSR’s which relies on contract manufacturers. Before you start to complain about Fisker’s lack of owning their own plant, just look at NIO’s $60 BN market cap and it’s run from $2 to $33 to realize that outsourced production can be very successful.\n\nAnyway, let’s get back to Lucid’s recent history to get a sense of what a stock price reaction might look like for FSR when we start seeing some cars on the road. On Oct 27th 2021, Lucid issued a press release stating that customer deliveries of its Lucid Air Dream Edition (priced at $169,000) would start on Oct 30th, 2021. Lucid surged as much as 47% the next and the stock eventually went from $27.69 to $45.92 in 7 trading days! A staggering 65% return in 7 days.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/lucid-shares-skyrocket-after-confirming-deliveries-of-169000-air-sedan.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/lucid-shares-skyrocket-after-confirming-deliveries-of-169000-air-sedan.html)\n\nWhat would happen with Fisker’s stock if it could start “delivering” cars in March 2022, which is less than 4 months away? A similar move in FSR would yield a $18.34 to $30.26 move. What happens when Fisker allows press and auto magazines to start test driving the car and they get blown away with 550bp, 0-60 MPH in less than 3.6 seconds, smart traction (allows the right amount of torque to the correct wheels) and “race-car” like handling?\n\nFisker also features an innovative flexible leasing model with no long-term contracts. This can generate “more than 250% margin on these vehicles long-term” as Henrik mentioned on the Q3 2021 conference call. FSR can lease their cars over and over again over a 12-year life span and charge each new customer for OTA (over the air) updates for different software enhancements.\n\n**Putting it all together in a model**\n\nSo, now that we know Fisker could pop once their cars start rolling off the pre-production line around March 2022, what is the company really worth over the long-term? Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas resumed coverage of Fisker with a $40 PT and a bull case PT of $90 on August 10, 2021.  News has gotten dramatically better since then, and Jonas has yet to appropriately update his model.\n\nWe not only had the LA auto show, the news that Fisker was using battery packs from CATL (largest battery supplier in the world) with class leading LFP chemistry, but also critical news that Foxconn signed a definitive agreement to purchase the 6.2 MM square foot Lordstown facility in order to produce the Fisker PEAR. This factory gives Fisker the ability to take advantage of any incremental EV federal credits for producing in the US. Henrik even said in an interview that this means that PEAR production could be moved up earlier. He has also dropped hints that Magna is ahead of schedule for the Ocean.  Please show me ONE EV company that has announced being early to market.\n\nOn the February 21th, 2021 conference call an analyst asked “in the announcement from yesterday, you talked about the Foxconn relationship alone to be 250,000?” and Henrik answered “could see surpassing our original goal of 250,000 by 2025.”  Then, on the Q2 call August 6th 2021, Henrik stated that when JUST speaking about the Ocean “I think we will easily be able to sell more than 250,000 vehicles of that a year and just wait to see it. It's just amazing. In terms of the last two vehicles for its total plan of, four coming together between before 2025, we actually already have designed the third vehicle and the fourth vehicle will be already in negotiations for something pretty unique about that vehicle as well. So the four vehicles actually are on plan.”\n\nTaking all this new information, Henrik’s recent tweets, and some factoids from the recent conference calls and running it through a model yields some pretty impressive stock prices. The peer group trades as forward sales multiples of between 14x (Tesla) to 35x (Lucid), so let us use a starting multiple of 14x for Fisker and we get the following resulting stock prices:\n\n                                        2023         2024\t        2025\n\nTotal Global EV Market (in MM)\t                     8,500,000\t       11,000,000\t        14,000,000 \n\nGrowth Rate\t\t                                                                                      29%       \t    27%\n\nOcean Units\t                                                           60,000 \t   175,000\t              250,000                     Growth Rate\t\t                                                                                   192%\t              43%\n\nPear Units\t                                                             5,000           \t75,000\t               250,000 \n\nGrowth Rate \t\t                                                                                   1400%\t               233%\n\nUFO Units\t                                                            10,000\t         50,000\t                 90,000 \n\nGrowth Rate\t\t                                                                                      400%\t          80%\n\nTBD 4th car\t\t                                                                                  15,000 \t                 60,000 \n\nGrowth Rate\t\t\t                                                                                                         300%\n\nTotal Units\t                                                              75,000\t           315,000\t        650,000 \n\n Implied Growth Rate\t\t                                                                      320%\t             106%\n\n% of Total Global EV sales\t                                           0.88%\t             2.86%\t            4.64%\n\nASP (Blended)\t                                                           $50,000 \t  $45,000 \t          $40,000\n\nTotal Revenues (in $MM)\t                                              $3,750 \t     $14,175 \t           $26,000 \n\nShare Outstanding (In MM)\t                                                314\t             330\t                346\n\nP/S Multiple .                                                                               \t14\t               13\t                   12\n\nImplied Stock Price \t                                                              $167 \t   $559 \t                 $901\n\n**Conclusion** \n\n* With a 28% short interest ratio, things could get really exciting when we start seeing some Fisker cars in the hands of press in early 2022\n* TSLA’s stock was up 743.44% in 2020 and its not that much of a stretch to see Fisker making a similar move in 2022 when we get closer to production \n* Fisker is trading at less that 1/10 the valuation of Lucid and yet will produce more cars than Lucid by 2025", "id": "rc2i6u", "created_utc": 1639001893.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 131, "comments": [{"body": "80% of your portfolio is a lot of conviction.
