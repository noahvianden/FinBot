This is partly driven by interest rates and other factors, but that doesn't mean it isn't a concern, especially given that we're likely now entering a period of monetary tightening.\n\nCrypto, NFT and EVs are all examples of areas of the market where valuations are excessive and likely in a bubble. Not calling a crash because firstly bubbles can last for years, and secondly if the dot-com bubble didn't burst many dot-com companies would have eventually grown into their valuations anyway -- in an alternative universe we would have just seen decades of under performance without any real crash in prices.\n\nBeyond a few pockets of the market that look like bubbles I would say today we're seeing conditions generally more comparable to the \"nifty-fifty\" period, although there are again differences and conditions probably aren't as extreme. But during this period we saw market concentration into a few large companies (the nifty-fifty) which were considered solid long-term holds. Although valuations during this period weren't anywhere near as excessive as the dot-com bubble, many companies still had PEs in the 50s, but this was ignored because they were \"solid companies\" and good \"long-term holds\" -- phases you commonly hear about stocks like AAPL or NVDA today. Although most of the companies in the nifty-fifty are still around and doing well today, in the decades following the these stocks underperformed the market significantly as valuations came down to more reasonable levels. Generally investors would have been wise to have avoided large-cap US stocks during this period.\n\nI think the main take away is to avoid excessive valuations and invest in places where continued multiple expansion isn't required to make a return. I think indexes look expensive at the moment, but not excessively so, still a flat year or 10-20% pullback is probably needed at this point. I continue to think people investing in EVs and crypto are going to be wiped out in a similar fashion to weed stock investors a few years back and that could lead to a general derisking and loss of confidence in other areas of the market, but I'd welcome that as it would present opportunities.\n\nI'd personally avoid US indexes and many US large-caps here and instead seek international diversification along with some smaller US stocks with attractive valuations.

I look for individual stocks I can understand so I naturally avoid most sectors because I have little understanding of companies in spaces like pharma, banking, materials, etc.\n\nI'm a software engineer so I generally invest in tech companies as I understand that sector better than most. I also look for high-growth companies and tend to stay away from stocks where you pay a premium for stability which in theory should result in higher average returns, but this also means most of my stock picks wouldn't be considered pure \"value\" plays and generally have high, or in some cases non-existent PEs. So I'm not sure how helpful my picks are if you're looking for sectors/stocks with value in the traditional sense...\n\nThat said, there are a lot of small US tech stocks I really like right now. I think UPST is looking very attractive at its current valuation and I've been buying looking for a pop. Stocks like PLAN, YEXT & COUR are all small, high risk names, but I think they have been treated quite unfairly by the market this past year and worth putting a bit of money in.\n\nInternationally I like OZON and BABA. These are generally seen as toxic stocks to investors here, but both have strong growth and wide moats in their respective countries so long as you can get past the political concerns. I own these partly for international exposure so wouldn't necessary recommend either to the average investor.\n\nThe other half of my portfolio is much more generic though. I own names like DIS, AMZN, GOOG, SHOP, TSM. Some of which I think are a little pricey, but they have safety in their size and don't seem to be excessively valued. I also own a small amount of a few random stocks like BA and BRKB purely for diversification and couldn't really comment on valuation.\n\nIn general I'm much more concerned with avoiding bubbles and excessively high valuations. Until recently I owned names like NVDA and NET, but have cut these because of their valuations. I don't really care about 20-30% pullbacks, I just want to avoid the 90% drawdowns which would risk wiping out my portfolio.

{"title": "Realizing These 7 Trading Mistakes Saved Me Over $200,000 in Losses This Year", "selftext": " If you‚Äôve recently started trading, you‚Äôre likely very disturbed by the recent pullbacks and volatility, especially among high-flying household tech stocks like Docusign, Roku, and Teladoc, which are down 45% from recent highs. Even more jarring was the complete crash of Chinese darlings Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com due to concerns that the communist government in China would be, well, communistic. \n\nInstitutional investors used fears of inflation and the latest COVID variant as a reason (excuse) to get out of positions they knew had been overbought. And all the stop losses got triggered thereafter, creating a snowball effect. This has restored some sanity to the market, though I‚Äôd argue many stocks are still overvalued.\n\n I‚Äôm going to lay out 7 mistakes everyone makes when investing below in the hope that it provides some guidance to those who need it. If you feel you don't need, just don't read it. Thanks.\n\n**Expecting the Market to Rise in a Straight Line**  \n While this seems straightforward, many people believe the stock market only goes up and never down. This is not true. The market goes up 80% of the time BUT not all companies are taken on that ride and you should expect a 10% pullback every other year. \n\nLikewise, the number of smaller pullbacks of 5% have become more common over the past decades and now average around 5 per year. Keep in mind, these pullbacks represent the average of a bundle of 500 stocks, meaning some stocks are affected a lot more than 5% and others less than 5%.\n\n**Not Picking An Entry Point**\n\nThese market pullbacks represent great buying opportunities, but should not be relied on as the entry points because in the moment investors don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a 5, 10, or 20% correction. Instead of trying to predict the future outcome of a pullback, I have a set list of companies I want to buy always ready to go with my target price.\n\nThink of this list as your budget - you determine this entry price and you don‚Äôt budge from that target. If the stock drops to the price or below, it‚Äôs a buy, and you enter the trade. I may lose more money on the way further down but that‚Äôs OK, I got my entry price and need to have faith in the investment rebounding. I have gotten burned more times than I care to count by getting impatient and buying a stock above my target price only to watch in horror as it tumbles back down to the price I wanted to pay to begin with six months later.\n\nTruth be told, this is more a game of patience and good technology. I set price alerts using Fidelity (always to my phone not email) and I try to ignore the FOMO as the stock rides up high quickly.\n\nBeing a successful investor is a lot like being on a diet at all times. I‚Äôm constantly hungry for more, wanting to jump in an enjoy decadent treats, and having to sacrifice my desires for better outcomes. If I‚Äôm not feeling the friction of personal restraint, I‚Äôm not investing, I‚Äôm just gambling.\n\n**Setting Entry Prices Based on Graphs Only**\n\nOK, so I need to set an entry point to avoid being the bag holder - how do I do that? There are many ways. The worst way IMHO is to look at a chart and pick a number based on where a stock has been previously aka a previous dip. Technical analysts will often point to support and resistance lines in graphs and talk  about whether or not a stock will hold its fall at a resistance point or break out through a previous resistance line. \n\nNew support and resistance lines are forming all of the time because of the micro and macro environments. Said plainly, events cause these levels - they are not mystical levels that form on their own. People react to events and prices change. And many levels are created by people in support of their own thesis these lines exist, self-perpetuating their existence. Usually, they are formed around events. The events could be company news or it could be macro news about the inflationary environment, policy changes, or other world events. So it‚Äôs critical to track events and know what‚Äôs going on with the company and the world before going in. You can do this through the news or by using technology.\n\nI use a software system to keep track of major company events and help me understand how they will impact the price movement. I haven‚Äôt found a more efficient way of doing that.\n\nIf you‚Äôve taken account of events, the next thing to do is find a way to value the stock. There are many ways to do this and I plan on writing a post with more detail on that in the near future. For now, I‚Äôll note a few simple ways to do this.\n\n**Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)**¬†\\- the P/E ratio gives an analysis of the stock‚Äôs price relative to its annual earnings or profit. The higher the P/E, the more expensive the stock. The easiest way to understand this is to think about your investment as the share price and the annual return on that investment as the earnings. If the P/E is 20, it would take you 20 years to recoup your investment in terms of the value of those earnings. This ignores a lot of things like inflation, free cash flow, the total assets of the company, company debt, and how fast the company is growing. But it‚Äôs a useful back of envelope way to give an idea about whether the investment may turn out well. If a stock has a P/E above 20, the company should be growing double digits annually, not be riddled with debt, and have competitive positioning so it doesn‚Äôt get crushed. If it‚Äôs trading over 60 P/E, it should be growing earnings and revenue triple digits to justify the valuation, or be in a position to dominate a market for many years to come.\n\nOther valuations include the Price to Book ratio, the Price to Sales Ratio, and the Enterprise Value to EBIDTA. We‚Äôll have to cover these in another post. For now, know they exist but you can use the P/E as a north star to guide your entry points and avoid overpaying for stocks. In an environment of low inflation, P/E matters less than it does than in an environment of higher inflation, where companies with less earnings and cash flow have to borrow more at higher interest rates to continue growing.\n\nSo set your entry price on a reasonable P/E ratio that is in line with the historical 5-year P/E of the company and its peers (Fidelity makes this readily available). If you buy a company with no earnings, it‚Äôs going to get crushed every time there‚Äôs an inflationary scare because in order to grow, that company has to borrow money or raise more money by selling more shares or debt, which dilutes the company‚Äôs value. Likewise, if their high growth stalls for even one quarter, the stock will go into free fall. So you need to monitor earnings results very closely if you own one of these stocks.\n\n**Creating a Portfolio That is High Risk**\n\nIf I had a hundred dollars for each time someone asked my opinion about Nio, PlugPower, or Docusign, I‚Äôd be able to pay a full year‚Äôs college tuition. Yea, these stocks have done very well until now. But they are volatile stocks all based on the premise of future domination with little evidence to back that up today. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I LOVE growth stocks. But they should compose a portion of a portfolio, not the whole pizza.\n\nI allocate 20% of my portfolio to growth stocks and that‚Äôs pretty high, but I‚Äôm willing to lose over half of that for the longer term gains. I would never be 100% growth stocks as that is an easy way to experience immense pain as these stocks are likely to crash heavily as we‚Äôve seen recently. And I buy and sell these stocks - I don‚Äôt hold them forever.\n\nThere are far better experts than I at creating the killer portfolio allocation, but my advice is to carve it up into stable dividend payers like Verizon, large cap leaders in tech like Apple, large cap healthcare companies (I like Anthem), large cap payments companies like Visa and Mastercard, strong value mid-cap companies like my favorite: Crocs, some consumer staples stocks that people need even when things are bad, some semi-conductors that aren‚Äôt overpriced, and companies leading in new industries that actually make money. \n\n**Buying At The Peak Price**\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever bought at the peak, the following scenario should sound familiar: An event happens, the stock you‚Äôve been hearing about all year, which is up 100%, rallies 13% today and another 15% the next day. Analysts up their price targets, the news is buzzing that the company is unstoppable, and days later the stock is up another 50%. You‚Äôve heard about this company for a long time and have wanted to buy it but waited. Everyone you know owns it, brags about their gains, and it looks like it‚Äôs making another unstoppable, huge run. Not wanting to be left on the sidelines missing out again, you throw some money at the stock, buying at its peak. A week later, UBS calls the stock‚Äôs valuation detached from reality and lowers its price target, sending the stock down 15%. In the days that follow, it continues to sink, with analysts downgrading their estimates. Then they miss their earnings target, and the stock plummets further. You‚Äôre unsure what to do, so you do nothing and watch your losses pile up. You are the bag holder.\n\nIf the description above sounds uncomfortably familiar, don‚Äôt fret: you‚Äôre not alone. We‚Äôve all been there. The only thing to do is to learn from the events and take the lesson that it‚Äôs very risky to buy at the peak, where a peak can be defined as the point at which everyone knows about it, is talking about it, and has already invested in it. If you come in after, you‚Äôre taking on more risk than the possible reward. So what should you do when you want to own that stock? Wait. Set a reasonable entry point and wait. You might have to wait 9 months. Women do this for children all the time while being wildly uncomfortable. You can handle not buying a stock for 9 months.\n\nThere is another way to play it that‚Äôs more complicated: you could pick a price that is a little above your entry point and sell a put. That gives someone else the right to sell the stock to you at that price and in return you collect the premium for the contract. If the stock you want is trading at 300 and the price you want to pay is 200, sell a $30 put at 230. If the stock never comes down, you make $30 a share, and you have profited from the stock. Congrats! If it does come down under 230 and the contract is exercised, you end up buying the stock at 230 but pocket a $30 premium, making your net purchase price 200 - just the price you wanted! Win win.\n\n**Losing Faith & Conviction**\n\nAfter taking a beating on a stock or ten, it‚Äôs easy to lose faith in your abilities to make sound investments and even easier to lose conviction in your other stock purchases. It‚Äôs these moments where you need to remind yourself that the market goes up AND down and you will have many more years to make money (if you‚Äôre healthy) provided you learn from your mistakes and continue trying.\n\nI write down everything I‚Äôve learned in a list that I revisit time and time again. This list is now 30 points strong on what not to do based on 30 ways I‚Äôve lost money. It‚Äôs now a list of how to make money in the stock market (and how to populate blog content).\n\nIf you write down what went wrong, you‚Äôre committing to lifelong learning and to be improving. If you don‚Äôt and opt to wallow in self-pity, you‚Äôre bound to not only repeat these mistakes, but you‚Äôre likely to sit out on future market rallies because you lack conviction. The best buying opportunities comes when market participants feel powerless and are willing to sell their stock at steep discounts.\n\n‚ÄúWhen there‚Äôs blood on the streets, buy property.‚Äù\n\n**Not Having an Exit Plan**\n\nHow much money do you want to make on your investment? The answer can‚Äôt be infinity and I don‚Äôt know isn‚Äôt much better. Professional wealth managers aim for 6% a year, net of fees. The S&P 500 returned an average of 7.5% over the past 20 years.\n\nSo what will I do if a stock I own goes up 300% in one year? I sell it and wait for an opportunity to buy it again when it comes back down to earth. Why? Because I‚Äôve accomplished the returns I‚Äôm looking for. I sell it because I reached my exit price, even if that happens a lot faster than I thought it was going to because my goal is to make money not to own stocks.\n\nSome stocks¬†*are*¬†long holds. Visa, Apple, Microsoft, Google - it‚Äôs ok not to have a lifetime price target on these. For others less established, I like to have a goal. I bought Lemonade stock at $44 for example. When I bought it pre-IPO, I thought it was a 10X stock over 10 years. In the first year, the stock skyrocketed to 175. It was too much too fast for the trajectory I was expecting so I sold some at 80 and the rest at 120. Making 2 x and 3x my money in one year reached my goal of 10X return over 10 years in terms of the annual return, so I was out. I also thought the valuation was not justified. Others agree, and the stock is back at $44 now. If I had bought and held, I would have achieved no profit. Instead, I grossed $50,000 on a $20,000 investment.\n\nIn case you‚Äôre curious, I do plan to buy Lemonade again IF they can prove they are able to gross more revenue per existing client. Right now they are paying too much for customer acquisition.\n\nJust remember to take taxes into account when determining your profit targets. In my case, I held LMND for a year prior to selling, so I paid capital gains taxes not income tax rates.\n\nGood luck.", "id": "rr5xz1", "created_utc": 1640776757.0, "score": 1128, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 159, "comments": [{"body": "Top tier shit post.\n\nMe - not having $200,000 saved me $200,000 in losses this year.", "score": 987, "replies": [{"body": "Amazing outcome", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "The only plausible one", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "#winning", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "And all the friends we made along the way.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "in other news, 100% of the people that didnt die, are alive.", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "wonder why OP didnt post on wsb lol", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "They're auditioning for a Seeking Alpha gig.", "score": 29, "replies": []}, {"body": "Clearly not decerebrate.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Financial advisers *HATE* him because of this one easy trick!", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Congrats on your top tier strategy", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Perfect hedge", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "You fucking beat me", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "we are not the same", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Op should also share his ‚Äú30 points‚Äù list he lost money", "score": 89, "replies": []}, {"body": "What the fuck's an exit strategy?", "score": 99, "replies": [{"body": "Hold until it's delisted", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "A margin call.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Something MSM articles tell you to make so you can exit good positions instead of holding them for better gains", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The peak bullet is BS.

{"title": "Anyone else seeing huge value opportunities in this market?", "selftext": "Is it just me, or has cheap gotten really, really cheap? No, it isn't just me. Even though value did well this year, the value spread is still near the biggest it's ever been (I like AQR's insights on this). That means that the stocks that have low P/E, P/B etc. have gotten cheaper, while those with astronomical ratios or negative earnings have gotten more expensive.\n\nThe most obvious and widely known one is probably T. Doesn't even need to be discussed, really. Buy one cheap telecom with huge earnings, get one big media/streaming company for free. Telecoms overall are unreasonably cheap... check out KT Corporation for example, it's fun.\n\nAnother one is the big Russian gas company. It's not going anywhere, being among the cheapest producers of the world's most important \"green\" energy source, with the biggest reserves on earth. Not to mention europe's suicidal energy politics. Going to get a dividend yield of 20-25% on my cost basis, would buy more but it's already over 10% of my portfolio...\n\nThen there's VIAC, which is priced like it wouldn't even exist in five years. No, it still makes a lot of money, has a fast growing streaming service, and a huge library of content. Maybe a buyout candidate?\n\nAn interesting one is Rolls Royce. It makes stuff like plane engines and energy systems, and is researching small modular nuclear reactors which may become the saviors of the planet. Priced like it's going out of business next week with a P/E of 4.\n\nThe Crown Jewel of China, BABA. It's gotten so much hate recently that I just had to buy some. Anything sub $150 is a steal for this kind of growth and moat. I missed my chance with Amazon, so why not try with the next best thing? Worth now the risk of a \"hostile takeover\" by CCP, IMO.\n\nCorsair. This has been popular on some unsavoury places, but maybe not entirely without merit. PC gaming is growing, so why wouldn't this stock grow too. The company isn't 50% worse than it was less than a year ago, as the share price would indicate. Hugely shorted.\n\nGold miners are cheap as hell while still making nice earnings. One would think that gold would get some love in an inflationary environment? I dunno, maybe it's just not that popular right now. The best time to buy.\n\nThen there's the entire nuclear fuel market. Every investor in the know has a small stake in it, simply because of the asymmetric risk/reward ratio.\n\nSome other cheap stocks that I own but maybe wouldn't add too much at this point are MU, KHC, WBA, INTC, some small steel companies and banks. And \"cheap\" tech SPOT, TWTR.\n\nShare your cheap stock ideas or criticize mine!\n\nDisclaimer: I own stock in all of the companies mentioned, have used long term margin to buy them, and am going to buy more in the near future.\n\ne: can't believe I forgot to mention Berkshire Hathaway.

We spend millions making sure e-sports \"athletes\" use our gear and have our logo on their t-shirt and fans notice that.\n\nc) It's not just gaming that is growing but streaming too. Our streaming gear like Elgato capture cards, microphones, web cams and other will surely benefit.\n\nd) In addition to streaming gear we are also starting streaming coaching service that is much higher margin business and growth segment.\n\ne) What really separates us from our competitors is that while we have competitors only selling PC cases and only selling keyboards and only selling RAM sticks, we sell it all. You can almost build entire gaming and streaming setup only using our components. Not just that but it all integrates into the same system via our iCUE software and then it all plays nicely together. So your RGB RAM sticks are synchronized with RGBs on your keyboard. That's pretty neat and something that no other competitor can offer. Therefore, we will get larger share of purchases in this growing industry.\n\nSo that's, I think, what Corsair would say to that. This is not just my imagination but pretty much what they are saying on their quarterly calls. Trust me, I'm as skeptical as you are if that can materialise as they predict it would but at the same time its not baseless or ridiculous that Corsair can grow at a nice clip. And you know, if something is trading at 100x PE then you better grow fast or you have no business trading at that valuation.

Let's discard 2008 from that data (I invested after most of the housing crisis, and my biggest trade was buying Fannie Mae at $0.69 and selling it at $1.40--this isn't exactly \"suriving the crisis\", I just got in after). From 2009-2021 I outperformed the S&P 9/12 years. Assuming a 50% chance of outperforming the S&P in a given year, that's 9 successes in 12 years, which can be modeled as a binomial distribution.

In this way, VTI is much more diversified and will likely be less volatile long term.  So it just depends on your risk tolerance.

Means growth of Tesla is severely constrained, costs are higher, and cars do not improve as hoped.\n3.

Assuming they won't happen does not make sense. If they do happen, the cars improve in every way, and you drive further demand and greater margins. Even without them, Tesla's continued innovation should ensure the cars are more and more in demand each year. And as to FSD... Latest videos of v 10.8 are absolutely incredible.

This week we found out a coal pit is using 171x the water that Giga-Berlin would use.  A judge has signaled he intends to deny operational status to both Tesla and the coal pit.  Since the construction of Giga-Berlin, I have gone from viewing Germany as being great at engineering to being great at bureaucracy. \n\n#2 Tesla Solar Residential.  \nThis should be a Home Run, but Tesla seems intent on playing in a Thunderstorm.  Customers are taking out Home Equity loans for Tesla Solar only to have Tesla cancel their estimate and then double it for \"Complicated roofs\" or supply constraints or whatever excuse they give solar customers.  These people have to cancel installation and are stuck with loans they have to pay back.\n\nAlso, where is the Gigafactory that is building Residential Solar panels?  Buffalo is supposed to be the location for that, but we hear no news of automation lines or increases in production or capacity.  The costs should be coming down with Economy of Scale, but the costs are going up.\n\nThey really need to have someone look at this part of the business.  They want to make Tesla Virtual Power plants from Residential Solar, but this part of the business is weak.\n\n#3.  Poor customer service and Elon Musk\nHang out on here or Teslamotors and you will see examples of poor customer service from Tesla customers.  These are honest people expressing their experience, but their posts disappear too quickly.\n\nElon musk is an engineering genius, but this is his fault.  He has the idea that they can manufacture perfect products and thus you don't need as much after sale support.  It has bern pointed out repeatedly on Youtube that there are not enough Service Centers and Mobile Service technicians to cover the demand.  No one at Tesla is pushing back to Elon on this.  They need better quality and customer service.\n\nThese are the 3 weakest segments of Tesla, in my view.\n\nThere are many bullish reasons to keep Tesla though.\n\nTesla Insurance, Commercial power, Supercharger network opening to non-Tesla cars, Tesla Semi test trucks rolling out to Pepsi, Tesla Austin coming online with Model Y's and soon Cybertrucks, FSD will be available for licensing to other manufacturers.\n\nAs far as ro otaxi's go, that has never existed before so No One knows how much that could make.  It coukd be worth Trillions or $30.  It has never existed before, we have never seen anything like it work anything is a guess.\n\nTesla Bot is an unknown.

At least half of those seemed quite easy and boilerplate in nature.  Clean lane markings, very common sign markings and positions... light to no traffic...  no hedges, walls, or vision obstructions...\n\nI'm thinking this means I've got some kind of calibration or camera problem.  That, or the software is substantially less optimal for our older X.

Trying to think back without bias (difficult, really) I'd hazard a guess that most of the failures were in the poorer lighting situations.\n\nIt also had a tendency to \"jump\" when crossing manhole covers... appearing to see maybe 1/5 of them as obstructions in the road at the last second.  (This seems to me to imply a poor lighting issue where the manhole cover was not seen clearly until the last second... but that's a wild guess)\n\nSo... any ideas?  When I get home, I'm going to check the cameras for mud/dirt/whatever...  is there any kind of calibration check an owner can do?  If it persists during the day.. should I contact service?  Email the FSD team?

The government chose the one that fit their needs best.  (Usually entirely cost based)  There's a SMALL chance that it was driven by some kind of corruption, which would be obviously bad.  However, there's no reason on the surface to assume it was corrupt.\n\nI mean, think about it.  Just the AVAILABILITY of the more affordable Teslas right now could have been the deciding factor.  There are plenty of plausible reasons to imagine this was a reasonable choice.\n\nOf course I'm not happy about it, being a Tesla shareholder.  That doesn't mean it was wrong.\n\nThere are a lot of people trying to tear down government as an excuse to sell off all kinds of stuff the government should really be managing.  The goal should be to stop throwing a lot of effort into ripping things apart and try to actually just work on fixing the places where the excess or failure occurs.\n\nSeriously.  Practically, what would the government NOT making the choice on what the police drive look like?  There's already a bidding process most of the time.\n\nThe fix in this case 100% is to check that the bidding process worked and was not influenced unfairly.  The decision remains with government in this case.\n\nWhat's the alternative?  Privatize the entire police force?  We have movies about that.  They're not showcasing a good thing there.\n\nThe government is not nearly as inefficient as it seems.  The constant pressure to reduce budgets creates substantial pressure to be more efficient.  There are very high profiles of cases where that is not true... and it tends to make people think all of government is terribly inefficient.  It's not.\n\nGovernment is least efficient when the pressure to reduce budgets is low.  (US Military)  Most of government is a huge collection of tasks that nobody gives a shit about until they stop working.  This means the visibility is low, so the risk of a budget cut is high.  It has to be efficient.  If there's some way to cut out money and still accomplish the task, it tends to be done.  This overall happens TOO much... the budgets are cut to some level of \"acceptable\" failure... where thinks are breaking but not enough to claw some money back.\n\nIt's the highly visible inefficiencies or failures that are driving people's decisions, and they shouldn't be.\n\n...\n\nThink of it like Tesla car fires in the recent past.  Obviously, people were used to gas car fires and they're just not noteworthy and certainly not newsworthy.  Tesla fires?  Newsworthy.... so that was brought to the foreground and thought about much more.  So, even though objectively Teslas were far, far less likely to catch fire and have tragic outcomes when they do... people were afraid of Teslas and thought EVs were unsafe.  The anecdote of a Tesla on fire overrode the actual data of what is objectively safer.\n\nNothing could be more ridiculous than the freak out over FSD.  Over a million people a year die in cars.  That's the standard.  And yet, one distracted human monitor failing to correct a failing of autonomy killing one woman created incredible outrage and pressure to abandon the effort.  Uber did give up, ultimately... possibly, to some degree, due to this incident.  That's certifiably insane.\n\nIt may sounds callous to even talk about.  \"How can you trivialize her death?\"  Well, it was tragic, it shouldn't have happened, and it had a massive impact on the lives of everyone involved...  JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER CAR DEATH.  Fundamentally, the \"you're disrespecting her death\" is in itself a MASSIVE disrespect of all the other deaths.  These decisions should be objective and they're simply not.\n\nPeople are fundamentally TERRIBLE at objectively weighing what decisions are good or bad.  It's the exceptions to whatever it is that we're used to that drive decision making.  It's bullshit.\n\n(cont)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "...  \nIf the primary need something is serving is in conflict with the goals of capitalism, then it should not be managed by commercial companies.  Competition towards higher efficiency is the primary benefit of capitalism.  This is in conflict with capitalism's main driving force of trying to create or extract as much value for yourself as possible from the market while giving up the least.  That doesn't mean capitalism is bad... it's the best form of management overall that we've implemented to date.  However, that doesn't mean MORE capitalism is the answer to everything.  That is an overly simplistic view.  \nThere is no better example of capitalism gone off the rails as the state of medical care in the United States.\n\n  \nIf a healthcare executive is given a choice between making the company more money vs. something that could improve their actual product they will choose more money 99% of the time (I'm including services in \"product\").  This extends to actually making their product worse to make more money.  Only government can ultimately regulate that, and it's seriously dropping the ball.  In healthcare, these executives are constantly making decisions that kill people so that they can make more money.  People choosing the market product that works best only works up to a point.  At some point, when the choices are limited enough or the information about those choices is limited enough... that dynamic doesn't work.\n\n  \nMedical care in the US fails partially because the information about the various costs for things is not nearly transparent enough.  The lack of choice in care is also a factor.  Medical care is tied to your job, which is HORRIBLE.  You don't get much choice on what plans you can choose from, your employer chooses that subset.  You can't go off and start that garage startup because your family needs health care. These things combine to, in capitalism, create dystopian outcomes.\n\n  \nThe tied-to-your-job thing is 100% due to human nature.  If you're given free choice, almost all the young people would never choose to buy health care.  Through random bullshit we've ended up with tying it to your job and taking away some choice just to force more people to have it.\n\n  \nTHIS IS SOMETHING THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD FORCE ON EVERYONE.  You know, like every other industrialized country in the world.  It should not be a free market choice.  It is not heavy-handed or orwellian, it is a rational choice given the constraints of human nature  and what bad decisions people would make if given that choice.  That's EXACTLY the kind of thing government should do.\n\n  \nThis extends to the makeup of what that health care looks like.  You can't let people pick and choose what they want to pay for, or they'll simply choose the cheapest thing and take their chances.  They'll make objectively bad decisions for themselves, based on subjective ideas of the immortality of youth or how few of their peers had similar problems.  Again, people are BAD at seeing what's important and what's not.\n\n  \nThe medical cost information failure is primarily caused by the consumption of product being often non-optional.  You can't just tell the doctor to try to diagnose your injury from a fall without an X-ray.  You need one, the hospital has one place to go in their radiology department... whatever it costs is what it costs and there's no point in showing the patient a list of fees until after the fact.  You have limited choice on which HOSPITAL you're at.  It's by far just the closest one.  Same thing on medication.  I almost never know what a prescription is going to cost until after I've gone to the pharmacy and I have them fill the order.  The doctor may weight choices with you a little bit... but that tends to come down to telling you about a generic form of it and helping you get the cheapest option for the exact same medicine.  It's fucking criminal when doctors prescribe an original medication with an entirely valid generic without telling you or giving you a choice.  Not, really, criminal of the doctor... but of the system.  The correcting incentive on the doctor to consider the costs is just too weak.  Capitalism fails a little bit here.\n\n  \nNotice how much cheaper drugs are when there's a generic option.  That's capitalism actually working a little bit.  IT REQUIRES CHOICE.  That choice MUST be visible to the person actually paying for it or it doesn't work.\n\n  \nThe choice of procedures is also driven by a lack of choice.  The healthcare worker is going to choose the treatment or procedure that they think has the highest chance of doing the most good.  There's little selection for cost in this equation.  Sure, there might be some... but overall the standard of care will drift towards what works best, not what is the most cost efficient.\n\n  \nA cynical person might say the standard of care drifts towards what maximizes what the doctor or hospital can extract from the patient or really their insurer.  \nThese are forces that cause capitalism to be a poor fit for medicine.  The balancing forces that contain excesses to create an efficient market are simply too weak (FAR too weak).  \n\n  \nThe poor decision making of the average person when it comes to planning their health has to be guided.  Some decisions have to be forced.\n\n  \nNow... at a fine level capitalism works in medicine.  Capitalist competition between laboratory services drives what doctors and hospitals choose.  Competition between device manufactures also works.  The doctors and hospitals SEE THE COSTS and have the time to make choices without someone dying while you're considering.  Importantly, the choice has no impact on the price to the customer.  A GP visit is a fixed amount... possibly tied to duration or what was done... it doesn't vary in cost due to what lab the doctor used.  So, since it's NOT just shrugged off as something passed on to the customer anyway... it's much more efficiently chosen.  It actually directly impacts the person making the choice, so it's chosen more efficiently.\n\n  \nA limited amount of choice is not a problem for government... at least, not to the degree that it is for an efficient capitalist market.  The power that government has in changing the rules of the game is substantial.\n\n  \nInformation visibility is also much less of a problem for government, as it can be delegated to a small set of people who set policy instead of only working if EVERYONE knows.\n\n  \nSure, the potential for abuse is high, and the costs of failure is high... but that's what checks and balances are FOR.\n\n  \nMake and enforce better checks and balances.  Throw out what doesn't work and keep what works.  (It's not just continually adding more regulation)\n\n  \nGovernment is a critical institution in civilization.

The socialist viewpoint is the source of their environmentalism, not the other way around.\n\nSocialists think there is something fundamentally wrong with the whole system of governance, and that we should change to a new system to 'fix the environment'.

{"title": "NIO sucked this year, why it looks promising in 2022", "selftext": "Nio is down nearly 40% this year. I manage almost $250K worth of shares and call options so the pain is REAL. Can't afford the double-doubles anymore, have to buy singles w/ no drinks :(\n\nSo with that disclaimer, here's why NIO is a buy at this $28-30 range, aka now.\n\n1. **Marketing/Strategy:** The Nio team have been textbook perfect in their execution.-It's paramount that an early stage startup targets and monopolizes a niche market of \"non-consumers\" before taking on the world. In the vein, Nio targeted the luxury EV market segment in China.\n\n\\-Furthermore, within the luxury Chinese EV niche, they targeted busy salarymen/women that couldn't afford to wait 30-minutes for a turbo-charge. A sub-10-minute battery swap addresses this market segment's need to replenish charge on the go. Furthermore, with cute ai-robots, passenger massage chairs, and a dealership that feels more like a country club, Nio has distinguished itself in its domestic market from non-native competitors like Tesla and BMW. This tightly controlled distribution strategy allows Nio to scale up safely while improving cash flow before they expand to new markets.-Nio then smartly targeted the Norwegian market, which has the highest per capita market share of EV's in the world. At Nio Day, they had Alan Walker (Norwegian musician) to headline the event.-Also at Nio Day, they revealed an expansion plan that includes most of Europe and the United States.\n\nNet Result: Nio was able to hit 100K car deliveries in half the time it took Tesla (12-years), despite the chip shortage, factory shutdowns from the pandemic, and skyrocketing competition from incumbent players (We must still thank the almighty Tesla for being the pioneer, and on another post, I might outline why VW and GM will likely fail to take significant market share in the EV market).\n\n2. **Pricepoint**\\-Consumers of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles have been conditioned to allocate a monthly budget to pay for gas, oil changes, and maintenance fees. Nio offers a subscription fee to lease the battery, which is the most expensive component of an EV. Not paying for the battery up front dramatically reduces the cost of the vehicle, expanding customer acquisition, and also increases the lifetime value (LTV) of each customer. A luxury car like the ET5 can cost just $40K (comparable to the Model 3 or a BMW 3-Series), yet those same customers will be paying Nio's subscription fees for years and become loyal customers over time.\n\n3. **Partnerships**\\-Nio is changing the way we think about \"gas\" and \"gas stations\". They partnered with China's largest oil and gas station company, **Sinopec**, to build more battery swap stations. They also partnered with **Royal Dutch Shell**, to again, build more swap stations. They are fundamentally changing the ecosystem in a way that Li and Xpev are not.-Nio is also going to collaborate with BYD to build an affordable consumer line of cars. Imagine EV's that cost as much as a Honda Civic. With the BaaS model, this is possible.\n\n4. **Case Study**\\-Nio reminds me a lot of failed EV startup, **Better Place. Better Place,** had a charismatic founder with a talented engineering team. They were the first to implement a Battery as a Service model and built battery swap stations across Israel.The key difference? Better Place brand was not very recognizable. They didn't spend money on marketing because they spent way too much cash on building the costly swap stations and Renault cars that had to be repurposed for swaps. Better Place went bankrupt after selling around 1K cars.-Quick reminder, Nio sold over 150K cars to date in a shorter amount of time, and have formed the necessary partnerships to scale their swap stations worldwide. Nio also has the cultural benefit of Tesla, which paved the way for the EV market and changed consumer expectations of EV's.\n\n**5.** **Substitution Curve: The Sleeping Giant**\\-The adoption of disruptive technologies tends to follow an S-curve--slow, seemingly low-slope linear adoption rate for the first couple years, followed by what seems like an abrupt, massive expansion, and finally, an asymptotic move towards 100% adoption by late-comers.-If you plot the EV market (v.s. ICE market) on this curve on a logarithmic scale, with the y-axis having percent market share and x-axis being a timeline, we're literally at the halfway point of reaching full disruption, that is, we have about 4-7% market share of EV's right now (depending on the source), which is absolutely insane considering the global disruption of the pandemic in 2020.But anyhow, according to this curve, in 9-10 years, EV's will reach near 100% market share. With Nio, we don't have to wait 10 years---every new milestone and increased delivery figures, will de-risk the stock and increase Future Revenue projections (less discounts). That means if ET5 sales really do blowout expectations (rumors on 100K pre-orders), and if the European market contributes a meaningful, stable number of sales, and if it lists on the Hong Kong stock market to improve liquidity, Nio will become a huge investment in only the next couple years. Don't miss the boat.\n\n**6. So why are we down so much**\\-**Chinese Stock and De-Listing Fears:** Look at DiDi. Baba. CHL. Why should Nio be a safe place to park your money? Nio has been compliant at every step. They secured a certificate from the UN's cybersecurity panel on compliance. They have also been extra compliant with the NYSE and China's respective commissions. This is because Nio needs America more than ever to breakout as a new Car supplier. China knows this. So does Elon Musk of Tesla. America (at least the politicians) needs Nio too, to increase job rates, and to hit the target for EV adoption. CEO, William Li, is also doing everything he can to avoid the Chinese billionaire crackdown/scrutiny. He professes to live domestically, in a studio apartment. He doesn't dress lavishly. And he is very vocal about coming from a working class background.-**Interest Rates vs. Growth vs. Value:** When the Fed Raises Interest Rates, Growth Stocks will tank as whales want to lower their beta by parking their money in safer bonds. As hinted at earlier, Nio has a tremendously large future revenue projection. When this is further de-risked by hitting the holy grail of profitability, shares will spike. This is what happened to TSLA in 2020. It's almost like a switch that opens the floodgates. The key to investing now is to avoid missing this inflection point. Ignore the 10 even 20 dollar fluctuations. We're talking hundreds of dollars in share price here.\n\n**7. Tail Winds:**\\-**Currency:** Chinese Yuan relative to the USD has been rising over the last couple months and is near all time highs. That means every profit generated per car equals more dollars on earnings reports.-**Listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange:** it was supposed to happen earlier this year according to rumors, but we're still waiting for it. It's dry powder as it is still very much on the table. It will provide further liquidity and volume for the Nio Stock.**-Upcoming ET5 and Norway Deliveries:**With the lack of hype, investors have low expectations. Anything that improves delivery numbers to greater than 15K on a given month will be huge for Nio.\n\nTLDR - Nio has been textbook perfect as a business, thanks to validated learning samples provided by the successful Tesla and the failed but similar Better Place.-The FUD on China stonks is scary but doesn't apply to Nio as it has demonstrated meticulous compliance at every single step. Nio really wants to be a global player. They made that explicitly clear on Nio Day 2021.-EV Market's growth is on track to be exponential in the coming years. Tailwinds like new exchange listings and increasing Chinese currency valuations make Nio a clear winner that could potentially grow 10x from where it is now.\n\nI'm an ape man that loves to eat in and out burgers and raising kane's.

If you assume that they act rationally, I don't think that's always the case. If NIO strays from the commie and narrow just once, they will get a huge kick in the balls just to give an example to the others. If you look at Tencent and BABA, you'll see that apart from the \"regulatory\" excuse of the day, the CCP kicked these company in the balls \\*to show they can\\*. This can happen to anyone, at any time, for any reason and for no reason. The regulatory issue is always found, and might actually be \"found\" after it was ignored for years. \n\nIt's not a safe investing environment.

On the recent Nio Day, CEO William Li not only talked about expanding Battery Swap stations, but also fast charge stations. Nio is already working on making charging faster and more accessible, as well as improving their battery capacities. Their ET7 will come equipped with a solid state battery that has over a 1km range. It's more than possible that their network of battery swap stations will become mere charging stations in the future. That would mean no more BaaS, but, from an investment point of view, this means that they have already achieved some level of market dominance. \n2. Admittedly, I don't have a good answer for this. I was invested in BABA for 10 years (10-years ago), and what I did gather was that the incumbent administration of today did not like Jack Ma for some reason. One could read the tea leaves leading up to his \"canceling,\" if you followed the news daily.  Nio and William Li has the benefit of hindsight in terms of why and how the Chinese government treats corporations a certain way. Thus, another metric of success in China is how well the company and its leaders stay in line. Nio seems to be good at it, for now. I don't know what the CCP wants beyond this--that they want to eventually replace all ICE vehicles with EV's by a very aggressive date (in the next 5-10 years). They want and desperately need a sustainable future because the alternative would spell doom for them. They need to include the involvement and collaboration of other countries like the U.S. and Germany etc, which they're kind of doing by opening up distribution channels with Elon Musk/Tesla, and BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen etc. and also collaborating on IP such as Nio's design schemes and engineering features.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm a dreamer, but i cant help but wonder if your post gave NIO more traction for today.
