San Francisco-based Square has since added a peer-to-peer digital banking app, small business lending, received a bank charter and offers crypto and stock trading. The company has acquired buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay and Jay-Z’s music streaming service Tidal. It’s also doubling down on bitcoin with a crypto-focused business called TBD.\n\nAs part of the Square rebrand, a separate part of the company “dedicated to advancing Bitcoin,” known as Square Crypto, will change its name to Spiral.\n\n“The name has many associated meanings for the company — building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome,” Block said in a statement.\n\nDorsey stepped down from his other job as Twitter CEO on Monday after running both Twitter and Square since 2015. Dorsey cited a belief Twitter was “ready to move on from its founders,” and will now have more time to dedicate to Square’s growing portfolio. But Dorsey is also expected to focus on his fascination with cryptocurrency.\n\nThe news comes roughly a month after Facebook changed its name to Meta to reflect on CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s plan to build a virtual world called the metaverse. Google famously renamed itself Alphabet six years ago in a similar move to reflect other lines of business.\n\nSquare was one of the biggest winners of 2020 as consumers shifted to digital payments. Shares are down roughly 2% so far this year, as investors rotate away from higher-growth tech names.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/square-changes-corporate-name-to-block-.html", "id": "r6pwhr", "created_utc": 1638394622.0, "score": 505, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 180, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 195, "replies": [{"body": "Maxwell?", "score": 21, "replies": []}]}, {"body": " They just added a dimension.", "score": 180, "replies": [{"body": "Few years from now Block will be rebranded as [Infinity](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/theoffice/images/3/35/DunderMifflinInfinity.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100118225704)", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Sad, I was expecting [HyperCube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercube)", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "My guess would've been tesseract", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I will be rooting or tesseract next.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "First thing I thought of too! in the brainstorming they probably thought it was a genius change but in reality its dumb.", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "It's funny, when I read the news I thought that this was the first name change in some time that I actually *liked*. \n\nIt's an easily recognizable and succinct name, it's somewhat clever, has a specific technological association (clearly the company believes in the future of blockchain-tech), and is at the same time kind of a meta-troll. \n\nBut apparently reddit disagrees.\n\nI do think that this should rather be a parent-company type situation where Square is a subsidy of Block.", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "oh certainly. almost exactly like alphabet/google.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "The dude is a negative Nancy", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "God damn it.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's a joke on the name Meta, because Jay Z is from the Block and the company is about empowering certain groups.

The difficulty of the problem raised the question of whether specified axioms of Euclidean geometry concerning the existence of lines and circles implied the existence of such a square. In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem which proves that pi (π) is a transcendental, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.\n \n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "But circle gets the square.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "He's creating the premise for Squid Game", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Spiral and TBD, both are specifically about bitcoin.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "*comment edited with github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite*\n\n    In response to API controversy:\n\n    reddit.com/r/ apolloapp/comments/144f6xm/", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Your friend would casually ask you which stock you bought on that day?

Very roughly speaking, 100 shares = 100 billionths which is one ten millionth of the company.\n\nAfter each quarter, the company releases their financial results, and the most important/relevant number is earnings per share (EPS). This tells you how much of the earnings \"belong\" to your stake in the company. \"Earnings\" represents the amount of income left over after all of the expenses in that quarter. Year to Date in 2021 (through September 30), Tesla has an EPS of $2.85. That number will likely be over $4 for the full year once the Q4 results are announced in January (not investment advice - simply an example to help visualize this concept).\n\nNow, obviously all of that money doesn't come to you directly. Tesla takes that money and saves it for the future or spends it on growth, like building new factories and research and development of new products.\n\nWhen companies are growing, they usually do not return earnings to the shareholders because all of the money is being reinvested into growth. The idea is to spend your $4B dollars of earnings now to generate greater earnings in the future. If you can earn $4B from selling just shy of 1M cars this year, imagine how much you can earn by reinvesting that money in factories, batteries, and more efficient productions methods (ie Gigapress) with the goal of selling 20M cars 8 years from now.\n\nAs long as there is significant opportunity for growth, companies will keep reinvesting their money into their future.\n\nMost companies eventually reach a plateau where they feel like their growth is tapering off to only a small amount per year. This is usually because they have grown out their product line and their production to take a significant portion of the market and there isn't a lot of space for significant growth left. Once this happens, a healthy company will make the decision to offer dividends to their investors. Dividends are a direct payment of a portion of earnings to the shareholder.\n\nThis is where the intrinsic value of a share is derived: the future promise of a direct return of earnings. Eventually, the stockholders will reap passive returns from the efficient operation of the company.\n\nSo, you might ask, how is the value of a share determined in the meantime? The answer is complex of course. Fundamentally, you are buying into the idea that you will receive dividends one day. Now, the company may choose to pay a set dividend amount each quarter, or they may link the dividend to a percentage of earnings. Either way of course, the dividend won't be 100% of the earnings per share, as the company still needs to sock some money away to grow slowly.\n\nEven though dividends won't be equal to total earnings from a company, the higher the earnings, the higher the expectation for the dividend, so higher earnings expectation is always better (obviously).\n\nInvesting is always about analyzing money potential growth in the context of time. If I can invest in a stock generating dividends already, why would I bother with a stock like Tesla which is a long way away from dividends? *Because I believe that Tesla will grow so much that it's worth while to park my money in their shares now*. I will receive no direct income for years, but I am getting in \"before\" the growth.\n\nIn this scenario I am projecting that my ultimate dividend from Tesla will be a much larger percentage of my invested money 10 or 15 years from now compared to the percentage I would receive immediately if I invested in company B tomorrow.\n\nHow do I determine if that is the case? Well, first of all, it's impossible to predict the future, so I can't know for sure. But I can model and estimate.\n\nWhen \"valuing\" stocks, people look at certain metrics to determine if a stock is \"expensive\" or \"cheap\". There are lots and lots of metrics and lots and lots of strategies, too much to go into here.\n\nBut I will discuss one briefly - the P/E Ratio. P/E Ratio is the ratio of your (share price) to (EPS). (Share price)/(EPS) = PE Ratio.\n\nNow, PE Ratio is not the best metric for radical growth oriented tech companies like Tesla. But it is a widely used metric which people talk about often.\n\nThe PE Ratio represents how much future earnings are \"Priced In\" to the stock price already. The higher the ratio, the more future earnings are already priced in, and the more growth you need, as a newcomer to the stock, before you would earn a worthwhile return through a future dividend.\n\nPE Ratio, then, is a way of expressing how much of a \"expensive\" a stock is, relative to a stock with a different PE Ratio. Amazon has a PE Ratio of around 60. Tesla's is 325, which is much higher. Tesla's earnings have to grow 325x to justify the price, while Amazon only has to grow 60x.\n\n(Again understand there are better ways of valuing a rapid growth tech stock, this is just an example to explain PE Ratio)\n\nYou might ask where the difference comes from - why is Tesla so high? The answer is simply supply and demand - how many people want to buy in now for Tesla vs how many people want to sell. Because there is such strong demand for Tesla, it is able to support a high valuation. Put another way, people expect Tesla to outperform even the 324x multiplier over time. Because enough people are willing to buy even with that high multiplier, the stock price stays that high.\n\nHopefully that makes things clear as mud!", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "This is all correct.

{"title": "Are we in a bubble? - Comparing the current stock market rally to the dot-com bubble!", "selftext": "Lately, there has been growing chatter around whether the current rally that we are experiencing over the past one and half years is mainly driven by speculation and if we are in one of the largest investment bubbles ever.\n\n>Why the Stock Market is in a bubble? - [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-bubble-when-will-it-pop-powell-fed-stifel-2021-11)Investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dot-com bubble - [Bank of America](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bank-of-america-warning-sign-shows-drop-2021-11)\n\nEven professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.\n\n>This Will Not Last - [Nick Maggiulli](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/)\n\nAdding to all of this, we can see that the Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s3433pgehv281.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34778dd2920cd572b20e58a75ebdb81594ba003\n\nWhile it’s easy to say that it’s all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back \\[1\\].\n\nSo what I wanted to analyze is: **Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the ‘new normal’ given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?** Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! \\[2\\]\n\n**The Warning Signs**\n\nLet’s first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert — there are a lot of them!)\n\n**PE /Shiller PE (CAPE)**\n\nThe price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.\n\nThe current concern is that as of Nov’21, the Shiller PE for the S&P 500 crossed 40, which is **the highest reading in the last two decades**. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).\n\nThe red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-’00) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.\n\n**Money Supply Growth (Aka ‘Money printer go brrr’)**\n\n1/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020. While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5jqvq1ghv281.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7a500075e0979d44ac904f5fb449b07b0899602\n\n**Increasing use of leverage**\n\nThere are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.\n\n[This survey conducted by Magnifymoney](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/) for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. \\[3\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l1r0n61ihv281.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=f541f20dd534613a3c8be2be4b4709fd3a0ab77a\n\nThe below research by Goldman Sachs shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it’s highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n6dwr02jhv281.png?width=854&format=png&auto=webp&s=919b9e34fc189a3a286ef042acbd6f6603d3a28a\n\n**Rise of new issues and speculative assets**\n\nMore than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO’s this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was [the Rivian IPO](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/rivian-ipo) where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.\n\nSPACs \\[4\\] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov ’21). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors’ desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a [large spike in IPO’s just before the crash.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5vfvqgkhv281.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b96ee7f5ef81380a48d67efa7e3d876be62e16c\n\nThis is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypt\\* where [NFTs are being sold](https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of/#:~:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&text=It's%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.) for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!\n\n**Investor expectations**\n\nMore than the P/E ratio, **investor expectations** seem to be the highest in recent history. The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company's sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7z2l2uglhv281.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=84393a2f7f79adb0848120e7e7b1259ed263ecad\n\nIf you consider a [four-year time period](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/), stocks that had a very high P/S ratio have underperformed those having low P/S ratio since most companies don’t grow as per expectations.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t39wr3pmhv281.png?width=334&format=png&auto=webp&s=59d51624139867fe1a29ad588912baf6e8c544a6\n\nNow that’s a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,\n\n**Are we certain it’s a bubble?**\n\nThere are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let’s look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.\n\n**Low-interest rates**\n\nThis is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the historically low 0.25% that we have now. This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gw4vqstnhv281.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=c78bf3ac750bd3ba1cb375e9d7be56e1082ce590\n\n**New Investors**\n\nIt’s no secret that we all hate Robinhood. But the data they put out during their IPO filing shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yyzegcjohv281.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86dc8058868a637e70a9a9a1e0a86e470a03a72\n\n**401(k) and Index funds**\n\nAs I have highlighted in [one of my previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/)s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up [more than 50% of the fund market](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/). According to [this report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html) from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.\n\nThe key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \\[5\\].\n\n**What’s the implication?**\n\nAs long as the above factors remain as is (Fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital) we might see the party go on much longer than expected\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe market of 2021 is significantly different when compared to the 2000s. As we can see there are more investors, cheaper capital, and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before. So I feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dot-com bubble is a tad wrong.\n\nBut, that’s not to say that all is well. Almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future.\n\nThe expected annual return by investors above inflation is a whopping 17.5% (which is 161% more than what is realistic) — This is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly double-digit return is the norm.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hwjg0ozqhv281.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1aade26701b9a5b5aba29d73ba69a0927465ddf\n\nEven if we are in a dot-com bubble-like scenario, [this thread from Corry Wang](https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915) perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble.\n\nBasically, even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in 2000 (Investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to Tulip mania as early as ‘98), **making money using that information was hard!** There were a few investors such as Mark Cuban and John Templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed, but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected.\n\nIt makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market. But, pundits have been calling a [crash from as far back as 2017](https://fortune.com/2017/08/10/stock-market-crash-today-down-bubble-2017/). Right now based on fundamentals, the chances do look far higher. It does make sense to not make significant one-time investments in the market now. But, changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best long-term strategy!\n\nAs Peter Lynch quoted,\n\n>Far more money has been lost by investors preparing for corrections, or trying to anticipate corrections, than has been lost in corrections themselves\n\nUntil next week…\n\n**Footnotes and Existing Research**\n\n\\[1\\] The amount of commission charged per trade before the rise of the zero-commission trading model was staggering. In the 1980s average commission per trade was $45.\n\n\\[2\\] As always, I am not a Financial Advisor. This is not investment advice. Please do your own research before investing.\n\n\\[3\\] Leverage only makes sense as long as the equity you are investing into would give better returns than the cost of capital at which you borrowed. Otherwise, your losses are magnified as you have to pay the interest for the borrowed money as well as take your losses on the underlying asset.\n\n\\[4\\] For those who don’t know, a [special purpose acquisition company (SPAC)](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxdUEGOwyAMfE05ogABkgOHvew3IgJuihpIBE6j_H7d9rbIYLAGe2aCR1i2ejmEhmzfGk547eAKnG0FRKjsaFCnFB2LrrMy2JmlNt0rQPZpdWw_5jUFj2krb5SyojOCPZwJMoo4Cun16Me7hiDuYMMsNS26fYf5IyYoARy8oF5bAba6B-LeburnJn8pzvPkqbyI3rZDTJ6HLVOZmOVG-bN3H7hvO0tOdlIIobpu7K1SXHIDQUejej9bqXsV-TBUa1aVb32XF8HbMTf04fluy6rLvj4BGxRMmQ6-phcQcnlr_UBI7kQ5HyXhNUHx8wrRYT2A4dfEjy_TAgUqmRsnj04YNUijje57M3yFk1X06IXVghGHuNGv8n_8H82YjVI) is a company that has no commercial operations and is formed strictly to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) for the purpose of acquiring or merging with an existing company. It’s generally considered riskier to invest in a SPAC as it has lower reporting/regulatory requirements when compared to traditional IPOs\n\n\\[5\\] And no, this is not going to cause an [index fund bubble](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/).", "id": "r6e0b3", "created_utc": 1638362931.0, "score": 819, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 362, "comments": [{"body": "Way more people have access to the Stock market nowadays and tech isnt only a speculative asset but has become a huge Part of All our lives.", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "My car is a huge part of my life, thus I believe it to be worth 1 million.

The \"dot-com\" bubble was more of a tech bubble than anything, the \"dot-coms\" was just where the most mania occurred. While I wouldn't argue against subsidies for TSLA or similar as well, I think it isn't correct to say they are \"propping up\" the company and that this is the general case. At first sure, but not any more. Most modern over-valued tech is being propped up by investors throwing billions of dollars into companies that burn money with no chance of ever turning profits in line with their future valuations. UBER and DASH are both examples of these: their business models are fundamentally flawed and there is no possible way they will ever yield returns investors are expecting from them. NKLA, and RIDE, are other examples. CELH is a non-tech company that I think also represents this as well. WeWork, Zillow, recently fallen are other great examples\n\n> second the bond yields back in 1999-2000 were around 5-6% which made them a attractive investment for many institutional investors...the bond yields today are far below the inflation rate and nobody in their right mind would invest in bonds...where does all that money go? stocks\n\nThis argument is exactly the opposite of what you are saying the, yields for bonds are only so low because bonds are *so fucking attractive* right now. The market is unstable, and people are willing to get the shit return bonds are offering for anything semblance of security.\n\nThink this through for a bit: prices are determined by supply and demand. If no one wanted a 20 year bond for a 1.5% yield, why would anyone buy that? They wouldn't, would they? Then why are bond yields so low? The treasury is continuously issuing new bills, so if no one wanted a 1.5% yield on bonds, wouldn't they have to raise the yield in order to sell them? And wouldn't that cause the yield of bonds to go up in general? Why would I buy a bond with a 1.5% yield on the market if the treasury was willing to sell me a bond with a 2-3% yield? That wouldn't make sense. Bond yields are exactly what the market is willing to pay for them because bonds are the hottest commodity on the market right now.\n\n> stocks.

If you actually look at how much money is still sitting on sidelines, I wouldn't be surprised if we see another parabolic move\n\nThis is literally an argument that we are in a massive bubble, just like the dot-com period, though.

Its a tough way to make gains and you need to have patience and know how SPACs work, but it is a fairly conservative strategy if you can get in close to the NAV. If you understand options, selling covered calls isn’t a bad way to make a modest income while you wait as well (just knowing that if DA is announced while you are short calls you could be severely limiting your gains).\n\nSPACs have a “risky” reputation because after the merger about 90% of them lose value due to dilution, PIPEs, and possibly bad valuations. But if you sell the news upon merger, you often are ok. And in the instance you actually like the target company and are okay holding long term, some SPACs have turned out well - see DKNG or SOFI for example.
