{"title": "Don't Ever Take Advice Here Too Seriously", "selftext": "**Take my words with a grain of salt. But always remember, advice may very well be bad advice. Apply critical thinking.**\n\nIt seems like I caused quite a stir here. Oh bad bad me. But my point still stands.\n\nIn October, I made a post about AAPL and asked whether it would be a good time to buy calls. AAPL was trading around $143 a share back then. I wanted to buy calls because AAPL was hitting the bottom trendline of a major ascending channel, according to my technical analysis.\n\nI was laughed at by people here telling me that I was \"stupid\" and that \"it would never work\" and that I was a \"moron\" for believing in technical analysis. I DID BUY THE CALLS, with some doubt tbh, and set a stop loss. Sold them two weeks ago at a handsome profit of 56k.\n\nMaybe I AM stupid, but I'm willing to ask questions and learn from mature, experienced people.\n\n**What I learned is, don't ever take Reddit advice seriously. Trust your instincts, and if you make a mistake, learn from it and move on. Learning from your own mistakes is much better than taking bad advice and then learning from them.** The fact is, as much as some of you want to deny it, this subreddit is made up of a limited number of decent people but a whole lot more adults that, like immature kids, tend to call you peculiar names and throw temper tantrums the second they find your opinions disagreeable, not unlike WallStreetBets. You should always be cautious when getting advice here. That's for your own benefit.\n\nIt's sad that nowadays, people only want to hear what they believe in, but refuse to change perspective and hear the other side out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ob8acbuwcz781.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e6b3eb8aa855a825eda117f1c8ccd0e0e9dbc8e", "id": "rpb14x", "created_utc": 1640568076.0, "score": 852, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 328, "comments": [{"body": "So wait, I shouldn't take your advice or I should?

I also like trending stocks because the IV is typically pretty low despite the stock making large moves weekly or monthly. That means the options contracts will be cheaper. This idea I got from Jamie. The BSM model, which is used to calculate options contracts, doesn't take into account momentum.

I accept it as being a bad idea, but I’m just curious as to the underlying technical reason why it’s a bad idea and was hoping an experienced options trader could enlighten me.\n\nSo if you take something like SPY and look at the daily chart, generally a price fluctuation of $5-15 is “typical”.\n\nAt the time of writing, SPY is trading for $472. If I were to set up a $10 DITM debit spread with 2, 1, or even 0 days to expiration, writing an option with a strike of $467 (15 bucks lower than the current price) and buying a call with a strike of $457 (deep in the money), it would cost about $900 to set up and would net about $100 at expiration.\n\nIt would seem to generate an 11% return on an investment in a very short period of time. In a bull market, it would win more often than not, but would be almost impossible to unload… so anytime it turned against you, you’d probably be looking at a 100% loss, which is, I assume, why this is considered a poor strategy. However, if you were diligent and never risked more than say 1/20th of your account, it would seem to work in one’s favor, over time, assuming a strong bull market.\n\nAre there other fundamental reasons why this would be a “bad” strategy, other than wagering a large bet for a relatively small return and the risk of occasional 100% loss?\n\nAgain, I’m not talking about TSLA here, I’m specifically talking about SPY during a broadly accepted bull market.\n\nI briefly, but not exhaustively, reviewed the FAQ.

You can continue to hold the cheapest GRAB shares and continue to DCA, if you still want to hold firm on your long term forecast.\n\nA covered call doesn't free up capital, it locks capital into a contract that will penalize you if the stock goes up too high.

There's a lot of hype around the notion but the dirty secret of computer science is the vast majority of computer scientists have absolutely no way to leverage quantum computing even if a functional quantum computing chip existed.  It's very similar to the current state of programmable logic.  Sure, FPGAs have existed for a REALLY long time, yet they are still extremely niche and mostly only used in hardware development.\n\nBefore quantum computing can become viable, we'll need a quantum computing programming language or library.  Even after that happens, there is really no guarantee that it will pan out into anything interesting.  The relevant example here is AI/ML.  Sure, there are a bunch of neato libraries and super AI/ML hardware that does have SOME benefits to some industry, but by and large it's not nearly as revolutionary as a lot of people have sold it to be.\n\nQuantum computing MIGHT have some interesting applications, but those applications will likely be relegated to the same areas as, you guessed it, AI/ML and potentially even just a subset of those applications.\n\n Solid-state Batteries - Has the most potential of your 3 ideas but I've not seen a compelling solid state battery manufacturer.  ATM it is much like the state of OLED tech.  Obviously superior, but not really demonstrated to be practical.  There's a lot of money in this sector so anyone that can figure it out will make it big.  The problem is finding the person that makes it.  Still possibly a 20 years out sort of thing as manufacturers will likely stay away until the patents expire.\n\nVertical Farming - A pipedream.  Sunlight is free, the best place to put vertical farms is in cities, and LEDs cost a lot of power to run.  You are effectively looking at 10 acres of growth  for a very large vertical farm.  Getting 1 acre of land in a city for a 10 story building just seems highly unlikely to pan out well.  Especially when those 10 acres end up being dirt cheap 30 miles away from the city and get free lighting.  The only way it works is if you are using it solely for high priced specialty crops.  IDK, maybe that pans out sometimes but I simply have a hard time believing it would work outside of the most densely packed cities.\n\nMy background.  I have a bachelors in Computer engineering,  I grew up on a farm, and I currently work as a software developer in finance reporting :D.

Yes, the equipment and tools to get things to print has gotten a lot better, but it's still just a niche hobbiest thing.\n\nThe fundamental problem with 3d printing (and why I don't think it will ever really take off) is it's just melting plastic into shapes.  There are, frankly, not a whole lot of places where \"plastic shape\" is terribly useful.  Consider the consumer goods you own, how many of them could you replace with ONLY plastic?  A lamp?  No, that needs wiring and metal.  A picture frame?  Nope, needs a glass pane.  A phone case?  Ok, yes... but how much do cheap versions of those cost and how often are you buying them?\n\nHence the reason why the most common use of 3d printing you'll find is things like figurines.  I've heard claims of \"Well, I can replace a part with it without buying it from the store!\" but generally the parts you are talking about are $0.10 a pop and you can order them off of amazon.  I guess you save the time?  But, again, what sort of consumer actually goes through the effort of looking up part numbers and specs to replace a broken plastic bit?  That's right, the 3 3d printing enthusiasts out there ;D.\n\nFor my opinion on 3d printing to change, I'd have to see an evolution past \"just melting plastic\".  And that is just something I don't see happening anytime soon.  The reason it's just melting plastic is because anything else runs the risk of both being too niche and vastly increasing the machine complexity/cost.\n\nRe: telemedicine, I think it's likely to be an ever increasingly major thing.  IDK if it will ever go past diagnosing more minor conditions but I do think you'll see people using it more to save on costs.  Particularly for things like mental healthcare where treatment is just a conversation you can have over the phone.\n\nRe: RPA.  Will likely see it's biggest impact in replacing call centers (already made a pretty big impact there).  But I don't see getting too far.  The main issue with it is there's a cost barrier to entry for switching things over to automation.  That cost might slowly get lower, but I doubt it ever gets to the point where everything is robots.\n\nRPA and Telemedicine are definitely places that might explode somewhat in value but I think they are still somewhat limited in how far they can go.\n\nI'd probably never invest in a 3d printing thing.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "ILIKF - Solid-state Batteries", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Yup quantumscape", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Interesting sectors.

Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges, of any type, in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin *AND* all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. For now, COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict but they are rapidly diversifying their revenue streams (NFT marketplace, custody agent for Facebook's crypto wallet, starting a media arm, etc). Another advantage of COIN is it being the first crypto exchange coming on to a major market exhange is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value. \n\nAs far as the criticism of Coinbase’s business model being eroded by other competitor entrants, COIN isn’t the same as a traditional exchange or broker, whose services are easier to duplicate. Coinbase has more comprehensive services, from custody to exchange to brokerage, and its fees take this larger suite of services into account.

Opening 1 1-month Put or four 1-week Puts in a row returns about the same in Premium (assuming they all expire worthless), but there are almost four extra weeks in the year (12*4=48 weeks vs 52 normal weeks) so there's that.  \n  \nAn alternative is to sell Put Credit Spreads, where you sell a Put (say $850) and buy a lower put (say $800).  This reduces your max risk (and hence Buying Power/Margin usage) from $850/share (stock can go theoretically to zero) to $50/share.  The downside to Spreads is that they're not very defendable.  It's almost impossable to roll a Spread for a credit while rolling a naked Put is easy.\n  \nI used to sell 15% OTM Calls as well, but after a couple of big losses I stopped doing that.  I consider myself a better trader now so where I once would have bought-to-close I'd probably roll these days.  $TSLA has risen 15% in a week 21 times since 2013 for an average of 3.5 times a year, but that includes the wildness that was 2020 (11 times).  Exclude 2020 and the rate drops to 2/year, which is very manageable, so I might go back to those once Q4 is over.

How can anyone seriously say that he's trying to make more people get Covid?\n\nI strongly disagree with some of Biden's actions (or inactions) regarding Tesla, but he appears to be trying hard to combat Covid.

They can unrelentingly drive the cost of production down by taking advantage of large economies of scale, in-house production where it makes sense, novel manufacturing techniques, inventory management, etc.\n\nIt's the second piece where Tesla is going to win. Let the competition set the price and crush them on costs. Legacy auto is completely encumbered by legacy business models. It will not be possible for them to unwind their old ways of doing things (try implementing a business model change at the company you work for and see how far it goes). I would even argue that it would an inefficient use of capital to do so. I don't see any reason why GM should even attempt to make a transition to battery vehicles. The market should just seed a new company that isn't encumbered by old business models and then run GM into the ground. GM has absolutely zero proclivities for the EV transition and has a ton of encumbrances that give them massive disadvantages.\n\nChinese automakers and new entrants like Lucid and Rivian pose a real threat to Tesla's business model but I think that Tesla's pace of innovation is going to get them a 10 year+ period of blue ocean opportunity. Tesla is scooping up all the best talent and are pushing the frontier in power electronics and electrochemical storage. Nobody else knows how to do this stuff because Tesla is inventing it. It's going to take a decade or more before enough engineers leave Tesla and join other companies or start their own before someone else will be able to catch up to them.

Other companies have announced their vehicles and some have even started delivery, but none have been around long enough to show that they can do it at scale. Even the best-selling non-Tesla EV, the Chevy Bolt, has been on the market for 4 years and only sells a fraction of the Model 3 numbers. Also, people are comparing the future potential of other EV companies against where Tesla is **now**, which is a really silly comparison; are they expecting that Tesla is just gonna be frozen in time for the next few years?\n\nTesla is also more of a tech company whose primary product is currently a car, rather than a traditional auto manufacturer. While a lot of arguments can be made for whether their side businesses are viable and profitable, the fact is that no other car company is doing real-world AI training, selling batteries and solar panels, and selling car insurance. If some of these take off, they can take a huge bite out of other markets that other car manufacturers aren't even remotely involved in.\n\nAlso, most of the other EV manufacturers are focusing on only one or two types of vehicles, but Tesla is the only one that currently has a sedan and a SUV, and a truck and semi-truck in development. Tesla is also a common household name amongst the general population; ask the average person to name another EV company and they'd be hard-pressed to do so. They're also the only car company right now (aside from some of the newer EV companies that just started delivery) that sells direct to consumers without involving dealerships.\n\nWhile other companies may eventually get to a point where they're on even footing, Tesla already has a huge multi-year lead over them, not only in sales but also manufacturing techniques and software development. People act like other companies will catch up and surpass Tesla in 1-2 years, which I think is just incredibly silly; it took car companies this long just to realize that they should start doing something, anything, to stay competitive with them.

We now know that’s not true, as it’s been extended yet again to May. It’s foolish to think that students will see enough economic gains between now and May in order to allow to payments to resume due to A) inflation running out of control, B) job maker resistance to raise wages to match inflation, and C) persistent supply chain issues that will continue through 2023, causing intermittent and inconsistent amounts of work in manufacturing and retail, further decreasing job security in what are typically considered as relatively stable job sectors. This will culminate in  a large amount of social unrest, just as the weather starts getting nicer, giving a higher likelihood for marches and protests against resuming payments. Delay again is almost guaranteed, and I think talks of cancellation will come back to the table. Whether or not cancellation happens is moot to the fact that people will panic at the discussion and unload their SLM causing it to drop. \n\nDisclosure: I own 3 puts at $13 for 5/20 because that’s all I would have had to make towards student loan payments next month had they resumed. \n\n\nTLDR: people will not be able to afford their student loan payments by May and that will be real bad news for SLM.
