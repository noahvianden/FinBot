A very simple example of this is that instead of investing or spending money at a local business people are instead buying Treasury bonds.

A shift in the demand curve that causes higher inflation will also cause higher output (overheating).\n\nThe demand curve is defined as:\nAD = C + I + G + (X-M)\n\nSince government spending is just adding to G (government spending) and taking away from from C (consumption) and I (investment). There's really no effect here.\n\nThe supply curve is also unaffected by the build back better plan (this one is probably easier for you to understand)\n\nThe only way you get major shifts in the demand curve are due to.\n\n1: Interest rates shifting (or the effective monetary base expanding, decided by the federal reserve, not congress)\n2: Inflation expectations de-anchoring (they have not)\n3: Economic wealth creation/destruction\n4: FX rates impacting the net exports term (X-M)\n\nA swap of less C and I for more G doesn't increase the total the equation for the AD curve.

Gun possession is, and it is the Dems coming for that. \n\nRegarding abortion, you have to understand the right considers the unborn life.  It is one of the few duties of government to protect innocent life.   So from the rights perspective, it is the left ignoring the human rights of the unborn.   They are not trying to 'take away rights', but protect them.   Now, you may disagree with them,  but using the abortion argument to suggest the right want to remove 'rights' requires a deep misunderstanding of their actual position.\n\nThere are authoritarian right, of course, but the vast majority of people on the right believe in 'live and let live', and want government out of everybody's business. The left tends to mischaracterize the rights positions on a regular basis.  \n\nAs for regulations, most are written by industry lobbyists and actually cement bad behavior behind law, rather than curb it.  For example, labeling organic food organic requires expensive testing that prohibits small farms from labeling their food organic, while having enough loopholes that corporate farms can often label food organic that common sense would dictate isn't.   Likewise, many pollution regulations actually legalize pollution up to a certain (industry approved) amount, and actually hinder progress cleaning up pollution as these factories are now technically following the regs.  There is also no incentive to improve emissions beyond current regs. \n\nThe right does want to get rid of a lot of regulations, and this is part of the reason.  It's not that they like pollution,  it's that they have different solutions (in the case above, some might suggest a community suing a polluting factory on a case by case basis, with each resolution localized and focused on each specific infringement,  without regulations protecting the factory).   Of course, another reason many on the right are against regs is that government interference in industry often does more bad than good; thinking non-expert beauracrats 3,000 miles away know more about a situation than those in the area is all too common.\n\nBut again, talk to your average (non-evangical) person on their right, and they are very, very much against government intrusion into your life.

The example you give, of a community suing, would require the polluting factory to be breaking a regulation or law to have legal standing to sue in the first place. If you remove the regulations, which it seems you are suggesting, but I could be wrong, then what is the community suing them for? It would seem you instead are advocating for stricter regulations that aren’t written by lobbyists and hold the companies to tougher standards, which to me seems like one way to promote innovation. You can either subsidize the outcome you want or penalize the outcome you don’t want, but both are aided by government support.\n\nThere are just some things that I don’t think the free market is cut out to handle. Environmental issues (how do you get companies to be accountable for pollution if it’s not an internalized cost?), healthcare (how do you not penalize people just because they lost the genetic lottery?), education (how do you give access to those who can’t afford the best teachers/schools?), etc. Yes, bringing in the government creates inefficiencies, but those inefficiencies may be preferred to creating such uneven outcomes.\n\nI know there is inherent unfairness in the world, but the role of government should be to improve the outcomes in areas where the free market fails.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The polluter is, by definition, polluting the land of others.  This breach of property rights is what would, theoretically, be sued over.  If the stream running through my land becomes polluted, the business would be sued into oblivion by me and everyone else downstream.  These lawsuits would be dealt with locally, where the community has a vested interest.\n\nWhile certainly not a perfect answer (none will be), this prevents companies from 'riding the Iine' of regulations that the industry themselves wrote.\n\nRegarding health care, giving the government control over Healthcare is a disaster waiting to happen.  First, because the government runs pretty much everything terribly.  They are bureaucrats.  Their mismanagement, over time, will inevitably lead to both tax hikes, and then less services to cut costs, and then more taxes.\n\nMore importantly, health care is not infinite.  Some surgery costs a lot of money, as do some medications.  Giving a government power over who gets what care is a recipe not just for disaster, but absolute disaster.   Who makes these decisions?   Already there are rumors of medications being withheld due to race and other reasons... empowering the government in this arena will backfire. \n\nThis isn't to say our current situation is good - the trifecta of insurance companies,  hospitals, and big pharm interacting is extremely ripe for price gouging (the hospitals need to ask high numbers to cover both insurance denials and those with no insurance, etc, etc).  But the answe is not giving the government more control.   Rather, in many cases we need less regulation than we already have.\n\nFor example, much basic Healthcare is relatively straight forward.  An xray, for example.  But we see massive bills for x-rays because of how our insurance system is structured,  regulations. Etc.  On the other hand, Lasik (eye surgery) is effectively done at mall stores nowadays and so costs are shockingly low.  \n\nWhile I can't offer a perfect answer for this, I think the reform needed is allowing more competition for the basics (testing, x-rays, simple procedures, etc) along the lines of lazik.   I think government control of health care is a ticking time bomb of catastrophic proportions\n.. it is only a matter of time until government bureaucrats use some awful formula to decide who gets treatment and who doesn't. \n\nEducation should clearly be free market.  Our educational system has absolutely cratered since the federal government got involved.  Communities should have complete control over education at the local level.\n\nUneven outcomes are a given.   Two twins born to the same family will have uneven outcomes.  However, those who excel have financial mobility and can create a better world for their children by moving, etc.  This requires generational thinking, something people no longer seem to have.  My father (mom not in picture) worked 2 jobs while going to nightschool... not for himself, but for his family.  Expecting equal outcomes requires handicapping the successful.... read the very short story Harrison Bergeron for a fantastic take on the ultimate result of fighting for equal outcomes (seriously, read it... only like 2 pages long and freely found on the internet)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If removing the regulations would make courts and juries more likely to side with plaintiffs in a civil case because there’s no “standard” the companies can hide behind, then I see your point. I’m just not sure whether the burden on the plaintiffs would be the same in either scenario to show that the pollution is actually causing damage and that the company intentionally and/or negligently did it without some form or regulation to show that guilt. These type of lawsuits have been going on for some time, and a couple have been made into dramatic movies (A Civil Action and Dark Waters). Usually the damages are a drop in the bucket or the company can just spin off the liabilities (like J&J did with the talc cases) and no community can “sue them into oblivion”. I think we can both agree though that letting industry insiders create the regs and laws is the real issue here.\n\nAround health insurance, I agree with you that the government is rife with inefficiencies, but with less regulation how to you maintain equal opportunities to access given variances in people’s genetic predisposition to disease and ability to pay. I’m just thinking about how a freer healthcare market would handle pre-existing conditions and my thought goes to either refusing to help that person because they can’t pay or forcing them into a lot of debt. If the answer is, that’s just how life will be for some people then I get it, but that’s a pretty bleak outcome for people. The US already spends more on healthcare per capita than countries with government run systems and our outcomes are better because of the higher spending either. Also, CBO estimates for a single payer system range from a decent decrease in overall spending to a modest increase. I do agree with you that the finite supply of healthcare would be an issue and needs to be looked at. But we’re already in a world where a system decides who potentially lives and dies through the organ transplant list.\n\nAbout your comparison to LASIK, I think that’s a bit misleading. LASIK is a voluntary procedure whereas you’re usually getting an x-ray for an emergency and you don’t have time to shop around to get lower prices on certain care. Definitely for more preventative and non-emergency care I agree with you that if there’s regulations artificially inflating prices those should go, but for some of the expensive stuff that can’t always wait to find someone who will do it cheaper.\n\nAround higher education (college), I also agree with you there that the Federal government guaranteeing loans probably had a large impact on the rising costs of tuition. But I don’t think the free market at the local level is the right answer. My point is not have equal outcomes, but equal opportunities. If you allow the free market to dictate who attends what school then the people with the biggest ability to pay will dominate the better schools. Some locales in this country could not support paying for better teachers and facilities. I think that is where the government would need to step in at a larger level instead of using local property taxes to pay for public school. Even charter schools have their limits because everyone will want to attend the best school and that school can’t take everyone.\n\nI shouldn’t have used the word “outcomes” in my earlier post. You are absolutely right that there will always be uneven outcomes and we shouldn’t be looking to equalize everyone (read Harrison Bergeron and would agree it’s a dumb idea to handicap success to bring everyone to an equal level). What  I should have said was to promote equal opportunities. There will always be those who don’t take advantage of opportunities or try to scam the system, but when people are stuck in medical debt because they’re genetically pre-disposed to a disease and don’t have great insurance because their job isn’t the best then I don’t see how the free market has a solution for that other than natural selection slowly weeding out that bloodline. Same thing with education, if you’re born in a poor public school district and don’t really have the ability to move to a better one then society might be losing out on that talent.\n\nCongrats to your dad for working hard and making a life better for himself and his children. I can’t speak to what he had to go through, but I’m just saying that he might’ve had some opportunities or luck that not everyone else does have. To the extent possible we should want to make sure everyone has those opportunities. If they don’t take them, that’s their problem.\n\nAppreciate the dialogue!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I absolutely agree the issue is with letting the industry write the regs, but I think that is a natural outcome of government.   Again and again we see government agencies captured by corporations (ie, Monsano execs in the FDA, etc), and regulations being literally written a to zero by lobbyists.  I do not think this is something that can be fixed by more centralized power, I believe it is a direct result of centralizing power.\n\nGiving power to local communities (aka, the people downriver and the judges that represent them) would allow communities to resolve issues themselves, and if an area became corrupt, such corruption would at least be localized and escape. \n\nTo me, the difference with LASIK isn't that it's voluntary, it's that there is competition.  You can't shop x-rays, and hospital pricing is convoluted and lacks transparency.  Basic services become like candy at the movie theater, combined with the aforementioned issues with insurance companies driving up prices.   Iirc, imaging services are hospitals primary profit center.  Giving government even more control over this will not make it more efficient.   Using government funds to subsidize fees (aka 'free' xrays) will not solve this because the hospitals will not suddenly lower prices because the government is paying... if anything, prices (and therefore taxes) will increase.   See the disaster of college tuition once government started providing govt backed loans.\n\nAs for the people who can't afford care, first of all, throughout history hospitals have a history of helping those who can't pay. That's one cause of high costs.  But at least with our current system, most people can choose to get care.  That is, if my kid needed some expensive surgery, I can mortgage the house and sell the car and try to make it happen.   As horrible as that is, I would take it over a bureaucrat telling me my kid \"doesn't qualify'\" for some reason.   Yes, this means richer people will get better care...but this will always be true - connected and powerful people will always have better access to skilled doctors, even if all care was 'free'.  Party membership will always have benefits. At least tying this tangentially to merit (via success) is better than tying it to race, class, or political allegiance.\n\nRegarding schools, we agree with equal opportunity.  But this can't happen... there will be better schools, better teachers.   Even if, say, all teachers made exactly the same amount, better teachers might congregate around, say, nicer climates.   And then those with money/power/connections would want to live in those areas.   \n\nOf course this means richer people will send their kids better schools.  Of course.  Part of the drive to succeed includes providing your children with the very best you can. A good parent should want their children to have the best education they can afford.  There's no 'fixing this, because not only is it natural,  it is unstoppable.   Even if every school had cloned teachers, parents would vie for the school with the least local crime, or best sports, or whatever. We will find a way to rate them, and then fight for the best for our children.   Government should not get in the way of this.    Like it or not, a stable, successful pair of parents will likely raise kids for success better than broken homes (and I come from a very broken home). Imho,  We fix this by supporting more families,not intervening in education.   School choice is a start - the bad schools should be punished, not supported by government shipping them students.    \n\nRegarding the issues of someone who is, say, sicker than most, or whatever,  yes, they may have a harder life than someone else.  This isn't always a bad thing; sometimes it instills a better work ethic, or a simple love of life. Again, I think we need to think generationally.    Most fortunes are gone quickly after the family entrepreneur passes- even phenomenal wealth of, say, the Rockefellers is usually gone within 3-5 (due to family growth,  lack of drive, etc).   And sure, that means that one Rockefeller earned a few generations a life of luxury for little effort, but it also means the power is temporary generationally.  Meanwhile, a high school degree and hard work can lift most families out of poverty within a generation.  This is the beauty of financial mobility, and tying it to merit and hard work.  And yes, some will fall through the cracks - we want to find those geniuses born in, say, a Chicago slum and pluck them into a good school because their success is good for all... but we can't promise everyone this.  Certainly, a merit based system is better than a fixed caste system, or political allegiance.  \n\nI think we do need to fix things, but I don't view the government as the fixer of things.   If anything,  I would argue centralization is the enemy of the people.  We want decisions made locally.  And yes, that means some localities will make better choices.   But other localities are then free to mimic the successes.   Centralization draws out the power hungry, and the inefficiencies and corruption can break everything.   Imho, the last 60 or so years show this pretty well.\n\nAppreciate the conversation too.

I don’t think we’ll ever get rid of that. And to your point, decentralizing that power would make things more difficult to corrupt over a large area since it needs to be done over and over again.  From my perspective, the Federal government doesn’t necessarily need to be the one deciding things, but you do need a level of government to establish the rules for society. Otherwise the powerful will almost always win over those without it. (I know this is what happens today too, but again this is due to human nature and it’s probably pretty naive to think this will ever change).\n\nIn your example of local communities resolving their own issues, this is something they can do today. If you’re suggesting that the federal regulations take power away from the local communities, I’d just again reference my point in my previous comment that it’d be interesting to know if judges and juries are more likely to side with plaintiffs knowing a corporation is causing harm with a regulation in place of without. \n\nStill neither of our solutions really fix the issue of these large companies just litigating smaller plaintiffs into submission and settlements or just spinning off their liabilities into bankruptcy.

If you had to get lasik from the nearest provider or the first one you could find because it was an emergency, pretty sure you’d be paying more than what you would from shopping around. If you didn’t need to get an x-ray right away you could easily call up different hospitals and see what they’d charge. Essentially, hospitals don’t need to compete against each other because they usually have a captive customer base. Maybe this could be due to rules and regulations in place, but I’d have to think that if you had time to truly shop around for different health services you could find lower prices. Definitely agree hospital pricing is convoluted and opaque and it’s probably kept that way so insurance companies have an even bigger reason for existing.\n\nYou’re right about government subsidizing causing inflated prices. No one is going to turn down extra government money if it’s offered to them (again, just human nature). I would say this needs to be more the government taking the role of the insurance companies and negotiate what the prices will be. Similar to how utilities are regulated and rate increases have to be approved, I think healthcare needs to move in the same direction. You could be right that this creates a severe supply issue and that it could fail, but I don’t see how removing regulations improves healthcare pricing when you pretty much have to accept treatment from the nearest place. You often don’t have time to shop around for different prices when your life is potentially on the line.\n\nI’m not sure why the bureaucrat would say your child “doesn’t qualify”. Instead I’d fear the risk of having to wait for a certain surgery, similar to people having to wait for transplants. Just out of curiosity, would you be in favor of people being allowed to sell their organs? I know I’m being overly optimistic about a world where the rich and powerful don’t dominate the successful outcomes (at least health related), but it’s something I think we should aim for (again, given human nature doubt this will ever happen).\n\nYou are absolutely right that there will be better schools than others no matter what. As we both stated earlier, equal outcomes is impossible and shouldn’t be pushed for anyway. But what I’m suggesting is a more even balance of how schools are funded. Using local property taxes just entrenches a continued class system if families can’t afford to move to a nicer school district. Private schools will always attract the best teachers, have the best facilities, etc. because they have the money to afford it. But spreading the property taxes more equitably around the state I think would help. This would still crest imbalances across state lines, but to your continued point you can’t centralize too much. Making sure schools have an adequate budget to help teachers provide a good learning environment I think is imperative. Still agree with your point that poorly performing teachers and schools need to be rectified I’m, but sometimes the poor performance is just due to lack of resources instead of ineptitude. \n\nI’m sure at a certain level, a pair of parents would be better than a single parent (holding everything else constant). But a single parent with the resources to help make their child’s life better would probably raise a more successful child than a pair of parents without those resources. There will always be those who don’t take advantage of what’s available to them, but sometimes you just don’t have those opportunities or for other reasons can’t take advantage of them. \n\nI agree with you that hardships can often breed a stronger person, but in your example about healthcare do you really think someone should have to mortgage their house, sell their car, and go into debt just to survive something they couldn’t avoid? Again, maybe I am too optimistic that we can reach a society where that’s not the case, but I would hope so. As for many of those families you mention, the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Hearsts, etc., they still have large amounts of power and wealth even if it is spread out. Some of them are still worth billions. So even thinking generationally, power and wealth often gets entrenched where it is.\n\nYou’re probably right that government overreach won’t fix these problems because someone’s going to go on a power trip and corrupt the system, but I also don’t see how the free market will fix these either. And if you’re thoughts are still “focus on the local level” I’d say that’s still government intervention, just on a smaller scale. I don’t think the Federal government has to be the one to step in here, but some level of government needs to act in the citizens’ best interest. Hopefully someday that’ll actually turn out to be the case.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think we agree on many issues, but differ on the solutions.  As such, do you mind if I step back and, rather than address specific points made, see if a bird's eye view is helpful to identify our positions? \n\nI think it might, because I think I can explain my distrust of centralized solutions.\n\nFirst, I think we will agree that there are corrupt people, and I also think we would agree the type of person who would abuse power often seeks such power.  This is fundamentally why I dislike giving government power, because...\n\nRight now, we have a diffusion of power between a single Federal government and a multitude of competing corporations with varying motives and goals.  In theory, this should be relatively adversarial as the corporations compete, and the government protects us from overreach, but of course in practice there is often collusion and other issues.   And even when the government swoops in to 'protect the people' with, say, environmental protection, sometimes that leads industries to flee the country for less regulated ones and leaves ghost towns in its wake.   And so, while wildly imperfect, at least we have a decentralization of industry competing. \n\nMy issue with government control stems from this.  When government takes control of an industry, regardless of how good their intentions, they bring with them the power of the State:  lethal force, fines, imprisonment.   They also bring bureaucracy, corruption, and inneffiecies because they do not need to satisfy the profit motive (a corporation must always optimize and serve the client to keep profits coming in over a competitor,  whereas a failed government agency just raises taxes to cover the bloat).\n\nAnd worse yet, this newly empowered government agency will simply attract all the worst power players of industry if industry was somehow neutered. So imho, we are left with a far more powerful (and therefore far more corruptible) system which, even formed with good intentions, is destined, over time, to be far worse than any decentralized system can be.\n\nThat said, I am no friend of corporations by any means.  They suffer from a similar issue - they become so big they do not care about communities.  A shoe manufacturer will use sweat shops in one community while selling product to another, pollute one country while virtue signaling 'green' in another.    It's the same problem any large organization has (including government, nimby policies come to mind).   The only saving grace is they do have competition, and need to protect profits, whereas governments can resort to pure force (tyranny).  \n\nSo I don't think the solution is handing over something like health care to the government. I want everything (including insurance) more localized and within the grasp of the common man.  But that comes from we the people... as long as we don't buy local, as long as we willingly support these companies, we are getting exactly what we pay for.  I don't know how that is easily fixed.   I wish I could trust government to do it, but history is rife with examples of governments killing millions when they go tyrannical, and I don't have a 'it can't happen here' attitude.\n\nIt sounds great to say we should provide for everyone, especially the downtrodden.  But i feel as if that attitude misses a vital point- to a great degree, we do.  Health care today is amazing compared to even 50 years ago. You won't be turned away from a hospital in most cases.   And yes, a disaster might cause financial distress, but how else do we solve for that?  Once government gets involved and finds out how expensive xrays are, do they ban skateboards? Or, like, NYC attempted, ban large sodas due to obesity related health issues?  It sounds silly until we sit down and really address the idea that all things, all resources, all health care are limited and will not be equally divided.   Even if we invented an entirely new system today, there will be those who seek to game that system,  to hoard power within that system, and worse.\n\nSo, for me, the only solution is decentralization.   Lots and lots of systems.  If one succeeds, use it as an example. If one fails, use it as a warning.  And so we have 200 or so countries,  so if one goes rogue others bring it in line.  We have 50 states, each trying to solve local needs.  We have effectively infinite businesses, and more ready to fill any market void.   And there is always (sadly) a natural pull towards centralized power (mergers in business, legislation in government) that we, the people, must fight against.    And to that end, I simply can't give the State what would amount to the power of deciding who gets care and who does not based on whatever metric they decide.  I would take our broken system over that any day (though would prefer we attempt to fix it another way, of course).\n\nIn short, the bad players won't simply go away.  At least now they are spread about, competing with each other (alongside good people).  Centralize power, and those bad players also centralize, over time.

However, there are things that the free market cannot correct for and that is where government needs to step in. It doesn’t have to be centralized in the Federal government, but still we need government intervention, even at the state level, to provide rules for society. Even though there’s the profit motive for corporations to promote efficiency and innovation, that still leads to unwanted outcomes like Ford deciding it’s cheaper to pay out settlements for the Ford Pinto rather than recall and fix the gas tank issue or DuPont willing to keep Teflon on the market because it makes them more money than it costs in environmental/human settlement costs. The technological advancements and globalization we’ve experienced means we can’t really go back to a world where everything is done on a local level. The world is too connected these days.\n\nYes, people are not turned away from receiving emergency care, but at best hospitals just need to stabilize people and aren’t required to necessarily treat the underlying issue. And we still subsidize that care through the high costs and opaque pricing hospitals have (as you mentioned before). Whether we like it or not, we don’t live in a siloed world. What we do has impacts to others. If people want to buy sugary things then make them pay for that through an excise tax, similar to what is done with alcohol and tobacco. I’d think you probably wouldn’t like that idea given it’s additional taxes, but how else do you intend to make people responsible for their decisions that affect others? Perhaps if government offered free healthcare you’d run into a moral hazard issue of people not caring about consequences anymore because they know it’ll be covered and to be honest, I’m not sure how you correct for that.\n\nAnd yes, decentralization helps to limit the ability to corrupt a larger system, but having so many different systems also means they may not work well together and then you have to deal with a different process depending on what system you may be in at a given time.\n\nAll this is ultimately to say, that there are some things that I think are rights to opportunities that everyone should have and I’d put clean environment, healthcare, and education in there.

{"title": "The Death of the Dollar", "selftext": "\n\nThe Death of the Dollar \n\nWithin this survey of the dollar, I will delve into the value of the dollar both past and present and the significance of its value. This delving will yield an understanding of what main factors influence the value of the dollar and thus the impact of that gain or loss of value on the common man. In attempting to discover these influences on the dollar, other fiat systems will be used as an example so as to better understand our own system and possible predicament. While no two situations will ever play out in the exact same manner, even a basic understanding of statistics and correlation will elucidate the importance of these examples. Moreover, once an adequate understanding of the dollar and its likely path have been discovered, I will then look at what is to be done about this course. While hind sight is 20/20, taking harmless preemptive action against a probable outcome surely can do no harm. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l7j5zmbeuj681.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=dacc92746a953a676e0d5f134ad46e5c4b552c9a\n\nLet us first look at the purchasing power of the dollar since 1900 in order that we may understand what has happened in the past. Through this past we may possibly gleam some nugget of the future. As demonstrated by the chart on the right, the dollar has lost most of its purchasing power since 1900. The dollar of 2020 is worth 1/26, or 3.8%, of the dollar of 1900, and why is this? There are two main causes that I attribute to the devaluation of the dollar. the first of these reasons is the government. The government prints money in order to solve problems which increases money supply, thus devaluing the currency. The government also took the dollar off of the gold standard which was preventing the Federal Reserve, whom I will call the Fed or in some cases JPOW, from increasing fiscal stimulus to the degree they thought necessary. Secondly, there is the Fed who has two main tools at their disposal in terms of monetary policy. The first tool is to control interest rates, low rate = growth stimulation ... high rate = economic contraction. The second tool the Fed has at their disposal is the issuance of treasury bonds. This allows the Fed to create Treasury Bonds and give them to the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department then gives the bonds to the banks who in turn sell them back to the Federal reserve thus creating money and fiscal stimulus. When understanding these two main factors it is very easy to see how the dollar of our forefathers was much stronger than the dollar we have today. One must also ask themselves, with rampant money printing and an enormous national debt, should one really expect an increase in the value of the dollar or continued devaluation through inflation? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/abzqiyapuj681.png?width=377&format=png&auto=webp&s=f455dd464e7a8786f4cef730916e1431e9f7f6e7\n\nLet us now entertain that the value of the dollar, and thus the wealth of Americans, were to increase. How could this happen and what would be the catalyst of such a return in strength to the dollar? there are two scenarios that most directly apply to the current situation. Scenario A is that the dollar strengthens and inflation recedes. In order for the dollar to strengthen at this point in time, the Fed would have to meaningfully raise rates. The Fed would also have to cease all fiscal stimulus through its treasury issuance and buybacks in order to give strength to the dollar. If the Fed were to follow this course of action, there would be a decrease in the money supply, restoring some value to the dollar. The Fed has stated that it will cease its treasury issuance over the coming months, and while this is necessary for the beginnings of a strong economy, it is not enough. The other “tool” the Fed has is to raise or lower rates. The Fed recently stated that it plans on three rate hikes in 2022. with these three rate hikes, the interest rate should be somewhere around 0.9% going into 2022. Typically, the stock market doesn’t like news of rate hikes, but during the most recent FOMC announcement, the stock market surged. This recent surge is Wallstreet laughing at the Federal Reserve as they realize that this will have no meaningful effect on inflation. These rate hikes will have no real effect on inflation because inflation is currently, as of November 2021, sitting at 6.9%. With the Federal Fund Rate sitting at .25% the real rates that are experienced on loans are -6.65% what this essentially means is that money is free to borrow, thus leading to the surge in both the stock market and the housing sector since March 2020. \n\nScenario B is my personal favorite as it would be akin to ripping off the band aid. In Scenario B, JPOW would have to raise rates past the rate of inflation in order to slow and kill inflation. In the 80’s, the CPI surged to 14%. The response of the Fed at the time was to raise rates to 20%. This indeed worked and within three year the CPI measure was back down to 3.5%. Now that it is clear that this has worked in the past, why can’t the Fed just jack interest rates up in order to quell inflation? The difference is debt. If the Fed were to raise rates to the point where they would have an impact on inflation, everyone would default on debt. The amount of debt in our system is so large that the government has to increase the debt ceiling to pay off other debt and so on. If the rates went up in any meaningful way, the stock market as well as most asset classes would absolutely disintegrate making the previous crashes of this century look like a cakewalk. Not only is debt in our financial system at all-time highs, but margin borrowing has skyrocketed. These two factors alone would be enough to cause absolute chaos in the system of rates were to increase. So now that we understand that the Fed can’t raise rates because this would cause an unimaginable issue for literally everyone, what seems to be the most logical course of action for the Fed and the government? \n\nThough the solution that I believe the Fed has chosen may seem simple or naïve, think about why this is the best course of action. The Fed, in my view, can do nothing and therefore will do nothing. They will feign concern and pitifully act as if they were actually fighting inflation hard. But ultimately there will arise more and more excuses about why they must continue quantitative easing through low rates and the creation of money. Reasons such as Omicron, or as Greg Mannarino calls it, “Moronic”, unemployment and government spending will conveniently pop up. The Fed is not solely to blame as our governing bodies are terrible at managing spending and great at spending what they do not have. The outcome of the Fed’s actions will indeed be an increase in inflation through greater money supply primarily. This is their endgame. In high inflation, government debts erode away and while the poor become poorer, the rich become increasingly wealthy. Ultimately, the Fed is between a rock and a hard place and has two choices. One, crash the economy in one fell swoop and be known as public enemy number one. Or two, crash the economy invisibly by destroying the dollar through inflation. Which do you think they will choose? \n\nHaving gained an understanding as to the main reason our dollar has declined 96.2% since 1900, what will its value be in the future? Inflation through monetary policy is not going away anytime soon as shown through our past, but let us look to the past of another country that experienced high inflation. Through this we may glean a nugget as to where we’re headed and what is to be done about it. It is also important to note that no fiat currency has survived the test of time. In fact, 20% of all fiat money systems have failed through hyperinflation. While this example below of what happens to a currency during high inflation, its similarities are striking to the current conditions in America. Rising prices, low productivity and the use of money \n\n https://www.businessinsider.com/hungarys-hyperinflation-story-2014-4 \n\nprinting to solve the issues of the day occurred in Hungary and are happening now in America. In Hungary, real wages fell by 80% or more and savings accounts were utterly decimated. Please either read this article in full attain an understanding of what happens to the purchasing power of average citizens during this event. \n\nIt is difficult to fathom that such an event could take place here in America, but that is what makes it all the more likely and devastating. False presumptions of security often lead to lackadaisical policy and oversights that leave systems vulnerable. It is for precisely this reason that we must look at the logical likelihood of this event. When looking at all of the economic data that is available today the state of our economy is not as rosy as MSNBC would have you believe. This data also points to the fact that we are already experiencing a high inflation environment and that most have not realized this yet. And while there is a massive amount of data that is pertinent, I shall summarize the most important of this data. \n\n* Debt as a Percentage of GDP is now 125%. Our production capabilities are severely lacking. \n* Initial unemployment claims keep exceeding economist expectations.\n* Record amounts of job openings indicate either a lack of willingness to  \n work or salary shopping in a competitive hiring market. \n* Supply chain issues are also driving prices higher. \n* Home sales are down even with real rates being negative \n* Credit debt is through the roof\n* The CPI came in at 6.9% \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wyjwxw1kvj681.png?width=577&format=png&auto=webp&s=62cd2d6e708a930585cb20dc352ed984664602e7\n\nNow that we have established that it is not out of the question that we may experience some similar inflationary event, I would like to look at the CPI. This is the official measure of inflation that is presented to us by the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics. While a reading of 6.9% shocked many, I would like argue that this number is egregiously false and in fact acts as a cover for the true nature of what is unfolding in the system. How is this number calculated, and has this formula changed? This number is calculated through an aggregate of average prices across the main consumer products and their increase or decrease as a collective compared to prior readings. The Formula for the CPI has been  \n changed twice and, in both cases, certain consumer necessities were removed from the equation such as housing costs. Shadowstats, a website that provides us with a CPI reading of 15% based on the older  \ncalculations, states the benefit that the change in the formula yields, \n\nIn general terms, methodological shifts in government reporting have depressed   \nreported inflation, moving the concept of the CPI away from being a measure of the   \ncost of living needed to maintain a constant standard of living. \n\nSo if the measure of inflation has been tampered with to hide the true inflation, then isn't this issue already much worse than the Fed and government want us to believe? Most certainly, and with the Fed not able to raise rates, it does certainly appear as if we might be on the cusp of high inflation or even hyperinflation. This is especially so given the fact that quantitative easing will most certainly continue. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rbjoaf1xvj681.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=8557a5d185d5bddc8c94954cc68f9487fa35397a\n\nSo the inflation rate is high, but what gives? the very last kicker is this little thing called the velocity of money. The following paragraph succinctly describes this phenomenon and was pulled from an article regarding hyperinflation and money velocity. \n\n“At the beginning of every hyperinflation, it looks like everything is okay. The economy is emerging from a crisis, usually a deflation or some kind of recession, and things are getting better. People feel more prosperous because the storm has passed and there’s more money around from the extra currency the government has printed. Markets like housing and stocks tend to rise. But this is an illusion because prices have yet to adjust for all the extra currency that was created. Why does it have to adjust? Because inflation is not just the result of a spike in money supply, but also money velocity. In simple terms, this is a measure of how frequently currency changes hands. As citizens begin to feel better about the state of the economy, they spend more. That extra money now starts to enter the economy and prices begin to move higher as it circulates more and more. Even though central bankers can control the money supply, they can’t control velocity. And since money velocity is largely a psychological phenomenon, it’s very hard to change it back once it takes hold. This is how inflation has historically gotten out of control and led to hyperinflation.”\n\n The velocity of money in the system has yet to spike, but as this article mentions, this spike will only really come at a point when the general public realizes what is happening. Then there will be a move out of the dollar, which is losing value, and a move into hard assets such as tools, non-perishable food and any real thing whose value is not predicated on the dollar, but on supply and demand. \n\nSo, what can we do to protect our families and preserve our wealth through such an event? Looking at a hyperinflation case, the Weimar Republic, there is one asset that clearly was successful at wealth preservation. While this may seem cliché, that asset was gold. According to the IMF, gold is “the only asset which runs no counter-party risk.” We may also include silver into this example because both act in the same way with regard to inflation, but have different uses. An article from GoldSilver.com succinctly states the role of gold and silver in such a hyper-inflationary event, \n\nIn the Weimar Republic during hyperinflation, gold did what it’s supposed to do: its   \nvalue skyrocketed during hyperinflation. Over the five-year period that included   \nhyperinflation, the gold price increased 1.8 times faster than the inflation rate. In   \nother words, not only did someone holding gold survive during the Weimar   \nhyperinflation, their purchasing power actually increased by nearly double. Contrast   \nthat with the fact that most people's savings were completely wiped out. Even the   \nwealthiest citizens were turned into poor ones literally overnight, except for those   \nthat owned gold and silver. \n\nThis example also holds true in all other inflation and hyperinflation cases. So, it appears as though one should own both gold and silver in the case of currency devaluation. Since the dollar has been losing value consistently over the past 120 years, why should now be any different? \n\nBeyond the fact that gold and silver become intensely useful during inflation for their ability to preserve wealth, they also hold their value even in what we perceive as ‘normal’ times. To demonstrate this, I will now present historical value and thus purchasing power of both the dollar and gold. In 1900, a loaf of bread cost $0.04 USD. In 2021, a loaf of bread costs an average of $3.3. With one dollar in 1900 you could have bought 25 loaves of bread. The price of gold in 1900 was $20.67. In order to equate the dollar to gold we will equate the dollar amount to the gold price for an accurate comparison. With 1 oz of gold you could have bought about 516 loaves of bread and with $20.67 USD you could've bought about 516 loaves of bread. Today the price of 1 oz of gold is around $1800 USD. Thus, an oz of gold could buy about 545 loaves of bread today. That same $20.67 USD, would buy you a meager 6 loaves of bread. This also holds true for almost everything that one could buy. A fully tailored men’s suit cost about $20 in 1900. today that won’t even buy a tie whereas an oz of gold could buy a tailored suit. So, it becomes clear that gold not only held, but did in fact gain value in the past 120 years while the dollar lost almost all its value. It is important also to run inflation adjusted returns on the stock market because the real returns are far less than the thousands of percent the charts show. \n\nIf either of the aforementioned scenarios do in fact play out, which one inevitably will, then gold’s primary function should be thought of as a wealth vessel until such a time that a new system arose which gained the public trust. Silver in this circumstance could also play the role of the vessel, but would almost certainly be more useful in the day to day needs since silver’s intrinsic value is less. If the hyperinflation came to pass, then there would also be ample opportunity to grow one’s wealth too. This could be in the form of real estate for example. Many people would default on their mortgages and there would be many incredible deals. These deals won’t be able to be taken advantage of in the increasingly worthless fiat currency, but if one had gold or silver, a seller would be willing to sell for something that has real value. On a side note about mortgages and adjustable rate debt. In hyperinflation, ordinary debt such as a car or house loan, interest rates on any debt are not locked in. A clear example of this happened in Mexico when during their hyperinflation, mortgage rates changed daily. Even those who had locked in an interest rate for 5-10 years were not safe as the government and banks just changed the rules. So, moving forward, one should be as careful as possible about how much debt they take on. It would be wise to avoid taking on more debt than one could currently pay off with their available cash. \n\nNow, understanding that gold and silver hold and even gain value over time, and that these metals perform well in any scenario, one must understand two important things. First, the quality or type of metal to acquire. When looking at the quality or type of metal to acquire, there are two main factors: liquidity and purity. Basically, any bullion that one buys should be well recognizable and have an appropriate size for its use. For example, 1 oz silver coins could be used to buy food or basics necessities, whereas 100 oz silver bars could be used to buy farm implement, land or larger items. In the case of hyperinflation, gold should most likely not be used, but held until such a time that a new currency or currency stabilization is seen by the general public. Quantity is tough to land upon as everyone has different available means, but a goal might be able to live solely on gold or silver for two or three years while supporting one’s standard of living. Then there could be other set aside for wealth preservation. As a percentage of one’s wealth, it should not be overwhelming, but enough to give the needed security and ability to pounce on opportunity. If one’s means do not currently afford the ability to reallocate a portion of the assets into metals, a slow approach makes the most sense. This slow approach will allow one to grow their security slowly through setting aside a reasonable amount of each paycheck for the acquisition of physical bullion. It should be noted that any bullion purchased should always have the troy weight as well as the purity stamped upon it. Without these, your bullion will be useless or difficult to use. It should also be noted that certain mints will be widely recognized such as the RCM and Perth Mint, thus increasing their ease of use through trust in the mint. Lastly, one should shop around and search for the best deals in order to find the best price. Premiums on metals are constantly changing, and depending on the type of coin one purchases, the premium could really eat away at the amount of bullion one ends up with. The goal is to acquire the most of the best bullion for the lowest cost, in order to best preserve wealth and attain ease of use during a hyper-inflationary event. \n\nThe following is a pertinent excerpt from SunshineProfits.com explaining the possible speculative upside to both metals in addition to their ability to preserve wealth, \n\nMany gold and silver investors believe that the market for both is systematically   \nmanipulated. There are many variations of this theory: some say that precious metals are   \nunder the thumb of central bankers, while others blame big banks and their use of   \nderivatives (‘naked’ shorts) and high-frequency trading for the declines in the price of gold.   \nThere are also worries about the discrepancy between Paper and physical gold (appx. 250   \nto 1), the fairness of London trading, declining inventories at Comex and leasing of gold by   \ncentral banks. At first glance, this theory makes sense, especially that the price of gold was   \nfixed for decades by governments or suppressed under the London Pool Gold, while a few   \nfinancial institutions have already been fined for influencing or manipulating gold prices. \n\nI would like to note one thing out of this article of particular importance, and that is the paper metal. This refers to certificates or futures contracts that are traded and most often settled in USD. These certificates could be leading to price suppression through the massive increase in liquidity. Basically, if there is more gold, even on paper, then it is worth less. Not only this, but these contracts allow an investor to take physical delivery of the metal. In the event of high inflation, it is almost certain that people will seek a safe haven in gold and silver. If there are 250 claims to every one ounce of silver and even 10% of these take physical delivery a demand driven price increase without direct correlation to inflation is certain. Given that gold and silver win in either ‘normal’ times or hyperinflation, if their price has been suppressed due to the massive amount of paper metal, then it would seem as though they are possibly some of the most undervalued assets in the world currently. \n\nIn summation, it appears as though allocating a portion of one’s wealth to these precious metals seems to be a no brainer. Without serious reform and overhaul, the current system will continue to do what it does best, which is to inflate. Given this, the course of this economy and the value of the dollar appear to be on track towards a very tumultuous time. But I would also have anyone that reads this note that I have used the words seem and appear at almost every turn. This is due to the fact that I am in fact doing what some may call speculation.

If wages do not keep up with the cost of milk, gas, rent, etc. then workers will die & productivity will drop.\n\nHowever, as cheaper alternatives to staple goods are found, the CPI is altered to reflect a lowered quality of life for workers.

That extra money now starts to enter the economy and prices begin to move higher as it circulates more and more.\n\nThe Money was not put in the hands of consumers, it was targetted into the hands of banks, who will be forced to spend it over a period of decades. There will be years of high inflation instead of one quick jump\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> as the government and banks just changed the rules.\n\nThis is a point that people sleep on.
