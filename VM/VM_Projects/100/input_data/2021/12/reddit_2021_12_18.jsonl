{"title": "FAANG IS NOT SAFE", "selftext": "I've been on this subreddit for a while, and it seems that people correlate all FAAN(M)G names as being extremely safe but let me remind you, they are NOT. First let me clear the air, I believe that all of these companies are phenomenal but recently the large majority of them are at ridiculous valuations and not worth investing into, and they especially shouldn't be considered \"safe\".\n\n Now, I'm mainly going to be talking about everything except FB as FB is probably the only one that reasonable valued rn. Ok, let's start with AAPL, by far the most popular stock that's considered \"safe\" in this subreddit. AAPL is currently valued as 2.8 trillion dollar company with EPS of 5.67 therefore they are trading at a P/E of around 30.48. Usually for such a large company trading at such a high multiple, they have large growth ahead of  them or an extremely large moat. With AAPL, although they due have an extremely large moat they have nearly no growth with the average EPS estimates being 5.71 for next year meaning they would just grow 2%. This would have AAPL at a forward PEG ratio of about 15 which is ridiculously high. Additionally, if you do any proper DCF calculation and keep growth at reasonable levels you'll see how overvalued this is at the moment. Additionally, people will claim that they have such a large moat or the actual business is so good that it's worth this insane multiple but let me remind you, it's simply not, just because a business is much larger does not mean they will continue to be that large for an extended period of time. An important statistic to note about this is that of the 20 largest companies from 20 years ago, not of them are still in the top 20. \n\nThe story stays the same for most of these other companies, AMZN does not have the growth, MSFT does not have the growth, NFLX does not have the growth, GOOGL is close to reasonably valued but does not have the growth. \n\nVirtually none of these companies have the growth to sustain their valuations, the only reason they are trading at such high multiples is because money flees to them during times of uncertainty but when these times cool down, they will deflate. \n\n**The main takeaway from this is that these companies are not bad to invest in, they could still generate good returns, but people HAVE to stop saying these are like saving account stocks or that they're extremely safe, because they're not.** \n\nIf anyone could give me a good reason as to why they can justify such a high valuation, please do so, but I simply don't see anything that could make these businesses so valuable. Also, don't say they have a large moat or some shit like that, those reasons don't justify a company to be trading at quite possible twice what it's actually worth.", "id": "rjba6a", "created_utc": 1639845875.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 122, "comments": [{"body": "Just a question.. \n\nSafe = cannot default in short time \n\nOr\n\nSafe = low volatility?", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "This is my takeaway from this as well.\n\nSafe means different things for different people.

Like just one fiscal. I think seeking alpha is for how the current fiscal will end too so this one is almost over. This has been a rougher fiscal for aapl and why the price hasn’t moved as much in 2021 compared to some years. Peg is calculated by 5 year expected growth though so fundamental analysis is taking a much longer view than just the current fiscal.

They aren’t necessarily going to tank in value like some stocks will. Safe havens like banks and faang are a good place to keep your money when things are uncertain to stay in the market without worrying about losing everything if things go bad.

Perhaps there is some marked improvement in tech recently but as sequencing currently is done I find it highly unlikely that pac bio can produce a competitive product the illumina novaseq. \n\nOn the actual market side of sequencing genomics companies, Invitae has a race to the bottom approach on pricing which is only valid if the market and clinical necessity of constitutional sequencing grows exponentially.

They have a data oriented solution and are in a very good position to take a big chunk of cancer market.  The current market leader is Foundation Medicine which is owned by Roche. Buying Roche is not a terrible idea but the upside is capped as genomics is a small percentage of their revenues. \n\nThe market leader in cell free sequencing is Guardant.  Liquid biopsy is likely a growth market but the cost is very high compared to the clinical benefits.
