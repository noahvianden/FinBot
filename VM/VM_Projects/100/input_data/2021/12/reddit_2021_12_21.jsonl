I need this truck for weekly dump runs. I cannot have this truck die on me. I also cannot deal with a huge mechanic bill right now.\n\nTime to do some research and bust out the tools.\n\nDiagnosed to a vacuum leak, and the most likely culprit is the intake manifold gasket. Fantastic /s. Order the parts. Order some more parts that might as well be replaced while I'm in there since they're stock. Buy cheap tools from harbor freight and get to work... in the cold.

Then the intake manifold itself and the knock sensors underneath.\n\nThen parts had to be cleaned. The intake was pooling with motor oil. Great, new PCV needed because Chevy's had this problem for 2 decades now and has only band-aid fixes for it. Spill some of that motor oil on the wife's rug while taking it down the basement. Clean up all the motor oil and dust sludge all around the heads in the engine valley. Vacuum out some leaves and crap I accidentally let fall down into the heads. Splice the PCV tube together after accidentally shattering 20 year old stiff plastic.\n\nAnd then re-assembly. You know, reassembly really wasn't too bad. Kind of a pain to keep all the wires and hoses and tubes straight and not get kinks, but it was certainly easier than taking it apart. And turn on the truck aaaaaaaand a VERY ANGRY FLASHING CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. Yea, EGR wasn't seated correctly because it's a steel fucking tube they expect you to bend around the throttle body cables and mount flush but it's only held in with ONE FUCKING SCREW.\n\nSo that got fixed with much bloody knuckles, hammering, and swearing.

I do feel there is obviously a huge wealth disparity in this country, but I'm not sure if Elon Musk is the guy to pick on. If I understand correctly, Elon Musk is TERRIBLE at his tax planning.  I don't know if it was intentional, unintentional, bad luck, good luck or Elon just don't give a fuck but his taxes owed are as high as it could be under the law.  if he had exercise his options at $6 (or even $100), he would owe just millions in taxes. The gov't would not have gotten the billions that Elon is now owed.   \nHere are some additional thoughts -   \n1) Alot of people feel because Tesla benefited from subsidiaries, Elon is indebted to USA tax payers. I totally disagreed with this. The purpose of those EV/clean energy subsidiaries are to jump start the EV/Clean energy section.  I would say that Tesla did more than just \"jump start\" the industry. If the gov't wants to benefit from Tesla's stock success then they should have invested in Tesla.  \n2) I don't get people's obsession with \"income tax\".  \"income tax\" is just one of many taxes that individuals and corporations pay. Heck, Texas and Florida don't even have state income tax and you don't see people complaining about that. I won't get into the details but Tesla pay payroll taxes and contribute to social security (as the employers) and people that made money off of Tesla stocks also pay short/long term gain taxes.  \n3) SpaceX is worth billions because of the billions in contracts given by NASA -  I don't understand this argument. As far as I know, SpaceX is not getting any free handouts. In fact Nasa is getting a great deal compared to the alternatives (boeing, Lockhead). It seems like people are suggesting that SpaceX is so successful by providing great savings to NASA (and by extension to the tax payers) so Elon should be grateful and pay more taxes.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": ">I'm not sure if Elon Musk is the guy to pick on\n\nAgreed. \n\n* Elon doesn't indulge in conspicuous consumption.

In the ruling issued last week, he says that even assuming Greenspan's theories are plausible, it isn't reasonable to infer he'd be held up to scorn, hatred, ridicule or contempt. He writes, \"Essentially **Greenspan contends that the harm resulting from the omissions was that he was robbed of his proper recognition for his role in the origins of Facebook; that is not a claim of defamation**.\"\r  \n\r\n\nAs far as I can tell, appeals of this outcome were unsuccessful.\n\nSo it was known in the 2012 timeframe that Aaron Greenspan was willing to file absurd lawsuits and basically \"make up\" some non-existent law saying that he was entitled to $ from Columbia, which the federal judge threw out.  \n\nFeeding Greenspan any information is just inviting him to cause legal trouble based on whatever fanciful idea he has about being wronged.

You describe the \"normal\" internet.\n\nYes precisely, we are already in the \"metaverse\". It's a spectrum, though. There's a big difference between the internet we know today and the internet we knew pre-iphone. There will be just as big if not more of a difference in the internet post-Web3 and the present. There's certainly a lot of hype that should be ignored but also a lot of real innovation that's happening.\n\nThere's also many very cool and useful things that have already been built that you can use today which is only possible with Web3 and the concept of trustlessly/permissionlessly transferring value. Here's some examples:\n\n* Automated and transparent insurance options where payouts are executed automatically by smart contracts. No paperwork, no need to worry about your claim being denied, fast settlement. This is already being used for things like farmers hedging crop yields against heat/humidity/etc, hedging renewable energy generation against solar irradiance and cloud coverage, hedging logistics/ports and more. Healthcare will be a an enormous use case in the future, but what I just mentioned is live today: https://www.arbolmarket.com/\n* Self-repaying loans with no liquidation risk. You post collateral that is used to generate yield which pays off your loan over time. You are effectively able to spend future yield in the present. https://alchemix.fi/\n* Allowing normal people to participate in income-generating strategies that previously were only available to large institutions like Citadel. Decentralized liquidity pools let you earn a portion of the transaction fees from people converting from one asset/currency to another. For example you can put in 50% USDC and 50% ETH to provide liquidity to anyone exchanging between the two, which currently yields 10% annually. The risk here is impermanent loss, but is a great way to generate yield while hedging risk. There's also completely automated algorithmic options and futures strategies you can participate in, such as selling covered calls on Bitcoin : https://stakedao.org/\n* Digital ownership & royalty rights to things such as music. Songs can be fractionalized and as they accrue royalties, they are automatically paid out to the NFT holders. This also allows artists to cut out middlemen which take huge cuts. It's new and still in a beta, but the first song has already been released and distributed on the platform: https://royal.io/\n\nThere's a ton more examples I can give but there's a lot that is being built as we speak that is going to continue to form this \"metaverse\".

We don't disagree on that, but it's good to be factual unless you are implying fraud is taking place with the company's shares somehow.** \n\n2. ⁠CTB is .5% but that doesn’t matter if you don’t believe price will go down, which it won’t in this case because they are quite simply too successful.\n\n**CTB** ***does*** **matter because it can force shorts to cover vs. just kicking the can and keeping the position open. It's not the only variable but it's important. The expectation that the price will keep going up is just that, an expectation and may or may not materialize as the whole market may move for some bullshit such as omicron. A high CBT is real and hurts shorts every day regardless of expectations. Can't keep a short position open if you keep getting margin calls for higher collateral because CBT is rocketing every day, for example.**\n\n3. ⁠I am confident you haven’t read their earnings transcript or multiple research reports where the big firms are repeatedly lauding VRCA’s ability at establishing high quality partnerships and SAS (recurring growth).\n\n**No I have not. Regardless, the analysts have price targets which this share price has virtually met. We all know analysts usually target much higher than what the share price is as they do DCFs over several years. The fact it's hit the price target pretty much means there's little to no upside anymore unless an unforeseen catalyst 'happens'. Why would new investors buy into a share when it appears fully valued? What would they know the analysts who are covering it don't?**\n\n4. ⁠SI is skewed to show 10% as a percentage of shares outstanding. However, as I explained above, nearly 100% of the 34.8m shares outstanding are held by long long term holders, which means the 3.5mil reported short interest as an enormous 100-300% of the float.\n\n**I never said otherwise, I even said it'll take shorts a very long time to cover.**\n\n5. ⁠Bonus; this stock is moving because it is incredibly illiquid due to lack of trading shares. 100 shares moves the price $0.1, and there are 3,500,000 shorts outstanding, a portion of which likely want to close before EOY.\n\n**I sincerely hope so. Keep in mind though that illiquidity works the other way too, if your trade doesn't work and you want to exit you'll have to suck up a big spread.**", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "1) no shit\n2) it does not matter here\n3) suggest you go read them\n4) cool\n5) fair point", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What does OTF holders mean?", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "And just like that I can tell you did not read the dd 💁‍♂️", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Is anything I stated incorrect?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWasn't their revenue and profits down QoQ?\n\nIs their borrow fee higher than 0.5%?\n\nHas it hit the price targets by the analysts pretty much?
