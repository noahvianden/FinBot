That would allow you to do the proverbial “buy low, sell high”.  The challenge is that the move you need is unexpected, which means the odds are most likely not in your favor.  If they were, why would anyone sell you that put at that price?  All that being said, being long is certainly safer than shorting from a potential loss point of view.

That‘s a long strategy.  Don’t confuse the derivative with the underlying asset.  They are related but separate things.   My derivative (in this case my put contract) has extrinsic value which means the price of it doesn‘t just move opposite to the underlying.  That’s the intrinsic value which certainly plays a part in the price but it’s not the only component of the price of my put.  In some cases it may not even be the majority of the price of my put.  Being short a stock is a very different set of risks to being long a put of a stock.  That’s why the most I will say is synthetically short.

I used TS for a while and won some, lost less, but after several years it started to average out and I realized I wasn’t making $ off the TS, I was making $ because my R/R, take profit, and stop loss was solid and the fact that we’ve been in a bull market for 13 years (Ik it’s a broken record but i recommend going back to bear market years, picking a random day during the recession or something ***without looking at “future days”*** block it out so u physically can’t see it, then try to make theoretical trades. Bear markets act completely different, and not just the fact that they go down rather than up)\n\nFEEDBACK FOR OPTIONS: Near exp gives you more leverage but time decay is huge so you might want to hedge it with a short option of the same type to offset some of the theta. Sure it’ll put a max on your profits but when you’re dealing with weeklies it’ll Mellow out some of that time decay. I’d also study the VIX and learn IV like the back of your hand, in my mind theta is pretty easy, it doesn’t matter what stock or anything theta is always going to eat away front months and nibble at back months. Also understand that the farther out the exp, the higher strike the highest Vega is (not OTM, higher strike), meaning for calls highest Vega is OTM and puts its ITM (at the same strike).\n\nSTRATEGY SUGGESTION: One of my strategies which has worked well for a long time, although kind of boring; is riding the IV increase leading up to earnings of around 30 companies on my watchlist (1-2 month long positions) I don’t have to worry about the direction of any stock for the whole 1-2 months plus most of their IV’s rise. I usually have a slight lean on the upside because if the stock goes up too much leading up to earnings the IV will in some cases actually decline, so I have an extra call to help hedge against that.\n\nThen during the week of earnings I close out most of them (different times due to different earnings announcements), I enter new positions, also bi-directional, negative Vega with some hedging if the price moves too much & some DOTM strangles if the price moves TOO MUCH.\n\nIn terms of toying with exp’s, it all depends on your risk tolerance. Near exp’s IV will change faster than back months, higher theta, etc. \n\nYou could short sort of deep OTM front month strangles and cover them with your main strategy of long back month options, could give you a little extra pocket change.\n\nAn even lower risk tolerance strategy could be selling iron condors on stocks you like. Let’s say you buy 200 shares of XYZ @100, and you’d double down @70 and take profits @130… sell a 70 put and a 130 call so you collect premiums as well as if either go ITM you get exactly what you want.

It's basically a game of musical chairs. It's zero-sum *eventually*, so if you get out before the last greater fool, you win. Retail is primarily speculation driven, yes, with very short time horizons measured in days, although that's a spectrum and some forms of speculation don't have as much variance as others.\n\n1. It's hard to say and it varies as retail involvement waxes and wanes.

There's a narrative in online forums like reddit and twitter that the market is rigged against retail traders and in favor of the fat cat institutions milking retailers. I don't buy into that conspiracy theory, but there is probably a kernel of truth in it. For example, big market makers like Citadel have gained ever increasing revenue and profits from retail trading. It is my belief that the big guys don't have to rig the market, dumb money is being thrown at them regardless. So I'd say retail looks a lot like the gaming industry, by which I mean regulated casinos and horse tracks and sports book, etc. Market makers, brokers and clearinghouses take their fees and cuts, while the retail traders duke it out in a zero-sum alpha game, competing *against* institutional traders with far more resources and much better informational and analytical tools at their disposal.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This answer is super helpful and is a lot to think about, thank you!

You could buy the same $X worth of shares at that point in time. You don't have to buy 100 shares.\n\nOwning shares has the advantage of no time decay, no expiration date, and if the shares pay a dividend, dividend income. \n\nThe one advantage calls provide is leverage. The net cost of benefiting from an anticipated $50/share gain in the shares at some future date can be less if you do so via a call and if everything falls into place at just the right time and without too much opportunity cost. That's a lot of things that have to go right in a row for a call to pay off more than just DCAing shares over the same period of time.\n\nPut another way, you use a call to pay a *premium now* in order to get a *discount later* on share price. If the premium is too high or the discount too low, it's not worth it. A rough formula would be, a call is worth it if and only if:\n\ndiscount later > premium now + opportunity cost\n\nThis is assuming you exercise at expiration in order to own shares.

That changes the formula, as I mentioned before. The downside is that in a shorter holding time you may get unlucky and catch a downtrend, but your upfront cost will be lower so you lose less. You also may be forced to realizes gains/losses more frequently, which can generate tax drag.\n\nIt should be apparent by now that there is no good solution for someone strapped for cash.

Cash secured put is when you have enough cash to cover assignment… ex. Sell 1 XYZ put @120… if you are assigned; you have to buy 100 XYZ @120 strike = $12,000 in exchange for the 100 shares you just now were obligated to buy, per the terms of the right of the put buyer on the other side of your contract. Being cash secured means you had that $12,000 in cash, ready to buy the shares\n\n2. Covered call is selling a call(s) against your shares in multiples of 100, let’s say you have 200 shares of XYZ, and you sell 1 call @160 strike, if you get assigned you automatically sell 100 shares @160 a share. For the example 200 shares, you could write (sell) 2 covered calls, but if you try to sell a third, it would be naked.\n\n\nAN INVESTMENT STRATEGY (NOT TRADING, I mean, technically you could trade this, but for starting out I highly recommend against it) could be to:\n\n1.Sell cash secured puts on stocks you want to own long-term at 1. A price you want to pay (if it’s lower than the current price of the stock) 2. that you’re okay with buying at that price before a certain date… let’s say it’s currently at $100 / share but you only want to go in at $80 / share it it hits at or below $80 before 60 days from now, you could sell a $80 strike put with 60 DTE and collect the premium. If the stock moves up, your short put loses $ which means you make $ because it’s short, if it expires while the stock is above $80, you keep the full premium paid, and if the stock goes below $80 at or before exp, you get assigned PLUS keep the premium you sold it for… profit.\n\n2.let’s say you already bought 100+ shares of a stock or had just been assigned for the example above: you can then sell a call at a strike at which you’d like to take profit (or not if you don’t want to cap profits), let’s say you just got assigned on the example above so the stock is @80 and you’d be okay with taking profits if the stock is trading @130 before 2 months from now… you could sell a 130 strike call with 60 DTE… if the stock is under 130 at expiration, you keep the full premium, and if it’s above 130 at exp, you get assigned for a locked in profit.\n\n3.you can combine these strategies by selling a put at a strike of which the price you want to DD and a call where you want to TP (aka a short strangle), if you have 0 shares then don’t sell the call because you have unlimited risk. If you want me to go more in depth (IK that’s pretty long though) I can go into where to choose strikes and expirations.\n\n\nTO ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION:\n\nI don’t own any shares of the companies I trade’s options.\n\nThe strategy I use is a Double Diagonal, a type of spread where the naked calls & puts are hedged by the long ones, so there’s no unlimited risk, the risk is defined. For TDA to sell naked options is tier 3 which I can’t even get, I think there’s a legal minimum of income and net worth to get cleared. I have tier 2 standard margin, trading spreads and covered short options.\n\nYou can get Tier 2 standard margin fairly easy just go through their main courses on options and mention that you completed it, also it might help if you have a margin account instead of a cash even if you don’t use it (I’ve never actually used my margin).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "To choose strikes & expiration I’d have to know your risk tolerance among a couple other things…\n\n\n1.for how long is the max amount of time you’d be okay with having your $ locked up in investments (ex.

For AAPL I might say a strike of $180 with 60 DTE, something it could hit but still not close enough to the current price that you won’t take much profit. It’ll credit you around $2.50-3.00 depending on the IV at the time, so $250-$300 / option, so for your $16,000 worth of shares you’ll either take a profit of 12.5% on the AAPL position in 60 days OR a profit of ~1.5-2% from selling the premiums of the options, along with this you could sell an identical put (+/- $20, so strike at $140) at which you are willing to double down again on AAPL, it’ll credit you about the same amount as the call so in total: either you:\n\n1.if AAPL goes past $180 before 60 days, you Take profits of 12.5% on AAPL + make +$600 premium ($300 from the call, $300 from the put) you keep no matter what\n2.If AAPL stays between $140 and $180, you keep the $600 premium\n3.if AAPL goes below $140 before 60 days, you DD + make the +$600 premium\n\nYou can also hedge these short options by buying further OTM ones.\n\nIt’s called an Iron Condor (spread), if you want higher risk (higher reward) though, don’t hedge them.\n\n\nWhen thinking about strikes and expirations (when writing options) with INVESTING, think about “is this strike price low enough that I’m okay with buying those shares at that price before X date (selling puts), but not too low that I’m making only $1 for this next 30 days” and “is this strike price high enough that i’m okay with selling my shares, taking profit, at that price before X date, while still making Atleast a decent amount of $ from the premiums?”\n\nAnything else you want to know just lmk", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "If you want to learn how to trade options, which is one of the riskiest investments out there, I’ll tell you abt that too", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Above I showed you how to use options to invest.

Your OTM option could go to $0 depending on how OTM it is, while the hypothetical ITM option could’ve only dropped a couple bucks off its $20.

I trade al 3 types; if I want to play it safe I’ll buy some ITM, if I want to get a high Risk high reward (meanings I’m probably really certain), I’ll buy an OTM. If I’m not really sure, an ATM is a good bet; not too much risk, but still having some leverage. But NEVER buy DOTM options (Deep OTM), the bid-ask spreads are very high and volume very low; even if you do happen to make a theoretical profit on them, you could have trouble selling them because nobody is on the other side to buy them, and if they are, you’re profits get crushed by the bid-ask spread.\n\nSTRANGLE/STRADDLE (spread): buying a put and a call at [strangle: different strikes] and at [straddle: same strikes]\n\nYou would buy this if you think there will be a greater than average price movement along with IV increase but you don’t know which direction.\n\nEx.

No, but if you exercise it or allow it to be exercised, certain things do need to happen.\n\nSo lets review the basics. An **exercised** put delivers shares and receives cash. So there are two cases to consider: you have the shares and you don't have the shares. \n\nIf you have the shares, it's straightforward. You bought the XYZ shares for $100, the current price is now $80 but you bought a $90 put, so you deliver your 100 shares and receive $90/share in cash. You only lose $10/share instead of the full $20/share the current price would dictate.\n\nWith me so far?\n\nIf you don't have the shares, the exact same thing happens, but you have to *borrow 100 shares to sell*, because you don't own any. So the effect of exercising the put is the same as selling 100 shares short. You collect $90/share in cash and have an open position of -100 shares of XYZ. Since the XYZ shares were loaned to you, they impact your margin buying power and are subject to a margin call if the XYZ share price suddenly skyrockets. You also pay a borrowing fee.\n\nIn this case, you generally do need to have some collateral to cover the short, either cash, which could be some or all of the $90/share you received for exercising the put, or marginable assets.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for your response!

Any other combo does not have that risk, so selling a put and buying a call would not have that risk.\n\nIf you sell a put without owning a put or being short 100 shares, it's a naked short put. Some amount of cash acts as collateral, anything from 20% to 100% of the assignment cost (selling a put means that if you get assigned, you deliver cash and receive shares, the opposite of exercising a put you own). So if a naked short put is assigned, you have to pay the strike price x 100 and you must receive 100 shares. Where the risk comes in is if the shares fall in value after you receive them. \n\nFor example, if you sold a $100 put for shares that are currently $105. The shares fall to $95 on expiration day and you are assigned, so you pay $100/share and receive 100 shares that are only worth $95/share, giving you a -$5/share unrealized loss. But if the next day the shares fall to $70, you now have a -$30/share loss.\n\nSince shares can't fall below $0/share, your maximum loss risk is the $100/share you paid. You can't lose more than that.\n\nCalls work the other direction. The more the shares go up, the more money you lose.

The contract \"bought back\" by X is not the same contract that Y owns. As noted in the links, there is no connection between buyers and sellers. Each is in a pool of traders, one pool for the buy side, one pool for the sell side, and a link is made between a buyer and a seller if and only if someone on the buy side decides to exercise. Then a seller is randomly selected from the sell side to deliver on the contract.\n\nFurthermore, as also noted in the links, when you **sell to open**, you go from 0 contracts to -1 contracts. When you **buy to close** (buy it back), you go from -1 contracts to 0 contracts. A person with 0 contracts can't be held liable for anything about the contract. If they could be, every man, woman and child in the world with 0 contracts would also be liable.\n\n>  Another question that has been on my mind is if most contracts are not exercised by expiration then who is at the end of the line purchasing all of these contracts that they won’t exercise and even if they choose to it would be unprofitable for them because there is still a very small amount of extrinsic value left prior to market close on expiration day?\n\nAddressing the last part first, none of the OTM contracts have any value, least of all extrinsic value. So there is no point in exercising them. If you have a call for $100 and the current stock price is $20, why would you pay $100/share when you could buy the same shares for $20/share? You wouldn't, so no OTM contracts get exercised. That's a big chunk of the reason right there.\n\nSo that leaves ITM contracts. Some number of ITM contracts won't be exercised because they will result in a loss. If you have a call for $100 that you paid $9 for and the stock price is currently $101, you would lose $8/share by exercising. Since people are not in this game to lose money, they don't exercise. So that eliminates that group as well.\n\nThat leaves only ITM contracts that are sufficiently deep in the money to overcome their break-even price. Note that the distribution of contracts across the chain is not linear. Most contracts are opened ATM, and while ATM changes from moment to moment over the weeks or months since the contract was issued, on average, the further you get from the average price of the shares during that period of time, the fewer contracts will be outstanding. So that means roughly 30% of all contracts still open end up in the zone of being profitable to exercise.\n\nNow to revert to the first part of the question, statistically the counter-party to every buy and sell is a market maker. At expiration, market makers are the bag holders for everyone.\n\nIt's also worth nothing that a **buy to close** paired with a **sell to close** destroys the contract. So there will be fewer and fewer contracts in existence as expiration draws near, which further reduces the number of contracts that would be profitable to exercise. While an ITM $100 call vs. a $150 stock price might be profitable to exercise, if it is *more* profitable to sell to close before expiration and if that sell to close is paired with a buy to close, the contract ceases to exist and there is no bag holder for it.\n\nNow, is all that stuff literally spelled out in that detail in the links?

{"title": "Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Intrinsic Valuation Analysis", "selftext": "Growth has underperformed value stocks over the last year due to inflation concerns. This has presented buying opportunities for those who want to add to their boomer portfolios for the long-term. I've decided to analyze companies that are down 50%+ from their 52-week highs.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nFounded in 1994, Corsair Gaming Inc. (“Corsair” or the “Company”) provides gear for gamers and content creators. The Company designs and sells gaming and streaming peripherals, components and systems globally. Corsair operates through two segments: Gamer and Creator peripherals, and Gaming components and systems. To increase brand loyalty and repeat purchases, the Company has 2 proprietary software platforms: iCUE for Gamers and Elgato for Content Creators.\n\nWith many of Corsair’s products maintaining a number one US market share position, its brand, scale and global reach provide significant competitive advantages and allows the company to continue to capture a growing share of the rapidly expanding gaming and streaming market, estimated at over $36.0 billion in 2019.\n\nCorsair leverages its scale and operations to acquire and integrate complementary brands and businesses into its portfolio, completing 6 acquisitions since 2018. Notable acquisitions include Elgato, Origin PC, SCUF Gaming, EpocCam, and Gamer Sensei.\n\n**Financial Snapshot & Commentary**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/tFAjRJs](https://imgur.com/a/tFAjRJs)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/FsjHNIQ](https://imgur.com/a/FsjHNIQ)\n\n*Historical Revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA Margins. 2021E - 2025E based on my own assumptions*\n\nSales growth from 2018 - 2019 was 17.03%, and increased by 55.16% in 2020 due to increased demand, consumer sentiment, and better margins. Over the historical period, gross margins increased from 20.55% to 27.34% and EBITDA margins increased from 6.22% to 11.84%. Net Income and Earnings per share had a significant increase primarily due to strong top-line revenue growth, gross margin expansion in both segments, expanding EBITDA with low capital expenditures, an asset light business model, and investing to consolidate market leadership.\n\n**Q3 2021 Results**\n\n* Corsair gained market share in almost every category through Q3 2021\n* Q3 Revenue was impacted by availability of reasonably priced GPUs which curtailed the demand for new PC builds and its components\n* Higher logistics costs including ocean and air freight had an impact on Q3 margins resulting in Gross Profit Margin of 25.9%\n* Gaming Components and Systems segment was impacted by GPU shortages which caused retail prices to surge to 150%+ of MSRP causing many customers to hold off building a performance gaming PC\n* Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment was impacted by IC shortages which caused Corsair’s premium high value products to be in limited supply. Additionally, Gross Profit Margins were impacted by increased logistics costs as well as some reduced sales in premium products\n* Company refinanced LT Debt, increased revolver size, and reduced the interest rate to LIBOR + 125.0 bps\n\n**Preliminary Risks**\n\n* Corsair’s competitive position and success in the market depend upon the ability to build and maintain the strength of its brand among gaming enthusiasts\n* Long term success and company growth depend heavily on continuous development and improvement of existing and new products\n* The Company depends on the introduction and success of third-party high performance computer hardware including GPUs, CPUs, and sophisticated new video games to drive sales of its products\n* Industry is highly competitive and Corsair faces intense competition for market share\n* Sales depends on the growth of gaming, streaming, and eSports industries\n\n**DCF Valuation**\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ZzXmFOh](https://imgur.com/a/ZzXmFOh)\n\n*Base Case DCF Valuation: $28.72 / share*\n\n*Winter's Opinion Case DCF Valuation: $42.58 / share*\n\nWinter's Assumptions: Revenue Growth of 13.0% / 20.0% / 17.5% / 17.5% / 15.0% in projected years, EBITDA Margin 11.0% to 12.5% in projected years, Cost of Equity 10%, Terminal Value EBITDA Exit Multiple 10x (used EBITDA given CapEx estimates), $20.0MM growth capex per year, effective tax rate of 17.4%\n\n* Commentary: Conservative growth estimates based on management expectations and industry growth. Supply chain disruptions should begin to decrease throughout 2022 and its likely GPUs and other systems will have pent-up demand over the next few quarters. The company should see a bullwhip effect in sales growth and a decrease in operating costs moving forward. Increase in stay-at-home lifestyle due to Covid-19 should help sustain sales for years to come.\n\n**Public Comps Analysis**\n\nCompetitors: Logitech, Turtle Beach, Dell Technologies, HP Inc.\n\nBased on Multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, Price/Earnings), CRSR share price ranges from $17.40 to $32.30 with an average estimated share price of $23.31\n\n**Outlook and Final Thoughts**\n\nBased on my intrinsic valuation, I believe Corsair is valued at $32.95 (average est. share price of DCF/Comps). Corsair closed at $21.17 on 12.10.2021, representing a 55% discount to my valuation. I think that Corsair is undervalued and selling at a discount. Growth stocks will continue to face problems based on inflation risk until supply chain issues are resolved. The share price may remain volatile in the coming weeks or months. I think this is a good stock to own if you're a strong believer in the gaming industry for the long term and believe that Corsair can continue to capture market share through marketing efforts and quality products.\n\n*Sources: Corsair Gaming, Inc. 2020 10-K, 10-Qs, Investor Presentations, Company Website, Google Finance, Yahoo Finance, WeBull Desktop Platform*\n\n*Disclaimer: All information is expressed as my own thoughts and opinions.

That will likely not change in this quarter or the next one.\n\nHowever, I am also investing in Intel so I follow the GPU releases as well, new GPU releases from AMD and Intel are expected in Q1 and Q2 of 2022 (Nvidia as well but no OEM gives a crap about those since Nvidia is not even planning to release to gamers but to crypto miners). Intel is planning on building a massive stock of GPUs in an attempt to cover as much demand as possible. I am not sure, however, if Corsair plans to build PCs with Alchemist or not (I would expect they would if the leaks are true, it isn't a weak GPU and better than some that they use). Intel's GPUs are also expected to be cheaper than what they compete against (3070/3070Ti at the high end).\n\nTo me, the GPU releases is a bullish case for Corsair's decreasing qoq revenue as they could possibly either have new cheaper PCs to attract new customers or increase their margins with it being expensive-ish.\n\nIt also looked like in Q3 2021 earnings they mentioned that container costs started to decline slightly so that is also good for them.\n\nI do, however, agree with some of the people here about EagleTree.

At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely from the rubble of the 500,000-square-foot Edwardsville, Illinois, facility, fire chief James Whiteford said. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. Tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states Friday night, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles. The Amazon facility was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time, Whiteford said. The force of the winds was so severe the roof was ripped off and the building collapsed on itself.\n\nWitnesses said workers were caught by surprise and forced to take shelter anywhere they could find. \"I had a coworker that was sending me pictures when they were taking shelter in the bathroom, basically anywhere they could hide,\" said Alexander Bird, who works at a warehouse across the street. \"People had to think on their feet quick.\" Amazon said all employees were normally notified and directed to move to a designated, marked shelter-in-place location when a site was made aware of a tornado warning in the area. Emergency response training is provided to new employees and reinforced throughout the year, the company said.\n\nIt was unclear how many workers were still missing, as Amazon did not have an exact count of people working in the sorting and delivery center at the time the tornadoes hit, Whiteford said. Colleagues and family members desperate for news about loved ones gathered outside the mess of concrete and steel. Amazon truck driver Emily Epperson, 23, said she was anxiously waiting for information on the whereabouts of her workmate Austin McEwan late Saturday afternoon to relay to his girlfriend and parents. \"We're so worried because we believe that, you know, he would have been found by now,\" she told Reuters. \n\nEarlier, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy posted on Twitter that the company was \"heartbroken over the loss\" of its staff members and would continue to work closely with local authorities on the rescue efforts. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos echoed Jassy in a statement shared on Twitter later on Saturday, in which he pledged the company's support to the community. \"All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,\" Bezos wrote.

Number one (and I cannot stress this enough) is to have a plan BEFORE you get into the trade. This should take the emotion out of it and leaves you to just execute the plan. As you gain experience, your plan will become more complex and envision multiple possible scenarios and what you will do if those scenarios play out. But this is still all done before you enter the trade. \n\n2. Determine an appropriate risk size for your account. Generally, you don’t want to lose more than 2% of your account on any one trade. This doesn’t mean that every trade has to be your max risk. When your risk size is appropriate, you will find it much easier to follow your plan. \n\n3. Give yourself enough time to be right. Don’t use your max risk on 0DTE options. \n\n4. Don’t ever settle for anything less than a perfect entry. The stock market is like Grand Central Station; if you miss a trade, don’t worry, there will be another. There’s no sense in chasing after one you missed. \n\n5. Get good at losing. Stopping out of a trade when you intended to is just as much of a win as hitting your profit target. Do this consistently. \n\nFinally, specifically for swing trading, you need to define the time frame of your trade, and then choose an appropriate instrument to express your thesis. \n\nThese are just a few things that have really helped my trading.

If you're adding a sizable contribution each month relative to the overall size of the portfolio, as I'd expect is the case for newer investors, then performance near the end of the year matters much more than that towards the beginning. So just two factors, a tilt towards smaller cap stocks and having large contributions througout the year compared to the starting amount, can explain a pretty substantial underperformance. \n\nWhy have small caps underperformed large caps this year? My guess is due to the highly unpredictable nature of the past year. Small caps tend to be less able to absorb shocks, so the whiplash in views towards the pandemic and the emergence of new variants might have made them less appealing. Small caps are also less likely to have as much pricing power as large caps, which means they might have seemed less and less appealing to investors as inflation has become a greater concern over the course of the year.

Overvalued growth stocks did horrible. I hold some of those, too (I'm down YTD on MA, V, SQ, CRSP), not to mislead anyone; and I'll keep holding them - but I have some other stocks, too, including 4 of those listed above (BAC, JPM, COST, DHR). I have some others that did well (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, ADBE, ISRG, BAM).\n\nIndividual stock holders as a collective didn't do horrible. Only those whose portfolios were overweight on tech growth stocks. My losses from the stocks that did bad were far offset from my core/value picks and I'm buying some of the losing ones as they're falling to hopefully outperform in the long term.\n\nIf you're down this year, it's not because you picked stocks, it's because you picked bad stocks. Stop FOMOing into outperforming growth stocks just because of their momentum and hype you see on YT / Reddit / Tiktok / Insta. I'm not against growth stocks, I hold several. But research the companies you're buying into. You're going to own a part of a business. Make sure it will make money for you and make sure you understand how.

I'm definitely critical of the whole \"HOLD\" (flip the last two letters lol, I can't write it out because it's not allowed here) mentality because it encourages people to hold onto investments which really aren't going to do well, either because they didn't do objective, solid DD before entering them or because the situation regarding that investment has still changed, i.e., their old DD no longer applies. There's nothing wrong with selling for a loss if things no longer seem like they will do better.\n\n>Also your paragraph on how various sectors are only up because of the times in the year where they did well is nonsensical to me?\n\nI was making the point that people might have bought into certain sectors later in the year and still be down for the year even if that sector is up for the entire year, and that doesn't necessarily make it a poor sector in which to park your cash.

The upside is they have zero minimum investments, zero fees, and zero expense ratios. The downside is you can only hold them in a Fidelity brokerage account, you cannot move them to another brokerage, and you cannot buy them in any other brokerage than Fidelity.\n\nThese are important for a few reasons - zero fees and etc is excellent because I like my money. I also like Fidelity and don't think I'll ever change brokerages unless something apocalyptic happens and at that point, ammunition and diesel fuel for my battle wagon will probably be more important that the S&P 500.\n\nI use FNILX, which tracks the S&P 500 but doesn't *license* the S&P 500 name so you don't have that factored into fees. It's just labeled a \"large cap index fund.\" There's also FZROX which is a total market index, and some others like FXNAX which is their version of a total bonds market as a zero-fee mutual fund.\n\nAt roughly $16.60 per share an no minimum investment floor (a lot of mutual funds start with like, $2000 to $5000 minimum initial investment) I PERSONALLY BELIEVE they're great for depressed millenials. Also comparing FXAIX (the S&P500 mutual fund) and FNILX, FXAIX comes out around 1.5% better returns which are eaten by inflation and fees anyway so I don't see why not just use FNILX with Fidelity.\n\nAs products, they can be offered with zero fees and expenses because they're bringing customers into the door for using Fidelity as a brokerage and customers are then more likely to purchase or use other Fidelity products so by being \"free\" they pay for themselves through other products.\n\nAs for ETFs in general, they differ from mutual funds because they are available for purchase all day long and their prices fluctuate with the market. Mutual Funds can only be bought once per day after the market closes when fund managers stabilize their price change. ETFs are basically baskets of stocks purchased at a rounded price, and managers are like \"Here's a baller sack of stocks I picked based on this wild math formula which prints money. My ETF list is better than theirs and, just trust us, this shit's fire.\" These fund managers are constantly flipping stocks in and out of their baskets based on the income and growth potential compared to the investment objective - growth, dividends, income, stability, etc - and by doing all this work they have 'expense ratios and fees' which is basically them skimming the profits off the top to pay for the work they do in ensuring you make profit.\n\nSo there's people who like to do their own research and due diligence, and maintain their own lists of individual stock holdings they like. And there's people who buy ETFs and pay the fees because they can't be fucked to do the research and DD themselves.\n\nI can't be fucked, so I hold ETFs.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "THANK YOU SO DANM MUCH, really explained a lot for me bro", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "What helped me in the beginning was the Investopedia website, just reading articles on stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, just understanding what they are.

However, my hunch is he finishes 10b5-1 this year at least in order to shut down the story he pays no taxes.\n\nThere is a theory that he's trying to get ahead of potential increases in taxes on the ultra wealthy, however from what I can tell that conversation is mostly related to capital gains (not ordinary income).More than half (6.5M out of 12M) of his selling to date has been (and likely will be) attributed to his 10b5-1 plan, which is related to his nonqualified stock options from his 2012 performance package. \n\nThese NSOs are taxed as ordinary income (market value at exercise - exercise price), not capital gains. Given his exercise price is like $6, it's basically pure income. Hence, for the majority of the shares he is selling there is no difference from a tax rate perspective if he sells in 2021 or 2022 (the tax brackets and rates are effectively the same).\n\nHowever, there is a difference in what the stock price might be. NSO sales this year may make sense from a tax perspective if he is expecting Tesla stock price to increase next year (pay income tax on a share price of 1000 vs a higher price next year). Though, this argument does not hold water, if he thought this way then he could have easily filed the plan in Spring/Summer when the stock was <$600.\n\nThe same thinking applies to the remaining sales of shares he holds currently. He could theoretically be selling now to get ahead of a potential capital gains tax hike (ala Nadella/Bezos), however I really do not think Elon Musk is that near sighted to care about a few % points of tax savings by giving up 1) ownership of his company and 2) potential longer term gains. Additionally, Nadella/Bezos sale was for a definite tax hike specific to Washington state, there is no such passed increase Federally or in CA/TX to my knowledge.\n\nThus I do not think the tax theories make any sense to me. My guess is that Elon just wants to have a sizable tax bill for 2021 so that no one can say the richest man in the world paid \"no taxes\". We've seen him defend himself in interviews, but when you start talking about effective tax rates that requires math for normal people, their eyes glaze over.

As a prequel to NTTD, it's actually something meaningful. When this movie first came out, I hated it. Because most of the story made almost no sense and the 3rd act of the film was pure nonsense and bullshit which completely ruined the first 2 acts of the film which were actually genuinely good. Only now, with the retrospect of NTTD existing, can I now watch Spectre and realize it's the first part of a 2-film arc. The Daniel Craig era can be roughly subdivided into an initial duology (Casino Royale - Quantum of Solace), a semi-standalone film (Skyfall), and a concluding duology (Spectre - No Time to Die). \n\nThis does not excuse the ridiculous shoehorning of Blofeld and Spectre into the Craig era, which only happened because after decades of legal fighting EON Productions/Danjaq finally regained the rights to these bits of intellectual property. The way they retconned events of the previous 3 films under the octopus umbrella of Spectre was hardly believable, because honestly it wasn't, it was done because they got the rights back and they desperately wanted everyone to know it.\n\nThe 3rd act of the film is still bad. It just is. As a setup for NTTD, Spectre is a functional film and forms the first part of a duology. That doesn't make some of the events of the film less stupid, or the retcon more pointless and aggravating. What's ridiculous is that like I said, the first 2/3 of the film is really, really good. When they go back to London at the end, the script goes completely retarded and the film falls apart. \n\nI like Spectre least of all the Craig era films, because it is the only one where having an script that makes sense, a story that flows rationally, and an outcome that feels like it was a conclusion and not a contrivance of external factors were completely pushed aside in favor of making sure the entire world knew that Blofeld and Spectre were back in James Bond canon.

{"title": "If You Think Inflation Will Stay Around Longer Than Your Dad, Buy $TLT Puts", "selftext": "# TL;DR\n\nThe long End Of Yield Curve (10Y+) will Steepen. \n\nInflation running hot and CBs can't hike rates.\n\nNobody will buy a negative yield 20Y-30Y. \n\nYields Run, TLT Plummets.\n\nDouble Top with Bearish Divergence (weekly chart).\n\nBoth, fundamentals and Technicals there.\n\nThis may be the only trade you need to make this year.\n\nEveryone will continue to believe inflation is under control until they don't. This is a trade we can actually see happening in front of us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL\n\nThe fundamental premise is inflation is present. Within inflationary environments, there is a steepening of the long end of the yield curve.  The long end includes treasury bills with a maturity of 10 years or greater.\n\nSo, if the fed would increase interest rates like many are forecasting, then lending is reduced the economy slows, which adds deflationary pressures and problem solved. However, the FED can't really hike rates in our current fiscal situation. Unlike the 1970s when the US was a net creditor nation with hella stacks, we are now a net debtor nation with a 250% Debt to GDP ratio (rekkt). If federal funds rates increase it would cause the current interest on government debt (currently \\~2%) to also increase. The resulting rise in interest could quickly bankrupt[ the US government](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/kelly-evans-can-the-fed-afford-to-raise-rates.html) (double rekkt).\n\n**How So?**\n\nCurrently, at a 2% interest rate, the US Gov pays $400B in interest. If the FFR goes from 0.0 - 0.25% to 2.0-4.0%. We could see a corresponding doubling or tripling in interest rates. Meaning, we would have to spend close to $1 trillion in interest per year. But, those rates aren't even close to high enough to control inflation. Paul Volker had to increase the mf 'n FFR to 20%! Which would equate to $4T+ just in interest payments. \n\nSo, since we can't raise rates, we are more similar to the 1940s US (shout out to Lyn Alden). Meaning, debt is high and inflation will run hot. Commodities and commodity producers will outperform this decade. These pressures cause the selling of long-term treasuries and a steepening on the long end of the yield curve. This is also known as a [bearish steepening](https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/blog/chart-two-types-of-steepening-yield-curves). \n\nBUT WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?!\n\nHERE'S HOW WE MAKE MONEY\n\nOur greatest advantage is that the US Bond Market is about to go from manipulated (via fed reserve purchasing) to the free market by [July '22](https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/fed-s-powell-says-taper-could-start-in-november-finish-in-mid-2022-121092300065_1.html). The free market wants at least a breakeven rate on their T-bill which is currently[2.4%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIE) on the 10Y. However, the 10Y is currently yielding 1.5%. \n\nSince $TLT moves inversely to yields, that would drop $TLT to \\~$125. \n\n**What positions?**\n\nThe play itself has been laid out by the FED. Taper to begin Nov/Dec '21 and hopefully, end by mid '22.  \n\nSo, an end of '22/ beginning of '23 $TLT put would yield over a 100% return if treasury bonds return to their breakeven rates by June. \n\nI currently have 10 x 12/18/22 $135 puts\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/197q6loev7581.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=d84f517f3b712231551b8751e775b8a86414356f\n\n**Crayons**\n\nI see a massive Head and Shoulders pattern with a bearish divergence in the right shoulder. The target for the H&S is \\~$100. I'm being conservative with my personal target at $120 assuming rates return to breakeven levels. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6s4dle95x7581.png?width=2012&format=png&auto=webp&s=16ac33b78e1956a90d4660e995ac4f0eef55820b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Risks**\n\n1.

{"title": "Understanding DWAC/TMTG's Value Proposition", "selftext": "**Not financial advice. Mange risk.**\n\n**Preface**\n\nThis post is not to meant to be controversial. I am not here to discuss your feelings and opinions. This is simply to walk you through what investors in DWAC/TMTG are betting on if you're interested in learning about it. I am not here to convince you of anything. This DD is simply to give you insight into the value proposition that holders of DWAC are basing their investment off of. I am simply going to go by the math and logic as it compares to the risk and reward. It's going to make this post a lot less exciting to the readers who are looking for the typical hype and WSB lingo, which is disappointing but it can't be avoided given the nature surrounding this topic.\n\n**The Basics**\n\nTrump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) is a company aimed at\n\n* Social Media (like Facebook and Twitter etc.) - TruthSocial\n* Streaming Services (like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Discovery+ etc.) - TMTG+\n* Alternative news (like Fox, OANN, newsmax etc.)\n* General webservices (like Stripe, Amazon Web Services, etc.)\n\nThere is also an agreement with Rumble (32m+) users for a youtube alternative and hosting services for Truthsocial etc. and it is speculated there may be other aspects of the company.\n\n**SPAC Structure**\n\n$DWAC is in a definitive merger agreement with TMTG to take it public. After the merger is complete DWAC shares will be worth roughly 37.21 M /  193.4M (shares post merger) **\\~19.2% (dilution factor of about 5.2 or around 80.8% dilution)** of the company. This means currently at $54.24 a share the current marketcap is priced in at 10.5B . Shares will automatically be converted to the stock ticker symbol $TMTG.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ju2wss12hc581.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=025f3fda37ae643a5afe257fa81362298e0f03ec\n\n**The Value Proposition**\n\nCompared to its competitors DWAC has massive upside potential. For starters, TWTR IPO'd with zero profit for a marketcap, adjusted for inflation, of 30-40B . From our math from before, this translates into a 3-4x the current share price of $54, $162-216 a share.\n\nHowever social media is one small aspect of the business model. I'm going to make some conservative assumptions about what the userbase size will translate into for the different aspects of the company in terms of share price of the SPAC DWAC.\n\nI'm going to start with TMTG+ streaming services since it's a much more simplistic model to users paying the company directly for its services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNetflix - 214 Million Paid Subscribers\n\nDisney+ - 118 Million Paid Subscribers\n\nHulu - 44 Million Paid Subscribers\n\nDiscovery+ - 15 Million Paid subscribers\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNetflix has 271B marketcap compared to 214 Million Paid Subscribes. This translates to about $1266 in market cap per subscriber.\n\nLet's say TMTG+ achieves only 10M subscribers with only $1000 per sub in marketcap . This alone would justify the current share price based off 10B marketcap.\n\nLet's say TMTG+ achieves only 40M subscribers at only $1000 per sub in marketcap. This alone would justify a 4x increase in the share price based on a 40B marketcap.\n\nTranslating this aspect of the business you can roughly translate **every 10M TMTG+ subs to an additional $55 in share price.**\n\nLet's move forward to the Social Media aspect\n\nFacebook - 2.89 B  Monthly Active Users , 917 B marketcap, $317 per monthly user in marketcap.\n\nYoutube - 2 B Monthly Active Users (MAU), 500B marketcap, $250 per monthly user in marketcap.\n\nTiktok \\~1B users, \\~400B marketcap, \\~$400/user\n\nSnapchat \\~306MAU \\~ 81B marketcap \\~ $264/user\n\nTwitter - 350M MAU, $35B marketcap, $100/user marketcap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can see that some companies are more valuable than others because of success of monetization. some companies are valued a lot higher per user.  Giving these a market cap weighted average is about $308/user\n\nLets say Truth social manages to do a much lousier $100/user in marketcap. This would mean 100M users would translate into 10B in marketcap. So **for about 100M users you can add an additional $55 to the share price.**\n\nLet's talk about the news and webservices aspect of the business model.\n\nAWS is responsible for about 64B in revenue of Amazon's 386B in revenue. AMZN has a marketcap of 1.74 Trillion dollars. Roughly speaking 16.5% of the marketcap (yeah I know margins etc.) is from AWS meaning AWS has a marketcap of something like 287B. Let's say TMTG pulls of 5% of this. That's an additional 14B in marketcap or about $79 a share. So for about **every 5% of amazon's size in web services you can add $79 dollars to the share price.**\n\nFox has a marketcap of 20B, lets say it achieves 25% of Fox's audience. That's an additional 5B in marketcap or **an additional $27 a share for every 25% of Fox's audience size from news.**\n\nOk here's the growth projections from the corporate slide deck\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bn8uhtlilc581.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c1d215d25232e116a4159877948a0a21b101bac\n\nAs you can see these numbers are pretty heavily understated to show what a slow growth and size scenario would look like. My suspicion is that this is deliberately understated, at least in time frames and definitively in social media users.\n\nSo currently the markets are priced at \\~54 a share would would translate to something like\n\n40M TS users ($22) + 5M TMTG+ subs ($27.5)  + 4% of Fox's audience ($4.32), 0.5% of AWS ($7.9)  \\~ $61.72\n\nYou can see this is a bit comical for what's being priced in for a someone who is as well known as DJT who had over 150M followers online and over 71M votes in his 2nd run for president. We've all seen the portfolio trackers and many others get banned off TWTR lately.\n\nHere's a potential scenario\n\n300M TS users (\\~1/10th of facebook) ($165) + 25M TMTG+ subs ($137.5)  + 5% AWS ($79) + 50% Fox Audience ($54) = $435.5 and still have massive room for improvement\n\nMore scenarios\n\n600M TS users (\\~1/5th of facebook) ($330) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($220)  + 5% AWS ($79) + 50% Fox Audience ($54) = $683 a share and still have massive room for improvement\n\nA total blow out of just one of the aspects\n\n1B TS users (\\~1/3rd of facebook) ($550) + 40M TMTG+ subs ($220)  + 5% AWS ($79) + 100% Fox Audience ($108) = $435.5 and still have massive room for improvement = $957 a share\n\nImagine in these scenarios it will be trading for much more aggressive ratios **so DWAC 1000** with much additional upside after on fundamentals is not a mathematical challenge.\n\n**Addressing common FUD - Understanding actual risk and nonsensical Fear Uncertainty and Doubt**\n\nI know many reading this will get very emotional both long and short and will look for any reason to make this sound bigger or smaller or impossible or dumb. There's also many people who do not want this to happen for their own personal benefits. So here's some common things that are said and a general counter to it.\n\n**FUD:** \"\\*The merger might fail or get blocked resulting in this going bad.\"\\***Counter**: SPACs don't fail for the reasons described or eluded to by the outlets. u/independence_hall has a great post  \"The SEC and FINRA DO NOT have the legal authority or power to block the DWAC/TMTG merger\" please see his post history and read it. He did the leg work and debunked this. It's almost a zero chance of happening.\n\n**FUD:** \"People won't want to advertise there\"\n\nCounter: There will be direct monetization outside of ads (see TMTG+ section) also Companies will have to go where people are advertising with their attention and dollars. It's easy for companies to dissociate from where their ads are located when the free market forces their hand.  \"Our ads are located in places that do not represent our beliefs as a company, we are solely interested in providing business to our customers despite their personal identities\" \" see it's not that hard to find work arounds for minor problems like this. Content creators will likely be supporting each other as well with a cut going to the host (much like Twitch, web3.0 etc.)\n\n**FUD:** \"Trump doesn't know what he's doing he can't even open email\"Counter: Trump just got over a billion in PIPE funding (largest in SPAC history). There's plenty of well paid people with the right background on the company. Trump is largely here for traction, which is the primary issue all social media companies face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9wrafrz1e581.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=039d0be978676d99b6cbe110626876055cb0c76b\n\nThere's also an agreement with Rumble to use their services and a rumor about Parler. You're welcome\n\n**FUD:** \"This will be GAB/Parler 2.0 failure\"Counter: TMTG+ and the other services are nothing like the markets that these are in. Secondly Parler was becoming massively successful very quickly before it was pulled from the app store and AWS violated contract removing it. Parler is back now. TMTG is safe\n\n**FUD:** \"Trump steaks\"\n\nCounter: Trump steaks and the other very few things like 'From the Desk' that were unsuccessful account for a very small percentage of his ventures. Those are also very different products in very different markets. Investigate this further if you still think it's relevant, you'll be surprised the actual facts and not what low effort FUDs would have you believe.\n\n**FUD:** \"Myself and other have moral/ethical dilemmas because of our ideology\"Counter: I'm not here to argue with you to try to show you why everything is wrong, it's a simple observation that at minimum hundreds of millions of people disagree with you and there is a massive market for it and a demand.\n\n**FUD:** \"Open source\" \"Bad security\" \"Software licensing\"Counter: Source is released and posted, security is fine. Android and Linux are OS as are many projects. There's billions in funding, tech people have already solved this issues for many other services. The issue is Traction. That's where Trump comes in.\n\nI'll add a lot more to this since I'm sure there will be plenty more to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short Interest**\n\nSo since this thing is trading far below fundamental value, what gives? We'll discuss the short interest is at least something like 3M on a 28.7M float. Also that over a 1B shares have traded hands. If something like 3% of this is held by people who are not willing to sell, that means essentially the entire float is locked up until we see higher prices. I have some conjecture in my post history talking about how there is probably more holders than there are shares because of naked selling and synthetics etc. Also the cost to borrow rate is up to 88%, this is quite high when you consider last time GME hit these level the MOASS happened. A lot of shorting took place in late Oct so FTDs are surely past due? Utilization is already at 100% so short sellers look to be in trouble. I suspect many of them shorted based on ideology and not fundamentals.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere's a lot of upside and demand that isn't priced in IMHO\n\nI have shares, warrants, and calls and I believe the beta-launch or full launch may cause a massive surge in price expectations once hard data rolls in, if not then by the time the revenue rolls in. The risks are often nonsensical or overstated by people with strong opposing political ideology and lack of financial and technological understandings.\n\n**Not financial advice.
