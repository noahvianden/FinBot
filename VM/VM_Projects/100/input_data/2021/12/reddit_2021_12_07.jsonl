The downtrends on the chart mean that shares were being delivered. They don't just keep somehow piling up.\n\nThird, he says these are \"options contracts\" (without specifiying whether they are calls or puts, the strike prices, expiration, etc) but this is also incorrect, the number reported is **shares** FTD. (Plus if they were options then any that expire OTM would just go away, and calls would offset puts, so the magnitude of shares that needed to be bought would be MUCH lower. But they aren't options, they're shares.) From the source:\n\n>The values of total fails-to-deliver shares represent the aggregate net balance of shares that failed to be delivered as of a particular settlement date.\n\nSo he added values that shouldn't be added and then multiplied by 100 without reason to get to a billion.

The amount of money the put is substantial. What struck me how many of them actually use leverage, as it is offered as well in such apps. It is gamified, it has a slider \"2x\" which can with a swipe increased to 5x. They have no clue what they are actually doing.\n\nAll-in-all they are extremely naive and not informed at all. I tried to educate, but then they show how much money they made on such accelerators. They don't look at P/E numbers of valuations, or risk. They jump onto stuff they hear in the news. The notion that the risk they take they have to compare, for example against the S&P500 index tracker performance in the same time they are invested, is not present. (most of them have net green numbers)\n\nWithout exception all of them had the same motivation: their banks charge them negative rates on their cash (I live in europe), up to -0.5% they have to pay. With a currently inflation of 5% ish percent that means loosing 5.5% per year on their cash. But I guess in the rest of the world it is similar. On bonds/cash account you lose every year several % of your money. So everyone flocks into equity, without looking at the risks, \"as it ain't gonna get worse than my cash account bleeding\".\n\nEven an insurance agent tried to sell me an investment with a very high TER. No, the TER was not even known to her. Arguments didn't help, she was sure as hell, again the motivation was that cash was just losing value and that wouldn't change as Europe couldn't afford to raise the rates.\n\nAlso the \"large cap over small cap\" pattern I see. They buy Amazon, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, stuff they wear (Adidas, Nike), you name it. They stay away from the small stuff, because then they have to understand the business.\n\nAlso COVID did a lot. They were bored and saw advertisements everywhere... especially the banks themselves show every time on the login to their cash account their brokerage offer.\n\n[So I just looked up the use of margin.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL663067003Q)\n\nAs images tell more than a thousand words, but aren't allowed here, [here's a link.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=J6OZ) It basically dipped a bit in the march 2020 stock crash and then went up by a factor of 2.\n\nThis ain't good at all. So much leverage, with the FED preparing to raise rates.\n\nMy next step? Get more to a cash position. Green positions I partly exited (will hold some of them nevertheless) and will continue to do so. I want more dry powder if this powder keg goes up.\n\nYes, I know the \"time in the market\", market timing, etc etc. I will stay invested but I'm getting more to cash.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger has been saying that it’s risky for the U.S. to rely too heavily on Asian chipmakers.

Gelsinger hammered away at the same point again last Wednesday, saying that China’s military threat against Taiwan makes the island “unstable.” \n\nOn Friday, TSMC fired back. It was the first time that I, or any experts I talk with, can recall the Taiwanese giant admonishing a customer. “Not too many people will believe what Intel says,” TSMC Chairman Mark Liu told reporters on the sideline of a tech forum in Taipei. He added that TSMC does not attack its “peers.” Previously, TSMC executives have almost always described Intel as a “customer” rather than a “peer,” as a show of respect.\n\n“It will be very negative for the United States to subsidize only American companies,” Liu said. “Unlike Intel, TSMC is very positive about non-U.S. chipmakers expanding capacity in America.

So I'll clear it up because ive been following this for far more than a day like most people here.\n\nFirst, TSMC and Samsung, the other two leading edge fabs are heavily subsidized by their government, to the point where they might as well be state owned. So it absolutely makes sense to subsidize the third leading edge fab, Intel, if we want a domestic manufacturer and to prevent a duopoly situation.\n\nSecond, this isnt the first spat Mark Liu (TSMC chairman) has had with Intel. Months ago he said America should not subsidize domestic fabs because its a global economy and TSMC is better. Essentially he doesnt want the US supporting Intel and not TSMC, because hes the chairman and wants TSMC to be the dominant player..\n\nThird in terms of the money possibly going to buybacks and not R&D, Intel stopped doing buybacks last year to invest more into fabs and R&D, they still are a dividend company, but no more buybacks. Look at their balance sheets, Intel is spending billions on R&D and fabs, even when they did buybacks it was a small percent. AMD has done more in buybacks than Intel has done in the last year.\n\nFourth, there needs to be less dependence on TSMC. We all know what China's/Xi's plans on with Taiwan, and even ignoring that, Taiwan had a major drought this year that forced water restrictions that lowered production. The world cannot rely on one country for like 80% of leading edge silicon. And Samsung is falling behind they will be roughly 2 years behind Intel and TSMC by 2023, while Intel is catching up up to TSMC and only about a year behind now, so it really makes the most sense to give the most subsidies to Intel, who are also domestic and have contracts with the DoD for chips for military/aero sector than to Samsung.\n\nFifth, why should chips be subsidized anyways? Because they are almost as important as energy. Phones, cars, PC's, planes, medical equipment, tractors, boats, manufacturing equipment, you name it and they are reliant on chips. Again, if something happens with TSMC, in the next few years, the economic losses that covid cause for 2020 will be a drop in the bucket. \n\n\nBut at the end of the day, this exact story is a big nothing burger. TSMC simply doesnt want Intel getting the lions share of the $50 billion CHIPS act, because it would be funding their competitor.

{"title": "Recovering from a ~40% loss over one year", "selftext": "Hello,\n\nThis is just my experience investing for the first time during the last year and a half. Probably all very basic, but it's been such a ride for me and wanted to share today's milestone of finally not being in the red anymore.\n\n**The start**\n\nI started investing in July last year. Tried to learn as much as possible before doing so. Started with £600 but quickly kept adding more and more to £10K and beyond.\n\n**The debacle**\n\nSome investments were just moving sideways, which is quite boring, especially if you are constantly looking at your account because you are new and learning, so even though I was convinced and had strong evidence that they were going to go up -and they eventually did-, I started trading to make a few bucks every day.\n\nIt worked for most of of the trades and little by little I could afford one or two additional shares with the same money. Then the big jump up came in and got me out. Missed an about 25% jump (from 80 € to 100 €), then jumped in just to see it collapse.\n\nI lost a lot -to me- of money. Only two wrong trades resulted in an overall of over -£5K, out of the \\~£12K total investment I had done up until then. Not only that, the process was painful. Sleepless nights making up things in your mind, anxiety and stress because if you don't buy/sell at the right time then you are missing out. And, of course, you cannot time that. So it affected my sleep and health a bit over that time, and more so after losing money that you had before. You cannot undo it and you feel stupid. And to just recover you now need to have even higher percentual gains.\n\n**The recovery**\n\nAfter contending with the idea of just giving up investing entirely, I switched to long term investing. Did some research and moved everything into AAPL when it was at around $130. I kept adding as I could, and never again sold to trade (or sold at all). I could comfortably forget about it and didn't even care if it went up or down in the short term, because I was committed to stay in for years or decades. In fact, sometimes I could sympahtise with people wishing AAPL went down momentarily just to add more to what they already had. It's been a ride and taken a while, but today I can say I am so happy to not be in the red anymore. Feels so rewarding, and definitely a day I thought would take perhaps 5 or more years to arrive, instead of just about one.\n\nI know this might seem like a smaller amount of money and time to many of you, but just wanted to share my experience after one year and a half investing. I am glad I didn't give up and was patient. I am well aware of the fact that things can go up or down from here, but I am so glad I recovered from all the losses.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is just my experience and I cannot give advice since I am not an expert, but what worked for me is to really focus more on actually investing in a company you trust and think long term, rather than trading and trying to make quick money (you definitely can, but you are also more likely to lose).\n\nThanks also everyone for the discussions in this forum, which were very helpful along the way to understand how things work.

{"title": "Cathie Wood to Launch a New ETF. It Tracks a Transparency Index", "selftext": " \n\nCathie Wood's ARK Investment Management is revving up to launch its second new U.S. exchange-traded fund in almost three years this week.\n\nThe ARK Transparency ETF follows the Transparency Index (TRANSPCY), which tracks the stock price movements of the 100 most transparent companies globally. It is ARK's ninth ETF, and begins trading Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange.\n\n\"ARK believes transparent companies have less friction which could lead to exponential growth opportunities,\" the company wrote in an investment factsheet.\n\nThe Transparency Index's top five holdings as of Oct. 31 include Cloudflare ( NET) , Bloom Energy (BE), Enphase Energy (ENPH) , Tesla ( TSLA) and Spotify ( SPOT) , according to ARK.\n\nWood became a high-profile manager after her innovation-focused portfolios surged in 2020, with the investment firm's flagship ETF, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), delivering a 153% return that year. She became especially well-known for her bullish call on Tesla -- a call she has since reiterated, saying she believed the stock could reach $3,000 by 2025.\n\nThe investment products have since struggled to outpace last year's gains, trading mostly sideways in 2021. The Innovation ETF is down nearly 25% this year, and the worst performer -- the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) -- down 31%.\n\nOnly two of ARK's ETFs have risen year-to-date -- the Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL) and the ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF (ARKQ).\n\nJust like most ppl on this sub back in 2020 I was a big ARK bull, but after seeing how they've performing since Feb '21, I've sold off all my ARK funds.

Also worth mentioning that during Clinton's first term, Republicans had a majority in both chambers of Congress and rejected Bill's budget proposal until it was balanced. Congress has more of an effect on budgets than the president does.\n2. I don't blame Obama for the mess George Bush left him with. George Bush was one of the worst and most incompetent presidents in the history. But when Obama took office, debt as a % of GDP was at 82%. When he left office, debt as a % of GDP was at 105%. When Trump took office, the debt as a % of GDP was at 105%. COVID shot up the debt level so just like I wouldn't blame Biden for it, you can't realistically blame Trump for the debt when in 2019, it debt as a % of GDP was only at 107%. Lol @ you trying to blame the tax cuts for the inflation rate. Name these tax cuts you are talking about and let's break it down. It just seems like you're regurgitating talking points.\n3. \"Infrastructure bill mostly paid for.\" You must be new. The government infrastructure bills are almost always way off the estimate. Happens in almost every government function. The real bill, which will reveal itself in many years down the line, will be much higher because of government incompetence.\n4. Do your research. Military spending as a % of GDP is near record lows. The USA is spending less on military spending than many other countries. Also, last I checked, the privilege you get being able to have the freedoms you have are a direct result from the fact that the military is protecting American interest. Would you prefer China have the strongest military in the world? The only reason China hasn't seized upon Taiwan, Hong Kong, and why Russia hasn't invaded Ukraine full-scale is because they know America's military is vastly superior. Mandatory spending is out of control due to the fact that there are fewer people contributing into the system than those taking in. 45% of Americans paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2019. (Not using COVID years because it is anomaly). Federal tax revenue as a % of GDP has been consistent for the past seven decades. If you take a look at the chart below, you'll see one line stay consistent and the other shoots up.[https://i.gyazo.com/efb2659146061e95d383b5a22d8d1807.png](https://i.gyazo.com/efb2659146061e95d383b5a22d8d1807.png)\n5. Climate change is being addressed but you are smart enough to know that nothing America does will matter if impoverished economies such as India and parts of China don't also change the amount of carbon emissions they produce. Also, take a look at nuclear power which is vastly better than renewables right now but is being decreased. If you want clean energy for cheap and in abundance, the easy route is nuclear power. Electrification? Lol, what are you even talking about. Electricity is primarily produced with fossil fuels in America for a reason. Renewable energy is what they call, 'unreliable energy' because there aren't enough batteries to store the energy for future use. If there is no sun or wind for the day, you're not getting enough electricity to run an economy. The bottleneck is finding ways to store that energy and quite frankly, there isn't an economic way to do so, yet. \"Reliance on foreign oil\", actually, America was energy independent and didn't need foreign oil when Trump was president because he pushed for quick approval of new drilling. Again, if you want clean energy, nuclear power should have been approved but we all know why both sides don't want it. Paid maternity/paternity leave when 45% of Americans aren't even paying federal income taxes? Please tell me how you would like to pay for it. Oh, right, \"tax the billionaires.\" Their wealth is tied into stocks. It's 'paper' money until they sell and if they sell, the value of the stock plummets so you can't assume that you can generate enough money from stocks alone to fund these entitlement programs. If there is a stock crash, how are you funding these programs? Hint: You can't. Do you know why Scandinavian countries are able to fund their programs? Primarily, because they have a small population in which the majority of their taxpayers are contributing into the system. Again, if 45% of Americans are not paying any federal income taxes and data shows that over 55% of Americans are receiving more in federal benefits than they contribute in taxes, what other benefits would you like to give for free? FYI, California has a larger population than all the Scandinavian countries combined. Denmark has a population of 6 million people. It's easy to fund the freeloaders when they represent a few people. Try funding millions of freeloaders in America who aren't contributing.\n6. You want a balanced budget but you also endorse spending even more on programs. When the Social Security was created, again, you had more people contributing into the system than taking from it. Right now, you have fewer people contributing into the system than those taking. Also, the life expectancy was much lower back then whereas today, the life expectancy means you have a ton of people getting Social Security payments for a longer period of time than was originally expected when the system was created. No politician wants to touch the question of social security because it is an automatic NO from voters. Look at how divisive both parties are. Do you seriously think you can get a balanced budget with two incredibly partisan extremists on both sides? If your solution is to tax more, list out your tax proposals. In NYC, tax rates for the wealthy are already, with state/local/federal, nearly 55%. Taxing capital gains is great but who pays for these programs if there is a stock crash?\n\nThe truth is, the middle-class is the only class that suffers in this current system. The wealthy earn too much for any policy to really affect them drastically and the poor receive more benefits than they contribute by a wide margin. Middle-class gets nothing. They don't get free college education the way the poor can qualify for, they don't get healthcare benefits for free, they don't qualify for SNAP, they don't qualify for government housing. America is a country with over 330 million people. We aren't even talking about those who are illegally here who cost hundreds of billions. Name me a country with close to the amount of population receiving more welfare benefits than America... None. America hands out an insane amount of welfare benefits.

It's a lot like buying bitcoin. No one really knows that what\nthey are buying, but they don't care because it continues to rise in value.\nGranted, Tesla is more transparent then Bitcoin, be still not the model of\nperfection that it is currently valued at. Right now, TSLA is trading at a\nforward PE of 212X. Apple and Microsoft trade at 43x and 32x\nrespectively. The market trades at 25x. Even if you factor in the\nunbelievable earnings growth expectation that the market has for Tesla,\ntheir Price to Growth multiple is almost 4 times the market. This feels SO\nmuch like Cisco in 2000. Back then we said \"but networking is the\nbackbone to all growth\". And yet there still a limit to how fast a company\ncan grow.\nHaving said that, can you remind me how much Tesla you bought?

What we struggle with is that there are periods of time when investors are willing to over pay for that growth…compelling others to follow. And that \"irrational exuberance\" can go on for some time.\nAs fundamental investors, what we do is identify intrinsic value. Tesla is worth a lot, and will likely be worth more tomorrow then today. But from what we can evaluate, it isn't worth today what people are paying for it.\nYour current position is about $41k.

This isn't exactly Tesla vs Lucid... chip manufacturing I'd imagine is significantly easier. Correct me if I'm wrong.\" :\n\nChip manufacturing is slightly easier. just like how Lucid was able to produce a very respectable car (some say its better, debatably, since it is very much more expensive)  but why do people buy teslas. Ecosystem. Its intuitive. Its easy to charge. it just \"works\" Nvidia is exactly the same. when you buy their product, they sell you an entire ecosystem, software etc included, to make your product work that much better. just imagine apple vs android. even when android had better hardware in the past, apple used software to beat it in general. Hence the big ass loyal customer base. same applies here, especially so with corporations who want their TOOLS to JUST WORK. \"But does Nvidia make any revenue from an AI application\" Yes, watch their keynote.

The company is moving toward Web 3.0 and is becoming more of a tech company then just a regular gambling company.\n\nHow does the price explode, short covering + short covering on dark pools, options gamma squeeze after breakout, Algos forced to de-basket DKNG from short high growth stock basket related to ARKK and macro event driven Algos (interest rates, j-pow tapering and money printer slowing down)\n\n**Price Point = $90+ in honour of Jim Chanos and claim that DKNG trades 30x revenue**.\n\n**Reason #1 - Jim Chanos**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/exmjq5a705481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0a1bb8451dd2b75b9b35c9a335bd159179206e\n\nThis guy is smart, caught Enron’s accounting fraud but he’s lost his touch.\n\nHe shorted TSLA – [https://www.benzinga.com/short-sellers/21/10/23427531/why-jim-chanos-is-still-short-tesla-and-this-tech-stock-thats-up-15-ytd](https://www.benzinga.com/short-sellers/21/10/23427531/why-jim-chanos-is-still-short-tesla-and-this-tech-stock-thats-up-15-ytd)\n\nHe hates meme stocks and those who trade them - [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jim-chanos-short-seller-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc-greedy-entitled-2021-8](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jim-chanos-short-seller-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc-greedy-entitled-2021-8)\n\nNow he’s shorting DKNG but using bogus math to do it and hoping Apes don’t know basic arithmetic.\n\nHe’s quoted in this interview [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chanos-short-draftkings-doordash](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chanos-short-draftkings-doordash) with the following reasons to short DKNG:\n\n“DraftKings has a valuation right now of 30 times runway revenue,” he told CNBC. “You can believe in sports betting ... but this business model is flawed.”\n\nResponse from the CEO :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1n2pxbf805481.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ae8a1422235ff93384d909ebe8d960501206bee\n\n**Jason’s right, market cap was never 30x revenue, revenue consensus for 2021 is 1.2 billion, Jim Is suggesting the market cap is $36 Billion, DKNG has not come close to that in the past few months and the current market cap $12.72 Billion.**\n\n“If you quadrupled DraftKings’ revenue and gross profit ... and take their marketing spending, which is currently over 100% of revenue, to 10% of revenue, which is their target, and you keep overhead at today’s level ... DraftKings would still be losing $200 million a quarter,” Chanos said.\n\nBelow is from the income statement, 4x revenue gives you 851,276, he said take the marketing spending and make it 10% of revenue, so that’s 85,127.6. Keeping everything else the same the loss turns into a profit of $440,915.40. So why would he go on CNBC and say different, because he hopes nobody will do the math on their own and trust him. This is pure manipulation or he’s gone senile.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bqtolml905481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=af724b9f388a8d3796b5af8264eeeba33c0156a3\n\nChanging a few lines of the income statement and keeping all else the same makes no sense as a bear case anyway, most lines in this income statement derive their value from previous entries or are items that would go up and down according to underlying factors, such as cost of revenue would increase with more revenue, expense related to admin would start to taper off over time and Etc.\n\nOnly reason this went anywhere is CNBC hyped Jim Chanos up to be an accounting expert, they even started the interview by reliving his Enron short, but in reality Jim has been losing money left and right and his firm is down a lot. This was a clear attempt by CNBC and Jim to manipulate paper hand investors to let their shares go for little to nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pqwir0ca05481.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=830d764ff43e4cd132fcf9f20cd6591004db9d0a\n\n**Reason #2 – upcoming catalyst to reverse bad quarter**\n\nShorts are going to want to get out of DKNG around this time, with the combination of NBA, NFL and NHL, the next earnings should be a blowout, plus will have the inclusion of new states that just legalized. Our hope is we send them off with a loss rather than a gain.\n\nDuring the last earnings, it was revealed that the lower revenue than expected was caused by favorites winning in NFL games during the weeks that were included in that earnings reports. This is an outlier event that can happen to gambling stocks and as we know just like options trading, you win some you lose some. But based on this information we can project with the recent upsets, the next quarter should actually have a significant increase in revenue. Basically people like to string favorites together in parlays for a better payout, if those hit , the house loses, if there are a healthy amount of upsets, the house makes money, if there are a lot of upsets, the house makes even more money. Look at some of the wins and losses these past few weeks and you will see plenty of upsets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aggvdt0b05481.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=52cb732be4cb67a29a75d887e1d6be5d2f378f36\n\nUpsets outweighing favorites for the majority of the NFL season\n\n**Huge growth**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/htn337ob05481.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffd62dd3655b0d43111b156c10b08a706f57f4a0\n\nGrowth comes at a cost and we can see by the income statement, DKNG spent a lot to grow the company, but with that they got market leadership, brand recognition, acquired a quality operator in Golden Nugget Casinos, and overall increased shareholder value.\n\nphysical casino’s are falling behind the online providers, but competition remains fierce and requires spending to open new markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqv1ghjc05481.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=a79b8d9dcaf5a038b12d140a84f60d4ffc0a1c0f\n\n**Inside buying – always a good sign**\n\nWe have seen a combination of the founders and exec team buying shares in the open market or exercising and holding options of DKNG. This is a positive sign as this time of the year we would see more selling. Also we notice a lot of selling by the big execs in anticipation of new tax laws next year, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and even Microsoft’s CEO had sold significant amounts of shares. So seeing the execs at DKNG buy at this low price shows confidence in the company’s future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oeix73bd05481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fdc10c5ed14dd0051b765ac2f5a78a983c03422\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bn79515e05481.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ba0e0047d9dc4e8bcc5f1698124d7d3cb6eb5d\n\n**Cash Burn and overspending concerns are overblown**\n\nWe get the same argument from short sellers about this stock as we do for all growth stocks. They burn cash and that’s a signal to investors that the stock in not well capitalized and will need to raise funds either through debt or equity issuance, which is dilutive to shareholders.\n\nBut as we can see from the below figures from the cash flow statement, the cash burn is small relative to the actual cash balance. The net change could also be seen below along with the growth in revenue, the ROI on this is clear, the more they spend to open new markets the higher growth is but when these markets start to mature, like New Jersey, they can become profitable within 2-3 years.\n\nSo, the cash burn on DKNG differs from other growth stocks because they are not trying to invent a new product, spending millions on R&D and only to half the product flop, they are gaining market shares in states that are newly legalized for gambling and converting existing daily fantasy clients to sports betting clients. Low risk spending in my opinion because they have done this successfully in other states and continue to execute on the marketing campaigns, they spend on by obtaining the #1 position in the states they are in, over time. If the state is not worth spending on, too small or not enough potential users, they will just spend less, it’s not out of control by any means, and well within the cash balance they have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m336726f05481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5fe731d8dd9510c83bac21be45a8f85568ff30\n\nThe below tweet from the CEO should boost confidence in the stock for long term holders, to be well capitalized is a bold statement for growth stocks but not for DKNG. They have a large cash balance, little to no change in cash over quarters and have already stated an equity offering would only come after the stock passes $125.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tpuklcuf05481.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=b749e54f4a573ebee9a0e1408c1126548f0922c5\n\nDKNG can be the next Amazon or TSLA, in this case the physical casinos are physical retail and legacy auto. The growth story is the same, operate at a loss, continue to growth, kill the competition, and disrupt the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/35lempmg05481.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=d147503372e12da13b1a29bf7324b2c0b4223ded\n\n**Trend change - Not just a Covid Play**\n\nMore and more people are betting online, and this is disruptive to physical casinos. Even with the emergence of physical casinos into the online space like BetMGM and Penn with barstool, the motivation to pursue this area is not strong with physical casinos, due to cannibalizing themselves.\n\nWe see in this article [https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/\\_/id/32753855/first-1-billion-month-nevada-sportsbooks](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/32753855/first-1-billion-month-nevada-sportsbooks) , a huge trend change, over 64% of bets came from online, and this is in Nevada, a destination for physical casinos, imagine the rest of the country. And this came in a month were casinos were open and travel was not restricted in Vegas.\n\n**Espn deal + twitter**\n\nESPN already has a relationship with DKNG from an earlier investment and a partnership would be worth billions. Same with twitter as the access to users opens opportunities to market and convert new users.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c1j7h0ih05481.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a53a0b498fa076914056c2eed672bdf3c36014c\n\n[**https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2021/08/27/espn-reportedly-in-talks-with-caesars-entertainment-and-draftkings-for-licensing-deal-worth-billions/?sh=373a985190ec**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2021/08/27/espn-reportedly-in-talks-with-caesars-entertainment-and-draftkings-for-licensing-deal-worth-billions/?sh=373a985190ec)\n\n[**https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/**](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/)\n\n[**https://www.legalsportsreport.com/32634/disney-owns-piece-of-draftkings-after-fox-deal/**](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/32634/disney-owns-piece-of-draftkings-after-fox-deal/)\n\n**Differentiation from current gambling stocks**\n\nDraftKing’s has a strong focus on innovation as you can see by their patent filings, they focus on customer retention, which is a huge competitive advantage in this space, when customers can be swayed from one app to another with free promos.

Zillow, Pelaton, TeleDoc, Zoom have no real relation to DKNG other than being in the ARKK ETF. This has been addressed by Cathie herself and we even see new ETFs popping up to inverse her fund. Wall Street is shorting a basket of stock related to ARKK and DKNG is being dragged down with them. DKNG differs from these particular stocks because they didn’t have a huge scandal like Zillow, or do an offering like Pelaton, or are considered a work from home stock like ZOOM but the price trend continue to match this basket of growth stocks. This is manipulation but once there is a breakout on DKNG the algos will have to cover and de-basket DKNG from this group similar to when TSLA broke out after their last earnings, which was also a Cathie wood stock.\n\n**Gamma Squeeze Potential**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qc2rmlqt05481.png?width=819&format=png&auto=webp&s=eac416148759bc6fe638e5680a02acbc3ce9fff9\n\nDKNG is a favorite of options market makers, with all the options outstanding, any breakout will send the stock flying in either direct, with enough buying pressure we squeeze up call options chain.\n\nOption chain skews towards calls for the next few weeks\n\n**Quote from intelligent investor which relates to the current state of growth stocks**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zpz583eu05481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=56cfe454d8cc93c52d963411195a548ab9f5754c\n\n**Positions – 300 Shares**\n\n**15 – Jan 2023 100C options**", "id": "rb1gbd", "created_utc": 1638890344.0, "score": 364, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 128, "comments": [{"body": "Long 400 shares, thanks for DD", "score": 65, "replies": []}, {"body": "Need a TLDR on the TLDR.", "score": 82, "replies": [{"body": "Gambling on gambling, that’s all I needed, count this ape in.", "score": 59, "replies": [{"body": "Perfect combination for WSB", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "its basically a play against options market makers who pin the stock down to burn out FDs and also against short sellers who followed Jim Chanos based on bad research.

This is a pretty good basis for deciding that they will have staying power as they grow into market share.\n\nI would want to make sure their intro bonuses taper off *after year one*, to know if customers are actually sticky or not. Or if you need to constantly throw more comps and bonuses at them. It's a competitive industry so I would suspect you'd need to spend more on retention, it's not 100% a one-time cost to acquire a client, competitors will always be running promotions.\n\nGood app design, brand, and familiarity does count for something, but it's a competitive industry and it is at the end of the day cost driven.

The insiders dumped about 370M in shares in Q2 and Q3 but now we're starting to see small insider buys trickle in. I think seeing some meaningful insider buys soon would confirm to me it's safe to pile into the stock - they likely wouldn't do this if another Entain-type bid is in the playbook.\n\nIt's kind of a dangerous game to play to speculate on big brain mgmt tactics, but that's definitely the kind of ruthless shit I'd do if your stock was overvalued in the 60s range.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

To avoid breaching the limit, the Treasury is using the **extraordinary measures** that allow it to continue to borrow additional amounts for a **limited time**. Treasury has announced that it will implement a provision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58) by transferring $118 billion to the Highway Trust Fund on December 15. CBO projects that the Treasury will most likely run out of cash before the end of December. If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and the credit rating agencies would react with downgrades. Yellen may have the authority to delay the transfer or break it into smaller payments but that would only keep the Treasury account afloat for a few more weeks.\n\n[Therefore, the extraordinary measures could be exhausted, and the Treasury could run out of cash, earlier or later than CBO projects.](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57653)\n\n**12/06** \\- Senate Republicans are rejecting a proposal floated by congressional Democratic leaders to attach a debt limit fix to the annual defense policy measure — typically treated as a must-pass bill and thought as the last hope for passing a new debt ceiling before the X date.\n\n# UPCOMING DECEMBER FED PAYMENTS OUT OF Treasury account: Balance=$152bil\n\n**12/15** \\- Highway Trust Payment = **$115bil**\n\n**12/15** \\- Interest payment = **+/-$50bil**\n\n**12/15** \\- SSA payment = $**20bil**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Federal Reserve Purchasing Projections Chart \\(at the current rate asset purchasing this chart shows will default the Treasury Account in December 2021\\)](https://preview.redd.it/x2j13wj8t6481.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bce4b7ff740e84d39d01677f5b76af753cf82d33)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Treasury Account DRAWDOWN MACRO IMPLICATIONS:\n\n* money market rates may come under pressure.\n* the wave of liquidity expected to be released could prove inflationary if credit demand is strong\n\n# CURRENT ASSEST PURCHASING REDUCTIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH\n\nThe Fed would need to increase asset purchasing reductions to **$15 Billion per month** and stopping after 8months to stop a default in 2022 with the current debt ceiling raising rules.\n\n# CONCLUSION:\n\n**There is not enough time between now and the 15th to stop a default at the current stage of debate in the Senate.

I got $37K premium for that, which seems pretty good right?\n\nI'm hoping it goes up (of course not passed $1350). Then I plan to repeat this, though next time I'll probably select a target high enough as to be less likely to get called, as I would like to hold my shares indefinitely.  Also, I used that 37K to buy 35 more shares of TSLA... if the strategy works out, in 6-8 months maybe I'll have enough for 8 calls.\n\nI realize that TSLA could pop at any time and I'll miss out on a lot of upside, but honestly I'd be cool with selling @ $1350 a share. And if it goes down (like it did lately) by Feb 18, I'll just adjust and sell more covered calls.\n\nPlease tell me if my strategy is foolish/flawed.   I am fairly newb to this.
