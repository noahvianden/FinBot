{"title": "Advice on my Apple Leap? Keep or sell?", "selftext": "I bought my first ever LEAP a couple months ago and well..it's doing pretty good.\n\nAAPL $115 19 JAN 24 that cost me $4,120 and it is currently (share price $177) worth $7,042.50 for a nice profit of $2,922.50 or 70%\n\nWhen i bought the call, apple was at $143 per share (WOW)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pzlalztebr481.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=14ae53f7ef1f99768ff198b41c898d54993abd19\n\nWhat would you guys do? Sell or let it run?\n\nIs there any benefit into selling this call and buying a different leap? I looked at the following:\n\n$140 16 SEP 22 - COST = 4,320, DELTA = 0.85, IV = 29%\n\n$140 16 SEP 23 - COST = $5,075, DELTA = 0.76, IV = 33%\n\n$140 19 JAN 24 - COST = $5,300, DELTA = 0.75, IV = 34%\n\nmy overall portfolio & yearly salary are less than 6 figures..i'm in my mid 20's...if this call went to $0 i wouldn't be needing to call anyone for money but i would definitely be banging my head on a table for a bit..i guess to let you know budget wise where i am at. I am sure 3k profit is life changing money for some and a drop in the bucket for others\n\nany advice is appreciated, thanks. (i think the picture below is current greeks?)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6k8vbttebr481.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb1760819b2282a7c3612aebd47bd886b1a52b88\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone that commented! I did not expect so much advice. I closed the option this morning for a profit of $3,000.\n\nGoing forward, I would of loved to implement the poor mans covered call on this one, but webull does not have it. For some reason, fidelity hasn’t approved me for call options. I can only do cover calls with owning 100 shares of a stock. (Am looking into doing this with Apple if the share price drops)\n\nMy next question is what brokerage would approve me for pmcc? I have a lot to learn going forward and of course I know that not every LEAP will have returns like this. I’m confident that Apple will continue to grow but I did not want to get greedy. \n\nAgain thanks to everyone on this subreddit for welcoming me.", "id": "rdevoc", "created_utc": 1639160317.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "I hold more than 6 figures in pure Apple stock, plus whatever exposure from various mutual funds and ETFs.  I'm also a lot older than you are I'd wager.\n\nSo with those facts as perspective on my advice - \n\nBuy the stock.  \n\nThe competitive computer landscape doesn't appear set for any major disruption to my eyes.  There are software operators (MSFT) and hardware operators (Dell, though they went private), and there isn't a company out there with the ethos of unifying hardware and software through design like Apple.  \n\nApple has been a long time coming, and perhaps the closest business in terms of \"build don't buy\" is Tesla.  You really need to understand that Apple computers are designed in the same way that the *machines that build the computers* are designed by Apple.  For every iPhone you see, they've built or bought up and refined the tooling that produces that device.  \n\nIt goes really, really deep.  Much deeper than any of their competitors.  The question remains then, will consumers prioritize the fact that there is a bit of a luxury tag on any Apple product?\n\nFor nearly 15 years the answer has been yes - again and again and again.\n\nSo ask yourself, \"what will make people change their behavior?\" because the evidence of recent history proves that we want slick tech.  *Globally*\n\nApple also has an enormous pile of cash.  They aren't so quick to act in some cases, you could argue they would have done well to buy Netflix years ago as it fits their \"intersection of technology and the arts\" mentality, but when they do make decisions, they get things very right more often than not.\n\nThe new M1 architecture does a couple things - to the public, it cements this idea that Apple is a technology leader, but to their balance sheet, it represents a huge bump in profitability.\n\nJudging purely by the jump in gross margin according to their most recent 10K, they're optimizing their COGS to massive benefit.\n\nhttps://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000320193/42ede86f-6518-450f-bc88-60211bf39c6d.pdf\n\n2019 Gross Margin Product 32.2%\n\n2020 31.5%\n\n2021 35.3%\n\nTheir effective tax rate dropped, their cost of sales stayed flat (despite COVID and store closing - they still have the pay the lease -14.6 B USD annually!), their R&D stayed constant *as a percentage* of their revenue (more rev, more R&D budget, more and better products and services faster), basically, everything that should go up has gone up, and everything that should go down has gone down.\n\nThey report 34.9 B USD in *cash* on hand (and we know that they have more abroad).\n\nIf the US Housing Market had been managed the way that Apple has been managed, it could not have crashed.\n\nSo when you hear posters here saying \"they said it couldn't happen to X and look what happened\" tell yourself that's total bullshit.  When companies \"suddenly crash\" there were smoke signals - OR they're just straight up lying to the SEC, which is a felony, and has landed more than one CFO in actual prison.  There were people who saw the housing market collapse coming (not me) because they looked at the data.\n\nWhen I read the 10K, I don't see any skeletons in the closet.  The only thing that could knock Apple down would be consumer habits changing, and I really don't see us giving up tech... ever.", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "thanks for the well written response my friend. i will definitely be throwing money at apple for a while, regardless of what i do with this option\n\nsounds like you are set for a while with your holdings!!", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "You have the option to buy the stock at $142 so if you plan on buying Apple hold it and exercise the option.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Wow well said !!!!", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Very well said", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Mostly agree but apple contracts the “build”, that’s the primary difference between them and Tesla who is truly trying to vertically integrate everything they can.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/11/13/bloomberg-details-apples-sophisticated-manufacturing-robots-and-equipment/\n\nThe humans involved in the manufacturing isn’t the point of my comment - it’s the machinery that matters as a competitive differentiator.

It's a secure storage for credentials. You can't store stuff like database passwords in version control systems or in company's wiki, it will be leaked eventually or accessed by people who are not supposed to know it. Vault provides a way to store such sensitive data and configure fine-grained access for people/services to read that data.\n\nTerraform - that's a tool for infrastructure-as-a-code approach. In the past people were creating resources (e.g. AWS instances or databases) manually via the interface of the provider. That leads to errors, it's difficult to track changes or to pass the knowledge about them to newcomers. Terraform allows to write infrastructure in a file, store in VCS and transform into those UI actions automatically.\n\nVagrant - it was a good alternative to VirtualBox for creating virtual environments when you needed to test software in a different OS or to do some dangerous manipulations which could destroy the real system. I haven't used it for a while, now the industry standard is to use Docker which allows to create smaller containers instead of full-blown virtual machines.\n\nConsul - service mesh solution, it's an alternative to more popular Istio and Linkerd. Service meshes are used in microservice environments, i.e. in pretty much every single modern project.\n\nBoundary - I'm less familiar with it, it's something related to cyber security. Iiuc, let's say you have a database on a certain host in your company's network. Without boundary everyone could technically try to connect to it - even sales or accountants. Boundary gives ability to configure access to that host only to developers (but I'm not sure, and maybe that's even not the main use case).\n\nSo overall, they do products for automating infrastructure and for making it secure.

Why wouldn’t it want the public to know the true rate of inflation in this country for what we buy on a daily basis (and can’t avoid buying like food, natural gas, and petroleum)? \n\nThe answer.  If the true inflation number is known, then the Federal Reserve would have no choice, it would have to: (1) immediately taper down the $120 Billion monthly T-Bond and MBS purchases to zero within 1-3 months, and (2) raise the Fed Funds rate from 0-.25 to like 3-5% or more. \n\nSo what’s the problem with a much faster taper, and a much higher Fed funds rate? Well, we have a $28 trillion dollar debt, and the debt service on that debt (interest) at higher prevailing rates, would cause a substantial fraction of the treasury’s tax revenue to be assigned to debt service.  This would leave much less for all the billion dollar governments programs and defense expenditures.  In effect, big government knows that “big government spending” can only continue with ultra low rates.  This process is referred to as “monetizing the debt.” \n\nAnother effect of higher rates would be a negative impact on the stock market, and other hard assets like homes.  After all, if 2 year investment grade bonds paid 4% , money would flow out of the stock market and hard assets to bonds. \n\nTherefore, in summary, we are trapped into low rates — the bogus low CPI numbers are rolled out to support those low rates.  However, the problem is that people know that the true rate of inflation is so much higher than the bogus CPI numbers.  For example, hyperinflation is happening with housing prices, rents, gas, and many raw materials (and many foo items like beef and fish).

But I see so many posts on Reddit of people losing money--significant fractions of their net worth--and blaming everyone but themselves; I feel there are some young folks here who need to hear this.\n\nThe S&P500 is up about 25% YTD--that's extremely rare. It's up 115% since the March 2020 low. Look yourself in a mirror, and ask yourself if you're doing better than the market.\n\nThis is not addressed to Bogleheads--you guys are doing fine. It's not addressed to traders who've been around since the dot com era. This is not addressed to retirees who've been through all this many times before. This is addressed to the novice investors of Reddit who entered the market after Covid and whose performance is negative, during an amazing bull run.\n\nFinance is one of the most cut-throat fields in existence. You are competing with people who are vastly more experienced, wealthier, and more influential than you. Some of the smartest people in the world. It's certainly possible for someone with a small portfolio to outperform--but it's not a game. You need to take it seriously. It requires work, study, temperament. Just because you're young doesn't mean you can afford to set your finances back years.\n\nDo you know how to determine the fair value of a company? Do you know how risk-free yields influence that calculation? Do you actually do that calculation before deploying your capital?\n\nDo you try to predict the short-term direction of the market?

No one forced you to buy stock in a company that had negative earnings; it's up to you to consider a margin of safety. Some people have genuinely been dealt a rotten hand---but you can't blame others for wealth inequality if it was **your own bad decisions** that caused you to lose money. Learn from it.\n\nThe market won't always be like this. Since Covid the overall market has been on 'easy' mode. I don't pretend to be an expert investor, but I've been in the market since about 2005 and it's almost never this easy.

The more diverse this basket of companies is the better while you are starting out. As you research put them into one of three buckets \"investable\", \"maybe\", \"outside my understanding.\" once you put a stock into your third bucket go find a new stock to start researching. put the maybe's in a notebook or spreadsheet to keep an eye on for the future, and the investable stocks put on your watchlist. \n\nWith the stocks on your watchlist you'll figure out the intrinsic value for that company based on what seems to be the industry multiple and how you think their profits will increase in the future. You'll hear 10x earnings or 30x earnings, that is the multiple and it describes how many years it would take to theoretically buy back every share at current price. then figure out a margin of safety in case you are wrong in your calculations. that is the point you'll aim to buy the stock at and if you see it low enough you'll buy it. \n\nFrom here you'll just have to find a strategy that works for you and learn more about stocks, options, etc.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Makes sense, but this does not apply to blue chips right?

It's such a small position compared to my TSLA holdings that I am willing to be risky with it.  At some point about a year ago Doge started to take off, and I realized Elon was memeing about Doge.  So I looked into Doge and I liked that it was: a) popular/well known, and b) inflationary.  I decided what the hell, I'll convert my BTC into Doge and see what happens.  You never fucking know.\n\nMy thesis is two part: \n\ni) crypto hinges on popularity/community opinion of the coin.  That is, anyone could at any point fork BTC and have a technologically identical cryptocurrency to BTC, but it would fail because noone uses it.  Not only that, but all the various crypto currencies are far more similar than they are different.  Put another way, BTC's (or any other coin's) only real moat is the support it has from its users and holders.  Dogecoin has a long standing community of supporters and holders (including our boy Elon), and it's an actively used crypto (i.e. people actually use it to pay for stuff or send eachother money).\n\nii) the vast majority of crypto tokens are deflationary like BTC.  I believe there is a need and a use case for an inflationary currency.  Just like BTC has a known max number of coins and a predetermined decay rate on block rewards, Doge has a known and predetermined creation rate of new coins.  What's the problem with a deflationary currency like BTC?  Well, who is ever going to trade their BTC for say business supplies to start their new car company if they know that BTC is going to double in value in x years?  It would most likely be more lucrative to just hold that BTC instead and do nothing.  A currency works well when it's value is somewhat constant or even slowly decreasing in value.  That way you are either incentivized to trade it for things you need/find valuable, or at worst at least you won't lose out by exchanging it for something else.  So if BTC replaces gold, I can see Doge replacing dollars.\n\nThat's about it...

{"title": "Outrages predictions 2022 US inflation reaches above 15% on wage-price spiral", "selftext": "\r\n**Summary: By the fourth quarter of 2022, US CPI \r\ninflation reaches an annualized 15% as companies bid \r\nup wages in an effort to find willing and qualified \r\nworkers, triggering a wage-price spiral unlike anything \r\nseen since the 1970’s.**\n\r\nAt the end of the 1960s, the US Federal Reserve and \r\nthe Fed chair then, McChesney Martin, misjudged \r\nhow hot they could run the US labour market without \r\nfanning inflation. The miscue paved the way for inflation \r\nexpectations getting out of control and a massive \r\nwage-price spiral the following decade. The official US \r\nCPI reached a peak at 11.8% in February 1975. It wasn’t \r\nuntil the recession of 1980-82 and brutal policy rate \r\nincreases to levels as high as 20% that inflation was \r\nfinally killed.\n\n\r\nIn 2022, the Federal Reserve and Fed chair Jerome Powell \r\nrepeats the same mistake all over again as the post-Covid \r\noutbreak economy and especially the labour market \r\nare severely supply constrained, making a mockery of \r\nthe Fed’s traditional models. \n\nPowell believes millions of \r\nAmericans will return to work and fill some of the 10.4 \r\nmillion open job positions as Covid-19 fades. But this is \r\nplain wrong. Some have retired early due to the crisis \r\nand thus have permanently left the US workforce. The \r\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis estimates the exodus of \r\nolder workers to be about 3 million people. Others aren’t \r\nreturning to poorly paid jobs after seeing huge handouts \r\nduring the pandemic and seem to be waiting for better \r\njobs and pay.\n\n\r\nThe big difference between today and yesterday is that \r\nthe pandemic has fuelled a great awakening of workers. \r\nAcross sectors and income classes they realise they are \r\nnow more empowered than ever. They demand a better \r\nexperience: better job conditions, higher wages, more \r\nflexibility and a sense of purpose from work.\n\n Coupled \r\nwith persistent inflationary pressures coming from the \r\nproduction side, the energy crisis and labour shortage, \r\nthis results in unprecedented broad-based double-digit \r\nannualised wage increases by Q4. As a consequence, US \r\ninflation reaches an annualised pace above 15% before \r\nthe start of 2023, for the first time since WWII. This \r\nprompts the Federal Reserve into a too-little, too-late \r\nmove to tighten monetary policy faster in a desperate \r\neffort to tame inflation. But the central bank has lost \r\ncredibility; it will take time to regain it.\r\n\n**Market impact: extreme volatility in US equity and credit \r\nmarkets. The JNK high-yield ETF falls as much as 20% and \r\nthe VIXM mid-curve volatility ETF soars as much as 70%.**", "id": "rdlng7", "created_utc": 1639178665.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 106, "comments": [{"body": "Powell bro, no one wants to go back to work for minimum wage when they can just buy dog coins and NFT’s w stimmy cheques instead", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "I make 3x more than my salary on QQQ calls for January every year.

I can only have these things when they’re owned by someone else and I’m authorized to use them. The cost is therefore spread out, as generally I must buy goods or services to use those facilities if I’m anywhere but visiting family. I do like washing my hands after I relieve myself, and during food preparation. I have to acquiesce to the social contract at least that far. If I don’t, my wretched life could end up costing taxpayers more if I end up in the hospital. In the last four years, the only doctors I’ve seen have been due to emergency situations.

It’s cheaper to employ machines than people, even if those people are children in China.\n\nOf course we work everyday. Just not all of us at the same time.
