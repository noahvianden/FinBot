NVDA is not a consistent company over the course of a decade, so its hard to gauge PE.  Wolfram shows a low end PE, pre pandemic, to be around 24.  This inline with other companies that compound between 10-20+% every year. \n\nHowever, NVDA has hit major growth in the last few years, so its PE has sky rocketed to look more like AMZN numbers.  Since the start of 2020, NVDA has skyrocketed, with a low end PE of 60. This makes it very difficult to gauge a low end \"VALUE\" price for a \"GROWTH\" company.\n\nNormally I'd wait for a PE of 24, but that's for stable boring growth companies (googl, chd, fb, msft, etc).  A PE of 24 would be 77, no way its going that low again.   A PE of 60 would be close to 200.  This seems reasonable, but you would need a major market event to bring it down to that level.  That seems unreasonable in the next few months.\n\nAnother way may be to extrapolate.  With an EPS 3.24, and assuming a growth of 37% (rough guess for a years wroth of growth), x a PE of 60 is around 266 dollars.  This is close to your 250 mark.\n\nI'd guess that if you can get NVDA between 200 and 250, that would be a good deal, assuming NVDA stays consistent.

I've doubled my money in under year and I follow this same strategy consistently.\n\nBuying NVDA at 200 and below, I would expect the same or similar levels of growth, but not at 250+.

Warren Buffet:\n\n\nMost analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: \"value\" and \"growth.\"... In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value.[73]\n\n\n—Warren Buffett\n\n\n\"Does that just mean companies with high P/E have had a higher total return than low P/E?\"\n\n\nAbsolutely not.  Compare CHD and CLX.  Same space.  CLX has a PE of 50.  CHD has a PE of 29.  Yet, which stock has a better rate of return? CHD by far!  However, CLX has much higher dividend.  For people with TONS of money who rely on dividend income, CLX is better arguably.  If you want just solid stock growth, CHD is far better.\n\n\n\"Also is that return driven by expanding valuation multiples? Or are the actual underlying businesses of “growth” companies performing better than “value”.\"\n\n\nRoughly, Returns are driven by 3 things, expanding multiples,  underlying growth in top/bottom line and the company's consistency or ability to meet promises made.  If Amazon doubles its revenue and bottom line over the course of the year, and its PE ratio stays the same, the value of the stock will go up.  However, people know AMZN is a consistent besat, so they are willing to pay MORE for the PROMISE of growth, so the PE ratio goes up as people want to buy it more.  This drives up the stock price and your return.\n\n\nI think its better to look at PE like steak at the market.  Some brands and cuts are worth more than others, so naturally they will cost more.  However, the price of steak oscillates with demand/season/etc.   When the price goes down, it becomes a value and that is when you buy.\n\n\nFor stocks, I like to use CHD as an example.  They are very consistent over their lifetime, growing top and bottom line by10+%.  The stock has doubled almost every 3 or 4 years since the beginning.  I would consider that a growth stock.  Their PE ratio oscillates between low 20s and upper 30s.  I buy in the low 20s because I know:\n\n\n1.  A growth from bottom PE of 22, growing to a PE of 32 is a 45% gain alone!\n2.  The company will grow its EPS, COMPOUNDING every year between 10-20%.  \n3.  Combining buying at Low PE + Company growth = SOLID returns for many many many years.   I bought it at 78 when the PE was in the low 20s earlier this year, waited patiently, and it just broke a 52 week high.\n4.  If the market crashes, I have historical data, and solid company fundamentals that will protect me, knowing that the valuation will likely not drop below a PE of 22~, and if so, not for very long.\n\n\nDon't fall into the mindset that you have to choose value or growth.  Its a loosing mindset and strategy.  Do what buffet says, and combine the ideas.

{"title": "JPMorgan agrees to $125 million fine for letting employees use WhatsApp to evade regulators reach", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/17/jpmorgan-agrees-to-125-million-fine-for-letting-employees-use-whatsapp-to-evade-regulators.html\n\nJPMorgan Chase is paying a $125 million fine to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that its Wall Street division allowed employees to use WhatsApp and other platforms to circumvent federal record-keeping laws. The SEC said Friday in a statement that JPMorgan Securities admitted to “widespread” record-keeping failures in recent years. The bank’s employees used personal smartphones and email accounts, as well as messaging services including Meta-owned WhatsApp, to conduct securities business matters from at least January 2018 through November 2020, the regulator said. SEC officials who spoke to reporters Thursday evening said JPMorgan’s failure to preserve those off-line conversations violated federal securities law and left the regulator blind to exchanges between the bank and its clients.\n\nFederal law requires financial firms keep and retain meticulous records of electronic messages between brokers and clients so that regulators can make sure those firms aren’t skirting anti-fraud or antitrust laws. Regulators in New York and London have ratcheted up enforcement of record-keeping rules in recent years as traders migrated to encrypted messaging platforms including WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram. While phone conversations and messages on official company devices and software platforms are preserved, it’s much harder for bank compliance departments to surveil communications on third-party apps. The method picked up in popularity after two of the industry’s biggest trading scandals of the past decade (involving manipulation of Libor and foreign exchange markets) hinged on incriminating messages preserved in chatrooms, resulting in multi-billion dollar fines for banks.\n\nTraders at JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and other firms have been dismissed or placed on leave for infractions tied to the practice. But the SEC order reveals how pervasive it was. At JPMorgan, the practice of going offline to communicate was firm-wide, and even the managers and senior personnel responsible for compliance used their personal devices to communicate sensitive business matters, the SEC said. The investigation at JPMorgan is ongoing and the SEC has launched similar probes at firms across the financial universe. JPMorgan ordered its traders, bankers and financial advisors to preserve work-related messages on personal devices earlier this year, Bloomberg reported in June.\n\nOfficials declined to offer details on the current status of the JPMorgan examination or those at other banks. “As technology changes, it’s even more important that registrants ensure that their communications are appropriately recorded and are not conducted outside of official channels in order to avoid market oversight,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a press release. In stressing the importance of diligent recordkeeping, Gensler recalled the foreign exchange scandal of 2013, when traders at several of the globe’s largest banks used a private chat room to conspire to fix currency rates to maximize profits. Five of the globe’s largest banks, including JPMorgan, ultimately agreed to pay more than $5 billion in combined penalties and plead guilty to resolve the investigation. “Books-and-records obligations help the SEC conduct its important examinations and enforcement work,” Gensler added. “They build trust in our system.” While SEC officials said the $125 million penalty is its largest recordkeeping fine to date, the bigger threat to JPMorgan may be reputational.

Tesla has had a PE of like 1000 and it still would’ve been one of the best investments possible over the past 5 years (I’m still not touching it with a 10’ pole, but those buying in the face of the “it’s overvalued” crowd have so far been laughing on their way to the bank) Start around 40 minutes on this podcast to get the point I’m trying to convey: https://youtu.be/IxkHQty5PtE", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Nice, thanks so much man this is awesome.

{"title": "Why inflation is way worse than consensus", "selftext": "I'm going to be up front, I have loaded a bunch of spy n aapl puts.\n\nSo Jack Dorsey famously tweeted about hyperinflation, which got him mainstream coverage and soon after the stepped down from Twitter. Now he is also the CEO of Block formerly known as Square $SQ so he has insights into millions of merchants and cash app data. He sort of knows what people are buying and whatnot.\n\nNow let's start with what is consensus. CPI is reading 6.8%. Food is up 25-50% for meats. Crude oil and other energies are up. Home prices are up. Stocks are up. SnP500 is up 27% this year. Historical, it usually gives 10% a year. So roughly speaking, 17% above historical averages.\n\nOk so those are the consensus facts. So what's hiding the hyperinflation? One, covid. Omicron is the latest variant and there will be more variants to slow down the economy if it ever gets hot whenever we reopen. It's really easy to see inflation once you go to eat and sees everyone waiting to get seated and the restaurant is understaffed. They are going to raise prices and only stopping them is covid.\n\nFunny internet money and new ipos and spacs also hide inflation. If those didn't exist, the money would have went to other things and made prices higher. \n\nWe talked about the current hyperinflation, what about the future? Well, the Federal Reserve is going to hike to .75%- 1% by end of next year. I don't think that's enough to slow down the economy. Terminal rate is 2.7% which doesn't stop an inflation of 6.7%. Now the Fed is hoping it's transistory, and they might be right. But the only way inflation comes down is when asset prices come down.\n\nNow let me explain my trade. Why did I buy long term puts on the market and AAPL? Only way we stop inflation is with asset prices coming down. Why not make money on the way down of something inevitable? If we already have hyperinflation, then they have to crash the market to stop it. Therefore you should be hoping for a crash to save the US economy. \n\nIf I'm wrong and the fed keeps letting inflation run another year, I think it's totally worth seeing the collapse of the financial system when they finally hike rates to 10% to stop inflation. So either I'm right and I make money, or I'm wrong and the economy goes into even stronger hyperinflation and crash. I will probably dca into deep OTM puts because the crash will be bigger and bigger until it all collapses. $1 of OTM puts would be worth $1000 or more at that point.", "id": "ri7vwh", "created_utc": 1639711712.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 157, "comments": [{"body": "I remember my first time putting on clown shoes and pretending to know more than the circus master.", "score": 207, "replies": [{"body": "Many of you thought it would never happen but I insisted we spend two hours every morning training for it.

But since those initial increases a year ago, prices have stabilized, and there have not been any more notable price increases for us since then.

{"title": "Blue chips wont be fun next year", "selftext": "Why I believe that sector rotation is inevitable starting now\n \n2020 and 2021 have been extraordinary years. They also have been extraordinary for the stock market. After an initial dip in the stock market when COVID broke out everything and anything rallied. Initial dip only lasted 2 months and then sector by sector flew into all time highs and rallied now for a year and a half. There were massive gains to be made in tech, pharmaceuticals, speculative plays, even the old boring financials and even the housing market… I won’t even mention the short squeezes! I myself had some fun with those.\nNo matter how high the prices looked for the stocks- they just kept getting higher. Critical opinions from analysts and news reporters started disappearing. It just doesn’t look very good if you keep saying that things are overpriced when those prices keep going up, does it? I remember Elon Musk saying that  Tesla prices were too high at $750 pre split- then it reached $1200 post split and now Tesla is trading at 300 PE ratio! And somehow nobody says that it’s that high anymore… Folks, don’t get me wrong, I love Tesla- it’s a great company; and would Elon Musk purpose to me tomorrow I’d say “yes!” without a blink of an eye, but 300 x price per earnings? I suppose Tesla will have to electrify Mars too.\n \nI should not single one stock out. Most stocks have gotten into euphoria zone mid pandemic, mid and small caps including. But what no one seems to have noticed is that while blue chips continued to rally- most mid caps (after reaching highs a year ago) have already consolidated. Yes! That’s exactly what I’m saying -market has already corrected leaving only the shiny blue chips at sky high prices. I really don’t want to be this person spewing gloom and doom everywhere, but I do not see a good year coming for Amazon, Tesla, Google, Ford, Zoom, Nvidia, Home Depot, etc. They are exceptional companies, that are currently priced even more exceptionally (if you know what I mean). We won’t be buying computers to start working from home anymore; we have bought extraordinary amount of cars to avoid public transport so there will be little demand for automobiles in the next 5 years, we have already settled with our new subscriptions, housing market is finally slowing and we are not redesigning our home anymore to accommodate a work from home office. There has been an incredible growth in the past few years but now earnings reports will start coming in showing stagnation or downtrend in demand and euphoria will pop very quickly. Our big growth companies will not be growing that fast anymore and can you really justify 50, 100, 300 PE for something that is not extremely high growth? For something that is possibly very strongly affected by inflation?\n \n \nSo following this thought process what do I think will happen in the stock market? I’ll pretend I’m an oracle here for a second…\nHedge funds need to justify their fees and make some money, most of them do not or are not allowed to go short so they will be looking for opportunities. Possibly stocks that are heavily underpriced with sound fundamentals and that are not that affected by fluctuations in demand. I vouch for the whole pharmaceutical sector to have an amazing year! Data collection agencies, infrastructure, utilities, gold miners should do well. Quite frankly all those beat down forgotten stocks that we were ignoring for the past year should come to life. I believe that after nearly two year stock market euphoria we will come back to fundamentals and conviction plays. Easy money won’t be a thing of the day anymore and things won’t rally “just because”….. here I am with gloom and doom again, but I do think that we need to prepare for more of a whack-a-mole setup in the market for the next few years and stay away from anything that doesn’t appear to be a good deal. I also believe that S&P and Nasdaq will pull back and will make negative gains next year or maybe even a few after, but that doesn’t mean that there won’t be gains made in niches or catalyst plays.\n \n Check out a 20 year Nasdaq yearly chart to see for yourself how desperately it needs to consolidate and it does do consolidate! \n\nAs for myself, I’ll be scouting out the stocks that have strong fundamentals, high growth possibilities (without hitting my wallet with high PE) and positive catalysts in the near future.
