The only problem, I haven't found how to trade something that looks like a spot VIX (If you have a useful link, please leave it in the comments).  \n2) There are a huge number of derivatives on it - futures, options, funds assembled from futures of different maturities (leveraged and regular), options on those funds.

Or delta(some\\_VIX\\_futures) = f(delta\\_VIX, time, ...). Or some similar way. No, not to get strict some coefficients, but, for example, the probability with which some coefficient would be such in this function. I think that kind of information would be pretty darn useful.  \n2) With this information, evaluate the funds that trade these futures by expressing them through VIX value and time. Also, do a cross-valuation of options on volatility etf, looking at the underlying asset not the fund itself, but the VIX.

At 30 DTE, about 2 weeks after opening, the spread is worth $.18 (that's 50% of $.36). You would buy to close at that point, pocket the $.18 profit, and look for a new trade to put your money in.\n\nAlternatively, say at 38 DTE, just 1 week after open, the spread has gone against you and is now worth $.72 (that's 2x your initial credit, which means you'd have a loss of $.36 to close, which is your 100% of credit loss limit), you would buy to close for a loss to limit your risk.\n\nFinally, if neither of the above happen and it bounces between a $.10 profit and a $.05 loss until 10 DTE, let's say it's a $.07 profit, you would close the spread because you are getting too close to expiration.\n\n**ABOVE ALL ELSE** do not hold spreads anywhere close to expiration, to avoid the worst case losses and expiration risks.\n\nOur \"When To Exit\" guide is here, for more information: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/whentoexit", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much, very helpful.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Platforms are not synchronized, and may pay attention to different exchanges; there are a dozen.  \n\nPrices and bids and offers change by the millisecond. \n\nFURTHER, the BID and the ASK are what you care about, not the \"mark\" (the mid-bid-ask), as the market is not located at the mark.  \n\nIf you are willing to take the risk on stock, or already own it, covered calls are an easy start.  \nBe willing to have the stock called away. \n\nThe \"COLLAR\" is probably the least risky option trade.  \n\nFind it in the Options  Playbook.   \nhttp://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I've been trying to clarify a point about poor man's covered calls, and I can't find it anywhere.\n\nAllegedly, you buy a long term call, in the money, right?\n\nAnd then somehow you sell calls OTM against the long term call?

ATM is “at the money“ which means right at or really close to the market price of the stock.\n\nThat being said, you need to stock to move below your strike price for your put to have intrinsic value.  An ITM (”in the money”) contract has intrinsic value because, in the case of a put, you have the right to sell at a higher than market price.  However your OTM put has no intrinsic value but yet you still paid for it.  That’s called extrinsic value and it represents time and volatility.  Extrinsic value is the way the market prices the odds of your contract going ITM.  The more time in your contract, the better the odds.  The more volatile the stock, the better the odds.\n\nI say all of this because you paid extrinsic value for the put.  So to profit you must make more than what you paid (you need to sell high).  This is why your best chance to make money on your contract is if it goes ITM since you will get intrinsic value.  Extrinsic value can decay as time goes on because at expiration, all that is left is intrinsic value.  The time value always decays, volatility can go up or down over the life of the contract.  So you generally want a big move to happen as quickly as possible to make money.

That means a stop can prevent profit as much as loss.\n\nSo are you day trading?\n\n> I have two options; based on LAST or based on ASK.\n\nBoth have problems. I take it you are selling to open? That would mean a stop would be a buy to close, and thus the ask is relevant. For long positions, you'd stop on the bid rather than the ask, since you are selling to close.\n\nThe pro for using the ask is that it can get you out earlier if you are in a rapid trend running against you. The con is that the ask can rise significantly higher than the last trade, so you end up losing more than you had to under ideal conditions. The last is the inverse of those pros/cons.\n\nBut more importantly, the stop level is not very important, you can get that wrong by several dollars and not be hurt by it.

When you bought the call, your \"sell back\" value was $8. It's still $8, so technically you haven't really lost anything, so stopping out on the ask cost you a position that was essentially unchanged.\n\n> In my paper trading, I had a 50% \"win\" rate, with more avg profit than loss (net 17% return).\n\nFWIW, that's a low win rate, even for debit only trading. You are basically playing long ball, swinging for homers but not getting them very often. Small ball (money ball) trading would be swinging for base hits and getting them more frequently. In other words, instead of netting $1000 in 10 trades where 5 were profitable (average $100/trade), you net $1200 in 100 trades where 75 were profitable (average $12/trade).\n\n\n> I set the trailing stop loss at $8.20 (+20% from initial position) and it's currently at $47.50 (+16%) with a stop trigger at $39.30 (-4.1%)\n\nYou have both a stop trigger and a trailing stop?

I'm not saying this is the best way or even the right way, but it's what works for me.\n\nOpen long calls at around 30 DTE and close to ATM, no more than two strikes above or below ATM. Exit at 10% gain, 20% loss, or 7 DTE, whichever comes first. At open, I set a GTC limit order to BTC at my 10% profit exit level. For the loss side, I just monitor the position daily and set an alert for if the value of the call crosses the 15% loss level. The alert sends me a text, so I can check the position and decide whether to bail or set a limit order to close (not a stop).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> sell to close ought to be based on the bid, not the ask.\n\nGood point, thank you!\n> FWIW, that's a low win rate\n\nUnderstood and (currently) I'm OK with that as long as I net out positive. As mentioned, I'm looking for this to be as passive/minimal effort as possible, so any net profit over 7% is a win for me (I could just buy and hold VTI for this annual rate). Also, that past year of 50% win rate is based off of prior selection and sell logic. Based on what I learned there, I've refined down to the 20% trailing loss and more successful selection criteria (70% win rate on the refined selection/buy/sell rules). FWIW, if/when I've built up more capital to allocate to options, I plan to incorporate more of your money ball approach with the more reliable base hits.\n> You have both a stop trigger and a trailing stop?\n\nClarification: No, I just have a trailing stop. My apologies on the sloppy terminology use originally.\n> So a 20% trailing stop on a 50% win rate implies an average profit target of at least 20%? Is that what you are actually aiming for?\n\nIf I can nab a 20% return, I will die a happy man. That being said, I want the optionality to \"let my winners run.\" Hence the trailing stop logic. Worst case, I lose 20% on my initial position. Best case, infinite. With my last year of paper trades, my average profitable position was +71% with my best netting +300%. *NOTE: The sell rules for last year were if +50%, implement 20% trail stop. Else sell at -50%. This means that I had a number of positions that were profitable, but never achieve +50% and crashed back down to sell at a loss (dragging me down to my 50% \"win\" rate). When I was doing this, I had the inverse of your proposed set up; I had a GTC limit to STC at -50% with an alert at +50%. If the alert triggered, I would replace the STC with a 20% trailing stop loss.\n> you are spending a lot of time on the downside exit strategy, but I don't see anything about the upside exit strategy. What are your profit targets? What's your max holding time?\n\nYou are correct.

You write a call for January's monthly expiration for the $100 strike and you collect $1.20 in credit (30 days to expiration, DTE). \n\nThe goal of writing calls is **sell high, buy back lower**, so you want the value of the call to go down and that usually happens when the stock stays the same or goes down.\n\nSo lets say XYZ shares drift down a little every day to where they end up at $77 at 15 DTE. Now your call is only worth $.70. You can buy to close the call and collect $.50 of profit (because sold for $1.20, buy back for $.70, net $.50 profit). At the same time you close the old call, you open a new call for February at the same strike or maybe $90 and get $1.05 credit.  That's a roll, close the old call and open the new call in the same order.\n\nRinse and repeat month after month. As long as XYZ stays below your strike, you can keep rolling out to the next month and saving part of the credit you collected as profit.\n\nHowever, things don't always work out this perfectly. Say XYZ drifts upwards instead of downwards. So by 15 DTE the call is now worth $1.50 instead of a $1.20. If you were to roll at that point, **you would lose $.30** (because you sold for $1.20 and had to buy back at $1.50, so that -$.30). You can still do the roll, *as long as the new call pays at least $.30 in credit*. Always roll for a credit, never for a loss. Say the February $102 call is paying $.35. That would be okay, since after rolling you'd still have a $.05 net credit on the trade. It's a lot smaller than the $.50 profit you took in the previous case, but better than a dead loss.\n\nSo that's why it's not free money. If the stock trends up, each roll loses money and you have to find a new call that covers the loss. \n\nAlternatively, and actually the better plan, is if the stock trends up, **don't roll at all**. Just hold to expiration and let your shares be called away. So from the above example, if at expiration XYZ is $102, your original $100 call is ITM and your shares are called away. You make a $20/share profit on the shares ($100 strike - $80 cost = $20 profit), **plus** the $1.20 credit you originally got you get to keep entirely, so net profit is $21.20/share. Now, that is *less than the $22/share profit* you would have had if you never had written a call and instead had just held shares until they reached $102 in value, which is another reason why CCs are not free money.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The thing you’re missing is that you have to buy back the contract.

I've read reddit and watched youtube extensively, and am reading Option Volatility and Pricing by Natenberg at the moment. That said, I still have a long way to go and the greeks are not yet intuitive. I hope to work through some blindspots with this post. \n\n**Preamble:**\n\nI've had to liquidate a couple lots of PLTR to free up funds for this trade. Although PLTR was my most reliable underlying to sell CC's on, I am looking to start trading in a margin account, and moving into more reliable/established/profitable companies. \n\nBTW - I am based in Canada, so we do not have short- and long-term capital gains\n\n**AMD PMCC Options:**     ...*Ba-dum-tsssh*\n\nI've got ~$5000 which I will be transferring into a new margin account with IBKR. I am looking to buy a long call >0.70 delta (preferably >0.80 delta), and >365 DTE. I've made a table summarizing my options: https://imgur.com/vZ0JbSR\n\nBased on the available capital that I have, any of the 105/115/125 strike LEAPS with Jan 20'23 expiry (392 DTE) meet the criteria. The Apr 21'23 115C (76.6 delta, 483 DTE) is also an option. \n\nHere are some options for the CC's: https://imgur.com/Ubh0Rvi\n\n**Buying the LEAPS:**\n\nThis is my main concern; I don't know when to buy the LEAPS. AMD has been relatively volatile the last couple months, going from $94 in July to $165 at the end of November. Todays close was at $145.92 and IV was at 47.2% and VIX is 17.96. There are a number of catalysts coming up, primarily the merger with Xilinx, but also a surge in Omicron over the holidays and the ensuing FUD. \n\nWhat's my best strategy here? \n\n- I saw a recommendation to buy when RSI is <30 on a 4hr chart\n- Buy when IV is low (this is relative, how do I define? IV Rank?)\n- Any other methodologies? I don't really know TA... \n\nRealistically, it's going to take me until new years for my funds to settle, transfer from my registered account to my bank and then into my margin account. \n\n**Management - General Considerations:**\n\n- Roll LEAPS for credit @ ~180 DTE to capture gains\n- Sell conservative CC's with <0.20 delta and 30 DTE. Buy back at 50% profit and re-sell on a solidly green day (>=2% increase in underlying price) \n- ensure that Net Premium is < 75% the width between the strikes\n- Avoid selling CC around earnings (+/- days before)\n- If underlying falls significantly (market crash) double down by buying more LEAPS (with a small(er) account size, this could be challenging. I will keep my premiums for this purpose. \n\n**Questions:**\n\n- Due to my capital constraints to enter the position, does it make sense to: (a) Save more money to buy LEAPS >= 0.80 delta, or (b) buy a more affordable LEAPS with a delta >0.70?\n\n- If I was to buy a LEAPS with a lower delta, is it imperative to let the underlying appreciate until the delta is >0.80, or is it safe to sell conservative CC's against it, as long the net premium is < 75% of the width of the strike?\n\n- I am having a hard time understanding why I would choose 392 vs. 483 vs. 756 DTE. Couldn't I just choose the shortest/cheapest DTE and roll it out, after I receive premium from selling CC's...?\n\n- If the LEAPS has a lower strike (105 vs. 115), following the *net premium is <75% of the width between the strikes of the long and short leg*, does that indicate that I should/can be more aggressive with the strike selection on the short leg? For example, the width between a 115 and 170 strike is the same as the width between a 105 and 160 strike. \n\n- I would appreciate clarification on my options if the short-leg is breached. \n\n- Am I silly for buying a LEAPS on AMD after it's increased 40%+ in the past 5 months, especially considering where the market/economy is at? \n\nAll thoughts are appreciated - Many thanks and happy holidays!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I’ll try some of these.\n\n  \nI prefer around an .80 delta, but .70 isn’t necessarily bad.

And slow and uncertain rising of rates will actually discourage reinvestment of matures debts into these bonds. And if the central banks decided to rise bonds at faster pace to increase demand it will trigger systemic failure and tank the economy thus reduce total activity and again reduce demand on bond.\n\nThe central banks just won’t be able to raise rates.

Do you think with 10 wish list items, i don't know what they want to have? \n\nSupposedly let's take example of photo tagging (label). If your friend is uploading a picture of you, who have other pictures together. Facebook will combine both the network graph + CNN model to predict that it's most probably you. Sure, google has more photos of each of you, but they have so many other photos that sometimes it's not feasible to go through everyone. Their network effect is not as effective as Facebook. Almost no one uses google + anyways. Good thing FB is shutting down the feature but you get the point. \n\nI'm not saying that google has less data, i'm saying they dont have the BEST data on all fields like the user above claimed. No, there are honest things you can do while be in Facebook (ie: looking through dog pictures, flower pictures, ect...). Another problem with searches is that if someone borrows a computer, forgot to log out, do you think it's not a contamination of data? Also, the search space is too vast, thus it runs into a sparse matrix problem. You can have a ton of data but each topic is only a few lines of data, and some might not be relevant to your cause/ROI. Yes, you do have more data but like i said, I'm not saying they have less data. They have to compete across the front with many other players (amazon, fb, apple, tesla, ect...).\n\nAs for conversion rate, Amazon is probably the best with less page usage. Their recommender model is top-class (same with netflix). They can categorize your shopping behavior -> match with similar people like you -> suggest items that others buy that you haven't. The same method is said with the items browsing. This is personalized data and requires a lot of network effect as well user profiling. Searches are too vast and can be contaminated easily, thus giving you more data but over too many fields to focus on. \n\nAgain, i'm not saying google is a bad buy or anything. I have over $90k invested in google and way less in facebook/amazon. What I am saying is that these AI problems are not easy and google doesn't have the hold of everything on top like the user said.

You need to be able to build up a model for someone and having their searches tied to the account is just solid gold.  There is just no other data nearly as valuable.

You can see on the chart at what price points she has bought all of her holdings in, and if they are green, then she's made money on them, and if in the red, then they are presenting themselves a better prices then when Cathy bought them, which may suggest that they are great stocks for you to consider buying (as individual stocks).\n\nIf you bought 6 out of Cathy's top 10 holdings today, you'd financially be in a better position that ARK is, which is pretty exciting for me!\n\nTake Teledoc as an example - Across all of her ETF's, it is combined, her 2nd biggest holding. Across all ETF's, her buy price is $148-172, and today it trades for $95.51. If she goes all-in on these stocks and puts her money where her mouth is, imagine what she'd do to be in your shoes today to enter into her 2nd biggest stock at today's prices.\n\nI'm not a HUGE fan of Zoom as a business model (I use it a lot, but i'm not confident that there is a big enough MOAT within the business, and I'd think that Google / Microsoft will gradually continue to take away this market share), but it is another example of a possible GREAT opportunity if this stock DOES peak your interest, and you'd be in a FAR greater position than ARK.\n\nHopefully this helps to open your eyes to potentially a unique way at looking at the situation.
