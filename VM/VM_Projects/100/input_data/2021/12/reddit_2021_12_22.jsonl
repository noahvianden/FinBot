{"title": "Elon Musk says he’s ‘sold enough’ Tesla stock to satisfy his 10% goal", "selftext": "Elon Musk said Tuesday he’s met his goal of selling 10% of his stake in Tesla Inc., and criticized California for “overtaxation.” In a nearly hourlong podcast interview with the satirical website the Babylon Bee, the Tesla TSLA, +4.29% CEO said: “I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option-exercise stuff, and I tried to be extremely literal here.”\n\nAccording to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Musk exercised 2 million more options and sold nearly 584,000 more Tesla shares Tuesday, bringing the total number of shares sold over the past month-plus to about 13.5 million — slightly shy of the roughly 17 million shares that constituted his 10% stake as of Nov. 7, when he posted a Twitter poll asking whether he should sell. He’s made more than $14 billion in those sales. But over that time he’s also exercised options to buy about 16.4 million stock options at about $6.24 a share, actually increasing his stake in the electric-auto maker.\n\nMusk also tweeted Sunday night that he will pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year. That equates to about 8.06 million of his recently sold shares going to his tax bill on stock options set to expire next year. Musk, who has insulted top Democrats in recent weeks who have called for him to pay more in taxes, took a parting shot at California’s high taxes.\n\n“California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is… becoming more so the land of sort of overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation,” he told the Babylon Bee.\n\nThis year, Musk moved his residence and Tesla’s corporate headquarters from California to Texas, which has significantly lower taxes. Musk is the world’s wealthiest individual according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, with a fortune of about $245 billion — up nearly $89 billion this year alone. In Tuesday’s podcast, Musk reiterated that his wealth is tied up in stock. “It’s not like I’ve got some sort of massive cash balance,” he said. Tesla shares gained more than 4% Tuesday and are up 33% year to date. The company’s stock has soared more than 1,100% over the past three years.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-says-hes-sold-enough-tesla-stock-to-satisfy-his-10-goal-11640149728?mod=mw\\_quote\\_news](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-says-hes-sold-enough-tesla-stock-to-satisfy-his-10-goal-11640149728?mod=mw_quote_news)", "id": "rlzmjr", "created_utc": 1640157021.0, "score": 1104, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 613, "comments": [{"body": ">\t“California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is… becoming more so the land of sort of overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation,” he told the Babylon Bee.\n\n\n>\tThe Babylon Bee is Your Trusted Source For Christian News Satire.\n\nUhhhh", "score": 790, "replies": [{"body": "We're living in a simulation and they are testing how much nonsense they can push on us before our coding breaks.", "score": 275, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 27, "replies": []}, {"body": "Before our codes break?

Corporate taxes directly reduce a company's profit. Income taxes force companies to pay employees more so they end up with the desired amount of money they want post-taxes. Sales taxes reduce the quantity demanded of the company's goods. Then of course, there's capital gains taxes which takes away the gains you make off a stock after all those other taxes hurting a company's profits. None of this is political. What is political is whether in spite of all these costs to individuals and companies, taxes are beneficial for society or not and whether taxation is ethical. I won't discuss this part in order to avoid politicising this subreddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you seem to be discussing the concept of taxes being a necessity for society to function, but when did I ever bring that up? Don't strawman the argument by taking it to the extreme. We are talking about whether Billionaires should pay more taxes. Specifically wealth taxes as people like Elon Musk derive their wealth from their stock holdings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour own argument fails here because you can't prove that on the other hand that the market will function after the implementation of a wealth tax. For one, forcing billionaires to liquidate their stocks would artificially inflate the supply of said stocks and could thus tank the price of the stocks and the value of the stock market, screwing over ordinary people. Another thing is that it could motivate people to privatise companies to make it difficult to value them. This would be devastating to the ordinary investor who now cannot grow his wealth by investing in said companies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou asked me to find a reputable economist that says otherwise. While there may not be many that are entirely against taxes, I'll be happy to let you know that most credible economists are in fact against wealth taxes which is why most successful countries don't tax it and aren't planning to. Just because certain people say they will tax the rich to get votes, doesn't mean they will.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPolitics can be involved in stocks.

First, Elon isn’t saying California sucks and always did. He’s simply saying that achieving the level of success he achieved is becoming more and more difficult due to policy changes. Which explains why he and his company are leaving. California has plenty to offer, to many folks, but he is now a target—and he’s not wrong. It’s becoming harder and harder to succeed in this country in general because of policy changes in Washington that crush main Street. Second, wealthy folks don’t mind paying taxes. The problem is, the money is wasted. The government doesn’t have an income problem, it has a spending problem. So when I lose half my paycheck or earnings to taxes, yea, it kinda pisses me off. My family came here with nothing and I was taught that taxes are the entry fee we pay to be Americans. I’m okay with that. But When I see how the government now spends my money, it boils my blood. So, without going into too much detail, I’ll say that the narrative among many in the upper tax bracket is not a general opposition to taxes, but rather how that money is spent foolishly and it is therefor frustrating to see hard earned dollars pissed away. Elon’s billions will be gone in 8 months. In 8 months uncle Sam will have spent every penny and there will be nothing to show for it. Third, I don’t care how much money you start with, achieving Elon’s level of success is near impossible. I’m sorry to say this, but anyone that bashes his success or where he started, is extremely ignorant, clearly bitter, very likely unsuccessful and will remain so, and possess both a low IQ and EQ. Elon has single handed my advanced mankind though Tesla, Neuralink, SpaceX, starlink, the boring company, he is currently working quietly on carbon capture . . . The man is brilliant and driven beyond comprehension. I don’t care how many great people you claim he hires, I don’t care how much money you think he started with, no one accomplished what he has by sitting back and watching. His level of success and innovation is absofuckinglutely insane. To say otherwise (and I rarely use this word) is the very definition of stupid. Fourth, this is a stock sub. While you have a right to espouse your beliefs and ideas wherever you damn well please, perhaps you ought to consider talking about your socialist ideology elsewhere. Or whatever communist, socialist, illogical fantasies you possess. This isn’t the sub for it. Fifth, when did we villainize success? Growing up, I was told to admire, learn from, watch wealthy successful people. And I did. And it helped me achieve my success early in life. I looked to those people for inspiration, guidance, advice and help. I never villainized them. I respected them and their hustle and what it took for them to get to that point in their lives. Now we make these folks out to be monsters. Truth is, they are just normal people who are willing to work a bit harder, with a bit more focus on specific goals, they are excellent at execution (where most fail) . . . They got to where they are by being smart and working hard. Perhaps, instead of villainizing them, we should aspire to achieve that level of success ourselves.

Elon's comment that \"when they disagree, it's not clear which one to believe\" is obviously bullshit in a traditional engineering setting.  Why?  Because you could just default to believing vision.  Now you're in a situation that's at least as good as pure vision.  Obviously there is a cost component to both, but that's not the biggest part of it.\n\nAt a high level, training a deep network is analogous to training a human (the human has far more implicit bias built in from billions of years of evolution, along with cars and road being built to human strengths, which is why they need far less data).  When you increase the complexity of the model, the training task becomes vastly more complex.  Vision tasks share many basic elements (\"features\"), and therefore the whole stack using vision to perceive the world means that the intrinsic dimensionality of the FSD solution is effectively lower.  Imagine you're teaching your teenager to drive and you say:  And if you look between your legs, you'll see a high-dimensional representation of the roof-mounted LIDAR unit, and over the speakers, we'll pay an audio representation of what the radar is sensing.

I suppose there will be a point at which upgrading all the current FSD chips is more expensive than the cost of training the network to achieve L4 FSD.

That seems harder (or at least vastly more uncertain) than going from a supercomputer to an FSD chip.\n\nSo the claim I'm making is stronger:  Even if I give you (realistically) unlimited compute power in the car, FSD is still easier to achieve \\*without\\* LIDAR.  \n\n\n(Of course Tesla is pursuing the right approach, which is to get decent FSD on a chip so it can be deployed at scale to collect training data.)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "That doesn't take into account what lidar enables that is very \"expensive\" computationally with vision.\n\nArguably lidar could help to give a sense of depth, preconditioning what vision algorithms to run on different depths of the image. \n\nAs a toy example, if you have 3 areas of interest, for example short, medium and long distance covering equal area of your image, deploying three distinct algorithms (could just be the big network pruned conditionally) could be more efficient. \n\nSo instead of having to run a big big model, you can run three smaller models on each subset of the image, reducing computation needed. \n\nI agree with mobileye CEO on that vision only will eventually get there, but also deem it more likely that lidar + vision gets to L4 first. Lidar is simply a pretty darn useful sensor that provides relevant and different enough data about the environment. \n\nThe hardware limitation is not actually an issue for solving l4 for others than Tesla, as they haven't sold the promise of future l4 for 2-3 year old hardware, so they can design for computational capacity of cars in the future instead of past as Tesla must.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, and this is, again attempting to apply classical engineering principles.\n\nHere is the situation:  We know there is a relatively small library of code that can drive a car based on vision (the human brain).

We have no idea if we had attached lidar DNA to primoridial species if they would have evolved to use it effectively.  The only proof of concept we have, of the existence of a small neural program that does FSD, is the human brain.
