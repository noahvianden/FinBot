{"title": "The omicron panic is overdone. Buy the dips in these stocks, says JPMorgan", "selftext": "“Over the last several days markets have been in turmoil over the new COVID variant omicron. However, data on omicron is sparse, information contradictory, and some media has been exaggerating risks and highlighting worst case scenarios,” chief global strategist Marko Kolanovic and quant strategist Bram Kaplan wrote in a note to clients. They pointed fingers at a “media blitz” on Thanksgiving evening, one of the lowest market liquidity points in a year, that sent growth-sensitive assets crashing. They took issue with a selloff sparked by Moderna’s CEO, who dashed hopes that current vaccines will work against omicron. They argued his comments have been “invalidated by reports from Pfizer, Oxford, the WHO and the Israeli Health Ministry.”\n\nKolanovic and Kaplan said their clients are less worried about the variant and more about flight restrictions, which have included barring South African flights, but not European ones, where cases have also been spotted. They described assessments of omicron’s potential transmissibility as confusing at best. “In simple terms, when older variants are spreading via breakthrough infections, new variants will always appear to be significantly more transmissible than older ones.” They backed this up with a tweet by biomathemetician Gabriela Gomes.\n\nEarly reports suggest it may be less deadly, and if confirmed in coming weeks, that could turn omicron into a positive for markets, said the pair. Kolanovic and Kaplan raised the possibility that a less severe and more contagious variant may crowd out more severe variants, potentially speeding up the end of the pandemic and turning it into more of a seasonal flu. That’s amid vaccines and a growing list of treatments to tackle COVID, said the strategists. “If the market were to anticipate that scenario — omicron could be a catalyst for steepening (not flattening) the yield curve, rotation from growth to value, selloff in COVID and lockdown beneficiaries and rally in reopening themes,” said the team.\n\n“Also, if that scenario were to happen, instead of skipping two letters and naming it omicron, the WHO could have skipped all the way to omega. As such, we view the recent selloff in these segments as an opportunity to buy the dip in cyclicals, commodities and reopening themes, and to position for higher bond yields and steepening,” said the bank’s strategists. Here’s hoping they’re right.\n\n **The buzz** \n\nApple AAPL, -0.32% has reportedly warned suppliers that demand may be softer into 2022. Wedbush analysts lifted shares to $200 from $185, on optimism headed into 2022. They also see the “tech stalwart” as a “safety blanket” in a near-term COVID market storm. \n\nGlaxoSmithKline GSK, 0.03% GSK, +0.61% says its COVID-19 Sotrovimab antibody treatment is effective against the omicron variant, but based on lab test tubes. The U.S. has unveiled its plan for stricter COVID-19 testing on international travelers.\n\nWeWork shares WE, -2.65% are down after the co-working space group said it will restate financials and admitted a material weakness.\n\nMeanwhile, infections in South Africa, which raised the alarm over the variant last week, were at 8,561 on Wednesday, doubling in 24 hours. A top scientist in South Africa has warned that “more severe complications may not present themselves for a few weeks.”\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-omicron-panic-is-overdone-buy-the-dips-in-these-stocks-says-jpmorgan-11638447971?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-omicron-panic-is-overdone-buy-the-dips-in-these-stocks-says-jpmorgan-11638447971?mod=home-page)", "id": "r78jjn", "created_utc": 1638454982.0, "score": 2447, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 434, "comments": [{"body": "wanna offload their bags to retails", "score": 620, "replies": [{"body": "yup anytime they want you to buy it means they’re trying to create liquidity 😂", "score": 259, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’m glad someone pointed this out\n\nEdit: the worst thing is this is going to work and people will buy it not knowing they are about to get rug pulled.", "score": 124, "replies": [{"body": "this casino is an endless game of musical chairs.\n\neveryone gets a chance to hold the bag when the music stops", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "I think this one is different though.

Also STMP definitely has entertaining videos, I just hope he doesn’t actually think he’s some sort of genius for getting lucky on a massive bet. His strategy isn’t replicable.\n\nEdit: as an example of why “results” don’t instantly mean someone’s investment strategy makes sense - if you put 100 people in a room flipping coins and have them compete against each other (whoever wins stays, whoever loses leaves) then eventually you’ll have 1 winner who is the “best coin flipper”.

This is a protein structure that sits on the outside of the virus cells and is involved in connecting with human cells and allowing the virus to inject its RNA into the human cells. The idea of the vaccines is to inject the mRNA which makes this spike protein and allow your body to create antibodies for it.\n\nThere is a general consensus it seems that as viruses evolve they become less deadly. However, some posited that COVID could be different because 'it spreads asymptomatically\". I don't buy this to the extent that some think. The virus would spread more when people are coughing and spluttering everywhere for many reasons. There should still be selective pressure for the virus to become less virulent over time, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nThe virus that is more virulent should outcompete the virus that is less, just by nature of how fast it can spread and consume resources. When infected with covid you likely have many mutations that are different from the sequenced mainstream variant, i.e. Omicron. So really you have multiple viruses that are very closely related.

{"title": "PLBY - Cardi B named \"Creative Director in Residence\" of PLBY, and \"Founding Creative Director\" of Centerfold", "selftext": "Keeping this one short and sweet. I've been shilling the fuck out of this stock based on the following thesis:\n\n* Playboy is misunderstood. It's not a shitty boomer company anymore.\n* Their revenues are increasing all nearly all fronts.. licensing, dtc apparel, and acquisitions (honey birdette, lovers, yandy)\n* The inflection point: They're going to tie everything together with Centerfold, a creator-driven platform. Too much to discuss on this front, but basically it'll be a version of OnlyFans that offers more streams of revenue and a more trustworthy and reputable \"home\" for the nice tits gig economy.\n* I don't think the market fully appreciates just how good of a shot PLBY has at pulling this off, and how much money it can pull in.\n* The big risks: execution. Centerfold website could suck, could be delayed, the creators that come on board could be underwhelming, etc.\n\nToday, another large part of that risk has been removed:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/notyif2zs5381.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=7163def2b1c4c2adfb8efae116eca478a017fd16\n\nThere's a Forbes article (google: \"Cardi B Playboy\") that came out, too. My favorite quote:\n\n> “Creators today deserve to express themselves freely and unfiltered,” she said. “They deserve to feel safe in their creativity and sexuality. And they deserve to own their future. This is what Centerfold is all about. For all those creators out there doing bold, revolutionary, truly culture-shifting things, come join me.” \n\nBasically, this announcement is a huge win. It ups the brand image of PLBY and makes it more likely that creators join Centerfold. It also shows management is really going all in on Centerfold, and that they're serious about creating a platform that serves creators.\n\nMy previous DDs go in depth about how Centerfold vs Onlyfans is \\*not\\* like Mixer vs Twitch:  Mixer/Twitch rely on the network effect -- more viewers means more creators, means more viewers, etc.   CF/OF only requires creators -- more creators, more subs... plain and simple. The creators bring their own audience through hustling... and who better to represent creators than Cardi B?\n\n**I still do not believe for a second that the market fully appreciates how good of a shot PLBY has at capturing a lot of this market from OnlyFans.** In fact, I'm doubtful they're even aware there is a publicly traded company that offers exposure to the cammer market, which is fucking massive and growing, and a no-brainer investment, deserving of tech valuations.\n\nI think that when Centerfold officially launches (**their launch party is this Saturday**, **so I assume an official PR announcement will be made no later than that**), the stock is going to go fucking nuts as smart money moves in.\n\n# Risks\n\nSince I started following the stock, a lot of the risk is starting to evaporate:\n\n* ~~Launch gets delayed.~~ On Oct 20, Launch got moved from H2 2022 to Q4 2021.  On Nov 31, launch party was announced for Saturday Dec 4. So, seems very likely it's ready to ship.\n* ~~Launch is underwhelming.~~ Cardi B is on board. I expect in the official newswire print, there will be **a lot** of bullish language surrounding that. Also I expect a lot of talk about the revenue potential of the market, how the product ties in the rest of the company (flywheel effect, synergies, etc), how the product has an edge over OnlyFans (created with creators in mind, possibly better revshare, offers multiple revenue streams, etc).\n* Website could suck. Still a possibility. But, honestly, I don't think it needs to be anything amazing. It's basically a blogging website where subscribers have to pay to see the blog. At any rate, there are technical risks here. Site could go down, could have bugs, etc.\n* Is it an appealing place for creators to join? It's possible OnlyFans is too \"sticky\", or that Centerfold just doesn't provide enough juice. I personally don't think this is the case, but it's a common criticism.  I think it'll become the preferred platform for creators for many reasons: possibly better revshare, more culturally relevant/reputable, created with founders in mind (sex-positive, anti-censorship, and be-your-own-business are all central tenants), multiple rev streams (commissions, apparel lines, etc), and best of all: **they didn't tell all their creators they'd ban sexual content, like OnlyFans did.** (Yes, OnlyFans reversed this decision, but still... imagine your livelihood being threatened overnight... would you still want to do business with them if you had a better alternative?)\n* Market could simply not care.  Always a possibility.. but I don't think all the things I'm raving about here are known to the market, and I think the official launch print will make it more clear.\n\n# Other News\n\n* A new ETF launched to capture exposure to non-fungus-tokens, and PLBY fungi are the top holdings of it.\n* PLBY announced more liquor and apparel collabs, proving once again they are still culturally relevant despite what a lot of you retards keep saying in response to my DDs.\n* You're gay if you don't buy the stock\n\n# How much of a Catalyst?\n\nThis is the question I ask myself every time I look at my massive pile of highly volatile Dec and Jan calls. When Centerfold launches... will the market care? How much of this is priced in? How big will the launch actually be?\n\nMy thoughts on that:\n\n* I think a tiny fraction of would-be investors are aware of the plan of Centerfold, and how it'll fit in to PLBY's other stuff... of which they are also unaware.  So the launch will illuminate that quite a bit. On top of that, I think it's highly investable.\n* Of those that are/were aware of the above, I think only a fraction are aware that Centerfold is coming \"this quarter\".\n* Of those, I think only a fraction of them are aware the launch party is Saturday, so I think the news print comes out Saturday at the latest.\n* I think it's clear Centerfold is Playboy's big bet. So when they launch, I expect them to throw everything they've got at it. CEO and Cardi B making the rounds on CNBC and wherever else.. strip clubs I guess. Big marketing. Targeted ads to creators. Whatever... they'll want everyone to know the \"new OnlyFans\" is here, and as a consequence the market will buy in to the hype as well. **I think it could basically be like a smaller version of what an IPO for OnlyFans would be.**\n* Is it priced in? Partially, yeah. it's been climbing since the Oct 20 announcement that Centerfold will be launched in Q4. They also had a great earnings, and on the call Centerfold was hyped. But I don't think the possible market-wide interest in this stock is priced in... and I don't think the hundreds of millions in potential revenue is priced in (OnlyFans pulled in \\~$3b I think?).\n\n# What else?\n\nPlenty of bulls on this stock, lots of bullish news. Read the latest Forbes article, and google \"hedgeye PLBY\".\n\n# Positions / etc\n\n**Still a fuck ton of Dec and Jan calls**, since launch is imminent. Been buying the dips... probably recklessly exposed to this stock, but fuck it... it's my end of year YOLO and I'll happily bet on a massive upcoming catalyst like Centerfold launching. I think this Cardi B announcement and price effect is nowhere near as big as the Centerfold announcement will be.", "id": "r7cnq0", "created_utc": 1638466549.0, "score": 475, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 240, "comments": [{"body": "I'm just here for the interesting articles.", "score": 211, "replies": [{"body": "I'm excited for whatever is going to happen on November 31st.", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "You definitely belong here :P", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Doing “research” for stocks.
