The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.\n\nIn an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark‚Äôs new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: ‚ÄúIf we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.‚Äù A $3,000 share price would put Tesla‚Äôs valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. \n\nElectrek‚Äôs Take\n\nSince Ark‚Äôs new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk‚Äôs email is basically a direct comment on Tesla‚Äôs stock price.

To me, it is like you are comparing Apples and stones (or was I supposed to say Oranges here?)\n\nEvery Tesla Auto is an EV, but not every EV is a Tesla. Do cars have 4 wheels? Yes. Do cars have a way to run? Yes, they do. But that does not make any EV Manufacturer a competitor to Tesla. Tesla is a Computer on Wheels that is going to further blow any competition out of the water with FSD (doesn‚Äôt matter when it releases to the Public). \n\nTesla has been, is, and will always be ahead of 99% of the Competition. IMHO. \n\nIn my mind, Tesla is spelled like this ‚Äú**S**-**Y**-**N**-**E**-**R**-**G**-**Y**‚Äù.\n\nThe Competition: \n\n(1) Is late in the race by at least a decade;\n\n(2) Is still focused on ICE Cars, for most part, since it is their bread and butter - they cannot just abandon suddenly, what they have been good at doing for close to 100 years (and is still earning them $$$$$$$) and run a race on a totally different track that would add to their Revenues several years/decades (?) down the line to match what they have been making for so long. Most of their resources are still focused on keeping these Revenue streams flowing - and while they continue to do this, Tesla will, as usual, continue to focus all it‚Äôs energies to moving forward in the EV-space.\n\n(3) Will be spending their time, effort and money trying to bring down Tesla or to slowing Tesla down - again a distraction from their goal to accomplish FSD.\n\n(4) will be aiming at where Tesla is right now, and by the time years roll by and the competition reaches Tesla‚Äôs capabilities, in terms of Range, driving technology etc., Tesla would already have moved further up in these and other new capabilities.\n\n(5) Will continue to sell through their Dealers-with lesser maintenance being required on EVs (compared to ICE), the middleman will try to make more money on each Sale, adding no value  as such, but, at the same time, adding and passing the additional cost to the Buyer. The last time we bought an ICE Car (tho it was also fun at some level, and a good learning experience for my son who was buying it), I hated having to spend 5 hours at the Dealership haggling the price down from $35,000 to $24,000 (which is  68% of the price that was first quoted - I‚Äôm really amazed that the ICE Dealerships have that kind of power and those kind of margins!) No wonder the Dealership Association have been up in arms against the Tesla sell-direct-to-Customer model. And this campaign by them has been supported full-heartedly by the ICE Companies and their Unions, since their individual and combined existence is in peril, and they would be willing do anything to stop Tesla‚Äôs continued progress.\n\nIt is going to be a very steep uphill journey for the behemoths to overcome the inertia (or the lack thereof) to reach where Tesla is at, and also keep up with the innovation that Tesla has been, and will continue to drive, for it‚Äôs ‚ÄúFan Boys‚Äù and ‚ÄúFan Gals‚Äù - we are (almost?) a cult now üòâ. You will not be able to move the needle for me from my love for Tesla.\n\nMy prediction: While all the other Auto Companies continue to struggle to play-catch-up with Tesla, by 2035, I think the Tesla Stock has the potential to rise to $6,000 from where it is now (and, of course, we can expect it to have split further by then).", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "dream on, that guy is the biggest con man on the face of the planet, deflect deflect, go to the arabs to get money blah blah. guy is a f'ing joke.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Go make your first lego car before you talk shit about people that bring literally anything on the table for the world", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "After what happened in January fuck TSLA, this man is bipolar", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Elon is a scumbag", "score": -1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Elon Musk - Troll number 1 \n\nLove this guy.", "score": -1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "but they dont make quality cars...", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "They have nice trim but shit quality control.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": "What about EV has anything to do with quality control for body panels not fitting together or inconsistent paint‚Äî[criticisms that Musk admits to](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/03/business/elon-musk-tesla-quality-problems/index.html)?", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "The value is basically ignoring all the competition they face on the market.

{"title": "Wishful thinking: Is China Fucked?", "selftext": "\n\nHELLO!\n\nI wrote my economics thesis on their bad debt maturities for the coming 10 years, specifically in 'shadow banking' and was wondering what the esteemed commune of WSB thinks of these points.\n\nMy conclusions were that:\n\nIf there were significant defaults in their 'shadow banking' industry the CCP could cover as much as 13 T USD in initial damages to the industry which would raise their risk profile and increase future cost of debt. The worst part about this debt is that is largely it is all OBS, (similar to MBS from the GFC). These 'bombs' are WMP (Wealth Management Products) and are actually highly leveraged instruments that through a web of borrowings with state banks use CCP money to invest in risky business loans.\n\nA lot of which have failed, you can read about the slew of 'shadow banks' failing in recent years with more and more in the past year.\n\nThere is a lot of speculation the CCP is already sterilising a large amount of bad-debts through perpetual loans for these 'shadow banks' to prevent a collapse of the industry and eternal damnation for Xi's finance minister.\n\nThis kind of catastrophe would derail China's economic vision and would cause a long and painful recession around the world.\n\nTo respond to your point about a sterilisation, it's my opinion that they wouldn't be able to cover the onslaught as it would be almost impossible to keep track of defaulting debt. This is because it is completely out of sight and thus the ability for Chinese governing bodies and financial regulators to take financial assistance action is an extremely difficult task in itself.\n\n\nSmoothieman790 out\n\nEdit: I don't have enough karma to respond to comments in my own post, I likened post asset inflation result to Japanese asset bubble as well to whoever was reminiscing on the Tokyo circa 1989. -- This was in reference to the US/CHINA\n\nEdit 2: Someone mentioned the soft colonisation of Africa, and this in my opinion is an economic bondage.
