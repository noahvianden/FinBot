{"title": "Congress must raise the debt limit by Oct. 18, Treasury Secretary Yellen warns in new letter as potential default looms", "selftext": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday told House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that Congress has just under three weeks to address the looming debt ceiling and avoid near-certain economic calamity.\n\n“We now estimate that Treasury is likely to exhaust its extraordinary measures if Congress has not acted to raise or suspend the debt limit by October 18,” she wrote in a letter. “At that point, we expect Treasury would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly.”\n\n\nYellen, who will testify before the Senate later Tuesday morning, warned in a separate statement to lawmakers that failure to suspend or raise the debt limit would lead to the first-ever U.S. default and have severe consequences for the U.S. economy.\n\n“It is imperative that Congress swiftly addresses the debt limit. If it does not, America would default for the first time in history,” she said in her remarks to the Senate Banking Committee. “The full faith and credit of the United States would be impaired, and our country would likely face a financial crisis and economic recession.”\n\nThe debt ceiling is viewed as the greater economic threat since failing to suspend or raise the U.S. borrowing limit would result in a first-ever default and untold economic havoc.\n\n**Own thoughts:** There’s a very little chance this would happen and everything negative expressed in the article would result, since they’ll raise it.

{"title": "The Great Market Wheeze is almost upon us", "selftext": "I don't expect this to be super popular but I want to make it as a record to say I called it. \n\nThe good times are almost up. \n\nHere's a long wall of text, don't apologise for it, no TLDR. Don't expect anyone to read this anyway.\n\n--- **Everything depends on treasury bonds and inflation** ---\n\nDon't look at the S&P as a PE ratio, but as a yield, so it's 1:1 with bonds. For example the S&P 500 has a 34.75 PE - in earnings yield 2.9% a year. The ratio between treasuries and the S&P 500 is called BEER (bond equity earnings yield ratio). \n\nCurrently a 10 year US treasury yields 1.4% and S&P 2.9%. The yield on a treasury can't exceed stocks in the long run, who would buy stocks if they could do better in risk free bonds. S&P comes with risk premium due to downturns. \n\nTreasury yield are near all-time lows due to a number of factors including COVID and the fed printing $120b/month to buy securities. Low treasury yields make S&P look more attractive, driving up the price and down the yield. 2.9% is better then 1.4%.\n\nThis relationship between treasuries, inflation and stock yields determines *everything.*\n\nMoney supply has expanded rapidly due to massive printing. M1 massively, M2 slightly so far. As the velocity of money increases with reopening it guarantees M2 expansion.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL\n\nWages are up, commodity prices are up which in conjunction with massive money printing *guarantees* inflation will at the very least run hotter then it was pre-2020 for an extended period of time. How hot... who knows? In 2019 it was 1.8%, so at a minimum we're looking at 2%, probably higher. Not hyper-inflation but hotter then before. This is a certainty. \n\n--- **The debt burden** ---\n\nThe government funds itself with treasuries and so the yield it has to pay is a major deal. The US has $29t in debt, at a 1.4% yield that's $400b/year in interest payments. Manageable. At 14%, as it was in the 80s, that's $4t a year, almost as much as the entire yearly $6.5t budget. Unmanageable. \n\nThis massive debt expansion gives very little room for the fed to manoeuvre, which makes it very predictable. The fed *cannot* allow inflation run too hot as it would bankrupt America. \n\nGiven a choice between crashing the market and inflation it will crash the market. It does not have the option to do anything else, it cannot let yields rise significantly. \n\n--- **So what does this mean for stonks?** ---\n\nRemember: Inflation rate < Treasury yields < S&P yields\n\nPE ratios going up over last 30 years is not the result of investors randomly deciding stocks are worth more. It's the result of low inflation, therefore low treasury yields, therefore low S&P yields, therefore PE going up, therefore stocks going up. \n\nThe US economy in real terms has been barely growing, a couple percent a year at best, the massive bull run over the last decade is not a sign of economic prosperity, it's almost purely multiple expansion. We're at one end of the pendulum and now it has to swing back.  \n\nInflation guaranteed to go up = treasury yields guaranteed to go up = S&P yield guaranteed to go up (PE ratio going down). \n\nThe yield on a treasury can't trail inflation significantly and historically has sat above inflation. There are less buyers for something guaranteed to lose purchasing power every year. \n\nThat means if inflation sits at 2.5% we're looking at treasury yields at a minimum of 3-4%. Which means S&P yield (currently 2.9%) has to sit up around 5-6%. This would involve the S&P losing *half* its value from relatively small absolute changes to inflation. \n\nEven the fed estimates inflation to be 4% in 2021 and 2% going forward which will be the absolute best case scenario. 2% inflation would still cause at least a 20% drop in stocks, probably much more.\n\n--- **Conclusion** ---\n\nInflation running hotter is a mathematic certainty. Treasury yields going up is a mathematic certainty. S&P PE ratio (and therefore stock price) coming down is a mathematic certainty. \n\nThe fed can choose to either fight inflation and crash the market, or let inflation run free and support the market. It will mostly choose the former, however we will see a bit of both. Inflation will run hotter then expected and stocks will fall.\n\nThe market won't crash all at once bar some unforeseeable event, this won't happen overnight, it will gradually wheeze down as treasury yields adjust to the asset purchase taper and inflation ticking up. I am naming the upcoming event **\"The Great Wheeze\"** and I expect everybody to call it this.\n\nThe underlying economy will keep ticking along relatively normal as before, so barely growing in real terms, but stocks will spend years in decline as treasury yields rise. People will recommend 60/40 stock/bond portfolios again. If you are looking to work in investment banks ask to join the bond division. \n\nI predict this will start within 12 months, probably accelerate early-mid next year and continue. \n\n--- **Is there a way to make money from this?** ---\n\nThe problem with everything bubbles is there's less opportunity. Almost everyone is going to take a hit.\n\nDiversify away from US stocks, invest in low PE foreign markets with high underlying growth to counteract PE compression. Economies that aren't to dependant on exporting to the US is best. We're at the cusp of a new era in investment that will be defined by international markets. Commodity and defensive value stocks with decent dividends are probably solid.\n\nThe other option is to hedge with 20-40% of your portfolio. Hedge against treasury yields going up (hello Burry) and the market going down. Goofy valuation stocks will fall the most. The problem is the market can stay irrational for extended periods of time.\n\nHolding cash is ok, but inflation will start to eat into its purchasing power. There's not going to be a sudden dip and then rebound, it will wheeze out for years, as it's not caused by some temporary recoverable event like COVID or the GFC, it's caused by the economic equivalent of gravity.  \n\nThe other option is markets don't collapse in uniform. Typically there's a cascade of collapse that starts at fringe markets and heads inwards towards the core. If you're holding stocks pre-collapse, selling them and buying in sectors that have already collapsed is another play.\n\nBest of luck fellas, catch you on the other side.", "id": "pwvrsi", "created_utc": 1632793410.0, "score": 771, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 306, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|5|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=pwvrsi)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=pwvrsi)\n    \nHey /u/ini0n, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "For the last time the deficit is meaningless.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Im laying in bed.

The US has $29t in debt, at a 1.4% yield that's $400b/year in interest payments. Manageable. At 14%, as it was in the 80s, that's $4t a year, almost as much as the entire yearly $6.5t budget. Unmanageable.This massive debt expansion gives very little room for the fed to manoeuvre, which makes it very predictable. The fed cannot allow inflation run too hot as it would bankrupt America.\n\n\nThis doesn’t make sense. You said it’s Manageable but then say it’s not if we go to 80’s yields which was some of the highest yields in modern history.  Not really reasonable. \n\n\nRising inflation means current debt is less expensive in real dollars. That’s a good thing. The repayment yield doesn’t matter in that case. The dollars do. \n\n\nIf the average yield today is 1.4 (which I’m not sure it is), that’s equal to 400b per your post in interest payments. In some number of years, with moderately high inflation, that 400b debt payment is now equivalent to what today would be 300b. That means it costs less in real dollars. \n\n\nCheckout modern monetary theory. \n\n\nNot sure if it’s related but part of the debt strategy is to shrink it via inflation.  \n\n\n\n> Inflation rate < Treasury yields < S&P yields\n\n\nDon’t think this has been true for a while. \n\n\n> Commodity and defensive value stocks with decent dividends are probably solid.\n\n\n\nThe opposite occurs. When interest rates go up, dividend stocks go down. You knew this, per your top point, why invest in stocks when debt gets you the same or better yield with less risk. \n\n\nHow to play? \n\n\nTAKE ON DEBT\n\n\nInflation will literally reduce the real cost of your debt. You can use that cash to buy real assets if you want. Real estate. Or you can use it to buy good companies. Even if it goes down sometime soon it doesn’t go down immediately now which means you’ll expand your money by reaping gains. \n\n\nThe other true way to play this would be to use CDS’ but in reverse, assuming you think t bill yields go up. Short high pe growth stocks. \n\n\n\n\n> Typically there's a cascade of collapse that starts at fringe markets and heads inwards towards the core.\n\n\nExamples? Typically works opposite from what I’ve been alive for. \n\n\n\n\nMy take is that ya inflation will rise and is rising and so are wages which helps that. Money supply up yes. But that. Infrastructure bill will make real assets too which helps reduce pure inflation. \n\n\nTaxes are being raise as a drag which is exactly what modern monetary theory says to do to reign in inflation.

Unlike Germany, There's real economic growth occurring and much of the new money is just sitting in banks. Wages are up and labor has some negotiating power.
