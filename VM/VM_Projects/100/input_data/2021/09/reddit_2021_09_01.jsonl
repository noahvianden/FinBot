Now that number is closer to $100k per year and continuing to slowly decline. \n\nI got started by doing this and learning how to do electrical/plumbing/hvac/water-treatment myself because you can’t exactly call any random contractor to your place when you have something like that going on. Skills grew over time started doing these services for other people in my situation Andy after a few lucky breaks began doing this for licensed multi-million dollar facilities. Actually have a job lined up next month for a subsidiary of one of CGC competitors :) \n\nMore people are growing illegally now more than ever because the police don’t care as much which means risk has dropped and barriers to entry aren’t as high. I may personally still know plenty of people that are doing exactly this. Let’s say between electric/water/nutrients/labor that it costs about $500 per pound to grow then any black market cultivator can undercut licensed producers which have that same $500/lb expense but also have to pay a ton in licensing/taxes/red tape. Here in FL a license recently sold for $90M and that’s just for the license doesn’t factor in buildings/staff/equipment/distribution. \n\nAdd to the fact that out in California there are massive outdoor farms operating illegally and flooding the entire country but the police there don’t enforce cultivation laws much so it’s a weird conundrum. \n\nAll of these add up to where long term I see competition increasing and margins decreasing. As in the words of Peter Thiel: Competition is for losers. \n\nI believe long term there will be a few large players but in terms of growth compared to where Tesla will be at 10yr from now it’s not even close. Why buy stock in big tobacco or big alcohol when you can buy Tesla? Cannabis will be the same as tobacco/alcohol eventually. \n\nI think the best opportunity in cannabis right now is the smaller scale craft side of high-end exotic strains (think top 5% quality) grown in small batches and marketed properly. Haven’t seen any publicly listed companies doing this. I know of a few smaller private ones doing this with good success as they’re able to distinguish themselves from the mass-produced stuff coming out of Cali greenhouses and capture a higher margin. \n\nEven though I work in the industry I don’t hold any “pot stocks” because I believe most are either scams or ran by idiots. I do have a business with a garden doing the small-scale craft quality thing that is decently profitable because I’m passionate about the space but it’s not anything that can be scalable into a billion dollar business.\nTLDR: Long-term we’ll have the publicly traded Budweiser garbage and then all the private mom and pop craft beers.

The yellow indicator is RSI with a divergence line rather than overbought and oversold lines. The blue indicator is on balance volume.\n\nDrawing a horizontal line on both indicators on where they closed today you can see the last time that daily RSI or obv has been this high was the last run up to $22 with the reverse merger dividend speculation.\n\nOBV has only been this high since the very tippy top of the peak. (this indicates that while price has been driven down the volume of the red days is being outweighed by the volume of the green days. This means that people have diamond hands. The idea of OBV is that price movements with low volume are much less significant than the same price movement on high volume.\n\nRSI: Last time RSI closed at this level on the uptrend (61.85) was on may 28th. May 28th had a closing price almost identical of our closing price today. This day also marked the beginning of the runup to $22.\n\nwe have a closing price and RSI to match the beginning of the runup however our OBV is already as high as it was at the peak.... this indicates to me that we have a very likely probability that this run up will be more violent and has more power behind it than the previous run up.\n\nThis is the sort of technical analysis that many professional traders would use to enter what they would call a high conviction trade setup. Most would enter here with a price target of $22 and a stop loss of $3.70 and never look again until the either the price target or stop loss was reached.\n\nlastly the candlestick pattern is bullish as hell. we have a bullish engulfing on friday, monday met with high resistance and insane volume, my guess is market makers delta hedged their $5 calls they have sold and proceded to short the price immediately after. Today leaves us a bullish hammer.\n\nI think we will see a few high volume days met with quite a bit of short fire power but it should be obvious as to the direction of the price. No one can be sure but because of the monday volume i would guess the $5,$6 calls have been delta hedged at this point therefore we likely wont breakout completely until we push over $8 with volume. $8 strike calls has a ton of open interest and i highly doubt those calls have been hedged.\n\nIm betting now, we see a price real close to $8 by end of the week and next week we breakout.", "id": "pflz6a", "created_utc": 1630468468.0, "score": 652, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|30|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|63|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmyma1/khc_bull_thesis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9pzfo/black_belt_level_tactics_to_force_the_squeeze/) \n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am in.

{"title": "Chewy ($CHWY) earnings put YOLO/DD (35k)", "selftext": "**Edit: Cut the champagne and open the steak boys!**\n\nChewy is an e-commerce retailer of pet food and supplies, mainly active in the USA. Last quarter they posted USD 2.14bn in revenue from 19.8 million customers (600k of which were new additions). For Q2 they project 2.15-2.17 billion in revenue for a very modest 1% q-o-q growth.\n\nI think they'll outdo their (very conservative) revenue guidance, but fall short on customer additions for the quarter and revenue guidance for the following quarters. Chewy is currently trading at the upper end of its historical P/S ratio, (save for a brief time in Jan/Feb 2021 when it was even higher than today). It’s P/S of 4.76 is relatively high for its industry (as it is a low margin retailer, not a platform business). It’s actually higher than Amazon, which I would argue is too high to make sense and I expect a short-term downside re-evaluation of Chewy after earnings.\n\n**Reasons**\n\n* **Competition catching up**\n\nThe key investment thesis for Chewy has been \"Fast-growing pet e-commerce industry\" and \"growing faster than its competition in its fast-growing industry\". I believe the second reason may be moderating. While Chewy is the clear market leader, I'm seeing several signs that its competitors (in both e-commerce and retail) are slowly catching up. Walmart (biggest brick and mortal pet retailer) just reported a big revenue beat. Petsmart (brick and mortar focused) is looking to increase revenue this year following a bad 2020. Petco reported great earnings two weeks ago.\n\nThese good results could be because the overall market (\"pet ecommerce\") is expanding. I don't think so. The market expansion took place in 2020, the number of adopted pets is on a clear downtrend. If most other big players are doing quite well, I suspect they are doing so at the expense of Chewy.\n\n* **Low net customers additions**\n\nIn Q1 2021 Chewy added a net 600k customers, their lowest absolute increase in two years. I expect them to report even lower additions this quarter as they follow up Q2 of 2020, their biggest quarter of customer additions ever. 1 year is a very typical \"cliff\" during which many former customers start to churn (according to Chewy CEO Sumit Singh). Since they haven't increased their marketing spend significantly this Q, I expect high churn and low gross additions, which is a bad early sign for growth companies.\n\n[Customer additions per quarter](https://preview.redd.it/dkmcffawmxk71.png?width=799&format=png&auto=webp&s=5521fbd76802f34cacbc31617550af9f34177b9e)\n\n* **Moderating growth rates in a fast-growth industry**\n\nChewy's app store rankings in Q2 have been at its lowest level since February 2019. Who downloads apps from the store? New customers, usually. Remember the part where I think they will have unexpectedly low gross customer additions this quarter?\n\n[Petco App gaining ground on Chewy](https://preview.redd.it/z5yvwgzjnxk71.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=38c746658cf948bc19a514b436ada7ed21cc071a)\n\nPetco is clearly aggressively promoting their app which is currently nearly as popular as Chewy's. You can see how their spikes coincide with drops in Chewy's ranking, leading me to believe that Chewy is losing more business than usual to its competition.\n\n* **Profitability**\n\nWhile profitability is less relevant for Chewy, on Q1 earnings they were relatively sanguine about their expected costs for 2021. Since then I expect hiring, material and logistics costs to have gone up quite a bit, which might result in them offering a more pessimistic profitability guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn summary: Chewy has achieved a high PS ratio thanks to its promise of outgrowing its competitors in a market that is already fast-growing in itself.

All assets depreciate without some force moving them up. For stocks and options, it's market price, demand, and company performance.\n\nThe same for houses. Buying a house is absolutely a gamble. You could burn it down. A natural disaster could occur that isn't covered by your home-owners insurance.  The market could take a dump when you have to sell. You could just be bad and not upkeep the structure (I said houses, not land).\n\nIn the end, while depreciation makes options a bit more like gambling, especially for shorts, the difference is that you choose the terms and direction of play. At a casino, each hand has its own probability. If you're not an idiot, you can absolutely buy options against specific securities and with time horizons that VASTLY increase your chances of winning. You can't pay a premium to be part of the next 2 weeks of poker games and choose which one to leave the market on at a casino without any added ante. You can't take the position of the dealer and cut your losses in any game, but you can in the market.\n\nJust calling it gambling is reductive and misses the entire layout of the market, and yes that's relevant to the housing argument. Your definition of gambling is too broad and not well thought out.\n\nAlso you are a depreciating asset, so selling your house to make a profit absolutely has an expiration point.

The largest daily purchase they have ever made, and **after** that purchase they still have a 9.4% premium to NAV. They have enough cash on hand to purchase another 600k+ lbs tomorrow, plus any new issuance. We could see a 1m+ purchase tomorrow. For reference, a 800k lb purchase is \\~4x the annual fuel usage of a 1000MWe power plant.\n\n....\n\n**Sept 15th Update**: A real knock your socks off day today! Spot at $48.55 ($50 ask) with just 100k lbs of buying from SPUT. I thought we would get to 50 by the end of the month, but it looks like it will be end of the week. Unbelievable.\n\n**Sept 16th Update:** Pullback today! Ended with the broader U market down 3%, but SPUT up 4.26%. SPUT purchased a new record of 1.45M pounds of U! Spot price rose to $49.75/$51.00.\n\nWith SPUT, U stockpile, and spot rising it is hard to take a sell-off too seriously. A bit of nibbling above closing prices on several U stocks in after hours. Tomorrow is Quad Witch though, so we'll see what shenanigans that brings.\n\n**Sept 17th Update:** Late again! Big sell-off today across the entire sector (and the broader market). I assume there was lots of profit taking and de-risking as China still hasn't admitted Evergrande is too big to fail.\n\nSpot price rose yet again on Friday to $51.50 ask.

AH mostly green for U, and rather green for index futures. It looks like we should have a better day tomorrow (not hard to do). SPUT finished strong today, spot at $50.25. I bought a few tickers too small to mention today and a lot of SPUT.\n\n**Sept 21st Update**: Spot down to $49.75 today, majority of U stocks modestly green today. Cautiously, it looks the sell-off is over. It would help to have FOMC over tomorrow, and China also comes off of holiday tomorrow so perhaps there would also be positive news there for general sentiment. All in all though, electricity needs to be made, and uranium is how we do it. Miners did get a bit ahead of themselves. SPUT bought 100k lbs.\n\n**Sept 24th Update**: Well, still 40 minutes to close but a doozy of a day. Volume is low-ish, so I assume selling has finished (for now). Spot all the back down to $45, but if it holds there this can start all over with another way of SPUT buying. Hope you all had some protective calls sold.\n\n**Oct 18th Update**: Having a second kid is about 500% more work than one kid. I thought it would only be 300% more. Updates will continue to be very sparse, but I think we all know what direction U is going.\n\nKAP (world's largest miner in Kazakistan) is creating its own physical uranium investment vehicle. They now be free to mine with their right hand and sell to their left without tanking market prices like they have historically done in the past. There is now a country that needs the money that is backing increases to U spot and mining proceeds. We have an actual unofficial cartel forming now. Welcome to UPEC!\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUranium.\n\nSure, there are no flashing LEDs like CRSR adds to all of their products, but that’s because we don’t need it. Uranium already glows in the dark! (see footnote).\n\nMaybe Uranium isn't as sexy as some over-hyped under-developed treadmill with an iPad glued to it that kills babies, and it is lacking in buzzwords like \"cloud data analytics,\" but uranium is dense, clean energy. There is quite literally no other way to support the load required by electrifying the entire transport grid, which makes this the only realistic energy candidate for the immediate future. There are already big incumbents in energy that need to get shouldered aside, so this will be a slower play than the up 50% in a week flavors of the month (which then falls 90%), but this is the real deal. With calls you can still get that 50%, or 500%, but shares will take some time. That said, NXE is up 18.8% in 5 trading sessions, and URA 12.08%. Just barely OTM calls versus last week are up 360% and 500% for NXE ($5 and $4 front month). That's not exactly [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/).\n\nUranium has a serious bull case of ahead of it. A new fund is in town (Sprott) who is buying up all the physical uranium. Get ready to gap up. Yes you have heard some of this before, and I peddled Uranium a full on year ago, but this fund is a market mover and it changes everything.\n\nTLDR, 1) since 2019 supply has been below demand for uranium as the market continues to deal with a supply overhang and over-investment by miners from the previous market cycle. COVID then reduced supply by a further 30% through mine closures that have continued for 2021 and the supply overhang is finally gone. 2) More nuclear reactors are being built worldwide than decommissioned, developing nations have hopped on board the nuclear train, and 3) if any country is serious about getting to carbon neutral then the only realistic avenue is via massive expansion of the nuclear fleet. Lastly, 4) there is a new physical trust, SPUT (Sprott Physical Uranium Trust) busy buying up all of the uranium and driving up the spot price. It’s working.\n\nUranium spot is $34.60 right now, 2007 was $137. That’s a lot of upside baby. Oh, and did I mention that the Uranium market is small? Tiny. Super tiny. WSB could blow this thing up. There isn’t an entire industry of traders, hedgers, and dilettantes (that’s a nice way of saying degenerates) trading U like there are for oil or other commodities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: it begins! Massive gap up today (Uranium spot updates daily, not constantly like oil) from $34.60->$35.65.\n\n**1. The Setup**: Uranium is already on a 5 year trend line of tendies\n\nUranium has been in a bear market since 2007. It started to finally sell through the over supply and over investment of the last market cycle and has been climbing from its 2016 low of $18.50. This was already a 4 year trend line, and then COVID came along.\n\nCOVID changed the uranium market in two main ways. First, it dramatically reduced global supply by about 30% in 2020 and 2021 due to mine closures by many of the majors and juniors. These closures have allowed the sticky overhang from the last decade to finally get put on the spot market as well as mines buying from spot to meet contracts. Second, there appears to be an OPEC+ of uranium forming. Miners, no doubt still traumatized from last time they aggressively expanded productions, are not opening new mines even as spot prices surge. Instead, they continue to provide quarterly guidance that they are operating below capacity for the rest of the year, and are selling old supply. They aren’t formally a cartel like OPEC is, but there seems to be some game theory going on here. It is in the miners' best interest to try to exactly match the demand of U on a global scale and then be able to dictate the price. Since fuel costs are just 2% of the operating costs of a nuclear reactor, utilities can also stomach significant increases in spot prices without effecting their generation rates of \\~ $.02/KwH (as cheap as coal, far below all renewables in pricing).\n\nU is $34.60 as of August 31st close which is 75.24% below its peak in 2007. In a market with all-time highs all over the place, U has a long way to run. What will miner profits be if U hits $100+ again? Massive.\n\n**2. New Demand**: Global demand has outpaced supply\n\nPlanned Reactor Starts in Gross MWe of new capacity (from world-nuclear.org)\n\n* 2021: 5,711\n* 2022: 13,559\n* 2023: 13,276\n* 2024: 7,569\n* 2025: 5,112\n* 2026: 6,997\n* 2027: 4,100\n\nCredit Suisse offers their own global view of supply & demand here. Get your sunglasses on as this assumes the US fleet is shrinking into 2030. That likely won’t be the case. See comments #1 below, automod doesn't like my links.\n\nFirst, if you are from the US then you are likely biased against nuclear. Get over it. The US has a very old fleet and has been periodically retiring plants rather than performing maintenance. I’ll get back to the US later, but the global view is very, very positive. Globally, many developing nations are starting a nuclear fleet. It’s cheap and it doesn’t pollute. India, Slovakia, Belarus, and Pakistan all have new plants started or starting in the next year. France continues to expand and sell energy, while China seems serious about cutting CO2 emissions and is massively expanding their existing fleet, as well as breaking ground on the world’s first SMR earlier this year.\n\nSo back to the USA—the US mostly acts as a drag. A reactor in New York just closed, and others throughout the country are always wavering on the edge of retirement. This is set to change, but it depends upon politics, so we’ll see (and the right likes nuclear too, it’s not just about the left's CO2). The Secretary of Energy is committed to keeping every single US plant operating as it prepares to transition to a fleet of fast breeding, small modular reactors (SMR’s) in the “late 2020s, early 2030s.” (this just means highly fuel efficient with far, far less waste, and reactors the size of a 3-4 story apartment building instead of a city block. Each will power 500,000+ homes, so they can be “close” to cities they power and also reduce infrastructure costs.) She is working with legislatures to allow all currently operating plants to essentially receive carbon credits as an incentive for utilities to keep the plants running and well maintained until the SMR roll-out.\n\nYes, this is a long horizon for the US, but the US is only one part of the uranium market and a very minor part of this bull case. Globally, supply/demand are already tight, and the world fleet is slated to expand. Utilities can see the writing on the wall and will want to start placing orders now for future delivery (spot market for Uranium is quite different from other commodities—purchasing, delivery, enrichment, and feeding take years). You can bet these utilities are looking at supply/demand graphs and already panicking. Spot is going to start gapping up instead of ticking.\n\n**3. Green Energy**: The Elephant in the Room\n\nNuclear power is the greenest scalable energy on the planet. Hydro destroys entire riparian ecosystems, wind and solar are both CO2 heavy in terms of manufacturing and are slow ROI on the carbon expenditure as well as having short functional commercial lifespans, while geothermal is quite literally tied to very specific locations (OK, I don’t know anything about tidal, but other than reading about some plans being nixed by NIMBY Boomers I’m not seeing it either). Most of these renewables are also intermittent, making them very difficult to design a grid around.\n\nThese renewable forms of power generation have another cost: land. Aside from geothermal, these are not power dense generators. You can't put 12,000 acres of wind turbines next to NYC. Here is an article working through the cost in land to electrify just British Colombia’s transport grid. The takeaway is that nuclear wins by a landslide: 2.4 m2/kWh versus solar’s 36.9m2, hydro’s 54 m2, and wind’s 72.1 m2. If you want to electrify the US transport grid then you can either build some nuclear plants, or convert all of Nevada to a single, massive solar farm. I mean, what is Nevada good for anyway?\n\nNumbers on energy density coming from here: damn you automods, see comments for link #2.\n\nThe latest generation of nuclear plants, SMRs, are small and safe. They can be built alongside cities to save CO2 and money that would otherwise go into infrastructure. How many more fires are we going to see every fire season as PG&E and other utilities run millions of miles of hot lines all over the country? This too is a cost of the current way of locating and distributing energy. This all changes with SMRs, and all for the better.\n\nBiden has made some surprisingly strong claims about aiming the US at net zero, and the US is hardly a climate activist country. If this happens in other countries, and perhaps the US, then it means we are looking at hundreds upon hundreds of new plants in the next two decades, not just the few dozen currently in the planning stages over the coming 2020s. This will be the renaissance of nuclear, and it is coming.\n\nThink about it. If there is any chance in hell of reducing carbon emissions, then nuclear is the path forward. Everything else is a half measure.\n\n**4. Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SPUT)**: The T-Rex in the Room\n\nThis is a new fund from an old hand in physical trusts. Sprott’s Physical Uranium Trust (U.U – Canadian listed, NYSE coming in \\~4m) purchases uranium on the spot market and then warehouses it. That’s it, that’s the whole plan. This is meteoric.\n\nAs shares of U.U are issued Sprott takes that money and buys uranium, which increases their NAV. So long as they have a premium to NAV they keep buying. They’ve only been buying physical uranium for two weeks now, but **they’ve already purchased 13.3% of the estimated global uranium production for all of 2021**. Read that sentence again. 20.59m lbs of the projected world supply of 154m lbs. Jesus Christ are these guys a market force to be reckoned with. How is this not illegal? They've only been buying for TWO FUCKING WEEKS.\n\nLook at spot price versus their holdings. They march up and up in tandem. Spot has gone up 7.1% in the last month, with all of those gains coming within days of when Sprott started buying.\n\nSee comment link for google spreadsheet of Sprott and spot rate. #3 in my comment.\n\n**5. There are short sellers here**\n\nSome entities sell naked uranium deliveries. In a market as slow moving and opaque as uranium is this probably seemed like a good idea at the time. How much of a factor would this be? I don't honestly know. Uranium is not like other commodities with all their nifty reporting and data. We'll find out?\n\n**Positions or Ban:** OK, we know you all just skipped to the end anyway\n\nGo long anything uranium.\n\nMiners/Exploration:\n\n* CCJ\n* NXE\n* Use google. Many are too small by marketcap for me to list here, but they are mostly small for a reason (no actual production, waiting on samples, etc)\n* URNM - Miner ETF, but not great spreads for options. Shares only would be my recommendation unless WSB can improve the options liquidity\n* U.U (This is Sprott Physical Uranium Trust. Buy this, but only if Canadian. Imagine what will happen when this gets NYSE listed in 2022!)\n* SRUUF is the US-based OTC ticker for U.U if your brokerage allows you to buy it (Schwab and TDA do, probably others)\n* URA: ETF of major and minor miners, equipment production, all things uranium. Decent option spread.\n\n*Options*:\n\nAs we all know, there are only a few times when dealers work with your play instead of hedging against it, and one of those is when you buy far OTM calls. When you buy a far OTM call the dealer will also purchase or adjust their position matching your direction.\n\nSo, if you are buying calls (I would recommend calls *and* shares) then far OTM calls skew delta in our favor.\n\nThat out of the way, the Uranium market is slow, but Sprotts has started to speed things up.\n\nURA 10/21 $25c is about as high as I would go without going longer dated.\n\nAfter that, March '22 is decently priced, June 2022 $30+ now looking a bit expensive. No doubt you will all ignore this and buy something idiotic like front month $30. Really, don’t do that.\n\nNXE 2/22 or 12/22 $5 or $7. I did a few call debit spreads of buying 12/22 $5, selling $7. Probably should be greedier, but it seems so safe. What could go wrong?\n\n*Shares*:  NXE, URA, and URNM.\n\nMy positions:\n\n* URA & NXE shares (some other too small of marketcap to list)\n* URA 10/21 $25c\n* URA 3/22 $28c\n* URA 6/22 $28c & 30c\n* NXE 9/21 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $5c\n* NXE 12/22 $7c\n\nfootnote: No, uranium does't glow in the dark you ape.

We currently have a total of 82 granted and 67 pending patent applications, including 36 in the U.S. and 113 in 21 other countries around the world. META’s portfolio comprises 46 patent families, from which 28 are granted. These patent families include but are not limited to: large-area holographic filtering, scanning holography, light capture for solar panels, large-area nanopatterning, near-field lithography, plasmonic lithography, transparent metal meshes, lens casting technologies, radio wave imaging, non-invasive glucose sensing, and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n\nThese patent families consist of different types:\n\nDesign patents, that detail the structure of metamaterial and other functional surfaces to manipulate light, electricity and radio waves.\nApplication patents, that explain how our designed structures can address real world problems. These patents cover a wide range of applications, from filtering light, medical sensing, wireless communications, to solar panels, advanced displays, and efficient heat transfer.\nManufacturing and process patents, that describe the basic processes on how these functional structures are manufactured.\nWe have also built a large body of manufacturing know-how: optimized recipes, custom tools and efficient algorithms on scaling up and producing such structures at high volume and low cost.\n\nWe collaborate with universities and other companies to develop joint IP or license already developed IP that requires commercialization.\n\nFinally, we own registered trademarks, which protect our products and services in different markets worldwide. These currently are:\n\nmetaAIR® and metaVISOR® (laser filtering products)\nNANOWEB® (transparent metal mesh)\nRML® (Rolling Mask Lithography – large surface area nanopatterning technique)\nglucoWISE® (non-invasive glucose sensing)\nFeatures of our Intellectual Property\n\nWe develop our IP guided by four core principles:\n\nIP that is unique. We have developed custom processes and intricate know-how that does not exist in the market and is not easily copied.\nIP that can be quickly prototyped. META’s team have backgrounds in advanced optical design and modelling, combined with quick prototyping and manufacturing know-how that remain trade secrets.\nIP that is relevant and commercially viable. We focus on real-world applications, not on academic explorations just for the sake of making proof of concepts.\nIP that is well-protected. We started patenting ideas in 2008, and have invested multi-million-dollars to design, setup and acquire specialized equipment and capabilities.\n\nLithography: A nanopatterned mask that rolls over a soft substrate and imprints a nanostructured surface.\n\nMedical Sensing: Anti-reflection coating for skin, maximizing the signal penetration for improved sensing accuracy.”", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "They’re making materials with properties that do not exist in nature, so yes .
