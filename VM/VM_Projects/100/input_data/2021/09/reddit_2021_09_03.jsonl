For a buyer yes it goes something that has no relation to share market but the company that sold the house is probably listed (its revenue increases); its suppliers get more money (their revenues increase) at the end the employees salaries increase which results in increase in savings. \n\nYou can argue that salaries doesn't increase but then the money will go to the owner of the company who is probably already richer than most and will again save or spent on luxury where the cycle of increased revenue starts again.

The feds are continuing to keep the support in place while the pandemic-pumped, stimulus-pumped assets aren't actually deflating much (except for maybe a stock here or there like Peloton). Meanwhile, capital assets that were deflated during the pandemic are starting to pick up, like industrials, energy, retail, and so on, as the world partially reopens. So that growth is being added on top of the fed-inflated growth from 2020.\n\nSo we have the fed-pumped, stimulus-lifted assets that did well during the pandemic remaining pumped up because the gov won't withdraw support, and we have the real economy assets like industrials and energy starting to pick up, on top of that. And on top of that we have inflation due to the pandemic multiplied by the US trade war vs China (and some other countries) disrupting production and supply chains. Finally, all the attacks on Chinese tech stocks from US officials and from Chinese officials have driven a lot (trillions?) of dollars out of Chinese stocks, in effect blowing a huge amount of liquidity into US investors' hands. \n\nThis is why asset values are so high and growing faster and faster. Yes, it is unstable, and if the money flow out of Chinese stocks doesn't reverse soon, the Fed should probably stop all its asset purchases and start raising interest rates (but it's reluctant to do that because its money-supply-oriented stimulus only really helped corporations, banks and investors and not regular people so much, and so we're at risk of stagflation).", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Just flip your screen.

{"title": "Iron Condor Basics for beginners", "selftext": "When most people think about stock options, they think about calls and puts. Calls, profit when the stock goes up, and puts profit when the stock goes down, pretty simple stuff. The problem with calls and puts is that there something called *time decay*. Time decay makes your calls and puts slowly loose money; at first. Time decay starts ramping up the closer you get to expiration and if your options is out the money, you should probably start sending out job applications. Even if the stock goes up, if it doesn't go up enough, your contract **will** expire worthless.\n\nNow, lets talk about how you can make money off of time decay. There are many ways to do this, such as selling calls, selling puts, spreads, pmcc and much, much more. As this post is about iron condors, lets talk about how you can make consistent, high probability profit if you do them correctly.\n\n***What is an Iron Condor?***\n\nAn iron condor is technically two spreads, a call and a put spread. It profits on the stock having no movement or very little movement. Let me just get this straight, **DON'T PLAY IRON CONDORS ON TSLA OR ANY VOLATILE STOCKS**, just don't. This is a strategy meant for stocks that don't move much, such as ETF's or just companies who have slow, consistent growth. One really good one that I just found today is ***IWM***\\*.\\*\n\nThere are two types or iron condors you can do, ones that have close expiration dates, 1-7 days, and ones that have long expiration dates, such as 30-45 days. you could play iron condors on times between this, but I personally like using iron condors a couple days before exp, or a 30-45 days. You are making money of ***time***, so it's better to have longer out expiration's.\n\n**How to open an Iron Condor?**\n\nTo open an IC, your going to have to buy a call, sell a call, buy a put, and sell a put. Instead of just telling you how to do it, let me show you.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5l2kxdt44dl71.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=6083512de8de0dfeaae1f4ba765bb68af8be0306\n\nThis is what an Iron Condor looks like. As you can see, it's a 4 option order. If you are doing this on robinhood, it will tell you if it's an iron condor; if it doesn't you did something wrong. Okay so now let's explain what were looking at. First off on the call side we're buying a $240 call. Right under, we're going to sell a $239 Call. This by itself makes a call credit spread; so if the stock stays below $239, we make max profit. Iron Condors also have put spreads; we bought the $210 Put and sold the $211 Put right above it. Make sure both sell calls/puts are facing the stocks current share price; idk if that makes sense it's just how I remember how to do them. So now, we also made a put credit spread; if the stock stays above $210, we make max profit. Both of these trades are pretty good, but we're only getting paid $0.13 in credit for the put spread, and $0.20 for the call spread. We have to offset $100 as collateral for this trade, as the difference in the strike prices multiplied by 100 is the collateral. However, we got paid $20/$13 in credit respectively, Making our max loss $80/$87. Well you might be wondering, how can we make more off this trade? ***BY PUTTING THEM BOTH TOGETHER.*** *If you open the put credit spread and the call credit spread you end up making an iron condor. Now as you guys can see, were getting a $32 credit off of $100, much better than $13 or $20 respectively. Our breakevens are $210 and $239, if the stock stays between that amount, you make max profit. For every cent difference, up or down, you loose one dollar of max profit.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo all you need the stock to do is to stay between those number. IWM, the stock we chose for this example, doesn't really move much making this a very high probability trade. It expires on 10/15, like 42 days untill then. Every day that passes, your going to make more money on time decay. And that's the basics of an Iron Condor. I actually did this trade today, seven of them perhaps. We'll see how well it works :)\n\nEDIT: it’s always better to close at 50% profit on the 30-45DTE IC, as the risk to profit ratio starts to decrease and it’s better to just take profit and open a new condor for a latter date\n\nedit 2: this post is doing really good, do you guys want me to make a video?", "id": "phf284", "created_utc": 1630707187.0, "score": 426, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "Wings are very narrow in this setup.

{"title": "A Lab of Rockets (supplement to prior DD on RKLB) 🚀 🥼", "selftext": "This is an unplanned supplement to my prior DD on the eve of Rocket Lab’s de-spac. \n\nI had dozens of comments listing key points/catalysts that I had initially missed, because I was keen on being the first to post a legal DD about rocket lab (SPACs aren’t allowed so when I first posted it months ago, it was taken down). In addition, there has been interesting news regarding the space launch industry as a whole, specifically with respect to satellite constellation launches for providing greater accessibility to affordable high bandwidth internet, all over the world (yay), and real-time global surveillance via satellites with 50cm camera precision (kinda & oh no).\n\nNews\n1. Amazon Project Kuiper 🔥 - Amazon had announced its own internet satellite constellation project to launch 3k satellites by 2026-2029. Initial 6 or 9 flights assigned to ULA. RKLB’s constellation supporting rocket, Neutron, is set to be ready to launch in 2024, ready in time to *maybe* capture some business from Amazon IN ADDITION to all of the ISPs that are going to be banging launch providers doors down, to not get left out of the next great revolution in global internet coverage. \n2. RKLB’s space systems business 👀 - RKLB just announced it had signed a deal to supply reaction wheels “for a number of undisclosed satellite constellations.” AFAIK satellites need 3 reaction wheels to control their orientation on all 3 axes (keeping a 4th as backup). Their production facility at initial capacity will output 2000 a year. 2000 / 4 == 500 satellites a year they are expecting to provision. For reference they’ve only launched 100 satellites themselves so far.\n3. Astra (ASTR) 😪 - had 2 failed launches last weekend in a row, still haven’t made it to orbit, still valued at about 1/2 that of rocket lab (what is wrong with this market). Launch reliability should carry a premium, rocket lab has a proven track record of launch reliability.\n4. Firefly (private) 😪 - watching their livestream of launch right now, and it’s not going too well (called an abort). But we’ll see how it goes…\n\nSome Key Upcoming Events\n1. September 8, Earnings 🍿 - likely will hear status updates regarding larger neutron rocket, as well as their space systems business (please tell us about the contracts regarding reaction wheels mentioned above).\n2. Lunar Mission 2021 (probably Q4) 🌝 - do I even have to say anything? What other space startup is set to fly to the moon this year, for NASA? What doors will this open for them 🚪?\n3. September-October, Back to back to back launches for global surveillance company Black Sky 👀 - this is very interesting as rocket lab has never turned around rockets this fast before. Demonstrating extremely rapid launch cadence will be proving to customer that they can schedule launch on demand essentially. In months, eventually weeks but not years. I expect to also see rocket lab demonstrate reusability of their electron rockets, by catching some with a helicopter (not joking) 🚁.\n\nSummary:\n1. Rocket lab is in a much better position than other space startups that are either still in theoretical phase (never launched), and those that are trying to launch but just can’t seem to get their rockets flying in the proper direction (Astra).\n2. Entrance of tech giants and ISP heavy weights into satellite constellation business is evidence that we are on the brink of a satellite launching party (from all ISPs to avoid getting amazoned, and want to keep their consistently high cash flow business models: Verizon, AT&T, etc.). From all the launches, the planet might heat up a few degrees 😓.\n3. Their neutron rocket is being developed at the right time to compete with SpaceX for launch contracts for such constellations (I also really doubt any one launch provider has the bandwidth to take all the contracts).\n4. Their space systems business (reaction wheels for one), will be a nice revenue stream, even for the satellites that they don’t launch themselves, yet still develop and produce key parts of.\n\nPositions/Disclosure: I have a lot of shares\n\nEdit: Firefly’s launch just blew up 💥\n\nEdit 2: Rocket Lab successfully catching rocket with helicopter https://youtu.be/HOnNYWu6onU\n\nEdit 3: founder & CEO Peter Beck on what it takes to succeed in this industry go to 4:20 mark, you won’t be disappointed, (https://youtu.be/8ZMSG386dQw) hint ⚽️\n\nEdit 4: founder & CEO Peter Beck eating a hat, clearly to advance rocket lab’s space program (https://youtu.be/Rafa_WBFIyE)", "id": "pgv4bi", "created_utc": 1630632206.0, "score": 1477, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 133, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|102|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mff22d/rocket_lab_vacq/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mff6q9/rocket_lab/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4mvjg/amzn_and_open_a_case_for_bringing_the_real_estate/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxhq0z/coursera_gang_rise_up_cour/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pb2qes/rocket_lab_rklb/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mff5sz/rocket_lab/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Big fan of Rocket Lab. 👍", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "im all in , yoloing my life savings 🚀🚀🍗🍗", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "I yolo'ed all my savings and cash lol", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Thoughts on RKLB since posting this ?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Continue buying all shares", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Rklb has big pp energy", "score": 65, "replies": []}, {"body": "Update: firefly’s launch just blew up.
