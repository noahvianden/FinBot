{"title": "5 Stocks for the rest of your life", "selftext": "If you had to pick only 5 stocks to trade for the rest of your life based in what you know now, what would they be?\nMeaning you can only buy and sell those only.\n\nNo Index funds, no ETFs, no mutual funds. Single stocks only.\n\nMine are:\n\nMSFT- My favorite tech stock by far. In the long term always seems to keep up with the pace of new tech and has solid workforce and at least since they dropped Balmer, management is on point. (Edited for spelling)\n\nAMZN- Absolute monster. Hard to not want it in my line up. They will continue to grow and buy up/absorb new tech and not afraid to buy up the little guy to increase their market share.\n\nAMD- I like them for the fact that their tech has been setting the bar as of late. While Intel or Nvidia might be bigger and have more market share, i think AMD has more potential over a long term.\n\nHD- I like the grasp on the non tech market they have. They do well during economic growth. They sustain during economic lulls. And even though I'm a Lowes guy, they are the workhorse in household consumer goods and building materials.\n\nBA- Chose this over an airline because it moves with the same news, but is tied in closely with US Military spending and  will sustain over times of peace and war.\n\nNote: Honestly i invest 70ish% in funds. And only about 25% of my portfolio is in blue chips.

And yes, there will be porn. \n\n* **Second, wearable, cloud-based healthcare**. 3 years from now your Apple watch is going to be a much more accurate medical diagnostic machine. It will be constantly monitoring your blood pressure, glucose level, temperature, oxygen level etc. 5 years from now doctors will be relying on this information for many diagnostics (think if Apple purchased Teladoc). 10 years from now all that data your watch is collecting on you will be easily analyzed by powerful AI cloud doctors that will customize medicine for you and predict and prevent diseases before they happen. 15 years from now the AI doctors will upload your data to Moderna and they will develop a customized vaccine for Covid3000 and that vaccine will be delivered to you via your Apple wearable.\n\nApple is uniquely qualified to become a world leader in these two fields due to their large cash reserve, dominant position in phones and wearables, customer loyalty, and sterling brand reputation (wearable healthcare isn't something you would trust to some no-name Chinese knock-off brand).", "score": -1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol no shit.

Not so much because they suck, but rather because they reached an evolutionary peak. Consider MagSafe, it's a far superior technology to EVERYTHING in the PC space. But once you've made the innovation, how do you improve upon it? Well, it turns out you really can't make the same gains, everything becomes marginal improvements until finally the company decides to remove innovation for the sake of change and improvement of profitability. Customers be damned.\n\nBut the customers didn't care quite enough to leave for alternatives. Quite frankly, all of the alternatives suck!\n\nConsider the iPhone. It was a breakthrough product culminating in the iPhone 4 (the best-engineered) and the iPhone 5 (pinnacle of usability compared to previous models). Later generations only improved marginally, and even that is debatable. Ultimately they became more fragile and more expensive, for not that much more improvement in terms of usability. The iPhone X was the next hotness, a return to what made the iPhone great. But that was still not enough to convince me to scrap my 5s. Are the marginal gains and inflated prices worth it? Again, the alternative is decisively worse for Apple power-users or people who have lots of Apple gear.\n\nBut alternatives are getting marginally better over time to close the gap. They aren't nearly as innovative in the sort of real-use way that Apple was in the 90's and 00's, but they suck less than they used to. For me, nothing beats the old Macs, but I almost bought a Razer because I needed an upgrade and it hit all the right features that were non-negotiable and had a lot of things I really wanted. Ultimately I just couldn't get a guarantee that it would be functionally better than my old Mac without actually using one for myself. The touchpad being the real kicker, nothing even comes close to Apple in that regard.\n\nApple has a serious problem with innovation in general, it's not something you can crank out at industrial scale. That's just not how inspiration works. To me, Apple has nowhere to go but down because they have stagnated and can't work themselves out of that situation. They really do need something new, fresh, and exciting; world-changing technology we've never seen before. That's how they retain their edge. Otherwise they are just a dinosaur, and I'd rather throw money at Microsoft.\n\nService revenue can only last as long as you retain customers. Customers are becoming more conscious and can't or won't stay in the ecosystem indefinitely without compelling reason to do so. Competitors have everything to win and Apple has everything to lose without an edge. Apple has some edge left, I'm probably going to buy an M1, but I'm not interested in their phones or tablets or music or cars. It's just a computer company to me that happens to make laptops that are the most functional. When PC manufacturers get their shit together in the ARM space by ditching UEFI/uboot they'll thrive.\n\nThen all Apple will have left is the superior touchpad. And when that day comes and goes I'll wave goodbye to my Macbooks. I'll probably keep my Mac Pro just because it's a dual-Xeon workhorse, but eventually it'll also get replaced by some superior AMD build.\n\nThis is only a segment of their revenue stream, but it's what got them to where they are. Take that away and you can say goodbye to half their market cap. Apple is just not that impressive, and it would really cast a massive shadow to lose the computing edge. Apple products are supposed to be about function dictating form (bad form inherently implies bad functionality, fyi), not the other way around, and above all else they should be more useful and usable than the competition.

{"title": "Should you follow insider transactions? - I analyzed 4000+ insider trades and benchmarked the return against S&P 500. Here are the results!", "selftext": "There is an old saying on Wall Street.\n\n>There are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.\n\nIf you think about it, you can sell stocks for any number of reasons - downpayment for a house, a medical emergency, or just plain profit booking. But when you are using your hard-earned money to purchase a stock, there is only one reason. You expect the stock price to go up!\n\nIt’s not a hard stretch to imagine that company insiders who are in high-ranking positions (CXO’s, VP’s, Presidents, etc.) would have a better understanding of the company and its expected future performance than any financial analysts out there who are just working with publically available data. So if these well-informed insiders are making significant stock purchases, does that mean they expect the stock price to shoot up soon?\n\nIn this week’s analysis let’s put this to the test. **Can you beat the market if you follow the stock purchases made by company insiders?**\n\n___\n\n**Data**\n\nThe data for this analysis was taken from **openinsider.com**\n\nit’s a free-to-use website that tracks all the trades reported on SEC Form 4 \\[1\\]. While there are a lot of transactions that are reported daily to the SEC, I kept the following conditions to reduce noise in the data.\n\n* Only transactions done by CXO’s, VP’s and Presidents (people who have a significant view of the company strategy and operations) are considered.\n* A minimum transaction value of 100K\n* The transaction should be purchase (Not a grant, gift, or purchase due to options expiration)\n\nThe financial data used in the analysis is obtained from Yahoo Finance.\n\n___\n\n**Analysis**\n\nFor all the transactions, I calculated the stock price change across different time periods (One Week, 1-Month, 3-Months, 6 Months & 1 Year) and then benchmarked the returns against S&P500 over the same time period.\n\nMy hypothesis for choosing different time periods was to understand at what point would you generate the maximum alpha (if we realize any) over the benchmark. All the results are checked for outliers so that one or two stocks are not biasing the whole result.\n\n___\n\n **Results** \n\n**Return Comparison - Companies with Insider Buying vs SPY**\n\n|Time Period|Insider Purchase Stock Returns|S&P 500 Returns|Alpha|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1-Week|1.9%|\\-0.3%|2.1%|\n|1-Month|3.6%|2.0%|1.6%|\n|3-Months|11.3%|6.6%|4.7%|\n|6-Months|17.0%|11.9%|5.1%|\n|1-Year|39.7%|22.1%|17.6%|\n\nSurprisingly, if you had followed the insider purchases, you would have beaten SPY across all 5 different timeframes. The alpha generated would also have increased with increasing timeframe with the insider purchase trades beating the S&P500 by a whopping 17.6% over the period of one year.\n\nI have kept 1-year timeframe as my limit mainly due to two reasons. First, I started the analysis for identifying short-term plays, and secondly, given our entire dataset is over the last 4 years, anything more than 1 year would not have data for a significant chunk of our population which can affect the analysis.\n\n___ \n\n**Limitations to the Analysis**\n\nThere are some limitations to the above analysis that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the trades.\n\n* The data I collected has a lot of small-cap companies which are inherently more risky than a large-cap index like S&P500. Given our returns are not risk-adjusted, the alpha we are seeing here might just be due to the higher risk you are taking on the trades \\[2\\]\n* The analysis is limited to the last 4 years of data during which the markets were predominantly in a bull run (except the Covid-19 crash)\n* Finally, this assumes that you will buy an equal amount of stock whenever a company insider does a trade which might not be practical given our inherent biases and apprehensions\\[3\\]\n\n___\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUsually, insider purchases are used to gauge the overall market sentiment. A very high proportion of sells over buys signify that insiders are losing confidence in the stock/industry and it’s time to get out of that market.\n\nThis analysis shows that the individual trades can be used for identifying stocks that are worth buying by analyzing the insider purchase patterns. This should be just considered as a primer into the topic as SEC Form 4 has a treasure trove of information \\[4\\].\n\nYou may or may not implement this strategy based on your investment style. But at the very least, you should check for the insider transaction pattern before investing in a particular security!\n\nGoogle Sheet containing all the data used for analysis: [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Cxj5FDxbCikjuS4w14PXnm2QDwIxHGaJANPjjF-R6wA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nUntil next week…\n\n___  \n\n**Footnotes and Existing Research**\n\n\\[1\\] SEC Form 4 is what an insider file when he/she makes a transaction. It’s expected to be filed within 2 days, but I observed more delay than that in many cases. For the purpose of this analysis, I have considered transactions that were reported no later than 10 days.\n\n\\[2\\] [Estimating the Returns to Insider Trading: A Performance-Evaluation Perspective](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/tprrestat/v_3a85_3ay_3a2003_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a453-471.htm) : The study published by Leslie A. Jeng and Richard Zeckhauser of Harvard found that insider purchases beat the market by 11.2% per year. Even after adjusting for the risk using the CAPM model, the returns beat the market by 8.5%\n\n\\[3\\] Very few people have the ability to keep their emotions away from the trades when a significant chunk of their money is at stake.\n\n\\[4\\] You can filter for the role of the insider (for eg, if you want to track only the CEO purchase/sales), industry, percentage ownership change, the current value of stock owned, etc. There are thousands of permutations in which you can do this analysis to find some alpha.\n\n\\[5\\] Multiple research papers over the last 3-4 decades \\[[eg.1](https://jbepnet.com/journals/Vol_4_No_3_September_2017/5.pdf), [eg.2](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/the-insider-trading-anomaly-recent-academic-studies-591/)\\] have shown that insider purchases significantly outperformed the market", "id": "puhzzv", "created_utc": 1632483775.0, "score": 1357, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "Can we get an ETF that mirrors the insider trading?", "score": 508, "replies": [{"body": "Sure!

ADRs. There is nothing special here another than that ADRs are an instrument that allow foreign equities to be traded on US exchanges by having a issuer hold the actual shares in question. There are many ADRs and most of them aren't even Chinese. If you buy BP or RCEHY, etc which are UK listed companies on NYSE you are buying an ADR.\n\nADRs have issuers, these are large financial entities that hold the shares on behalf of the ADR owners. In BABA case this is Citibank.\n\nOk, so ADRs aren't scary at all. The thing you are really worried about but don't know the name of is VIE, or Variable Interest Entity.\n\nVIEs look scary and in the classical sense do carry some risk because they were developed explicitly to enable investment in areas the Chinese government has yet to approve (or has explicitly disallowed) foreign investment. They were first used by the Chinese telecom companies, namely China Telecom to expand their network and grow rapidly despite China banning direct foreign investment in telecommunications infrastructure. \n\nSo VIEs are definitely a gray area but there are some very important factors to take into consideration when looking at BABA in particular.\n\nFirstly the Caymans holding company isn't just some empty shell company as FUDsters would have you believe. It actually wholy owns the vast majority of the ~600+ entities that make up Alibaba, including all of it's non-China assets (Lazada, etc) and the vast majority of it's on-shore assets (Taobao, TMall, etc).\n\nHowever some parts of Alibaba's business are under investment restrictions, either due to holding sensitive licenses or IP. These portions of the business have VIE contracts with the Caymans holding company and sub-license the IP and licenses etc to the actual profit generating entities.\n\nSo in effect buy buying HK listed shares OR the NYSE ADR you have direct equity ownership in about 80% of the Alibaba entities (which account for about 99.99% of the profit) with the remaining 20% being controlled via VIE.\n\nAs for VIE legality itself there has been a lot of indications recently that VIE will either be moved out of the gray and regulated directly by Chinese authorities (see the new data security review mandate for foriegn listings) and the recent Shanghai IPO of Megvii which uses a VIE structure.\n\nSo yeah, VIE FUD is a complete nothing-burger at this point unless soemthing -very- drastically changes.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Whoa.

The only thing they are ahead on by any kind of significant amount is having everything in one package. The Porsche Taycan is within spitting distance as an electric vehicle. Waymo has better actual FSD and has proven that they can actually achieve L5. Their charging network is significantly better but Elon has also made comments about opening it up to everyone.

If Tesla was at L3/L4/L5 while everyone else was at L2, that would be a huge advantage. Toyota and VW also have 100x the vehicles on the road as Tesla. That means they can collect the amount of data in 1 year that Tesla can collect in 10.

The most batteries that are produced the farther the costs are likely to go down as the manufacturers gain more experience and learn how to better improve their products. \n\n> Also, I think the stock is really high due to Elon Musk and young adults worshipping him like he’s some sort of prophet. That whole visiting space etc is so far away, Tesla is a $200 stock, way overvalued.\n\nThe cool factor of Musk, and his proven record at his companies definitely helps increase their stock price. But despite it's very high valuation today that doesn't mean that the company is going to fail and get beaten out by the competition. \n\nYou're clearly familiar with a lot of the Tesla bear case talking points. However I'd suggest looking into some of the long term Tesla growth projections if you want to understand the stock. While it might sound outrageous when you read a headline that says \"Tesla will sell over ten million vehicles a year in 2030\", you should listen to why they think this kind of growth is doable, and how they think they can get there overtime.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "lol i would bet my first born this does NOT happen.

You'll learn what you need in a relationship, how to be a better partner, and find a better match in the long run, which is absolutely key to financial, career, and emotional success in the rest of your life.\n\n7) if it were me I'd pay down the student loans. Maybe not aggressively if the interest rate isn't bad, but being free of debt like that can make it a lot easier to go in for debt like a mortgage or investing on margin later if the right opportunity comes. I don't just mean easier to get the loan, I also mean easier to feel good about the level of debt you're carrying so it doesn't stress you out.\n\nBottom line: Keep your eye on achieving financial success for sure, but don't get so singularly focused on it that you miss the other great stuff in life.
