Elizabeth Warren Asks Federal Reserve To Ban Its Leaders From Trading Stocks\nMentioned:\tAAPL AMZN BABA CVX GE\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has called on the 12 regional presidents of the Federal Reserve System to enact new rules to prevent their leaders from individual stock trading.\n\nWhat Happened: Warren, who is the chairwoman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Policy, made her request following news reports that Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren actively traded stocks and other investments during 2020.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Kaplan made multiple stock trades of more than $1 million each involving shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -ADR (NYSE: BABA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), while Rosengren focused his trades on real estate-related securities.\n\nWarren pointed out that although Kaplan and Rosengren pledged to sell their individual stock holdings and no longer trade individual stocks, their actions created conflicts of interest and potential self-dealing.\n\n'This controversy over asset trading by high-level Fed personnel highlights why it is necessary to ban ownership and trading of individual stocks by senior officials who are supposed to serve the public interest,' Warren stated. 'Regional Fed leaders must ban the ownership and trading of individual stocks by senior officials, and impose strong and enforceable ethics and financial conflicts of interest rules for themselves and their staff to restore public trust.'\n\nRelated Link: Sen. Elizabeth Warren Asks Federal Reserve To Break Up Wells Fargo\n\nWhat Else Happened: Warren also raised attention to her proposed Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act, which she said was designed to strengthen conflict of interest and recusal requirements of government officials by banning individual stock ownership by members of Congress, senior congressional staff, federal judges, members of the presidential cabinet, White House staff and other senior agency officials while they are in office.\n\nWarren's legislation also included provisions to prevent federal government officials from holding or trading stock in companies that could influence their agency, department or actions. It also requires senior government officials and White House staff to divest from privately owned assets that could present conflicts, including large companies and commercial real estate.\n\nWarren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in 2018 without co-sponsors and was never acted upon by the Senate. She reintroduced the legislation in 2020, again without co-sponsors, and the bill was referred to the Senate Finance Committee but has yet to be brought up for consideration.\n\nPhoto: Gage Skidmore / Flickr Creative Commons.\n\n© 2021 Benzinga.com.

You can make this more intuitive by considering a thicker cable to be equivalent to multiple individual cables.  If you put a bunch of resistive elements in parallel, then the overall resistance goes down.  A lot.\n\nThere are a few other things to consider.\n\n1. Higher voltage means less current for the same amount of power, so if the cables carry higher voltage they don't need to be as thick.  This probably isn't it.  Well, at home anyway.  In the field, Tesla chargers may very well be higher voltage and that'd be part of the answer.  At home, they'd probably both be 220V.  It'd be dumb to be anything else (for generalized solutions).\n2. There's a lot of variation with wiring insulation and strand gauge.  If a cable is flexible, it's got to be a stranded cable.. made up of a whole lot of higher gauge (smaller diameter) bare wire.  Also, amount and type of insulation can play a big role in how thick and flexible a cable is.\n3. Engineers may design things to different specs.  The Tesla cable has always struck me as very minimalist.  The thicker cables are probably very conservatively specified.  It's also possible that Tesla, having complete control of the car side of the charging as well, is more free to make compromises (higher cable voltage drop, etc) and know that the car will be fine with it.

Those are usually for things like data or legacy charging infrastructure, etc.\n\nA Tesla charging plug is mostly those two big connectors and there's only a couple other small pins and they're tucked in pretty tightly. Tesla doesn't have to worry about legacy connectors and they didn't do something like have twice as many connectors so they could have separate DC and AC charging. \n\nBut the real limiting factor for charging is the cable, not the plug.

Would love to get feedback.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "All, Please see my spreadsheet at this link - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Se8kfZxEkfIsqGZ9Z4edV3CLgst0TF7MgYuVQ5prXA4/edit#gid=1686468184](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Se8kfZxEkfIsqGZ9Z4edV3CLgst0TF7MgYuVQ5prXA4/edit#gid=1686468184).  I included 4 of my trades, 3 that worked and one that did not. I also included images of trades in each trade in additional tabs to give you an idea of adjustments. As you can see adjustments have been key.  More on that later. You might want to look at the actual charts for those trades over that time period to get an idea of why I adjusted since I did not track the price of the underlying at that time in my spreadsheet (sorry!). \n\nSome thoughts: \n\n\\- I do not recommend ICs for most people. They require a lot of adjustments and monitoring. While many are attracted to the fact that you can't lose on both sides, if the stock does move violently on any side, the potential for loss is high. My IC portfolio takes up less than 2% of all investments/trades in equity markets. \n\n\\- My spreadsheet does not show how I pick the trade, only how I evaluate it and track the ones I choose to do. Some thoughts on the trades are below.\n\n\\- Underlying  - I pick stocks or indices that are mostly above 100, have high options volume and OI, trade within a range already, and no earnings or big things coming up. Sometimes I do try to catch the downdrift after earnings, but not a must. I tend to do ICs on the same stocks repeatedly.  I look at some very basic trends but do not use any TA concepts religiously. I also do not try to look at how high the IV is and how it can come down - not that I disagree or anything, just that I have not figured an edge with that in my trading plan. This is purely theta. I tend to have constant trades in SPX and RUT. I do think that I have a big correlation risk among my underlyings and I need to fix it. \n\n\\- Strikes/Span, etc.  - I tend to pick the short strikes that are 16% probability of expiration ITM or so, but I am trying to cut my risk and go for lesser prob recently.  Span - I prefer a width of 5 or more since smaller widths cost a lot in commissions with all the adjustments.  I tend to pick 35+ DTE. \n\n\\- Close - I close 10-14 days before DTE at 50% profit with limit orders. One of my biggest changes to help make this work (apart from adjustments) is not staying too long. I might also exit even sooner if the profit is being achieved faster than time decay. You can use the last column to check if exiting at the current price is worthwhile. \n\n\\- Adjustments - In his book on ICs, Michael Hanania Benklifa says that once you are in an IC trade, you trade the math. That is mostly true for me. Once I am in the trade, I keep an eye on the underlying, but when one side looks like it might be tested, I check the price on the untested side. If I can buy it back at around 20% of the original credit (see my final expectation is to buy back at 25% - half of 50%), I buy it back. I do this proactively and once the stock pulls back a bit toward the untested side, I sell another spread on that side using the same 16% prob ITM rule or even a little lower. You can see this in my first 3 trades in the sheet. This can lead to you padding your premium but you need to be careful about narrowing profit zone. But, sometimes, the stock never come back and I exit the trade. As you can see, I lost on AMC that time (I know many here might be aghast at me doing this on AMC, but that is a different conversation). Adjustments are primarily to preserve capital, but I am opportunistic to add to premium as well.  I do adjustments when they are the best course of action, not to win in all trades. The number of adjustments I have done before on that trade is immaterial to me as long as my math works out. I have realized that some of my adjustments have helped increase premium and led to easier exits. \n\n\\- Spreadsheet things: a) columns H to Q show the premiums for the open, adjustments and close b) columns S to AA are the corresponding legs c) some might be thrown my formulas for how I calculate return % - since the premium is captured first I think this is the right formula, but not a big change. d) the last 3 columns are to test exits.

This means that you have a better break even price on your contested side as the break even price is the sold leg + or - minus the credit receivers depending on whether or not it’s the call or put side. \n\nFor example if apple goes to 160 the put credit spread will approach worthless a lot quicker as the value of that spread diminishes very quickly. However the price of the call credit spread will be causing a net loss currently as the you become more delta negative as the price increases(aka being short) and vice versa if the price falls. So you will more than likely be at a net loss currently assuming theta decay hasn’t occurred much. However if you now close the put side and sell the $150 put and buy the $145 put you would have brought in a larger profit assuming the stock stays between your legs. Also your new breakeven on the call side is $160+the credit received when you initially opened the iron condor+ the new credit from rolling the put side. \n\nAdditionally your max loss is diminished as the max loss is the length of the wings-all the credit received.\n\nSo the reason why your probability of profit is much higher is because you’re banking profit when you roll, the breakevens are a lot better despite the implied move being smaller due to time passing and maybe some contractions in IV. Additionally your expected profit per trade in the long run increases as your credit goes higher which will reduce your max loss potential and increase your max gain potential", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ah I got it!

And it's mine, by the way.\n\nKey volume zones are at 120 to 127.  No one gives a fuck about that. The key volume zone on the downside is 133.6 to 135 ish.\n\nThen you have to go all the way up to 147.25 to 150.25 and we DO  give a fuck about that particular volume zone.\n\nOk, \n     14 th of July it approached the 150 ish zone for the first time, and over the next 45 days it tried to breach 150 a good bunch of times,  many many times, minorly even breaking out for a day or two on the 16 th of August and 23rd of August.\n\nThe ONE time it broke clean was on 30 the of August, and eventually came back for a REAL retest last Friday, the 10th of Sept. (I wrote something in r/options and as a result actually wrote a 150 call and 157.5 (less liquid strike, stay away) for the 10th of Sept). \n\nLast four days since Monday you have had two red days and a couple of green stars. With Tuesday being the most volatile day totalling a huge 5 points (that's a joke).\n\nSo right here, RIGHT NOW, a tug of war is ensuing with seemingly the bulls losing.\n\nWhy do I say that ? Because these kind of retests when they have some bullish pop to them, rebound decisively and usually in two days, as all the shorts run for cover, quickly reversing their trades and buying back the market, and new bulls joining, not to mention the Bulls that took profits, also rejoining. Almost triple pressure. Dudes are NOT reinitiating shorts at this level after that strong bullish break on the 30th of August. \n\n** Once you are a seller in the market, you automatically become a buyer and vice versa.\n\nBUT that has not happened. So I would wait a day or two and watch the break of the 13th's (Mondays) high of 151.42, before getting bullish.\n\nWith the way volume was almost non existent at the high of 157.04 on the 8th of Sept (it was smacked downwards like a termite), shows clear price rejection at that level. Meaning Dudes WERE ready to short at 155, 156, 157 and were ready to throw down market orders to do that. \n\nHow does this affect you, the Condor seller ?\n\nWell for one, you can wait Friday out and write it on Monday, (you obviously avoid the weekend effect) and you get to see how this tug of war plays out.\n\nBECAUSE if it breaks Wednesdays (yesterday's) low of 146.37, THEN you can write the 155 160 instead on the call side.\nI think they cost,  1.78 and 0.83, netting you the 0.95 !!! INSTEAD.  Fuck the 60's.\n\nA days patience.\n\nThe bell curve is the bell curve is Gauss is brilliance. But a perspective on supply and demand is what we can add that can give us a further edge as an everyday trader.\n\nHaving said that, everything is a trade. My style is to read the right side of thr chart,.not ruminate about the left side (even though it looks like i did that, I   am really trying to  anticipate and see if we can grab a real good credit and Make a TRADERS stand.)\n\nPut side looks fine.\n\nAlthough I would get alert at the downside break of 142.54 on 28th of July (and the 25 EMA)  because there is literally NO volume supporting it till 133 to 127, which puts you in a tough spot. Do not hesitate either following the market  and closing your winning call spread (booking a profit) and reinitiating one at say 150 155 (taking in more credit and reducing exposure)  OR closing the put side altogether.  \n\nNotice that's a big OR in the middle, not an AND, although you can always bail out, but that kind of trepidation is not called for yet.\n\nP.s.  don't try this if you  are a set it and forget it type. Matter of fact, don't even read anything I write. But if you have some experience adjusting condors, then this a whole nickels worth of possibly profitable advice for you. Rest is the turn of the coin son, don't sweat it.\n\nIron condors are the most easily adjusted strategy. And never adjust OUT, no matter what, never prolong the agony, take a loss and high five the McDonald's guy on the way home.\n\nEVERYTHING i wrote is a REACTION to a condition. We are traders, not tarot card readers.  We REACT. We  React, adjust, work hard, that is trading. Setting and forgetting is for the barbeque discussions, it dosent count as trading.\n\nWe are like Bruce Lee, \"like water\" (you have to say that the way Lee says it).\n\nAmd whenever you are in doubt,  close half your position you will GUARANTEED feel better.\n\n\"I be bumpin Niggers like Al Capone, Crazy air freshener Who needs cologne.\".\n\n LL  1991.\n\n\nEdit.  The basis of this play, (to earn more credit on the call side), is when a price consistently fights in a zone for two months in a row (the level around 150) and makes a defining break, the first retest is the KEY retest. Amd that too on the most liquid stock in the world.  So bottom line your call side is not where i fear currently (that could change), it's the bottom you have to think about, but it's not that tough  a spot, all in all you have a decent trade IF you are ready to adjust and roll with the punches.\n\nAll the best.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Where did *you* learn to trade?

I write like that always, Long. I can only answer, if I can put everything down, a 0 or a 1, no half measures. That's why I only answer one or two  questions a week, where I'm over 90 percent sure and I really want to answer. I can't leave the two liners. (Some people can do that  and do so very well, but it takes a certain talent to express yourself in four lines, which I lack).\n\nYou have a got a good attitude about taking advice. Leaving all doors open and having some patience.\n\nBut at the end of the day, you are the Captain of your ship, and yours wlll be the play that you are mentally at piece with, this matters a lot when putting on a trade, you can adjust and go thru the 28 days in peace and usually successfully, win or lose. The process is important, not the result. That will take care of itself as you put the trades in over the months and years.\n\nHavjng said that, the play I suggested is $278 risked to win $222. At a rate of 57.8 percent (those are max profits, but Condor maxes are pretty attainable for obvious reasons, not like iron fly's). It's an aggressive condor. (These prices are gonna change, but the idea is important).\n\nThe key to understanding the trade, is the ultimate most important decision YOU WILL MAKE is the actual number of contracts you put on, so keeping that in mind, 57.8 percent is actually a low percentage for a condor (usually 70 to 90, is more like it), you should adjust accordingly.\n\nSo if you put on 6 contracts for an 85 to 90 percent. You will dial it down to just 2 contracts here, (I'm assuming a 50 k acct (PDT and all), if it's 25k, just half the numbers). That is using Kelly correctly. As the percentage of profit falls so does your size. (I just wrote something detailed about Kelly  last week if you wanna look that up, thru the icon).\n\nAlso, I know these are max profits, but if you do the MATH AS IS on a calcator, you will see you end up slightly positive, about $822 over a 💯 trials. Usually, it dosent work like that.  Especially for IC's.\n\nWhat THAT tells me, is there is volatility term structure mispricing at play too (I'm almost 75 percent sure), where maybe you can sell a near term and buy a longer term at a couple of points cheaper then that. This is usually 10 to 15 percent edge available instantly. So here you would actually put on 20 contracts !!!!(same 50k bankroll) and when the structure corrects (sometimes it corrects in an hour, sometimes a day or two), you immediately close for 10 to 15 percent profit, essentially making the same 250 to 500 dollars. \nThis ALSO means you take the 200 or 300 loss if the spread between the volatilities widens. Of course check earnings etc. When a mispriced trade like a term structure corrects itself quickly (the longer one rises and the shorter one falls, convergence), it usually means you had an edge, so capture it and be done with the trade. Hence the higher size. (Don't try that now, I'm just saying, let's see if there is some meat to that first). This para is a reference to the Great Mark Sebastian.\n\nThis is all conjecture as I need to get In front of my desktop and a proper 🍎 option chain open on 5 consecutive tabs, so that the term structure yields a calender play instead of a condor. Calenders are great in generally low volatility situations. Condors, Fly's, not so great. Keep that at the back of your mind. I'll get back during the Friday session.\n\nA calender has the same characteristics as a straddle which in turn is a more aggressive strangle, which ties into the hedged sitiuations repectively of a fly or a condor.

Our basic thoughts are in alignment and so definitely, waiting to see what it does right here vis a vis the limits of the high on the 13th of 151.42 and the low on the 15th of 146.37 is IMPORTANT. Whichever breaks first is a clue to you, on how aggressive you wanna get on the call side.  And if it does break ABOVE, the put can be now MAYBE moved upto 140-135, to keep similar characteristics. The three local lows of 144.5 on the 19th of August, 142.54 on the 28th of July and the 141.67 on the 19th of July, should be barrier enough if our current retest to the bull side succeeds.\n\nWe'll see. Let me see if anything on an outright mispricing on the calender pops up mid-way thru Friday,  Otherwise Monday is cool, cause you cannot write on Friday after 1 pm for further obvious reasons.\n\n(If anything i pointed as obvious is not obvious, let me know, i assume a lot sometimes).\n\nThe orignal condor I referenced for the numbers above is 150-155 and 135-130.

I mean surely no MM is that 0 IQ to sell options weekly they know are in the money right?... wrong, but let's get back to how they will use the money from that later.\n\nThey can short the stock of course. If 100% is short and they need to cover 100% of the float, well guess what? They just buy the shit they sold into the market back and keep the short position open. That is one way to solve it, but not the only one.\n\nLet's say 1 MM gets assigned 100% of the float and only has say 50% hedged. Ok, what happens besides shorting? Well, they can deliver the shares T+2. So they deliver some today and most likely most people who exercise the calls will immediately sell the shares back into the market for profit. They aren't all going to hold. So what can the MM do? He can buy it right back and settle another option, etc, etc, etc and on and on until eventually fully covered.\n\nYes this will cost them money, but less than if they let this thing ride out to triple digits. So they can cover more than 100% of the stock with these two methods alone and not let it get out of control. They also use the new options chain to sell even more naked options that you will buy, because your thinking the party won't stop. Because of course it won't stop right? So they use the profits from that to cover and short. The shorts eventually pay off, and the only people who lose are those who DiAmOnD hAnDeD and some poor swing traders.\n\nThis could all be stopped my someone with a huge amount of money who can make this even worse, and at that point you can just start adding digits.\n\nOr maybe I'm just as retarded as anyone else here.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Just tell us you have puts bro", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I had calls that I bought weeks ago.

It is literally the fuel by which this can go multiples higher. They have to cover the exercised contracts. If they are assigned and don't have the shares, then they must buy them. \n\nWe already know there were A LOT of naked contracts written because the OI suggests there isn't enough of the underlying security to cover the calls that were written. \n\nWriting more calls would be like trying to extinguish a fire with gasoline. I don't have the data in front of me but I would be SHOCKED if MMs were writing new contracts with 9/17 expirations. And how in the world does writing calls dilute the share prices? \n\nAs for selling shares short, where are the shares to sell short going to come from? The MMs don't have a lot of time to buy the float 5-6 TIMES over to cover their contracts by close tomorrow.\n\nVolume is the key ingredient tomorrow. Volume will be insane anyway. But, if today's volume is matched in the first 90 minutes of trading tomorrow, then I see a chance that this doesn't retest 60.

Yes it is like trying to extinguish a fire with gasoline if they hedge them. But here is the kicker, they won't unless they have to. They just have to stop it from going any higher to the point where they have to. Imagine if I sold a bunch of 60 calls on IRNT naked. I can choose not to hedge until it hits 60. Or I could hedge immediately. \n\nIn this situation, if I was a MM, I would short the stock which adds shares temporarily to the float. A lot of people forget about this. If I short 100% of a 1 share company, now 2 shares exist \"*temporarily\"*.\n\nIn this case with IRNT, short shares exist. A MM in theory could short 100% of the stock and use the shorted shares to cover options contracts. Here is an example of how that could work. I sell short 100 shares to you. Now I buy it back from you, but I buy it to cover the options contract. NOT THE SHORT POSITION. I can cover the short position later on. Maybe next week, maybe in a month, maybe when it dilutes in a few weeks, etc.  \n\n\nHopefully this helps to further explain the situation.\n\nThe risk in this is real where MM could get blown up by big money if it blows passed ever increasing naked options positions.

The stall was just market makers doing lots of really small sales to drive the price down one trade at a time and having really low volume and a really small float amplifies the impact of that. Their goal is to reduce the number of assignments and drive the price down to reduce the amount of cover that has to be done to remain delta neutral.\n\nIf buy volume picks up tomorrow, the price will go up just as fast (or faster) than it went down... and it's not uncommon to see stocks with big options moves on a Friday go sideways or down a little on the Thursday before or to see stagnant or down AH action. The reason why large buyers might not engage on a Thursday AH is because that's spending their resources ahead of time without the chance to exercise options. If I were a big fund and I were to buy in AH on a Thursday because I wanted the stock to go up, that gives anyone playing the other side of the trade the entire Friday pre-market to use their resources to reverse the pricing effect I just did, without the ability to leverage profit from any options I put in the money to buy more shares and further drive the price... as a result, the smart money holds for the morning fight.\n\nSo it could continue to run tomorrow, and given price action today it's possible that a 10 - 20 points swing COULD happen.

No idea... depends on where the majority of the money lands and whether the MMs trying to keep it down simply have more money.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Also a factor in this is that the SEC has a no naked shorting rule because naked shorts are highly risky... so any regulated fund is audited for their risk exposure. That audit frequency used to be monthly, but earlier this year to address the high risk to the funds from events like GME, the SEC changed the rule from monthly to the option for the SEC to do it on a daily cadence. That doesn't mean that the SEC will audit a fund every day, but rather that the funds need to be ready to address a risk deficit on any given day and will likely have to show, once audited, that they have procedures and policies which are documented as in effect to pass their audit controls tests.\n\nThis means that MMs can sell today and then buy tomorrow morning and technically still be risk covered, and regulated entities will probably (at least to some extend) be covering if they sold their cover today to be regulatory compliant.
