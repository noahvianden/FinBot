{"title": "If Apple comes out with a car, are you buying an Apple car or a Tesla? TSLA 3,000 is higher then AAPL, Be honest, very curious, Cathie Says", "selftext": "Good evening everyone and thank you so much for reading my posts. There are debates everywhere abou TSLA valuation so I am not here to go into that. It should be noted that TSLA now has a market cap higher than the combination of Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, Honda all combined. It should also be noted that Toyota alone sells nearly 10 million cars and Tesla 500k…..\n\nThis post is not about that though…however Cathie Wood says that TSLA should be worth 3,000 easy, in her base case. \\[Mind you she just dumped… along with insiders that sell every day of the week check form 4\\] Whatever is the case if TSLA is 3,000 a share it will rival the largest company in the world AAPL. Nearly 2.5 trillion…\n\nTSLA is thought as of the car/tech of the future…Many believe that APPLE is the best innovator… It has been rumored over a year that Apple has plans to possibly team up with a car manufacturer and make an APPLE car….\n\nSo the question is simple. If both cars come out, both cars are near the same price…be honest which do you buy? This happened with Blackberry, Iphone and Samsung…\n\nThank you for taking the time. Please share thoughts, ideas… or if you think someone will overtake Apple and Tesla in the next few years.", "id": "plxv88", "created_utc": 1631323206.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 140, "comments": [{"body": "I have a hard time believing Apple will make a car.

{"title": "Kroger CEO: Organized crime, supply chain issues compressed margins", "selftext": "Kroger (NYSE:KR) CEO Rodney McMullen said Friday that the gross margin compression that contributed to poor reception for the grocery chain's latest earnings report stemmed from supply-chain pressures and shoplifting that involved organized crime.\n\nSpeaking to CNBC, McMullen also predicted 2%-3% inflation for the rest of the year for the company's inputs. He added that the chain can pass most of the costs associated with increased commodities prices to its customers.\n\nKroger shares dropped more than 7% on Friday even though the company reported earnings and revenue that nominally topped expectations.\n\nThe company's margins decreased by 60 basis points, and many investors apparently saw that as their cue to take profits on the stock after KR ran up 24% in the two months heading into the earnings report.\n\nMcMullen told CNBC that half of the margin decline came as a result of disruptions in Kroger's supply chain, which drove up costs. The other half came from a rise in stolen products fueled by an increased prevalence of organized crime.\n\nMcMullen said shoplifting by organized crime has become more prevalent in the past year or two. He added that he has been working with other retailers and law-enforcement authorities to counter the problem.\n\nThe CEO suggested that technology might make it easier for criminals to sell their ill-gotten products, making \"shrinkage\" –  the industry term for merchandise lost to theft –  a bigger problem.\n\n\"In the past, it would have been more flea markets, much harder to sell,\" he said. \"[But] if you look at the current market, it's much easier to sell in the market.\"\n\nKR dropped $3.48 on Friday to close at $42.67. Shares had advanced from early July into last week, when the stock set a closing 52-week high of $47.31. KR also established an intraday 52-week peak of $47.99\n\nhttps://s eekingalpha.com/news/3738842-kroger-ceo-organized-crime-supply-chain-issues-compressed-margins", "id": "plz62f", "created_utc": 1631328402.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "This is the first time I've ever seen organized crime being listed on an earnings report as a reason for disappointing numbers.", "score": 135, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "For some reason I always thought some level of theft was always expected and even though you try to combat it, you will never see 0 theft.

There were so many incentives:\n\n* 7500 Federal Tax Credit\n* up to 5000 State Tax Credit (NJ)\n* No State Sales Tax on EVs (NJ)\n\nTwo of the major competitors in the EV space (Tesla and GM) have exhausted the federal tax credits. Here's a list of qualifying vehicles:\n\n[https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml)\n\nThe NJ ChargeUP program has the following vehicles:\n\n[https://chargeup.njcleanenergy.com/eligible-vehicles](https://chargeup.njcleanenergy.com/eligible-vehicles)\n\nBased on test driving and analyzing the various vehicles, I went with the Nissan Leaf. However, I would have gone with the Volkswagen id4 if they didn't have delays (the one I wanted would not be available until March 2022, and there was no guarantee the tax credits in state would still be available). The Mustang Mach-E was impressive as well, but it didn't fit my family's needs.\n\nFrom a cost standpoint, with Nissan year-end incentives, I got a brand new car that retailed for around $40,000 for $22,500. With no sales tax, that's like 50% off (and Nissan gave me 60 month 0% interest financing). I am not knowledgeable enough about what states other than NJ are doing, but Tesla and GM are at a bit of a disadvantage because they exhausted the federal tax credit. \n\nObviously there are international markets (Tesla is big in China!).

In its latest diatribe,1 Amazon spends \nover six of eight pages on matters wholly irrelevant to the current proceeding or even matters \ncurrently before the Commission. Pushing past Amazon’s efforts at distraction and delay, only \none simple question is currently before the Commission in this proceeding: whether SpaceX \nprovided sufficient information on a proposed minor amendment to the application for its next-\ngeneration system for the Commission to seek public comment on that application. The answer is \nunquestionably yes.\nAs usual, Amazon tries to prevent a fair review on the merits by using procedural \ngamesmanship. Despite its theatrics, Amazon does not identify a single fact, figure, or scintilla of \ndata that SpaceX omitted from its application. Nor can Amazon point to a single rule that prohibits \nSpaceX from providing the Commission with extra information about an alternative configuration \nfor its system. That is because SpaceX has provided all information required under Commission \nrules and more information than necessary for the public and the Commission to evaluate all \naspects of its application. Nonetheless, Amazon is attempting to use a procedural gambit to\nprevent the public from even having the opportunity to provide feedback on the merits of SpaceX’s \napplication.\nSpaceX’s request at this point remains straightforward and simple. SpaceX asks only that \nthe Commission make its application available for comment from all members of the public—\nincluding Amazon’s legion of lobbyists and lawyers. Undoubtedly, Amazon will find a litany of \nother issues with the application to complain about. Nonetheless, that is what the comment cycle \nis for—to give the public the opportunity to build a complete record to assist the Commission in \nevaluating SpaceX’s application for its next-generation system. SpaceX therefore urges the \nCommission to put the application out for comment immediately to expedite the process of\nproviding better broadband to more Americans, no matter where they live.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I loved that response.
