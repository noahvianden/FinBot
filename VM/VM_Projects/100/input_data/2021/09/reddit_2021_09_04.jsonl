The time remaining, multiplied by some factor of the volatility dictates the extrinsic value. By not exercising the contract and not selling the contract, you don’t get the extrinsic value because  you are forfeiting the POTENTIAL value of the option in the future. When you sell a contract, you are selling the current value plus the time remaining. Exercising removes the remaining time.\n\nIt’s kind of like calculating total energy in a system from physics. Think of it kind of like Potential Energy plus Kinetic Energy. Potential Energy is the time left on the option and Kinetic Energy is the price difference between the strike price and the stock.\n\nJust like any system, it’s not 100% efficient, so some energy is lost to entropy.

Thus, include in your profit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes! That's why selling the contract is often better if there is increased volatility and/or the price goes significantly above strike, the value includes the time left factored against the implied volatility measurement plus the selling price minus the strike price times 100 (since you're effectively planning to buy and then sell shares). Lots of time left or lots of volatility with some time left and above strike = valuable (or a combination of the two). \n\nLow time left and no volatility result in value closer to just the value of the stock minus the strike price if above strike.\n\nHere's a good example:\nyou buy an options contract for T (AT&T), which has very low volatility (seriously, I keep wanting to sell a covered call, but the premium I'd collect at the strike I want would result in like $3 made on the contract because of super low volatility). As a result, there's not much Intrinsic value because the stock doesn't jump around a lot, so the premium to collect on an out of the money option, even with a long expiry (like I think June 2022 call is like $0.05 for the contract ($5 total premium), is incredibly low.\n\nIf you buy the contract for $5 and the price of T jumps drastically (we'll say it was a $32 strike with Jan 2022 expire) up to $33 by the end of this month (which would be ~22% increase in the price), then the IV would include $100 for the difference in the strike and current price, plus the volatility * time left on contract (since contract is up in Jan, then there's some factor that I don't know that multiplies those values together, which gets added to the value of the contract). Likely, the contract would go up another $5 per contract (I'm assuming the contract is pricing in another $5 of movement into the contract), resulting in a net gain of $600 if you sold the contract immediately at that point. However, if you exercised the contract, you'd buy the shares at $32 and sell them (or hold on to them if you think they're going to keep going up) for $33 and keep $100 profit, which is $5->$100 = ~2000% profit (I mean, really, it's like 1900%, but it depends on how you want to measure the gains as you could ignore cost basis and call that your profit/loss ratio since you only risked $5). \n\nBut if you had just sold the contract, you would've netted $600 revenue (minus the $5 again) which would be 595/5 * 100 = 11,900%. Obviously, these are kind of extreme cases and very few options are going to end up paying out like this.\n\nHopefully, that helps illustrate why exercising typically doesn't end up with large gains. Especially, when your net investment is a very small number. If those contracts go up in value, you can turn a 5:1, 10:1, or 20:1 risk/reward ratio, but since they're fairly infrequent, you have to look at the number of times you took profit in your ranges and how many you lost where the contract expired OTM. With a 2:1 reward/risk strategy, if you're right 50% of the time, you end up making 66 wins vs 33 losses in 99 trades. If you wagered $5 at each one, you end up with $10*66/(($5 * 66) + ($5 * 33)) = 1.33. So, your overall ratio is 33% gains on average if you succeed 50% of the time. \n\nThe lower your success percent goes, the higher your reward ratio needs to be. So, that's why deep OTM options can sometimes turn very profitable over longer runs if you can do something to increase your odds of being right (like you have strong reason to believe that a company's earnings is going to considerably beat analyst estimates due to past behavior and known economic conditions that would drive the price of that stock up before expire).\n\nOk, I'm really done explaining now.

Say that I have purchased one call on MSFT 310 strike with 10/15/2021 expiry. In this case the price was ~3.40 at close on 9/3/2021. Therefore I paid $340 premium (3.40 * 100).\n\nToday Microsoft is trading at 300. Assume that I exercised my call right now, what happens? I end up buying 100 shares of MSFT @ 310 immediately losing $10/share. For 100 shares it's $1000. So I'm total I spent $340 for the call and another $1000 exercising early. \n\nOkay now let's say I waited until next week and for some reason Microsoft has jumped up to 320/share. What would happen to my call? Let's assume I immediately exercised it when MSFT is at $320. This means that I pay $310/share when MSFT is at $320 and I make $1000 total gross or $10/share. If you include the premium I paid that's $1000-340 = 660\n\nInstead of exercising let's say you looked at the price of your call that you bought a week prior and it has gone up to $13.25! That's great. If we inspect this price closer we can see the 2 \"components\". As I said before there's $10/share of profit for this contract so 10/13.25 are the value of the contract *intrinsically*-meaning related to something about the contract that provides it value aside from anything else about it. \n\nThat means the remaining $3.25 are actually related to something outside the contract -> I.e. time/implied volatility, etc. That's weird cus last week the contract was OTM but worth $3.40. That entire $3.40 was actually extrinsic value. Now that the contract has gone up so high, why did the extrinsic go down by 15 cents? \n\nThe answer is because of time decay. The extrinsical value will go down slowly every day for that option until the last day or its expiry. What this means is, if MSFT stays at $320 until 10/15, when my contact is exercised I will immediate make $1000. My contract also on the last day will be worth only $10. This reflects the exercise potential with 0 time value. \n\nPreviously if instead of exercising, let's say you sold that contact for $13.25. This means you'll collect $1325 of the gross, recently on which you spent $340 for a net profit of $985.

The 25 EMA right now for the weekly is around 139. This is in stark contrast to the daily 25 EMA, where it whipsaws around it.\n\nBut what's important is that clearly 138 to 140 was THE area to break and at Some point AAPL will come back to retest 140 at least, or if say a month goes by, that 25 weekly EMA could be at 141, but all the orders (long and shorts) are bunched up in the 138 to 140 zone. \n\nNow if you look at the Volume profile since Mid May 2021, the most volume is very clearly at the 145.75 level (145 to 146).  \n\nThis tells me a retest is possible, anywhere from 138 to 146 !! Depending on how it performs there, if sentiment is bullish, and the shorts sell, Apple will bounce back with double pressure of the shorts selling and bulls rejoining.\n\nAlthough there are many options (intended).\nFor you, and based on your replies, I would recomend the following two. Both have been mentioned in various ways.\n\n1) You made a 150%, pocket 50%, and do the same thing all over again. If it dips to 145 or whichever of the above levels it has a successful retest at.\n\n2) Which I find better.\n\nSell weekly calls, constantly, one cycle after the other. Take advantage of max theta decay. If you see Apple at an obvious resistance level, which sadly right now is nowhere to be found at 154.3, you can even sell ATM calls. But one expiry after the next. If you see your level breached, you can buy the calls back and do it again. Eventually the volatility risk premium is plus ev for you.\n\nSo for example right now, the Sept 10 th, 155 is @1.29 and the Sept 10 157.5 is @0.53. Choose one of these, that's it, don't even think of the 160 strike. OR even acknowledge the 17th September expiry. We want next expiry, as close to ATM as possible. The 157.5 is fine.  \n\nIf you sell for 0.53, buy them back at 1 dollar and Do it again. You will lose 47 cents, but make  1.25 on your calls or 1.10 probably. But DO IT AGAIN.\n\nIf you sell an ATM for 1.29, buy it back for 2.25, your calls will still best the 45 to 50 delta you gave up. Dont worry about assignment or any of that bs, jist manage your trade, put a stop loss everyday. A trigger order not a limit.\n\nWhen it does drop back to the 140:s and starts hitting resistance repeatedly. Execute step 1 above and do the whole thing all over again.\n\nYour entire job is to sell as many calls as you can from Sept 10th for the next 90 to 100 days, that should give you 13 14 expirys. And you can pocket anywhere from 5  to 10 dollars. \n\nSomewhere around 45 days to expiry, execute step 1, pocket everything above a 100 percent and buy the same calls again that you did when you bought these 120's.\n\nAnd then, guess what, start working every week again. What I am trying to drill continuously is that ATM:s and close to ATM's, a strike off, is where the money is at. Don't sell more then 4 dollars away. Don't be scared of anything. As you can buy insurance for cheap.\n\nOn the big scale, most of the volume is clustered around 125, but short term that volume spike is at around 145. Those are your guidelines. \n\nAND please do not hesitate to insure your self. The 135's only cost 6 cents. These are called units. The 130's are 4 cents. The 120:s are only 2 cents.  These will be also bought every week to get gamma to work for you most efficiently if there is a disaster locally, company wise or systematically.\n\nThe reason you don't have to worry about gamma yourself is obvious.\n\nEverything I have explained is to be kept with ONLY APPLE in mind. Not as a generic strategy. You will do the same thing always in this situation (up 150 percent on a LEAP) but maybe you want be as aggressive as I am telling you to be. It's a series of PMCC's, we know that.

Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.\n\nIf the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.\n\nFollowing his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/)\n\nElon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that’s only going to happen with a big “if.”  \nThe new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.  \nWhen first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.\n\nTesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  \nPeople who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  \nThe vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn’t a priority for Tesla.\n\nLink: [https://electrek.co/2021/09/01/tesla-delays-new-roadster-2023/](https://electrek.co/2021/09/01/tesla-delays-new-roadster-2023/)", "id": "phiruh", "created_utc": 1630721141.0, "score": 1400, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 510, "comments": [{"body": "Cybertruck 2077.", "score": 201, "replies": [{"body": "Ahahah that was clever, it’s definitely going to be as much of a disappointment if not even worse.

Most people fundamentally misunderstand what caused the supply crunch thus fundamentally misunderstand who is adversely affected.\n\nCovid didn't suddenly cause a massive spike in demand in order to precipitate a crunch. There was some demand increase in consumer electronics sector as more people purchased equipement to work from home but this is rather minimal and mostly focused on products that people didn't already have and are using lower end semiconductor processes, think webcams, mice, keyboards. Take a look at LOGI to see how this side of the demand increase played out.\n\nNow, so what -actually- caused the supply crunch? Well actually it was automakers and other traditional industries that forecasted a massive decrease in demand cancelling or scaling back their supply contracts. This caused foundries to either spin down for retool or sell capacity to someone else. Both are having a significant impact on auto chips right now which are mostly produced on the less advanced 32nm+ node processes.\n\nThe latter is why this affects TSLA less (though they are ultimately still affected which I will address later). They went ahead and purchased the depressed capacity, similarly AAPL/GOOG/QCOM/MRVL all took advantage of this to buy up capacity and lock in cheaper rates for the next couple of years while autos and industrial companies were panicking about a sustained economic recession.\n\nHowever this still ultimately does affect TSLA (and NIO, LI, etc that took similar approaches) in that purchasing capacity during the dip doesn't protect you from increased requirements going forward due to growth. So while they aren't needing to cut production like traditional autos that stupidly cancelled their contracts they aren't able to grow capacity because the same companies that cancelled are now willing to buy capacity at a premium and are buying everything they can.\n\nThis has some big follow-on effects for the semi-conductor industry though, especially combined with developments over the last few years w.r.t geopolitics. Firstly all the big foundries (INTC/TSM/Samsung) are building out new fabs now. These take 2-3 years to online but once they do come online we are going to see a massive supply glut which will drastically lower the prices of NAND, consumer electronics chips etc and free up the older fabs for the next gen of auto/industrial chips which will slowly upgrade from 32nm+.\n\nThe other major factor was the whole trade snafu with China effectively banning the use of SMIC and Huahong Semi by US companies, which are major suppliers of these cheaper, less advanced semiconductors. Trump also intervened to have the Netherlands block access to ASMLs latest EUV machines to China which is now causing China to spin up their own EUV lithography efforts which is going to fuck ASML hard in the future. Just look at how Ericson is faring against Huawei... It might take a decade but ASMLs monopoly is probably over because of that boneheaded move.\n\nThe boom/bust, crunch/glut cycle is nothing new for semi-conductors but there has just been a perfect storm of factors to make this particular cycle very noticable for the first time of people outside of consumer electronics.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "That was very informative.

And why Viacom instead of any other company?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Let me start with my TA first…which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>$SPY is at a critical resistance level…I mean…it literally is hitting the fucking roof here… and with everything going on in the world…you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble…but how was that even theoretically feasible? It’s impossible in my opinion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the /r/stocks equivalent of astrology. My god! A \"critical resistance level\". Oh no! You're just making things up. There's nothing alarming about that image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret…THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment banks slash or raise estimates by 50% all the time. This isn't news worthy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Simply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.\n\n\n\n\nI hope you realize lumber demand isn't only influenced by the building of homes. If lumber price increases it could be due to a million other things. Simplifying it to \"lumber price up = more homes built + economic growth\" is pretty dumb. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So…yeah we’re fucked. Which in turn has a DIRECT impact on companie’s future earnings… and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now…\n\n\n\n\n\nWrong. The total sum of earnings from US firms effects GDP. GDP does not affect a firm's earnings (at least not directly). GDP is just a measure production. It doesn't (directly) impact the earnings of a company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>This ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Get it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>The lumber/gold ratio HAS PLUMMETED in the last 2 months…literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember…play defense)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Side note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But…gold was up big this week as well…and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're trying very hard to make the data fit your narrative but it's not working. Here is a better chart of lumber/gold along with gold and lumber separately shown: https://i.imgur.com/UIfO1ZS.png. It should be pretty obvious that lumber/gold spiked and fell only due to the price of lumber. This isn't some \"key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash\". This is just how fractions work. You seemed to have missed this lesson in 3rd grade so I'll cover for you. When the numerator of a fraction increases, the fraction becomes bigger. The lumber/gold only moved due to lumber price changes so why did you even try to argue for the use of a lumber/gold graph? Just use a lumber price graph. Oh wait, if you did that then it'd be easier to see that your argument makes 0 sense. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Since the start of 2013 the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs. No big deal right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're going to have to explain why this is a big deal. Do you think the economy of 1989-2000 and the economy of 2013-2021 are easily comparable just by looking at how many highs were hit?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks. https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP. No big deal right?\n\n\n\n\nYou're going to have to explain why this is a big deal. Unless you have a PhD in economics I don't think you have the knowledge to judge if this is good or bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak. https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi No big deal right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would hope that the median home prices from 2006 would eventually be surpassed. That's kind of how numbers work when you have 2-3% inflation a year and a stock market that grows, on average, 8+% a year. So yes, no big deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Timing this is almost impossible…but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen why are you trying to time the market?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a “Black swan event”by purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs.

It's not a secret. Between the M2 supply expansion and the high demand for everything in the economy right now, prices are up. And the ISM manufacturing and service data tells us that it's real economic activity, not just cheaper dollars.\n\nWe should all welcome the market trading sideways for a bit. Every day / week / month that SPY isn't making ATH, is time for earnings to catch up to valuations and the multiples to come down. I still feel like it's a little over-bought, but it's hard to know if this is a bubble, or just prices adjusted for a larger federal reserve balance sheet.\n\nHome prices are up, but the market is cooling a little, which is good. Demand for homes has increased because many jobs are now work-from-home and a lot of people left big cities to buy houses. Combined with months of no construction last summer from covid, there's a market shortage for properties, but that's coming into balance. It's not like 2006 when lending standards were very lax and everybody was getting multiple ARMs for over priced houses. Houses are being bought above asking price with CASH! These aren't bar tenders paying $1 M with 99% leverage, these are corporations and wealthy folk with 0% leverage that own the real estate outright. How the fuck does that market crash when these people never need to sell, which was why it all came down in 2008 when all these over leveraged people had to sell homes they couldn't afford because they could never afford the mortgage payments to begin with.\n\nLumber was at historical all time highs, again, because lumber factories were shut down for covid. These prices have plummeted the last 3 months as those factories catch up with demand. There was actually never a price spike for raw wood, which proved it was just the factory through-put.\n\nGold is worthless. It's just not a good asset. They dig more up every day, and it's just a commodity with a few industrial uses, including creating luxury items. Gold prices have slumped because people believe crypto, real estate and equities are a better position, especially if inflation is up.\n\nGoldman Sacs didn't cut their forecast for GDP by 50%, just the growth part. So 6% growth is astronomical for a $22 Trillion economy like the United States. The only reason that number is that high is because of last year being down. 3% growth is still above the normal annual growth of around 1.5-2.5%.\n\nAnd lastly, people like you. There are so many people, companies and businesses that feel things are expensive that there's a ton of cash sitting out, waiting for the dip to come. We could very well have a correction, and soon, but how could equities keep falling when there's so much cash in the system ready to buy cheap companies.

The root problem is massively overextended margin debts that is under-collateralized. This is the same thing that led to the global financial crisis in 2008, which never really ended. This will create a run on high-quality assets, like treasuries, that I think could blow up your trade.\n\nJust like then, this is being fueled by dark money movements in the derivatives and swaps market. This is what caused the collapse of Archegos Capital...they were able to leverage 100/1 positions on swaps; which is why a <5% market swing got them margin called and immediately liquidated. The huge problem is that there were almost no underlying assets to liquidate, just beta-negative swaps. They were not alone, they were just the first to collapse. Every investment bank, hedge fund, and regulatory agency is willingly complicit.\n\nI think you're going to get torched on your spreads, for two reasons. One: just like 2008, as pressure builds, everyone will be desperately seeking treasuries to add to their net accounts, in a last-ditch effort to appear solvent. It's already been happening for months.This will also keep USD in demand. Two: Same as 2008, the USD is relatively insulated by the petrodollar system. IMO, this renders the GDP model useless because for USD to be the world reserve currency, we need to carry trade deficits with the rest of the world. A side point here is that most world currencies are much more fragile than USD. So, the \"canary in the coal mine\" litmus test would apply here. \n\nAdditionally, I think you're missing what's really happening with, and to, the Fed. This was sneaked in during the Trump Administration, via Steve Mnuchin and the Treasury. During the early stages of the pandemic selloff, the Fed was allowed to exchange cash for assets (mostly treasuries and corporate bonds), at historic levels. It's still happening. The key thing is that at that time, these trades were made at Mnuchin's discretion. I'm assuming they're still at Yellen's discretion. To me, it seems that the U.S. Treasury is force-feeding the Fed toxic government and corporate debts, that they helped create, while extrapolating USD. Basically, it seems that the U.S. is pushing the central banking system out, like many nations have since early 2020.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}

Waymo will forever be limited to high density areas where there are enough customers to make it worth maintaining the maps.\n\nTesla on the other hand is building a system that solves the problem anywhere.

It doesnt scale well. Neither in unit cost nor in fleet maintenance.\n\nOther manufacturers are faster, because they solve an easier problem. But they have no hope to solve the entirety of the problem. They will be forever limited.\n\nBut he DOES have a point if it comes in capturing part of the TAM.

I've just read the comments and someone says it may be fake:\n\n\nSteve Baker\n12 minutes ago (edited)\nI call *FAKE* - and I think I can explain how it was done.\n\nSo there are some things that are definitely real.  The building that's lit up with red lights that they start out next to is the Kiev university building - and if you look at the map display in the car and compare it to Google maps for that area, it's a good match...so this isn't something that was filmed at night in the USA and made to look like it was done in Kiev...that much is real.\n\n_HOWEVER_:\n\nThere are some fairly well-known hacks to put the Model 3 into various \"special\" modes - such as \"DEVELOPER MODE\" and \"FACTORY MODE\" - and at 4:07 in the video, you can see it says \"Factory Gateway\" in big red letters across the screen - in the same font, size and color as the display that warns you when the car is in various special testing or development modes.\n\nThis mode is, for 100% sure not available on any un-hacked Tesla - even if it has the FSD Beta installed.   So right here, we know that something fishy is going on.  This car has for sure been hacked...no doubt...no question whatever.\n\nThe hack is very well known - just google for it and you'll find easy instructions to turn it on.  https://fn.lc/post/tesla-model-3/ is a good starting point.  You need some fairly common hardware like a CAN-Bus interface - things which a car dealership or a University department might plausibly own.\n\nSo does a hacked non-FSD-beta car look like this one?\n\nElon Musk has said that he drives his car with developer mode on all the time - and that it displays a bunch of things you can't normally see.  This could plausibly explain why the graphics look like FSD's graphics...so this I believe could easily have been faked.\n\nThe car's display from 4:26 - which shows the forward camera with a bunch of annotations looks exactly like the developer mode display shown at the \"Autonomy Day\" demo a year or so ago...this, again, does NOT look like FSD...it's looks like Developer Mode.\n\nIn the daylight portions of the video - the car is driving extremely erratically - and this is NOT how the beta FSD drives...so this isn't what it claims to be.\n\nAnd if this car is a Ukrainian model - (which I think is likely when we see the street names written in cyrillic letters on the map display) - then why is all of the FSD stuff in English?   I very much doubt that developer mode has ever been translated into Ukrainian...or Russian for that matter.  The developers are all English speakers...so, again, this is a car that's been hacked to run in developer mode.\n\nAs I watch this, the camera is usually positioned so you can't see the guy's left hand...it's plausible that he's either steering with that hand or possibly with his knees or something...so I'm not even convinced that the car is driving itself anyway.   Changing the steering wheel icon to blue is an easy video hack.\n\nSo this video is VERY suspicious.\n\nIf I were a betting man - I'd say that somebody with a \"CAN-bus\" interface for a laptop has followed the instructions from (for example) here: https://fn.lc/post/tesla-model-3-modes/ - and used them to get into Developer and/or Factory modes - and used that to make a fairly convincing fake FSD video.\n\nIt's really REALLY unlikely that FSD is being beta tested in the Ukraine...just no.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Is this version 8 or something?!
