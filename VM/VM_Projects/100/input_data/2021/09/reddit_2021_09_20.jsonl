A net loss of 62% (3.2 / 5.2) is certainly better than just losing all 5.2 and getting nothing back.\n\nEven though the seller had to sell their $3 stock for only $1 (the strike), they still made good money on the deal overall, because in *addition* to the $1, they also got the $5.2 *from the premium*. So in reality, the call seller  got to sell a $3 stock for $6.2.\n\nBut suppose that instead of dropping, the share price has gone up to $8. The strike+premium remains 6.2, and the call will still be exercised. Only now, the *buyer* benefits netting $1.8 in value from an original $5.2 outlay. The seller has netted 5 cents from the transaction (6.2 - 6.15, the share price at the time they sold the call). The seller has missed out on a good gain.\n\nSo as you can see, there is zero reason to sell (to open) a deep ITM covered call just before expiration, because you can't capture any time value in the premium. In our case, the time value was only 5 cents. Sure, the seller was protected from loss, but that's it. They gave up any opportunity to make more money from the stock. They might as well have simply sold it.\n\nSuppose they instead sold a $5 strike call for $2. That gives a strike + premium of $7. That means there is a time value of $0.85. If the share price goes to $3. The seller keeps the $2 premium, the call is not exercised, and so they only really lost 1.15 ((3+2) - 6.15) in total asset value. If the share price goes to $5.5, the seller will get the $5 strike and keeps the $2 premium. The seller actually made 0.85 on the deal, but the buyer lost $1.5 overall ($0.5 - $2). Suppose the stock actually went up. The seller STILL made 0.85 on the deal, but missed out on additional gains. But suppose the stock only went to 6.5. The seller made 0.85 instead of only the 0.35 they would have made had they never sold the call. The buyer's breakeven point for making money is when the share price reaches the strike + premium ($7).\n\nIn summary, for ITM calls, the most a seller can make is the ((strike + premium) - original share price). This is not a lot of money, and the closer to expiration they sell the option to open, the more likely this *gain* will be minimal to nothing (because they aren't selling any time value). The worst that can happen is the stock becomes worth $0, so all they have left is the premium.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Note: I can actually think of two reasons to sell a deep ITM covered call instead of just selling the stock outright. \n\n1. You want to continue to collect the dividend. You own the stock, so you get the dividend. However, the higher the dividend (and the lower the strike), the less likely the strike + premium will be higher than the share price. Nobody would pay you $5 now for a $6 stock only to get it 6 months from now and forgo two dividend payments (depending on their size, of course). \n\n2. Taxes. Suppose you've held a stock for 10 months and you've made $10k. If you sold it, you could pay short term tax rates of 25-40% on that gain. But if you held it for two more months, you'll only pay the long-term capital gains rate of 15%. So if you're comfortable that the stock won't go to 0, you could sell a deep ITM covered call which essentially locks in the current price. The holding period will conclude whenever you're assigned and the call is exercised. It could be tomorrow, (or maybe just before the dividend payment). But hopefully, it's after your 1-year period, so you'll get the lower tax rate. But you don't risk anything either way. I just checked, and when a option is *exercised* (as opposed to you buying to close), the holding period for the premium income is considered to be the same as the underlying stock, not just the two months between collecting it and getting assigned. But don't take my word for that. It's just something that I read online, and the law could change. Do your own DD.\n\nA second tax reason would be to delay recording the income from the sale until next year's taxes. Suppose that it's Nov 2021, and you know that you will have a much lower income next year and be taxed at a lower rate. (Maybe you're retiring.) You could sell the covered call to open, and get assigned in January 2022. You'll then be able to record the income on your 2022 taxes instead of the 2021 taxes that you'll file in just a few months.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for such detailed breakdown.

Stops on options tend to prevent profit as much as loss.

Also a bit uncharacteristic of the government to do so.  \n\n\n(2) I believe this is the most likely scenario, but that would transfer the burden onto banks (both Chinese and international) as they will not be getting repayments for their loans to Evergrande.

Much like 2008, the real estate market in China is highly levered and in an extreme bubble. This is because the Chinese government imposed strict limits on who can invest in certain types of assets (mostly equities) but lifted almost all restrictions on real estate/housing market. Ergo, many of the middle class started investing in “investment properties” and as demand grew, so did the prices. The problem was, Evergrande used the increases in the price of land and began taking out equity on that increase in order to fund more and more real estate deals. They currently account for ~2% of China’s GDP and is the second largest real estate developer (and 30% of chinese gdp comes from real estate)… yeah a pretty big deal.\n\nNow, how does this shitstorm in China affect the US Markets? Theoretically it shouldn’t be but a ripple right? Well, when Evergrande was raising capital, they did so by selling commercial paper and investment grade bonds. The buyers of these bonds and CP were large large banking + investment institutions: Vanguard, Blackrock, HSBC, Goldman, etc. These institutions then took these bonds, rolled them into mortgage backed securities and sold them to anyone who would buy them. Much like 2008… everyone believed that if something happened to Evergrande, that the Chinese government would step in. After all, how would it be conceivable that the CCP would let their second largest real-estate developer fail? \n\nThis is where things started gong wrong. Everything was fine until the insiders started getting word of Evergrande’s overinflated balance sheet. But once investors started selling out, Evergrande’s bonds started taking a nosedive. The intl banking institutions didn’t want to be left holding the bag, so my guess is they started deleveraging these toxic assets to any firm willing to buy. How do I know this? Evergrande’s investment grade bonds are now downgraded to junk bonds, and they are trading at 20cents on the dollar. This became such a big issue in fact that these very firms and their executives were in China this weekend to discuss “risk management” \n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-wall-street-meeting-focused-092729599.html\n\nNow, the ripple effects would most likely be as follows: banks + institutions will seek to continue to sell toxic investment and decrease their exposure to the real estate sector. The firms that were dumb enough to buy these toxic assets from firms unloading are now left holding the bag. The once “investment grade” bonds are now junk, and no one will accept them as collateral. So they get margin called. Firms will all rush to find cash, but the smaller firms will inevitably have to liquidate their long positions in order to remain solvent. This will likely happen in growth stocks and tech stocks with high PE ratios that have continued their bullrun since the middle of last year. As these equities start losing their value, other firms with exposure to these US equities will be forces to manage their risk to the downside and sell their positions, thus further driving the price down. This cycle will probably continue until firms have de-leveraged, defaulted, or until the fed decides to buy the toxic assets from these institutions (much like 2008). \n\nSo in short, the effects of Evergrande defaulting will likely have huge implications to the US + international markets, and if my understanding of the OTC+derivatives market is correct, we have a category 5 shitstorm heading our way that will have 2008 look like a walk in the park. \n\nNot financial advice.", "score": 155, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely possible but for this to happen china would need to not step in at all(who knows what they're going to do) and the derivatives markets connected to evergrande bonds would have to be quite huge that larger firms have to liquidate other assets to meet margin. \n\nWe'll just have to wait and see.

However, it may prevent damage to millions of Chinese  homeowners that would stir discontent and weaken the CCP.\n2. The  problem is simply too huge. In the name of development and GDP, Xi gave  Evergrande a free pass and $300B worth of Yuan would need to be printed  to cover them. Not only would this devalue the Yuan but it makes up **2.1%** of China’s GDP. This is simply a case where the concept of “too big to fail” may not actually be valid.\n3. Even  if a bailout did occur, that’s not a good look. Consumer confidence  would decrease rapidly and other firms would continue to push new market  bubbles under the assumption that a bailout will always be available.  Volatility in prices would increase rapidly as there would be confusion  between how the PRC prices property versus individual developers. This  would reflect uncertainty in the general stock market as well as a  bailout indicating weakness in stocks and the overall economy’s  stability.\n4. [Fuck you, China bulls - China](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-evergrande-should-not-bet-govt-bailout-global-times-editor-2021-09-17/)\n5. Even if China bails out its companies and citizens underwater and stricken with debt, that does not mean your shitty VIE ADRs \"representing one share\" of a cayman island shell company will get the same treatment. Daily reminder that Chinese investments are always inherently risky. They are the only stocks that don't comply with PCAOB audits, so financial valuations can be hot garbage for all they care. Financials presented to foreigners are also separate from what they keep at home, SEC has a 2024 deadline to comply with PCAOB or get delisted. If you think that China bailing out its people will save your precious VIE ADR as a foreigner then LMAO\n\n# Other Thoughts\n\n^(I am not an economist, this is not an economic forecast)\n\n* The US market should survive this. The United States is not dependent on the Yuan, and we have sufficient controls in place to keep banks in check (Sarbanes Oxley). Any excessive overreaction, especially in the semiconductor industry, should recover fairly quick as demand still outpace supply.\n* Bonds, even high yield bonds (e.g. HYG, JNK) may present itself at a discount later and bounce no problem. Search ETF holdings for chinashit and most are devoid of them (some may have MGM Macau in there which isn't much). General risk of contagion in the financial sector within the US should be isolated to accredited investors and high risk fund managers. Your wife and your wife's boyfriend's retirement accounts are safe.\n   * (UNLESS) fund managers are making bullshit assets like MBS within MBS bundled up and hiding them in plain sight and stuffing them in high AUM etfs. If this happens again, good luck folks.\n* We will likely see some recovery this week as JPOW turns on his printer while China burns. China may rally as well on Tuesday. I believe we are in the denial stage.\n* \"Never bet against America.\" - Tupac\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bjxfm0gmlro71.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=7960a60695f4f10d96ee2ec29022abb572afc8ef\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tlzj3932mro71.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fd81ca4b36fb94b89cd6f4f3802feefcfafc63f\n\nFurther Reading: [https://twitter.com/inartecarlodoss/status/1438944431734919175?s=21](https://twitter.com/inartecarlodoss/status/1438944431734919175?s=21)\n\n# TLDR; I think China is 没办法 / 完蛋 for realsies this time, so I'm short China using ASHR, EWH, MCHI, WYNN.

China's RE market is far, far different than the US pre-08/GFC. A lot of Evergrande's RE sales required 30-70% down payments, so a huge cascade of defaults would be the extreme case, & not much of a contagion alone.\n\nThe part EVERYONE seems to be missing is WHY the 'ghost cities' in China were built to begin with. They were built in preparation for the long term trend in China of people in rural areas migrating to cities as the Chinese economy modernizes. There is roughly an equivalent of the whole US population (hundreds of millions) of people in China STILL living in the countryside. These ghost cities were built in preparation for this migration, and a ton of Chinese folks were banking on this happening so they could collect rent from them.\n\nHere's the crazy thing - my view is that folks who wanted to/could move to cities for higher paying jobs have already done so. What's left are a bunch of old people, which is a separate issue; Google China's demographic troubles.. it is VERY concerning given China's economy is mostly manufacturing-based and thus, requires population growth for GDP growth more than other nations.\n\nSo back to the point - the deep underlying issue is exactly that. If China cannot get more rural folks to move to urban areas/ghost cities, the house of cards is going to collapse and any Chinese citizen with investments in this 'sure thing' are going to be the last bagholder.

{"title": "$YANG GANG UPDATE- Banks Blowup, RE Troubles, & The China Contagion - An Evergrande Update - Part 2", "selftext": "Sup fuckers, it’s been about 3 days since I posted **Part 1 of** [**$BEKE, $YANG, $NOAH - Big Profits off the Collapse of Big Brother - An Evergrande DD**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp1obi/beke_yang_noah_big_profits_off_the_collapse_of/)**.** Since then, the Evergrande situation has gone even more mainstream, with Finance Twitter increasing coverage and bracing for the potential cascading impacts of the greatest real estate cucks in history. However, media outlets are ironically pretending Evergrande doesn’t exist. Evergrande has also hired the same advisors who “helped” Lehman Brothers and Enron 🤡. The movie script practically writes itself. \n\n# Basically, I was right and on time, and the bailout most likely is not occurring. China fuk this morning. $YANG up 15%. \n\nA lot of people were triggered last time that I gave specific tickers and positions so this time, I am going purely for an information dump. It’s unlikely most of you retards will even understand the full scope of this fiasco but that’s okay, neither do I. The only main play I think that would really benefit from this is $YANG calls or $YINN puts and puts on banks ($XLF) tied to Evegrande’s liabilities. \n\nAnyways, this “DD” is meant to build on the previous information, provide some updates, and link all the juicy cancerous news I have been seeing, all condensed into one short post. Most of the data is sourced from reputable news sources that I can’t link in here due to rules, and lots of info derived from a [@kylascan](https://twitter.com/kylascan) Substack post. \n\n# [MARKET UPDATES]: \n\n[Yeah..... we only go down from here bois.

Unsustainable.](https://preview.redd.it/einze0umjno71.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce152c6a7699618ecb0c364b2cd6b2624053d92b)\n\n**Based on the latest news and data, I see a perfect storm brewing on a few fundamental factors:**\n\n1. **The China Contagion.** Evergrande is basically real estate COVID and banks are patient zero.  Evergrande isn’t the only Chinese real estate developer at risk. The top 10 alone are at risk of defaulting, more so due to Evergrande (regardless of a bailout or not). Entire sectors will get destroyed too such as construction, materials, and finance.\n2. Tether may be backed by “commercial paper” aka “China Money” and other debt that is backed by Evergrande. This would further fuk China and their heavy hand in this year’s Buttcoin run up. \n3. Even if Evergrande wanted to, they can’t sell shit. Consumer and institutional sector confidence is down to all-time lows. A fire sale is largely possible. \n4. Internal panic and \n5. This one’s a meme, but the same advisors that helped the clearly successful Enron & Lehman Broskis were now hired by Evergrande.\n\nIn fact, Evergrande has already begun to repay its investors with “physical assets” aka property, according to Reuters. Many of these properties are still under construction while others are being destroyed like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/prf8ji/china_demolishes_15_buildings_in_45_seconds/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).\n\n**Contagion 2021:** \n\nCurrently, the majority of news is focused primarily on Evergrande itself, ignoring the several other real estate developers and banks that are also tied in the loop. Over the past decade, we have seen China grow rapidly, spending any resources necessary to grow, grow, grow. At this point, Xinnie the Pooh has been erect for debt for 10 years. What we know is the high **contagion risk** described by Saxo Bank as:\n\n*“A default poses funding problems to Chinese real estate corporates and the Chinese banking sector, which inevitably increased exposure to the real estate giant during the past decade.”*\n\nBasically, RE companies and the banking sector are fucked. The contagion is far worse when you realize many American banks including Citi, GS, and JPM were “attracted like moths” to China’s RE sector just this year.\n\nThe UBS can also be quoted saying, *\"Three weeks ago we did not see any imminent risk of a credit event occurring for Evergrande. Since then, there have been a number of setbacks which have led us to believe that a credit event seems unavoidable\".* \n\nSo, let’s start off with the top 15 RE companies in China currently:\n\n[Damn this debt is THICC.](https://preview.redd.it/kqfrh3lvjno71.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=5efc0dd2ea0ea48f956acb48f278c5f6ebbcf985)\n\nThe sum of **debt** across these companies is approximately 2.44T Yuan or **$377,532,312,360**. **Note that is not total liabilities, simply debt.** All of the bonds associated with these firms are near default levels due to missed interest payments, and this debt along with other liabilities **amounts to nearly $500B in total liability.** \n\n# Tether Troubles\n\nI’m no Butter or Buttcoin fan, so the downfall of Tether stirs something deep inside my balls… Anyways, there is a clear case presented by [@TheLastBearSta1](https://twitter.com/TheLastBearSta1/status/1435231303633448963?s=20) on Twitter that everyone should check out. I wanted to go more in depth, but it is late, I have classes and I thought it would be better to provide the sources and you can all make your own views. Plus, I’m not sure what WSB allows regarding Buttcoin.\n\n#  TIMELINE: \n\nThese are the most important dates this year that would accelerate the Evergrande Implosion if it does not occur within the next week: \n\n1. **Oct 23rd - March 2022 offshore bonds default on this day if Evergrande fails to pay interest.**\n2. **Oct 29th - March 2024 offshore bonds default on this day if Evergrande fails to pay interest.** \n\nAll of these are actually due on **Sept 23rd and 29th** but 30 days for late payments are allowed so my guess is that Evergrande will stretch this out as long as possible. These dates and **Nov 10th** are the main ones to watch for a credit event (such as a default).  \n\nHowever, tonight’s price action tells me this will all blow up within a week… \n\n# Enrongrande: \n\n\"California-based Houlihan Lokey, which set up an office in Hong Kong in 2007 and Beijing in 2010, topped the list of America’s biggest debt restructuring advisory firms over the past six years. It had roles in the workouts at Enron, WorldCom, and Lehman, among others.”\n\nI literally have no words...\n\n **Finally, here are lots of different sources I put in a pastebin link that highlight the shitshow going down in Xi’s palace:**\n\n[Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/wcwqa2BY) \\- Links to CCP spokeperson describing why a bailout ain't happening.\n\n **In conclusion, China goes** [boom](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/prf8ji/china_demolishes_15_buildings_in_45_seconds/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)**.**", "id": "prtzp4", "created_utc": 1632141480.0, "score": 412, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|29|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|321|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx4lof/tx_dd_ternium_it_up_latin_americas_balls_of_steel/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oakw8w/zim_pirates_of_the_zimmabean_dead_mans_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx74mo/tx_dd_ternium_it_up_latin_americas_balls_of_steel/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p65ai1/spy_june_2022_100p_play_the_ultimate_100_bagger/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzq2ke/the_woof_of_wall_street_a_shart_play_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prtzp4/yang_gang_update_banks_blowup_re_troubles_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1696i/lesl_drown_the_shorts_a_shart_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o17se2/lesl_hot_chad_poolboy_summer_a_hart_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pp1obi/beke_yang_noah_big_profits_off_the_collapse_of/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o15vb9/lesl_drown_the_sharts_a_shart_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nx54zk/the_mexican_clf_ternium_steel_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o15o2a/lesl_drown_the_shorts_a_shart_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvwg0y/otrk_guaranteed_squeeze/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=prtzp4)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=prtzp4)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bro… how do you have time for this much DD??\nJust to be clear the play here is YANG calls?", "score": 132, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 109, "replies": [{"body": "Calls on OP's coke dealer 🤣", "score": 37, "replies": []}, {"body": "Haha i bought the play last week man 😎 cheers 👌", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "You should start a finance blog", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "How many Yang calls did you pick up?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "TLDR: buy yang calls expiring in October", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I bought January ones and they are printing too.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "China will step up.

{"title": "🚀📶 $ASTS How Douchebag Hedge Fund Bros Will Value AST SpaceMobile w/ $3.7M Position Update 📶🚀", "selftext": "**Douchebag Hedge Fund Analysts = Your Path to Tendies!**\n\n* I'm going to provide a brief overview of how a douchebag hedge fund analyst and his peers will quickly analyze $ASTS after missing out on $10-$20 of upside as the stock likely ramps heading into March 2022 launch of BlueWalker-3\n   * If you don't know much about $ASTS, there are several posts by [/u/thekookreport](https://www.reddit.com/u/thekookreport/) and [/u/faisall1](https://www.reddit.com/u/faisall1/) that cover the company in depth with varying degrees of humor\n\n[Get ahead of these D-bags before Tendy Town](https://preview.redd.it/faccuf61eoo71.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=5474df97754da2492f2cb2ea4be11c5709943474)\n\n \n\n**Assembling Financial Projections:**\n\n* After getting yelled at by their bigger douchebag Portfolio Manager (\"PM\") for missing part of the move up, they'll assemble AST's public forecasts and street estimates:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7kr4k034eoo71.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b16d3d1c9247da0ec0c26ac04afbec3c0a1e8c\n\n* As you can see, Deutsche Bank is the most optimistic haircutting AST's 2025E topline by 33% whereas Barclays applies a more severe haircut of 61%.\n* The douchebag analyst will probably take the quickest approach by just averaging the two street estimates to create **\"Street Consensus\"**, which is easy to explain to their PM\n   * Note that AST and the analysts expect steady state EBITDA margins to be north of 96% as the company will be relying on telco partners for subscriber acquisition and maintenance costs\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comparable Valuation Analysis:**\n\n* Next the douchebag analyst will pull together a comparable valuation analysis \"comps\". They'll likely select the following companies:\n   * **$IRDM:** vertically integrated, niche global connectivity provider of voice and low-throughput data services (176kbps - 704kps) to bulky proprietary satellite phones. Offers 100 minutes of voice and 100 text messages for $89.99 a month and has 1.6 Million subscribers globally.\n   * **$GSAT:** they'll throw this vertically integrated old school satellite phone provider in the analysis, but it's not really comparable. GSAT has some interesting satellite spectrum that could be utilized for limited regional emergency phone connectivity in future handsets. However the company's satellites are old and need to be decommissioned and replaced with new satellites utilizing a similar approach that AST has patented (high powered, large phased array aperture satellites) to provide anything beyond emergency messaging services. GSAT offers various voice plans starting at $79.99 a month for 150 minutes and has 745,000 subscribers.\n      * Take a look at both Iridium and Globalstar phones, which require large antennas and high power to connect to their respective satellites for voice and low-speed data services. AST’s satellites will allow you to use your current handset for voice and broadband internet!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1hzjc1h9eoo71.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=b780be9b64755f2b19be031183ae7003304faf0a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **$AMT $CCI $SBAC:** AMT is an investor and sits on the board of AST. AMT has made it clear that AST's technology could help reduce the need to build out expensive cellular towers in low density areas which could save telco partners significant future capital expenditure $. Once AST's constellation is up and running, the business model would be very similar to wireless tower companies like AMT/CCI/SBAC where they enter into long-term partnership agreements with telcos and provide the infrastructure (towers) that enable connectivity to subscribers.\n   * Tower companies enjoy long-term agreements and predictable cashflows, which have enabled many to convert to REITs as they pass along a steady stream of income to shareholders. Similarly, once AST has invested in deploying its constellation, aside from some minimal maintenance capex the cashflows will be substantial to the point where the AST will likely institute a dividend and/or return capital to shareholders via share buybacks.\n   * Here’s a video of AMT’s Chief Technology Officer talking about AST: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erDOlUoEmnc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erDOlUoEmnc)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/loxfvskgeoo71.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcd29da48bf96a69e8b95400a1e1590ef6aab050\n\n \n\n**Probability Weighing the Outcome:**\n\n* So the douchebag analyst has put together valuation \"comps\", using haircut public estimates and peer 2025E EBITDA multiples:\n   * From this comparison, he can support **$100 - $150 per share for AST if it is successful**\n   * Keep in mind that all of these comps exhibit much lower growth rates... if the company can execute the valuation multiple ascribed should be higher\n* Now this is where qualitative due diligence is important. The douchebag analyst may talk to Deutsche Bank and Barclays research to get a feel for probabilities of success. They may also talk to the AST and read reddit posts like this one. *What's the probability for success here?*\n* Deutsche Bank takes an equal weighted approach of 25% for management case, 25% for DB case, 25% for conservative and 25% for zero. The douchebag analyst may take a similar approach:\n   * 33% chance of full success resulting in $100 or $150 price\n   * 33% for partial success resulting in a $30 price. Maybe the service works but is slow or subscribers aren’t as quick to adopt the service … so you might end up with something like $IRDM, which is worth $6 billion\n   * 33% of total failure resulting in $0. This is pretty punitive given the growing patent portfolio, but zero it is!\n* Based on the valuation analysis above, this is what expected values might look like using forward 2025E EBITDA multiple discounted back 2 years by 15 discount rate to get to beginning of CY2022\n   * **Using $IRDM as a comparable: $32**\n   * **Using Tower Cos as comparables: $45**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tb69ua6keoo71.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=93269552f8e09dcdcc842e3e2e0c9feb53aef0ec\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n* Most institutions will likely ignore AST until we get within a few months from the scheduled March 2022 launch of BlueWalker-3 satellite aboard SpaceX.\n   * Once BlueWalker-3 is successfully deployed, it will allow for full scale testing of AST’s technology and service ahead of Phase I deployment for equatorial coverage and service\n* However, once institutions and retail start to focus on this event the valuation exercise that I outlined above will be kicked off at generalist, event-driven, Tech/Media/Telecom and other douchebag hedge fund desks across the street\n* These douches completing their valuation analyses will then lead to FOMO position building in anticipation of BlueWalker-3’s launch which should cause the stock to ramp (who is going to miss out on what could be the most disruptive company in wireless?!?!)\n   * Yes, the effective float here is tiny at 36.9M shares once you remove the 9.2M held by strategics purchased via PIPE. Management and employees are locked up for 1 year\n      * Although SPAC sponsor is locked up for 1 year as well, they are allowed to trade 33% of their shares (3.9M) if the stock price exceeds $12 for any 20 of 30 trading days at least 150 days after deal close\n* **The stock currently sits at $11 vs. expected values of $32 to $45 at year end, where should it trade now? How about in 3 months?**\n* I'm a big believer in the company and the valuation outlined above is very conservative (using street estimates that take significant haircuts to management projections).\n* I'm one of a growing base of investors that continues to diligence AST and its opportunity as I underwrite my investment everyday. Even if you're skeptical of AST's probability of success, having a small position sized to zero can mean significant upside if it works!\n\n[Chief SpaceMob Exec Abel Avellan](https://preview.redd.it/mvjlshxreoo71.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8909a80fc0f65c039d37d93e8228a203d534375)\n\n \n\n* **I’ll close with Deutsche Bank highlighting AST’s potential:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tpa8d2qveoo71.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=25fba71868cb301ddb90d0efcb6742a3aff21ce6\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Finally an update on my $3.7M position below:**\n\n[The entire family is invested!](https://preview.redd.it/yjc1rarxeoo71.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=08e118560238c18276808eb495234f1bcb61068e)", "id": "prx4qw", "created_utc": 1632151589.0, "score": 2044, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 215, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|32|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|420|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pl3boi/geni_upcoming_catalysts_dd_and_24m_position_update/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prwyug/asts_how_douchebag_hedge_fund_bros_will_value_ast/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prx4qw/asts_how_douchebag_hedge_fund_bros_will_value_ast/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mm2yb8/asts_my_notes_from_meeting_with_abel_avellan_ceo/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oirq54/spce_s3_mixed_shelf_went_effective_today_was/) [x](https://i.redd.it/anocg27uujf71.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mm32dt/asts_notes_of_my_meeting_with_abel_avellan_ceo_of/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqeiwv/pipes_101_read_up_despac_degens_trading_low_float/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqevic/spac_pipes_101_degens_playing_low_float_despacs/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pqexc0/spac_pipes_101_degens_playing_low_float_despacs/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=prx4qw)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=prx4qw)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Been following your posts on ASTS for a while now and built a small position.

Lynk is focused on limited text messaging with the hopes of expanding to voice and data.  However their approach of trying to utilize low power, small aperture nanosats will not work for delivering anything beyond intermittent text messaging.  There's physics at play here... if you have a low power, small antenna cell phone like what we use today, then the other end which is a cell tower OR in this case a satellite in LEO needs to have high power and large aperture in order to communicate with that phone. On the flip side, a service like Starlink uses lower power small satellites, to transmit data... but the user on the ground has to use a big, HIGH powered antenna to communicate with the satellite.\n\nRemember, 5G is a standard that utilizes many different bands of spectrum, which also includes cellular spectrum.  AST is utilizing the cellular spectrum of its partners primarily in the 600-900mhz and 1.7-2.2ghz frequencies, which happen to be the best for coverage and propagation.  These frequencies are key for a LEO satellite to communicate directly with an unmodified mobile handset.  Why? Your current handset already works with these frequencies and because of the propagation and coverage characteristics, you will be able to use AST's service in various conditions (rain, obstructions like trees/walls, etc).  Going back to the Starlink example, Starlink is using millimeter (high frequency) band spectrum which is great for data throughput, but terrible at coverage and propagation... which is why you need unobstructed line of sight for best service.\n\n2) AST is utilizing the spectrum, network and billing/customer service of its 20 MNO partners (AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, etc).  AST is compensating these partners by splitting revenues it generates from the partner's subscribers (50/50 or better).  You can go to AST's presentation to see what their ARPU will be for developed and developing markets:\n\n[https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST\\_SpaceMobile\\_Investor\\_Presentation\\_Public\\_12-15-20.pdf](https://npa-corp.com/wp-content/uploads/AST_SpaceMobile_Investor_Presentation_Public_12-15-20.pdf)\n\nPage 29 shows that developed markets will be $7.62 / month and developing markets $1.03 / month.\n\n3) Older companies have used this radically different approach because the cost of launching a 2 ton satellite into space was prohibitively expensive ... UNTIL NOW.  The cost of launch has gone down in orders of magnitude, especially with the advent of SpaceX.  There's a reason why I won't invest in Astra, RocketLabs, Relativity, SpaceX, etc. There are more than 200 private and sovereign launch providers in what will be a race to zero.  The benefactors are companies like AST that will be putting up next gen satellites that were unthinkable 10 years ago due to costs to deploy. Those other companies may try to do something similar in a few years time and cannibalize their existing sat constellations. Competition is inevitable, but I like AST's IP position with over 1,200 patent claims (which many hopefully will flip to granted patents). If you want to learn more about AST's approach to delivering broadband to an unmodified cell phone, watch this video:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3talrmxiQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF3talrmxiQ)\n\n4) AST did a reverse test.  They launched BlueWalker-1, which had a mobile phone, into space. They then communicated with that phone with BlueWalker-2, which was a test satellite that was here on earth.  By using this approach, they've been able to continually improve the design of the satellite system which will ultimately culminate into BlueWalker-3, which will be a slightly scaled down but full blown production satellite in March 2022.  \n\nThe company hasn't publicly released the testing results, HOWEVER BlueWalker-1's results were what Vodafone, Rakuten, Samsung and American Tower diligenced and led to their series B investments and ultimate PIPE investments.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the time and effort!\n\nI found the video on youtube as well.

We see the issues the World had with Starlink, these are very, very small at only 5m span, compared to this array...\n\nNext year they will launch the first array. If it is successful, there will be one.\n\nPage 32: Looking at their costs, currently, there is not enough cash on hand to build the first one and launch it. (the exact amount from the SPAC and capital raised to date exactly matches the cost for the first launch???)\n\nLets say that is true, so currently, they have no cash left, right? It has all gone to factory build and the prototype. They claim not to begin revenue generation until 2023...which I am not sure that one array can generate 9 million customers and $181M in rev.\n\nThat is asking alot from subscribers to add another monthly fee to their bill with very, very limited coverage (for many , many years)\n\nIt appears there will have to be a significant offering in Q1/Q2 simply to keep going and keep building arrays.\n\nTo the business model of providing coverage where none exists...\n\nThere are reasons, in many under or un-developed countries why there is no coverage, they simply have no money. Keep in mind, the ASTS fee is in addition to the cell phone providers fee, and of course, there is a cost of the cell phone itself. These cell phone companies provide cell phones and service where there is a market to pay for such.\n\nYes, it is nice when someone visits remote areas to have cell phone coverage, but I am not really sure that this is worth paying the extra costs for (especially with the very limited coverage)\n\nand really, until there is infrastructure in developing areas, I see no reason for a cell company to provide cell phones and service, simply for the ASTS add on.\n\nMy opinions:\n\nIts an interesting concept, but given the shear size and number of the required array, I see a regulatory hurdle. The time required to set up 200 of these is another big issue for me.\n\nI simply do not see the numbers of subscribers ramping up that fast, given that there is one array with limited coverage for a few minutes a day when it is overhead.\n\nAt a current $2.35Billion valuation...this company is at the pre-development, pre-testing, pre-approval and pre-revenue phase....there will be many more rounds of dilution, and the valuation leaves no upside for at least 10 years if even successful.\n\nSorry...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Origami unfolding mechanisms are the future of large arrays which is similar to what AST will be utilizing to unfold its large aperture.  You can find them on the internet.

Vodafone is the largest provider of service in this region, which is WHY they are working with AST.  They want more coverage in broader areas of these developing countries, HOWEVER building out towers and network infrastructure is prohibitively expensive.  The governments of these countries also want to connect their populations which is why AST and Vodafone have already received 6 licenses to operate.  The 18 satellites will provide full equatorial coverage... this is not intermittent service.  Anyhow best of luck.
