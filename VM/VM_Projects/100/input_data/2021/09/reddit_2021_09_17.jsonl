{"title": "Small Account (scalping trader) *Weekly Update (3)*", "selftext": "This is another weekly update on my small account challenge I started to share with the public on 8/24/21 ([initial reddit post available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/ph6gjf/is_this_scalping_style_sustainable_in_the/). Update 2 post is [directly available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pln76c/small_account_scalping_trader_weekly_update_2/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI took 7 trades this week. All 7 trades were winners.\n\nI'm at 31 winners / 1 losing trade out of the 32 combined. My win rate, according to TraderSync (a journaling system), is at 96.88%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/041emaawd3o71.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=491db6a7b7075fd0118afdfb69910552c86371df\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vjs736kxd3o71.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6bbae929245425e0cc76e49a47146df12659482\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8jcse6zd3o71.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=a45bed9cf2403a8795ec12e198cc174000c89bec\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rhcqusf0e3o71.png?width=915&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd3f9fc14063467f262c876663cb960ff497de9f\n\nI get it. The internet is huge. So is reddit. There will always be believers and non-believers. I don't even know why I am starting out with this type of tone if you will in my post today, but I think a lot of people want some kind of closure, something that allows them to see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to day-trading. It might be based on the fact that that some so-called \"day-traders\" are more successful than others. Some have tried it and failed miserably and consider it a strict gamble. Here's what I can tell you. Everything in life is truly a gamble. Drive a car to work, get into an accident and you could end up dead. Go to eat out at a restaurant while you're not aware of any allergies to shellfish, and you end up dead. You invest money long-term into the market and then decide to pull everything out at retirement because you're now old and ready to enjoy the rest of the final years of your life, but the market happens to plunge 75% - you're pretty much \"dead\" now because you've lost almost all of your money that you planned on retiring on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in terms of day-trading: Just don't gamble. DAY-TRADE. It is a LEARNED skill. Have a trading plan AND execute on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI personally don't ever expect anyone to prove to me how they trade or whether they're truly profitable or just trading on a paper account when I go over someone else's post/comment. I like to think of it as keeping an open mind. There is plenty to learn from other people, whether positively or negatively. The important thing is to learn and to improve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is how this small account challenge started. [Initially it started with $497.50](https://i.imgur.com/wZ8iQJU.png), but after 3 trades, I decided to add an additional 2,000 to make things more interesting and quicker. If you want to round it up, you can say that this challenge's debut was with 2,500.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a [snapshot of the recent entries](https://i.imgur.com/60aRUze.png) on the account statement if interested (or as proof).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4 weeks into this, I've netted $448, $572, $496 and $502 each of those weeks respectively (on a $2,500 account) after fees and commission. If I'm being completely vague on this, I could say I'm almost at 100% of profit trading for 160 minutes in total (32 trades taken, rounding up/down to 5 minutes per trade) the past 4 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone truly day-trading the past 4 weeks knows how this market has behaved. I consider this market a fun environment to day-trade in because of more increased volatility, especially right at market open. Remember, this is how I (prefer to) trade. You should adapt to your own trading style based on your own trading experience, knowledge, expertise, risk tolerance, trading capital and make it work for yourself. If you keep and are true to yourself, and continue to work on following YOUR trading plan, you can get there too. Nothing in life is easy. Give yourself plenty of time to learn this. This journey has no end. The goal is to be consistent and continue to grow the account over time. A steady rising equity curves is what you really want to help your proper mindset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are the 3 trades I took this morning alongside with my daily routine/thoughts:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in Central time zone. I woke up at 6:45am. Turned on the TV as I like to wake up listening to Squawk Box. Not necessarily for trading tips (we all know how bad their tips are), but mainly for potential news regarding upcoming FED talks, any kind of catalysts that might affect how the markets might behave this morning. I remained in bed listening, half asleep, half awake for approx. 45 minutes while checking on other things on my phone (emails, schedule of the day, read up on some other people's reddit posts for entertainment and to get my mind to literally wake up). Now it's 7:30. Time to get up. I proceed to go brush my teeth, take my morning dump and head over to the trading station. 8:05am, I'm now just sitting there sipping on coffee. Getting my mind ready to go over my own trading rules. I repeat them on a daily basis to set the right expectations, the right mindset. It is important to follow a routine.\n\n8:20, I launch my thinkorswim platform, then I continue to sip on coffee while I literally watch the red countdown of the remaining 5 minutes before market bell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoing long on AMZN was almost a no-brainer to me. If you stick to certain tickers that you watch and follow daily, you understand that AMZN has behaved differently in recent days than some other QQQ components. Always keep an eye out of the price of the options you're about to buy in as a scalping trader. Your risk is set at ENTRY. I jumped in with 3 contracts on 3600 Calls expiring next week at 4.30 a pop., sold them about 2 minutes later for 4.70. Yes, money is always left on the table (went as high as 5.76), but as a scalping trader you should be more focused on what happens most of the time (aka most mornings, most market opens), not what can possibly be an outlier move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that initial quick $120 gain, I can now simply take a look at my other watchlist tickers, scroll through them with a glance and see if I cannot spot another trading opportunity. I immidiately noticed FB and AAPL and had high interest in playing both short. I ended up deciding going with AAPL just because of recent (negative) news, especially with market weak on this Friday. I jumped in on 5 contracts at 1.63 and set my exit price for just 15 cents higher, and simply wait for it to fill me, but 4 minutes into the trade, I realize it might take a little longer for that push further down, so I adjust my fill price for just 10 cents, and get out of the trade. No need to worry how much extra I could have made, etc, etc. That is not helping you as a scalping trader for your mindset long-term. Just enter a trading opportunity and execute your exit as needed based on your trading plan. I don't mind taking $50 from AAPL in 4 minutes because I know I could do that over and over and those $50 bills do stack up quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast trade I took was simply just to make back the commission fees I spent today on both preceeding scalp trades on AMZN and AAPL. I decide to play for a rebound on AAPL with a weekly call option expiring today. It was pretty much ATM. 7-10 cents scalp there would have easily paid for the commission today. Again, it turns out, it wasn't moving quick enough for me, so I bail on the trade just a minute or two later. Still profitable, trade literally does not bother me at all. I already made what I think is a healthy/hefty amount for this morning trading for what, perhaps 10 minutes total in 3 trades. I'll just continue doing this every morning, every day, with the same routine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope by sharing this today can help and motivate some other traders, especially if they haven't performed well this week from their own trading. I embrace every market condition every morning. Market could open green or red and it doesn't bother me the slighest. Going into each trade with the right mindset is immensely helpful and a much required skill to learn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's really crazy is, I've already spent a little over 1.5 hours literally writing up this update post, along with getting screenshots together and making the post looking nice and neat than it takes me to do my actual daily trades.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's hope I help more than 1 person out there achieve better trading with this.", "id": "pq3qvu", "created_utc": 1631896893.0, "score": 330, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 187, "comments": [{"body": "Very interesting post, from what you’ve written your trading style is mostly based on intuition?

I've tried it myself and I have failed miserably at it too. But on a serious note what makes you question that it is not possible? If you haven't been able to show 5 or 10 consecutive trades to be profitable, I think you may need to revise your trading strategy to get to that point.

Nothing beats actively watching stuff move and unfold right in front of you.\n\nStick to a few stocks. If you really want to be anal about it, just pick 1 stock. Preferably a NASDAQ stock, so take AMD for instance. Watch it every market open for say 30 minutes and see if you can't grasp how it tends to move right at open, 5 minutes into it, how much of a move it's capable of making. Some days it tends to open lower only to cancel out the direction and end day higher, some days it tends to run up for 7 minutes only to give back all its gains. There is a lot to learn from a stock's movement by simply watching it over and over.\n\nThen, have some capital set aside, and start to trade very small (can't get smaller than 1 contract, but you can go as low as 1 share and continually increase it to more if you plan to trade its stock).

It's very spontaneous from the moment I spot 3 trading opportunities on 3 tickers on my watchlist. I immediately drop 2 within a second of a thought if you will, then completely shift focus to THAT ONE trading opportunity. At that time I already have a good idea if I want to go long or short. I immediately proceed to look at the option chain, figure out which strike I want based on its price, how many contracts, then simply am ready to watch that BID/ASK of it so I know the price range immediately. Seconds later, I am in the trade (hopefully and typically) at a much lower price, so I can immediately exit the trade if the move has happened, and that is how she wrote it. I don't really look back after the trade is done because I know I probably left money on the table LOL. But I then just immediately shift my mindset back to, okay, trade done, is there another trading opportunity? Back to the other 2 I had earlier...go from there.

I stopped buying copper when the minimum purchase was increased beyond $650 per order with my supplier.\n\nThe other problem is getting your money back out of it.  The “official” buyers will pay a value well UNDER spot.  Usually these are the same companies selling it to you so them make their money on both ends.  An example:  I bought $350 worth of copper rounds back in 2007.  Paid 75 cents a round or so on average.  The copper value was around 34 cents a round.  I sold them on eBay until interest had dried up.  I got enough to cover fees, shipping, the original cost and around a 25-30 cent per round profit.

{"title": "Is waiting for a dip the best strategy? - I analyzed last 3 decades of market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market!", "selftext": "We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”\n\nAt the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was\n\n**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**\n\n**Analysis**\n\nFor this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you\n\na. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year\n\nb. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year\n\nc. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year\n\nd. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \\[1\\]  \n\nFor analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side and never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&P500 \\[2\\]. For investment amount, let consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and for every subsequent year increased your investments by 5%. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  \n\n**Results**\n\n**Investment Returns : S&P 500 (1993-2021)**\n\n|**Scenario**|**Return**|\n|:-|:-|\n|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|\n|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|\n|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|\n|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|\n|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|\n\n \n\nThe analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.\n\nThe most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \\[3\\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      \n\nIf you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.\n\nOut of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.\n\nWhile this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are\n\na. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.\n\nb. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f96f61-9b99-4d4a-b6cd-88eece3ecc1d_624x241.png)\n\n As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.\n\nFor e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.     \n\nIt is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \\[4\\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.\n\nIf you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.\n\n*Data used in the analysis:* [*here*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LT3qazGZXHT3qnnBS7oWAZU8n8DH1gv-JsCixN2mdPM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n \n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] I have considered the [following crashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stock_market_crashes_and_bear_markets) for the analysis: Dotcom crash (2000), Sep 11 (2001), market downturn 2002, Housing market crash (2008), 2011 stock market fall, 2015–16 stock market selloff, 2018 crypto crash, Corona Virus crash (2020)\n\n\\[2\\] The data for the adjusted close for S&P 500 from 1993 to 2021 was obtained from [Yahoo Finance API](https://rapidapi.com/blog/how-to-use-the-yahoo-finance-api/).

Just like the stock market 90% of people have no idea how to master the mind of an intelligent unemotional investor.\n\nWhy is everyone obsessed with immediate gains? That's a question I ask myself. It makes markets dangerous trust me. Do people realize that stocks and indexes don't always go up? Sometimes they end the year negative? Also realize that indexes and stocks have baked in years worth of gains. The chances of 10% returns on indexes over the next 5 years are very slim. Probabilities are everything. Chances of your Gold going up during a crisis be it deflationary or inflationary are high. Chances of your Gold going up 20% over the next 2 years are about 72% chance.\n\nPlease answer this question: Would you still regret that purchase if it had gone up 20% since you bought it? My guess is no you wouldn't have.

{"title": "Paysafe will triple easily from here. Next PAYPAL SQUARE>>", "selftext": "Legal online sports betting has made its mark on the US gaming industry as GeoComply records its highest four day stretch of geolocation transactions ever recorded. The company supports nearly 100% of the US online sports betting market and, according to its data, legal online sports betting in the country has reached new heights. The data is already out in public, you can only get in now before its too late. \n\n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-betting-arizona-geocomply-sports-betting-record-high/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-betting-arizona-geocomply-sports-betting-record-high/)\n\nAlso, according to an interview done by the CEO, Q4 transactions reached record volumes that he has ever seen. Paysafe currently has 100% of Canada's only betting market and 75% of US betting market. Its main revenue comes from NFL, EPL and IPL (US, UK, and INDIA Cricket League). All of which started its season this month. Its volume will triple in Q4 and MM is shorting to drive retail out in Q3, this stock will easily triple from its 2020 30% revenue increment not counting US market.\n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=psfe+earnings&client=ms-android-samsung-rev2&source=android-browser&sxsrf=AOaemvI7inTIJws3m-o9A6KvgyMuhp98Fg%3A1631844649794&ei=KflDYb_xL4ewrQG1vaaQDQ&oq=psfe+earnings&gs_lcp=ChNtb2JpbGUtZ3dzLXdpei1zZXJwEAMyBAgAEEcyBAgAEEcyBAgAEEcyBAgAEEcyBAgAEEcyBAgAEEcyBAgAEEcyBAgAEEdQAFgAYJDdB2gAcAF4AIABAIgBAJIBAJgBAMgBCMABAQ&sclient=mobile-gws-wiz-serp\n\nAny check on google will show it has exclusive partnership with twitch, epic games, dkng, coinbase, and etc.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QtAm\\_Ezkv8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QtAm_Ezkv8)\n\nLooking at a larger basket of comps with a collective growth rate of \\~12.5% (not far from Paysafe’s minimum 10.6% projection) here are valuations based on PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, bill, GPN, and Paysign among others:\n\nPaysafe’s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\nAfter eliminating outliers with highest multiples:\n\nEV/EBITDA ratio :$50.75\n\nEV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n\nEV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage :$46.52\n\nNotes:\n\n1. Unlike Paysafe, around half of these competitors report negative EBITDA growth and a third report negative EBITDA and negative free cash flow.\n2. Used low end of Paysafe's projections and factored in debt and high-end of potential dilution.\n3. As noted Paysafe’s 10.6% rev growth projection excludes planned inorganic M&A growth and projected 55% CAGR iGaming growth, which constitutes a third of their revenue.\n4. The above comps were taken during a sector-wide pull-back and do not reflect recent fintech gains since Jamie Dimon’s \"enormous competitive threats\" comment.\n\nThis is not any financial advice, but I am just a nerd that all in on Paysafe at 8.2. Only when we unite, we become stronger and earn from short sellers. GME took 1 year to run from 3 to 300. Psfe has positive net income + cpypt wallet + igaming market. I am ULTRA LONG here so if you want to 10x your money here's your chance.\n\nBtw, Grasso tweeted and hes still holding for his 45 pt too. Affirm has recently gap up 100%, and greensky acquired by GM at 4x rev with declining rev YOY. PAYSAFE has a 20% increment rev YOY if accounting for divested product. The shakeout continues but you have a greater upside now :).\n\nEasily from my calculation, 10% shorts are trapped, and long holders are ultra long holders. Blackstone, CVC, blackrock, cannae, dan loeb and many more. Any momentum here will send this to 30 ish imo. Do your own DD. UNLIKE WISH SOFI OR ANY OTHER TICKERS PUMPERS POST HERE, PSFE reveneue increased 20% yoy, igaming up 50%, book net income positive for the first time, and exceed analyst expectations. ALIGHT another blackstone and cannae ticker, experienced the same event, went down to 8.2 and rose all the way up to 13 on 5% rev increment. PSFE has 20% :)\n\nFor comparison sake, IRNT has 6m rev down 20% YOY at 2b Market capt while PSFE has 1.55b rev up 20% YOY at 6b Market capt. 3x market capt at > 100x rev and upside YOY.", "id": "pppocj", "created_utc": 1631838831.0, "score": 270, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|20|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pppocj/paysafe_will_triple_easily_from_here_next_paypal/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p9v59t/paysafe_pt2/) \n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/Curious-Interest-734, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Slowly adding PSFE every couple of weeks", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "this is the way.

{"title": "Is this really happening? 461% short interest (according to ortex)", "selftext": "Note: I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice. I just like this stock.\n\n\nWell, I’m sure we’ve all heard about the rise and (slight) fall in IRNT today… but this data looks insane if correct.\n\nIRNT has a share lockup for the vast majority of their float. I will link to my sources after I post, I just want to get this out there to get some feedback from some of the more wrinkle brained apes…\n\nIRNT float is 47 million shares. SPAC lockup reduced the float to 1.3 million shares. SPAC lockup’s typically last for 180 days - the lock up period began on 8/26/21. So essentially the float will remain at 1.3 million for over 5 months.\n\nOrtex data from today is estimating the current SI at 6 million shares. All of their data up to this point has been based on a float of 47 million shares. You can verify this by looking at the estimated current % of FF being 16.07% at 6 million shares. 16% of 47 million is ~7.5 million, so that’s close enough as far as I’m concerned.\n\nSo, if ortex information is anything close to being accurate (and by god I hope it is), then if there are 6 million shares shorted on a 1.3 million share float, that brings the short interest % to 461% 😳\n\nSome other noteworthy items are the 100% utilization, CTB average at 855.13%, and ~20x the average daily volume adjusted for today (if you look at avg. daily volume before today, it was 2.3M shares traded, so we would almost be up 30x volume compared to yesterday).\n\nAlso, IRNT has been on the Threshold securities list since 9/2. People smarter than I have pointed out that a squeeze is likely (but not guaranteed) to happen next week. I assume this is due to all the call options that will be ITM (apparently there are enough ITM options that would need to be hedged that would exceed the 1.3 million float). This buying pressure, combined with the excessively high CTB will likely cause shorts to cover and create a gamma and short squeeze like no other.\n\nPlease, correct me if any of this information is wrong. And please bare with me while I try to link the sources to this post. This is my first Reddit “text post” and I’m not sure how to link images, so I will attempt to figure that out now.\n\nAlso, the shill bots are going crazy in WeBull chat today (way more than they were in the past couple days). The stock was also shorted like crazy AH into close.\n\n\nIf true, this is big.\n🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n\n[WeBull post from today - share lockup info, float size, and more](https://www.reddit.com/r/irnt/comments/ppq98z/found_in_webull_chat_today_share_lockup/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n\n[Ortex Data from today (September 16, 2021)](https://www.reddit.com/r/irnt/comments/ppq9ok/ortex_data_from_today_thursday_916/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) \n\n\nEDIT: Invest at your own risk. Again, this is not financial advice, merely speculation. I do have a small position in the stock / options that I opened today, but if this is true then I plan to buy more.\n\n\nEDIT 2: A Reddit user has kindly provided some counter DD that has changed my position on this idea. There will be 5.2 million warrants redeemable on 9/27, which will dilute the float by about 3x. It seems the short interest will be below or at 100% so I’m not loving the play after all. \n\nI thought we may have found something flying under the radar based on data not being congruent, but I have since changed my position. I’ll still hold my calls JUST IN CASE, but be advised this is risky AF at this price point.\n\nGood luck in the markets!", "id": "ppqhvv", "created_utc": 1631841959.0, "score": 157, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|123|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I am too late to this?

{"title": "GME is about to fuk u with its negative beta.", "selftext": "Greetings to the most intelligent people on the planet!\n\nI've been playing with GME and the other charts recently, and it all accumulated into a massive piece of delicious TA,  which I didn't really plan to post to WSB originally - because I felt like some of the honorable WSB residents might be a little tired from that particular stonk. However, after seening [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pppfro/tmc_spotted_the_cock_and_balls_upside_down_head/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pph9f0/as_you_can_see_tmc_is_forming_a_classic_nut_sack/) beautiful examples of intellectual superiority, I just couldn't resist sharing my hard work with you, dear WSB!(If you, dear reader, are the one who is fed up with GME, then I would recommend you stop reading now and follow the two links above to appreciate HQ TA on other stonks).\n\nFor those, who stayed - enjoy the read!\n\nIt all started from my “L'Oreal shampoo commercial”-like hair bet post, where, in its third chapter, I was theorizing about GME's negative beta (particularly in light of the late January events, when the buy button was disabled) and the current general market setup - how it might influence subsequent GME moves. So, I decided to dive deeper into those correlations and deviations between the price movements of GME and other major assets, using January sneeze as the starting point. This led me to a fascinating, tits-jacking discovery that points at the upcoming inevitable volatile price action!\n\nBuckle up for the TA journey of your life, let’s ~~dive~~ fly in!\n\nOh, almost forgot to quote Jack Black:\n\n>“This is not the financial advice, no.  \n>  \n>This is just a tribute.  \n>  \n>Couldn't remember becoming a financial advisor, no.  \n>  \n>This is a tribute, oh, to the greatest stonk in the world, alright!”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst things first, it’s a good idea therefore to revisit **late Jan events**, which in my opinion was the moment of revelation and a preview of inevitable storm, when:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I. The North Remembers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME v VIX v SP, 30 min chart](https://preview.redd.it/yu1zzckpa2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e10bd82e172e82ea16a68da5c9c4a9c3e07f70ff)\n\n* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,\n* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a single day,\n* and injuring SP badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, the thesis should sound something like GME🆙VIX🆙=SP🆘, and vice versa. It will be developed further in the next chapters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, quoting my bet post here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, I should recommend  you reading u/peruvian_bull Endgame series, and/or u/Criand the Bigger Short in order to develop the understanding of the fundamental processes taking place under the hood of the financial markets. To sum up the core idea: the financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standards, it is heading to the next, coming soon, financial crisis. And, in my opinion, what you can see on the charts above, was a sneak peak of the house of cards collapsing. Disabling the buy button was the only option for the big moni guys to stop (or rather to postpone) the system failing miserably. By bringing this dirty trick into play they were able to ~~buy~~ steal some time, which was necessary for deploying emergency measures and urgent market mechanisms (such as new DTCC/NSCC rules) - which, in turn, are aimed at mitigating the inevitable financial hail**shit**storm, ready to hit the fans.\n\nThere is a plenty of outstanding fundamentals DD on that topic (start from clicking profiles in the paragraph above). As for me, I am the TA type of a wrincle-brained ape, so...\n\nLet me speak from my ~~heart~~ charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# II. Negative beta more beautiful than Catherine Zeta\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start from something that you must have heard about many times, but did you really dive into GME exceptional beta? So, what's that thing and why is it so negative? For the sake of saving my and your time, let me quote the almighty Inve**stop**edia:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In investing, beta does not refer to fraternities, product testing, or old videocassettes. Beta is a measurement of market risk or volatility. That is, it indicates how much the price of a stock tends to fluctuate up and down compared to other stocks.  \n>  \n>The value of any stock index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, moves up and down constantly. At the end of the trading day, we conclude that \"the markets\" were up or down. An investor considering buying a particular stock may want to know whether that stock moves up and down just as sharply as stocks in general. It may be inclined to hold its value on a bad day or get stuck in a rut when most stocks are rising; whereas the beta is the number that measures a stock's volatility, the degree to which its price fluctuates in relation to the overall stock market. In other words, it gives a sense of the stock's risk compared to that of the greater market's.  \n>  \n>Beta is used also to compare a stock's market risk to that of other stocks. Analysts use the Greek letter 'ß' to represent beta.Beta is calculated using regression analysis. A beta of 1 indicates that the security's price tends to move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the security's price tends to be more volatile than the market. A beta of less than 1 means it tends to be less volatile than the market.  \n>  \n>**Negative beta**: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely.\n\nEssentially, negative beta asset is an asset that tends to move in the opposite direction from the general market. Famous precious metal is one of the good examples: gold and gold stocks have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines. That is exactly the reason why investors cherish this asset in the turbulent time of recessions, market crashes and corrections, or general uncertainty and volatility - historically gold tends to perform well during such periods, providing the 'safe heaven' to market participants and acting as a hedge. Noice, but this turbulent time we have something special on the horizon.\n\n\\*\\*Le wild negative beta unicorn appears\\*\\*\n\n[Captain GME to gold](https://preview.redd.it/rpv734w9c2o71.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&s=56080fa590e5ecb6f65ad1a72329cd4d12569014)\n\nMany of you must have seen -ß posts, but math and numbers are for geniuses, retards only understand crayons and visuals, so...\n\nLadies and gentleapes, with the great pleasure I present you the new negative beta king:\n\n[GME v SP, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/iwtaoohhc2o71.jpg?width=2039&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67b2824b31bf155c6f7d5f992c5141f67a82cdfb)\n\nWhat you see on the chart above is a vivid illustration of GME's negative beta behavior, which commenced during/after the January sneeze. As for SP, the stable uptrend with the minor corrections is evident, while the asset is achieving ATHs on a regular basis. Looking at the GME now and connecting its highs with the median line, we may observe the opposite trend, as the line is descending. All in all, there is a big-ass convergence manifesting between the two assets, which most probably will result in the increased volatility and the explosive GME breakout / trend reversal for SP. Who will blink first?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME v SP daily chart + Tower of Pisa](https://preview.redd.it/3fiwmwwqc2o71.jpg?width=2033&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63ecddcaa4651b946a4df8541409c8d8e547d435)\n\nNext, take a look at this chart. Don't worry about GME's Pisa offset here, as it is insignificant for the point I'm making (and I had some struggles overlaying the charts in this case). If the previous chart indicates a longer term negative correlation, the one above is like a zoom in: there is an obvious series of divergences and convergences highlighted yellow and blue respectively, which illustrate negative beta again, but on a smaller scale and with local trends. As you can see, as soon a GME bullrun commences and accelerates, SP dips, and vice versa. I hope, that the examples provided are persuasive, and that they helped you to reach the same conclusion as I did, namely: sstonk goes up when stonks go down, while when stonks go up, GME is suppressed = GME🆙SP🆘. Should that correlation continue manifesting itself (which I'm pretty damn confident it will), the exciting times are on the way.\n\nOk, so 🆙🆘 is a simple concept, but why is it important, you may ask.\n\nWell, that's why:\n\n[SP, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/6b41eaewc2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ae4bdc7758ecdbc84425e6ea567e1d4243f9e1)\n\nSP has been forming a powerful bearish technical formation called the rising wedge, through the past year and a half. Currently it is narrowing down, and the point of breakout is not far away - typically it is to the downside for such a technical setup. Add GME with its negative beta to this equation - if you know, you know.\n\n[SP 4H chart, I called it ‘Head of Penis’ formation ](https://preview.redd.it/sbs9va8od2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce9b57e1a6fa2020ac1c91218ad5d462ceda5d07)\n\nBut wait, there’s more!\n\n[SP, monthly chart ](https://preview.redd.it/1goqfoa2e2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e3eefcd4720f38907877a2791ea642c3955122b5)\n\nIn one of my TA longwrites, the Big Short 2.0, I identified a beautiful, long term, juicy Elliott 1-2-3-4-5 impulse wave structure on SP, take a look! The investors are currently riding the top of the fifth wave, which is usually the most fun, euphoric and crazily risky. Everything in the nature works in cycles, and all the things that go up, must go down eventually! Considering the current bullrun being one of the (if not THE) most powerful and longest bullruns in history, you can imagine how nasty the retrace may look this time. Especially, when you take into account the fact that current financial markets are filled with shitty synthetic derivatives, excessive leverage of a bad quality, unthinkable level of risk, and... plain fucking crime. The financial world is craving for the correction (like Sahara for rainfall) and a proper bear market, as the deleveraging will make it healthier, and maybe, just maybe, it will bring price discovery back to life from the grave where it has been rolling for I don’t know how long.\n\nMan, I wish there was a safe heaven asset that would protect me from the upcoming financial typhoon, the price of which would move the opposite way from the overdue nasty correction on all financial markets, which have been enjoying the most powerful bullrun in history for more than ten fucking years... Oh, wait!\n\n[Vasco da Gama can’t be wrong ](https://preview.redd.it/gt1rnbz7e2o71.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f6db503236cce3d87f8c4511221e8b5e30f91bb)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# III. Chew it Over with VIX\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext, let’s talk about Volatility Index - what I noticed recently, is that VIX is often being neglected in the TA discussions, and in general also, so it’s a good idea to show it some love. Especially since GME and VIX correlate to a considerable fucking extent, but later on that.\n\nTo begin with,\n\n[VIX, monthly chart ](https://preview.redd.it/1fcd3vlge2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78c23f899b3d623552b4b402c0abe74266108223)\n\nThe chart above is provided for the visual explanation of how this instrument behaves. In short, markeds kaboom TWIX wroom wroom. In essence, the Cboe Volatility Index is a market sentiment tracking index that represents the market participants expectations for volatility over the coming 30 days. Volatility, or the severity of price fluctuations, is usually helpful to gauge market sentiment, particularly the degree of fear and uncertainty spreading on the financial markets. Investors use VIX to measure the level of risk, fear, or stress in the market when making investment decisions. It is an important index in the world of finance because it provides a quantifiable measure of market risk and investors' sentiments.\n\nAnd who would have guessed, throughout the year VIX spikes have been accompanying almost every single GME major run, but for one:\n\n[GME v VIX, daily log chart](https://preview.redd.it/ksd03p5pe2o71.jpg?width=1969&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=835dee5dd6c8b5367088857995e01a720f41f13a)\n\nJust one major outlier to that tandem is late November 2020 run. Speaking of outliers, also VIX middle of June 2021 spike seems to stand out from the crowd, as there is no relevant proportionate positive price action on the GME side. Outside of those two occasions, the correlational behaviour of these two instruments is evident. Moreover, VIX and GME runs correlate to the extent that their peaks match time-wise in several run ups. Furthermore, take a look at how starting 2021 four out of five major VIX spikes correspond with the occasions when GME’s price action was trialling $230-ish level (margin call level, it seems) - the price territory, around which my concept of the ‘Purple Haze’ resistance (“break to initiate the squeeze”) is established, refer to the short squeezes comparisons post to explore the concept. The correlational behaviour described above, to my understanding, points at two big conclusions: the first and the most obvious one, is GME🆙VIX🆙; secondly, it seems that GME is currently the biggest risk for the market! - too much synchronicity is present between the two, for this to be a mere coincidence. Remember, VIX represents volatility, fear and stress - wut feelin Kenny?\n\nOh, and did I mention?\n\n[VIX, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/q0hb68xue2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bcfaadcd5304e1c57307f4b954759dd402f33f8)\n\nDuring the year and a half, the instrument’s price action has been consolidating into a beautiful bullish formation, called the descending wedge - which is exactly the opposite of what SP is consolidating into. VIX descending wedge + SP rising wedge + GME🆙VIX🆙SP🆘, quick math, and\n\n[We get an ape’s best friend, Gator the Bubbles Deflator \\(the Greater\\).](https://preview.redd.it/2fzj2pdye2o71.jpg?width=2032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecbdb4676a65c16dee75b9d3613fde91cecf7335)\n\nIf you know, you know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# IV. This is the tits-jacking part. Achtung! You have been warned!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright, that was quiet a TA journey. I hope that the discussion above helped you to build the solid understanding of what's happening on broader financial markets and how those correlations and tendencies are affecting GME price action, and will probably add the fuel to the rocket in the upcoming major GME moves. Now, the focus of the discussion is back on the GME current TA status quo! (yeah, finally!) And, what can I say, it is so fucking juicy!\n\nFirstly, let me remind you about this TA of mine, which aged like a fine wine:\n\n[GME, daily log chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ibiauo96f2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4645e967977f6c91ad71f07546993dc6140fda1)\n\nThe log chart support above proved itself to be an ape's ultimate best friend! As you can see, during the year, each time the price action approached the lower support, a sharp re-bounce followed - August and September confirmed the price line as THE most important support, manifesting the steadfast buying pressure. That pressure is currently confronting the most important resistance for GME in 2021 (magenta line). The battle will be legendary! (Hint: remember the current market setups discussed in II, and III, and the correlations? Based solely on that, what do you think the GME breakout will look like?)\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's change the viewing ~~tri~~angle:\n\n[GME, daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/nii0wtvhf2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d29dc68d5034aa1a8258a22dae522f241ab3b196)\n\nHm, looks familiar. I swear, I must have seen this TA setup before! Oh...\n\n[AMC, daily chart - 4 months old analysis ](https://preview.redd.it/aahe793pf2o71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce50af7363612d218d3f98ba410416dbc1e3cbdd)\n\nTake a look at beautiful triangular wedge formations at the core of each chart. Retardos love triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarnate the flattening of the price accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is theatre stonk’s price action after the breakout. \\*\\* GME: \"Hold my beer\" \\*\\* I'm pretty much convinced, that the triangle on GME chart above is how the Mother Of All Triangles must look like.\n\nButth waaitt, therrz moooore!

What do you think, fellow professional investors?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: there is a strong correlational behaviour which goes like GME🆙VIX🆙SP500🆘, and which is evident when you overlay and compare the charts. According to the current ‘the everything GME’ market setup, GME is ready to moon fuelled by the upcoming massive VIX spike and the sharp SP 500 !negative beta rulez! correction (which is way overdue already, as the rally is longer than 10 years and SP is craving the proper bear market). Based on the TA outlook, the moment of revelation is just around the corner... There is only one safe heaven to protect investors from the upcoming financial typhoon, which goes by the name GME, so buckle the fuck up, shrinky brain astronauts primates!

Your bot says the market cap is 537,337,500 which would mean a share price of $12.46 (537,337,500/43,125,000)- which I believe was the value close to when the bot posted (always a little room for error).\n\nPost the ticker swap to VLTA, the new share amount is [143,694,315 shares of Class A Common Stock and 10,023,107 shares of Volta Class B Common Stock ](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001819584/000121390021046178/ea146705-8k_voltainc.htm) which is roughly 153m shares. [Marketwatch has it as 152m](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/vlta).

But back to the original gamma squeeze idea:\n\nThis Friday (today) we were supposed to close above $12.50 to really fuck with MMs and ThetaGangers as there were way more calls than the public float could afford.

As previously stated, taking this into account gives us the 2.7M public share float that will be locked up until dilution.\n\nDilution? Yes dilution of the shares are presented in the SEC document stating that they will issue 5M more shares after trading above $15 dollars for 20+ days. The SEC filing also states further dilution at higher strikes after major upswings. Theoretically, until this company's shares are gamma or short squeezed (or naturally grows as a company), ***we are stuck with a 2.7M public share float.***\n\n# Opinions\n\nBut we didn't close above $12.5 today, so the play is over right?  Those calls are worthless? Well **no and yes** there's a lot of hopium and copium at this point. The major shitting on MMs and bears at the guillotine won't happen today, but who knows what could happen next week? The volume of next months calls and November calls have increased exponentially.
