{"title": "10-Bagger Index Plays for an X-Mas Rally", "selftext": "#10:1 Index Plays for the X-Mas Rally\n\nComing off of a similar correction this time last year lead us to a strong year-end rally. Tom Lee of Fundstrat sees this year being even bigger. These are 8 index positions that can be used to chase 10:1 returns.\n\n-XLY or XRT: Retail and consumer discretionary has been hanging out in a tight range since March '21. XLY is a better pick leaning into names that crushed last quarter and will likely do it again (TGT, WMT, MCD, LOW). XRT gets an honorable mention but it's more heavily weighted towards newer, growthier names like Etsy, Doordash, and CarMax, so I'm not as into it. That said, both will make great plays for the holiday season.\n\nRecommending XLY $205C 01/2022, costs $1.02 (XLY is currently $184.89), becomes a 10-bagger if XLY sees +16% by January (The period between September 25th and January 21st of last year yielded +20%, despite the market being shaky at the time). \n\nComparatively, the XRT $100C 01/2022 (costs 3.3 at the time of writing) would require a *40% gain in XRT* to achieve that same 10-bagger. At best, you could try the XRT $110's (1.05) but that would still require a +27% move - That IV is no bueno. \n\n-SMH or QQQ: Semi's are a no-brainer here. We're about to have a bounce-back to ATH- that's most always driven by semi's. QQQ works too if you're a basic vanilla hoe.\n\nRecommending SMH $305C/$325C 01/2022 (costs 2.12), max return ~10:1 if the SMH can rise +19% before January. \n\nOf course if you're riding the Q's you can grab QQQ $410C/$425C 01/2022 for 1.48, offering a 10:1 return if QQQ can rise +13.5% by the new year. \n\n-DIA or XLF: I'm not huge into banks so I would be more likely to grab the DIA here, but if you're a believer that inflation is going to be more than transitory, you want either of these value baskets in your portfolio. \n\nRecommending DIA $375C/$390C 01/2022, payout ~10:1 if we get +10% out of the DIA.\n\nIf you're more interested in banks specifically, you can grab the 01/2022 $40C for .94 and pray for a *31%* rally to $50 - which would be your (unlikely) 10-bagger. \n\n-IWM: #1 Component in the IWM is a dead movie theater company, so this makes a great put hedge in a long-biased portfolio. I don't think we're really correcting this year, but if we are, and SPY goes -10%, IWM is going waaay further. \n\nRecommending IWM $190P/$180P 01/2022. Costs $1.05, ~10:1 return if IWM drops -19%.\n\n-SPY: Last one and most obvious, but you HAVE to buy SPY OTM spreads on a dip like this. You'd literally be stupid not to. \n\nRecommending 480/490C 01/2022, payout ~10:1. That's a ten-bagger if we get 10% out of SPY over the next four months. \n\nThe idea here is to have a portfolio that is both concise and diverse, using options that have a reasonable OI, high rate of return, and a reasonable probability of happening. If you were only correct about 1/8 plays, you would still be profitable. \n\nTl;Dr:\n\n01/2022 Index plays for 10:1 returns in order of smallest to largest required price move:\n\nSPY $480C/$490C, +10% (Highly recommended)\n\nDIA $375C/$390C, +10% (Highly recommended)\n\nQQQ $410C/$425C, +13.5%\n\nXLY $205C, +16%\n\nSMH $305C/$325C, +19%\n\nIWM $190P/$180P, -19%\n\nXRT $110C, +27% (Not recommended)\n\nXLF $40C +31% (Not recommended)", "id": "pvh1gh", "created_utc": 1632609027.0, "score": 267, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 192, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for posting this.\n\n> SPY $480C/$490C, +10% (Highly recommended)\n\nBased on recent trends, 10% on SPY in 3mo is technically possible but requires buying at the absolute low in the time range and selling at the max, which is basically impossible to time IMHO.

Even if we're talking about price moves that we feel are unlikely, this style of trading has lead me to consistent gains.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I am very happy for you and your fiance being able to make a living trading options; not many people have the time, intelligence nor opportunity to do so. That being said, while I respect your credentials, I am sharing with you my perspective as a grad student of quantitative finance and while I'm not asking you to change your strategy per se, I would like to share with you where I am coming from mathematically.\n\nLet's take the example you gave. Say I have a die and every time I roll a 6 I make or lose $5, and for every other roll I make or lose $1. Given my two choices are I can bet on 1-5 or 6, the expected value of any given dice roll is +-(5(.17*1)) +- (.17*5) = 0. This is the same hypothesis that runs the options market - the expected value of a trade is exactly what is given to you by the pricing of the option. If your spread is $100, then you are expected to have a 90% chance of losing $100 and a 10% chance of making $900 which puts your EV at 0 and right back at where you started. Similarly, if a $900 spread implies a 90% chance to make $100 and a 10% chance to lose $900, your EV is once again 0.\n\nSo, you may ask me then, what does it matter which spread I choose? If the expected value is 0 either way, then it doesn't matter what I choose. And I'd say, if you were to discretionally trade (AKA choose your plays off of \"feel\"), which it seems like is how you make your trades, then I would say it doesn't matter because in the long run you will more than likely have a realized profit of 0. Where the arbitrage lies is being able to find signals and trading opportunities to boost the EV of your trade. If I, for instance, can discover an opportunity that gives allows me to make $100 on my spread 91% of the time and only lose $900 **9%** of the time, out of 100 trades, suddenly I now have an EV of +$1000. The process of analyzing data and discovering signals in the market is in essence the foundation of quantitative trading, and it, in my opinion, is the only way to consistently produce a positive EV and be a *long term* successful trader. I say this because there is simply no way that you and your fiance alone have more data, knowledge, and resources than any and every hedge fund in the world and should be able to conclusively decide that your 480/490 SPY spread is undervalued. Its expected return is exactly what its price is indicating.\n\nNo offense, but it looks to me as if you just thought about some plays in the shower and convinced yourself that they were worth taking. It looks like you arbitrarily chose 10% OTM and 10-width just because it's a round number. All I'm saying is that if you truly do this for a living, you owe it to yourself to apply more conviction to your trades through statistical tests and mathematical bases. The arbitrage in my own personal strategy lies in the market giving me the \"odds\", so to speak, on any given debit spread, and I choose the width, expiration and strikes based off of mid-short term trends and backtesting with factors such as seasonality, bond pricing, news sentiment, volatility, etc., and allocate more or less money depending on the confidence produced by my model. Maybe you are some trading guru and the \"charts just speak to you\", but I think you would agree with me that whatever you are doing is not enough effort nor is it advanced enough to deserve you 1000% gains.

The difference in regulation alone is magnanimous. I draw ire with this comparison because it's analogous to the classic \"You're never gonna get consistent income because funds have a hard time getting [insert shitty return here]\" literally the worst argument that people love to repeat - like lol I guess no individual trader is profitable /s.

I respect that you first and foremost do not trade off of silly chart drawings and hysterics, but my point is that there are millions of \"players\", if you will, that you are competing against every day by trading. There are trillions of dollars being thrown at obtaining the best data, the brightest minds, and the most dedicated of traders, as well as thousands of man hours all for a chance to gain a 1% edge.

Not disagreeing with you, and it's more of a rhetorical question, but you should be asking yourself this and be able to articulate the answer to that question further than something along the lines of \"I see no negative catalysts and am bullish.\" It is an incredibly confident outlook and if that is really what you believe, it makes no sense to then have a hedge so far OTM in the opposite direction like an IWM spread 19% below its current price. If someone is confident enough in believing the market will rally that much, then they cannot simultaneously believe it will dump equally in the opposite direction.

Because that isn't the only cause of inflation, but is the short-hand explanation we give to high school students to pass a vocab test. Might I suggest actually *reading* the entry on inflation on Investopedia instead of trying to find a few sentences without their context to back up your claim? If you *did* read it, you would see that there are many causes and types of inflation. From that article:\n\n>**Cost-Push Effect**  \n>  \n>*Cost-push inflation is a result of the increase in prices working through the production process inputs.* When additions to the supply of money and credit are channeled into a commodity or other asset markets and especially *when this is accompanied by a negative economic shock to the supply of key commodities, costs for all kinds of intermediate goods rise.*  \n>  \n>These developments lead to higher costs for the finished product or service and work their way into rising consumer prices. For instance, when the expansion of the money supply creates a speculative boom in oil prices the cost of energy of all sorts of uses can rise and contribute to rising consumer prices, which is reflected in various measures of inflation.\n\nAre you really trying to argue that having trouble find labor isn't a supply chain issue even though it directly effects the ability of businesses to create, supply and ship goods? Labor is clear a example of a \"production process input.\" And you know what? This isn't even up for debate. Labor is part of the supply chain. This is not an opinion, this is a fact. Just like how inflation isn't just caused by increase in money supply. Again, not up for debate, just a fact.\n\nNow please actually read that entry on inflation.

First, CPI is meant to measure what people are actually paying rather than market prices, so if you have landlords that only raise rent when turning over tenants, then the increases measured by CPI would be lower than the change in postings for apartments because people who aren't moving aren't seeing as high a change in rent. The same would go for places with rent control. Another potential issue is owner's equivalent rent is obtained by a survey of what a homeowner would rent their home for, so homeowners might not price their property in the same way as if they had actual income on the line. Finally, rents and changes in them are very location dependent. I couldn't find the data nicely organized, but [this search](https://beta.bls.gov/dataQuery/find?st=0&r=20&s=popularity%3AD&q=shelter&fq=survey:[cu]&fq=cg:[Geography]&fq=cc:[Metropolitan+Statistical+Areas]&more=0)  I did of the CPI data brought up results for shelter in a number of specific metro areas.

{"title": "AST SpaceMobile. The Black Swan of Low Earth Orbit satellite communication constellations. 🦢🦢🦢🦢🦢🦢🦢🦢🦢🦢 🦅 Why is it so different?", "selftext": "* **TL/DR** AST SpaceMobile constellation will boast the largest ever deployed area of antenna in space. Powerful enough to do what no one else does: Connect directly to smartphones. Price Target: 45 USD per share. 3.8 x current share price.\n* I am not a financial advisor. This is analysis, not financial advice.\n\n**Background. The Communication Services Sector, CSS, Telecommunications addressable market and stepwise evolution of telecom sector.**\n\n[CSS sector in the S&P 500](https://preview.redd.it/1k2298oq0op71.png?width=356&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ef26467d529ec95851ae9cbcfdcb78694d0a81b)\n\n* Alphabet (Google) and Facebook make up half of the S&P 500 CSS. Telecommunications companies is one fifth (21%) of sector, and about 2% of the S&P 500 total value. Internet infrastructure is not part of CSS, it is part of Information Technology sector.\n* The Total (global) telecom addressable market in 2021 is 1,000 Bn USD. Growing at CAGR 40% annually. This means the entire Telecom sector is by definition in hypergrowth. A company just maintaining its market share is, thereby, also in hypergrowth. This is largely driven by 5g rollout. And fueled by new technological concepts and evolvong standards.\n* Mainstream consumer telecom started as wire connected telegraphs, then phones, evolved into cellphones and terrestrial towers further subdivided into 2g, 3g, 4g LTE and now 5g. Research and development has started for another leap: Connecting to satellites.\n* **🦅**  Incorporated in 3GPP release 16 and 17, 5g standards. For Example Qualcomm x65 release 16 chip, manufactured by Samsung, and in cellphones from early 2022 is engineered to improve its satellite connectivity. Regular cellphones has already started adapting for AST type constellations.\n\n**🦢🦢🦢🦢🦢🦢🦢🦅 Low Earth Orbit Satellite constellations. A whole lot of swans.**\n\n* There are a lot of Low Earth Orbit communications Constellations planned and operational.\n\n[How numerous some leading LEO constellations are planned to become. \\(correct for AST is 336 sats\\).](https://preview.redd.it/hgq0vcis7op71.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b944d53295902bc743dc53afa0bf09d407c23ab)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🦅      **SpaceMobile constellation. Bigger antenna than any other.**\n\n[Ellis Island. Originally only 3.5 acres in size, today Ellis Island covers nearly 27.5 acres. Or 111.000 square meters. This is the size of the total phased array antenna that AST SpaceMobile constellation will deploy when it reaches 336 satellites. ](https://preview.redd.it/dnz72ofreop71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb5f6fbda9f37e23e234076f2bc00856806b46e9)\n\n* 🦅     An AST satellite will be aprox 17.8 by 20 meters and flat. It features approx 331 square meters of phased array antenna. For a total of 111,216 square meters. And like Ellis Island SpaceMobile will grow in phases. And the real beauty lies not here but in the land side of the Network. The use of Altiostar virtualisation and using the internet for cellular connectivity. AST is bent pipe architechture keeping the complex stuff down on earth. No complex routing in space.\n* 🦢🦢 For comparison Starlink satellites has 4 phased array panels approximately .65 x 0.65 meters in size each or 1.7 square meters total per satellite. That is a total of 71,400 square meters for the 42,000 planned Starlink constellation and 20,400 square meters for the constellation under current application. So Starlink is smaller in antenna size, more numerous, and more complex with routing and packeting done on satellite up in Space.\n\n[Low Earth Orbit, LEO, is satellites close to earth. Typically they are small with narrow Field of View, FoV \\/ footprint. And use inter satellite links, ISL. See the section.](https://preview.redd.it/3ciqyskd7op71.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbba22356feeb181be4a059431f6e42a33403e80)\n\n* 🦢🦢  We see the most numerous constellations (Starlink, US, European and chinese clones) are dominant. These white swans are competitors and share a few common traits: Small satellites, narrow field of view, intersatellite links, Ku-Ka band, and most importantly: They require a proprietary handset or fixed user terminal to achieve broadband speeds.\n* 🦅  AST SpaceMobile communicates on cellular bands of terrestrial partners, a much lower frequency, compared to Starlink / Kuiper. AST  has a very wide Field of View, not narrow as the others, which allow much higher share usable capacity as they will not be starring narrowly down on just deserts and oceans. AST does not use multiple inter satellite links like Iridium, instead it beams the data straight down to terrestrial gateways. This increases capacity and reduces latency.\n\n[VSAT, very small antenna aperture.](https://preview.redd.it/1xxz4uv09op71.jpg?width=923&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0dc30cd2559ec0262f28a13261a85feef84eae37)\n\n* 🦢🦢 The VSAT terminal cost is subject to economy of scale. For example the once 1000$ Starlink phased array terminal is now 499$ and projected to reach 200$. To this cost comes costs of distribution and mounting.\n* 🦅  AST SpaceMobile communicates with standard cellphones and tablets already in peoples pockets at a Customer Acquisition Cost of zero. For fixed home internet an off the shelf 5g dongle will do. Making it highly competitive on developing markets and ad hoc / low throughput use cases globally.\n\n[Mobile monthly revenue per user on different markets.](https://preview.redd.it/wa3rqtvlcop71.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c1bf3eedd881f62161800da1d60757504ea8cf3)\n\n* 🦢🦢  The customer acquisition cost, CAC, that subventions of VSATs would incur is still prohibitively costly on developing world markets compared to the Lifetime Value, LTV.  Compare a future 100 USD initial VSAT obstacle to a revenue in Africa of 3.4 USD per month = 40.8 USD per year. These terminals also require manufacturing.\n* 🦅  Communication satellites are getting higher throughput, and thereby lower Capital expenditures per bit transferred. AST takes this to extremes.\n\n[CapEx per Gbps. I have added numbers from Barclays bank AST coverage, to show AST SpaceMobile numbers. 1,200 Gbps and $ 10-12 Mn cost per sat. Link to Barclays report: https:\\/\\/pdfhost.io\\/v\\/C0G\\~b\\~5c3\\_Barclays\\_AST\\_SpaceMobile\\_Researchpdf](https://preview.redd.it/4u5s5gf09op71.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b13f1e809d54015465240a0398470e5d3ca8478)\n\n* 🦢🦢  CapEx per Gbps is coming down on the space segment as shown above. Starlink will mass produce its satellites and bring down costs to .5 Mn USD per small satellite (0.29 Mn USD per square meter phased array antenna deployed).\n* 🦅  SpaceMobile is an extreme as it will mass produce its satellites and bring down costs per huge satellite to 10-12 Mn USD  (0.036 Mn USD per square meter antenna deployed). This sharing of the expensive central control module along with wide FoV is the key to accomplish outstanding CapEx/ Gbps metric.\n\n**Signal Strength.**\n\n* 🦢🦢  Like previously mentioned other constellations has proprietary terminals in both ends to achieve enough signal strength and broadband speeds. This means they are either fixed and/or has prohibitively high user terminal / Customer acquisition costs. They use Ku band that needs free line of sight.\n* 🦅  SpaceMobile is connecting to standard cellular phones. By its application to FCC we can see what the signal strength will be like. AST use cellular band which will penetrate inside buildings and through foliage/canopies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[From AST application. The cellular spectrum fronthaul tech specs. ](https://preview.redd.it/daavmycqjop71.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=350deffadbe3d3df35bcfa76539ca0848ae412f0)\n\n* 🦅  Maximum Power Flux Density (upper table) of transmitting Beams 5/6 (same for both polarizations) in the 1805-2200 MHz (cellular fronthaul) range is -96.6 dBW/m2 or in other format 2.19e-10 W from a single midband beam at ground level. That is 2.19e-7 mW. -110 dB is virtually no signal (dead zone) the 13.4 dB difference is since it is a log scale 22 times the power of a lost signal level.\n\n[Signal strength and number of bars. From a research paper.](https://preview.redd.it/44b0uvfxjop71.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad0b0d826228dcc9597b9951eecc4e44b87fde4)\n\n* 🦅  By matching the chart above the signal strength of the AST application is the equivalent of 4 bars on a cellphone ( there's no real standard on how companies can represent signal bars). So if AST SpaceMobile constellation delivers what AST managment applications show then it will mean medium/good download signal strength. As far as I am able to interpret these tech specs. This high signal strength is accomplished by using phased arrays and beam forming, highly directive antennas. If we were to compare radiowaves to visible light, then AST uses lasers where others use flashlights, so to speak. These narrow beams make for smaller cells, not only resulting in higher signal strength but also more bandwidth per user.\n\n**The Businessmodel**\n\n* 🦢🦢  Most other LEO constellations integrate vertically, it is because they have their own standard. They build the entire network including user terminals and own their spectrum. This is expensive, making their service exclusive. They fight ove Ku Ka bands.\n* 🦅  AST SpaceMobile use extreme throughput Q and V bands in their backhaul that there is little competition for and they use shared spectrum from terrestrial partners (currently partners with 1.5 Bn customers are under 50-50 revenue share agreements MOUs) at no spectrum acquisition cost for AST. Terrestrial part of network will use Altiostar/ Rakuten virtualisation / AI software to slice exisiting terrestrial infrastructure and the internet to transfer traffic optimizing latency and speed while minimizing costs. Terrestrial sites will be built and maintained by partners Vodafone group and American Towers, all world leaders in their respective field, incurring no terrestrial CapEx for AST SpaceMobile.\n* 🦅  Whenever a partner subscriber goes out of tower coverage they get an SMS so they can connect to AST SpaceMobile instead. Customer Aquisition thus automated, all digital, and requiring no extra end user equipment.\n\n[Present and future communication satellites in south east Asia, comparison. I added AST and Starlink. Note that AST has no \\\\\"join the club\\\\\" one time or monthly fee.  Just 2$ per GB used. No monthly cost and no starting \\/ VSAT cost makes for easy entry.](https://preview.redd.it/lrer965ipop71.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fd7478019f49d17edb82a37d833179b949a71e5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The only pure play**\n\n* 🦢🦢  Other constellations performing at broadband speeds, like Starlink and Amazon Kuiper are not available to invest in directly. They are part of bigger enterprises or not listed. There are companies like Iridium and Globalstar that are LEO constellations, but their latency, speed, and user costs is nowhere near competitive.\n* 🦅  AST SpaceMobile does have a 51% owned subsidiary with 90 missions flown aiming at 30% of the US nanosat market, it is called NanoAvionics. But apart from that it is a pure play for investors seeking to invest in Low Earth Orbit connectivity.\n\n**Price Targets**\n\n* 🦢🦢  No LEO constellation ever became cash flow positive without first becoming chapter 11, bankruptcy. That is how CapEx intensive the industry is, and how few customers they get by using proprietary hardware. Starlink expects to go cash flow positive somewhere beyond 2030.\n* 🦅  AST SpaceMobile has coverage from DB and Barclays with price targets of 35 and 29 respectively for an **32 USD / share average**. Todays price is 11.7 USD per share. An upcoming catalyst, launch of Bluewalker 3 with Space-x in march 2022, will be pivotal for share price.\n* 🦅  AST SpaceMobile is different in a good way, mutualistic/synergetic business model that shys away from CapEX by massproduction / economy of scale, using the reduced launch costs of Space-x, leasing terrestrial gateways from terrestrial pros, and most importantly using already paid for spectrum of terrestrial partners maximizing the use of the scarce expensive commodity of cellular spectrum in a 50-50 win-win model. By beeing different in a good way we can put *some trust* in company FCF projections and do DCF / NPV calculation.\n\n[DCF \\/ Net Present Value Sensitivity Analysis. By u\\/Cryptographer](https://preview.redd.it/7509yo2trop71.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6b468ecfad1343cd0e4a842c62c31555c79b405)\n\n* 🦅  AST SpaceMobile investor presentation projects revenues up until 2030. And will become Cash Flow Positive upon launch of Equatorial in 2024. Using a percentage of the positive cash flow years (column) and an discount rate of your choice (row) the above table allows you to arrive at a fair current market capital. Using just 40% of the future projected positive cash flows (as a proxy for 60% failure risk) and a discount rate of 12% we arrive at 8.264 Bn market cap. Divided with 182 Mn shares that is **45 USD per share**. When doing this we put zero value to subsidiary Nanoavionics a cash flow positive Nanosat provider growing yoy 300%. But beware that AST has within it many hypergrowth criteria. It is likely to either fail and be lower, or be much much higher on success.\n\n**Final thought. The impact on society.**\n\n* 🦅  AST SpaceMobile global coverage directly to cellphones from satellite will revolutionize the world very much like cellular towers already has. Understanding these leaps of technology is easy in hindsight. But now they seem like a Black Swan. Something you have never seen. Most will react by denial at this stage, which explains the current price. The omnipresence of 5g coverage (that from 3GPP release 16 includes hardened positioning / fused LEO GNSS i.e a more secure more precise GPS) will revolutionize drones and remotely operated vehicles as they will be connected everywhere with low latency. The network will jump-start economic development in the third world and open up markets for other communication services sector companies as new customers gain access to cellular connections at broadband speeds.", "id": "pvciwf", "created_utc": 1632594129.0, "score": 315, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 164, "comments": [{"body": "I’m really ready for this thing to explode.", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "Steve, what if I say ASTS makes my pants want to explode?", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "hmmm.
