You lost all of your investment because it closed out of the money.

A LEAPS contract is just an option contract that has 12 months or more until it expires.  They stand for Longterm Equity Anticipation Securities.  Take a look at this link, and it shows why it is best to do these on strike prices that are well below the current trading value.  Right now in order for you to make money at the expiration date, HNST has to be trading over $18.50.  Anything else, you lose money on a sliding scale.  This is ultimately fine if your thesis on the stock is correct and it doubles in value.  That means you will have made $1050 by expiration roughly.  However, this now comes down to a risk-reward scenario.  You parked $1050 + commissions in something for 2.5 years for the potential to make 1R on your trade assuming it doubles in value.  Looking deeper at it, you need the stock price to increase at least 66% in the next 30 months in order to make money.  \n\nhttp://opcalc.com/AHF\n\nA better option (and I am not telling you to do this but just for future), would have been to do a diagonal play on this.  This means you buy a deep ITM option (at say $2.50 strike for the same expiry).  Doing this, your break even is $14, meaning you only need a 26% increase in the stock price to make money.  Further, if the stock doubles to $22 you make 2x as much on your trade, you make upwards of $775/contract vs. just $350/contract on virtually the exact same upfront cost of the option.  Now you are only trading 1 option vs. 3, but the risk-reward profile is better at the same risk for the same intended move.  A secondary benefit is you can now write a covered call each month (I am not going to get into it here --- look up a Poor Man's Covered Call online or on YouTube to explain it in more detail) so you can collect a passive income on your contract while you park your capital.  Each covered call you write lowers your cost basis (your break even).  See below for a long call deep in the money alone vs. doing it as a diagonal, and you will see the striking difference in the break even at expiry, assuming your thesis is correct and the price increases correspondingly by the end of your contract.  Keep in mind you can write the calls every month this is just an example using the expiry month only.  So you could lower your basis even further.  Just writing the one call now automatically cleaves almost $4 off your basis instantly, and you don't have to do anything and just let it expire either in- or out- of the money.  As long as you don't close the short position early (the short call contract), you get to keep 100% of the premium, no questions asked.\n\nLong Call alone:  http://opcalc.com/AHG\n\nDiagonal (Poor Man's Covered Call): http://opcalc.com/AHH", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> A LEAPS contract is just an option contract that has 12 months or more until it expires.\n\nNot true.

It does not necessarily represent what you could actually buy/sell the option for.\n\nIn this case, the bid/ask spread is terrible!

My trades of choice are credit spreads, mainly short iron condors to try and get some repeatable weekly/bi-weekly income. The more I am researching, the more I see people like OptionsAlpha, ProjectOption, and TastyTrade all recommend a mean timeframe of approximately 40 days for credit trades. I found one study, done by TastyTrade that claims 45DTE is the sweetspot with 75DTE giving the most gains overall, but it also had the largest drawdown potential. This does make sense to me simply because the more time value you have baked into the option you get wider break-evens and more profit potential. However, this is at a detriment to theta that hasn't really started to accelerate too fast yet.\n\nSo my question is if the standard is writing 30-45DTE credits and then covering them when 50%+ of the trade has been realized, why not do something like 10-15DTE, let it try to realize 85+% of the profits and leverage theta? I just did a quick glance at SPY ATM puts and each week the premium increases obviously, but at a smaller and smaller ratio. First it was a $1.51 hike for Sept 24th, then $1.31 for Oct 1st, then $1.10ish for Oct 8th, and then <$1.00 for Oct 15th. There seems to be a negative correlation between time and the increase in premium percentage week over week. Therefore, it seems like the only advantage to these longer dated credits is the wider wings and breakeven levels.\n\nAm I missing something here? For instance, assuming all expires worthless, I could feasibly write 2 SPY ATM credit trades for ~$1000 gains if I let it hit 90% decay every 10 days vs. only seeing ~$850 in gains for ~20-25DTE trade.  is it because the wider wings on the 25DTE is going to buffer it and the chances of seeing the $850 gain realized is better than the tighter wings and the $500 every two weeks being realized?\n\nThanks in advance.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "As the option approaches expiration, gamma coalesces around at the money, and moves of the stock can have drastic influence on the option, and thus riskier for stock moves than longer expirations\n\nFarther out in time, gamma is spread relatively evenly across the strikes, and this makes it easier to manage the option position.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much for this.

Literally speaking IV is derived from options prices using formulas. IV is the unknown you're trying to find out, the options prices are the known truth.

It can be reverse skewed where IV is higher for lower strikes or forward skewed where IV is higher for higher strikes.

First, let's go over the risk scenarios. There are several, but they fall into two general categories, short leg losses and total losses.\n\nA short leg loss means that the short leg went ITM and stayed ITM during your holding time. This situation generally benefits the long leg, so the *net* loss of the whole spread is not as bad as the short leg alone had it been naked. But the *potential* loss on the short leg alone is open-ended, like a naked call. Fortunately, should the loss exceed your available cash to cover, you can always sell to close the long leg for a profit and reduce or eliminate the net loss on the short. So even though the loss on the short leg is unlimited, so is the potential gain on the long leg.\n\nA total loss, on the other hand, happens if the underlying tanks so much that the loss on the long leg can't be compensated for by the gain on the short, since that gain is capped (you can't get more credit than you received at open). However, that also means this loss is defined, since you can't lose more than the net of the cost of the long leg vs. the credit on the short. For example, say an underlying is worth $500 and you buy a long call 1 year out for $10, and write a short call 30 days out for $2. If the stock tanks to $23.69, you can't lose more than the $10 on the long call, and the $2 credit nets that loss out to $8.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Ok, dabbling with the options... is there a place to back date options you've closed so you can see what would've happened had you not closed them?

They all use some form of binomial tree, since as I noted earlier, binomial trees sacrifice speed for accuracy (or at least you can turn that dial depending on your implementation) and work for american-style options as well as european-style.\n\nThe volatility smile doesn't happen because brokers mistakenly use BSM to calculate IV. That's so ridiculous I seriously ROFL when I read that.\n\nHere is what a volatility smile is actually about: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatilitysmile.asp\n\nPerhaps that post was based on a gross misreading of this statement:\n\n*The volatility smile is not predicted by the Black-Scholes model, which is one of the main formulas used to price options and other derivatives. The Black-Scholes model predicts that the implied volatility curve is flat when plotted against varying strike prices. Based on the model, it would be expected that the implied volatility would be the same for all options expiring on the same date with the same underlying asset, regardless of the strike price. Yet, in the real world, this is not the case.*\n\nAs I've already noted, brokers don't use BSM for quoting the greeks, so the fact that BSM doesn't predict the vol smile is irrelevant.\n\n> Another website calls this \"volatility skew\", indicating the skew is an aberrational phenomenon? If it's an aberration that isn't actual then how should it affect pricing? Surely IV needs to be actual in order to have an affect in pricing!?!\n\nNo, no, no. The difference in IV values between brokers has nothing to do with vol skew. Vol skew happens because the market is made up of real people trading on a mix of objective facts and subjective sentiment. Vol skew can happen for something as silly as people thinking that the 420 strike is luckier than the 419 or 421 strikes.\n\nAnd IV **does not affect pricing**. You have it backwards. Greeks are descriptive, not prescriptive. They tell you *why* the price is what it is, not what the price *should be*. IV is back-calculated by plugging in constants for the actual prices and the greeks and then solving for IV. **The actual price drives IV**, not the other way around.\n\nAt the end of the day, all the option pricing models are models, not reality. They can only approximate reality. And given how chaotic and nonsensical markets can be (GME broke a lot of records), no mathematical model is ever going to be 100% accurate all of the time.

Are there methods beyond heuristics that can help me build a portfolio that's balanced between asset classes?\n\nYes. First, you have to describe what you will use options for. There are three main reasons, in descending order of frequency (dollar x volume across the whole world):\n\n1. Hedging other asset classes\n\n1. Deriving income from non-income producing asset classes, or boosting income from income producing asset classes\n\n1. Speculation, which is a fancy financial word for gambling\n\nIn the first case, you would decide how much of your portfolio's value to sacrifice to the hedge, since a hedge is generally a cost rather than an appreciating asset. Think of it as an insurance premium. You pay for car insurance every year, so that's a cost of ownership for a car that you don't expect to get any value from when you sell the car. Same with options used for hedging. One way to think about it is if your target CAGR on the investment portfolio is a 5% real return for your time horizon, how much of that return will you sacrifice to the hedge? You might decide to sacrifice 1%, so your net CAGR will now by 4% (or 20% of your growth rate for the hedge), but your downside risk will be reduced. Your upside might also be capped, as hedges often have that side-effect. In general, you want to cost of the hedge to have as little impact on your growth rate as possible, but still give you the protection you want.\n\nIn the second case, there's no real upper limit as a percentage. You are constrained more by how much collateral you have. So if you have $500k worth of investments in ETFs and stocks, of which $400k have liquid option markets, you can deploy income generation strategies on up to $400k of assets. Worst case scenario, you are forced to sell all $400k of those assets prematurely, that's the risk you face. You may end up giving up potential capital gains on those assets as well, so that's another risk.\n\nIn the third case, the general recommendation by portfolio managers and financial planners is no more than 5% of total portfolio liquidation value. Some say it should be no more than 1%, since 5% on a $1 million portfolio is still a lot of money.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well, sadly it seems I fall into the third case.

(As mentioned previously, the ruling is full of dunks on the expert witnesses.) But she says Apple is still entitled to license that intellectual property for a fee of some sort, and requiring developers to use Apple’s payment system “accomplishes this goal in the easiest and most direct manner.”\n\nEpic’s unbundling alternative, meanwhile, would “severely undermine” the system, says the ruling. “Indeed, to the extent Epic Games suggests that Apple receive nothing from in-app purchases made on its platform, such a remedy is inconsistent with prevailing intellectual property law.”\n\nEven if developers could entirely stop using the IAP system, “Apple could still charge a commission on developers. It would simply be more difficult for Apple to collect that commission,” Rogers writes. \n\nEnd of quotes.\n\nThe judge clearly states that Apple deserves compensation for hosting an App even if payment is made outside the App store. \n\nApple can still charge the 30% commission according to the judge even if alternate payment is used. \n\nThe App Store clearly states the 30% commission is due regardless if Apples payment system is used or not.

Housing prices have escalated dramatically. When a handful of houses in an area sell at a higher cost than the neighboring houses this will increase the value of those other houses. These are the \"comps\" (comparables) of a house a realtor will give you when you are looking to purchase a new home. Now a neighborhood went from an average of $300k to $350-$400k per home based on comps. Property taxes are based off of a homes assessed value (not the same of appraised/market value but similar). If a home is assessed at 300K with a $1.25/$100 tax rate then the taxes would come to $3,600. Say that house it now assessed at 400k then the taxes would come to $4,800. A difference of $1,200/yr or $100/month. If a renter wants to recoup those costs then they would likely charge you as the renter that $100/month. \n\nOf course it's a stretch that a home would sell for a 25% increase year over year BUT I have seen some insane prices on local homes in my area. This would also usually result from a house not appraising for a certain value, which a bank will not give a loan above what a house appraises for, but many are paying straight out cash or paying enough cash to cover the difference in what the bank will loan them. What's happened is that with the pandemic, many people have had the capability to work remotely and people have moved from more wealthy areas to areas with a lower cost of living. Someone moving from NY, CA or even Northern VA (with higher pay due to higher costs of living) to Central VA can sell their 800 sq ft $600k house/condo and purchase a 2000 sq ft house for $400k even if it only appraises for $325k with cash to spare.

I consider it likely that this point will be reached before Dojo is fully operational.

{"title": "$CLOV DD The \"DUDE Diligence\" Report 9/12 Edition: Making a Strong Case, Correcting Rampant Misinformation and How to Trade $CLOV", "selftext": "What's up Degernates?  The $DUDE here with my periodic \"Dude Diligence\" reports on $CLOV - Clover Health Investments Corp and thoughts on potential price action for the upcoming week.  Be prepared to read a little bit (and I realize what I have here is probably more reading than most of you crayon-eaters have done collectively since the first grade)  ...but it will be worth your time if you're seriously considering trading CLOV\n\nI want to start off with a quick intro- I'm a long-time lurker here on WSB but rarely post.  I joined a little over a year and a half ago right before COVID hit as the subreddit was on the verge of breaking 1M Degenerates.  I spend a bit more of my time on Twitter and am active there if you care to follow me aka, The $DUDE  ([https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a)).\n\nAnyway, I don't want to make this too long but I've been trading for about 16 years which started with a single $2000 deposit as a college student in my early 20s which was a good chunk of my net worth at the time.  That $2K has grown significantly over the years through working, trading and has been diversified into real estate as well.  I work in tech for a publicly traded software company and now have few healthy trading accounts (primary trading, IRA and Roth IRAs) where I mainly swing/momentum trade some YOLOs and occasionally invest longer term if I feel there's a disruptive technology/company w/ high upside potential.\n\nOriginally I came to WSB for the memes and then quickly realized it was a really helpful community w/ useful crowd-sourced info, strategies and data in addition to the solid meme game.  That was before it exploded 10X in size over about a 6 month period time leading up to the GME and AMC squeeze craziness earlier this year.\n\nWhile I will say most of the info here is still good for the most part, you do have to dig a bit deeper now, verify a little more often and pushback on a lot more misinformation than in the \"early days\".  And that brings me to the point I'd like to speak about today.  Misinformation and how it has run rampant especially when it comes to Clover Health Investments Corp aka $CLOV.\n\nI've been trading this stock since late Feb and seen the many ups, then downs, then big ups again and then downs.  But more than anything, I've seen and still see the disruptive potential of A.I. in a dinosaur of an industry like Healthcare.\n\nHere's my fresh take since I know there are a lot of new traders/investors in CLOV and there's been a definite uptick of late in interest to potentially invest moving forward... (Disclaimer:  I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, it is solely made up of my own personal opinions.  I do currently hold a position in CLOV for obvious reasons once you read through this)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**STORY TIME**\n\nI'm going to start this all off with a little story...\n\nOnce upon a time, there was this new fangled company called Tesla and it was forward thinking and it was technology obsessed and it was innovation first and they wanted to build cars.\n\nWell, the collective good ol boys (GoB) club that makes up the automotive industry saw this quirky autist-lead company and laughed at them and pointed fingers at their silly electric motors with \"auto pilot\" and weird frunks and batteries- WTF??.\n\nThe GoB don't like disruption.  Instead, the GoB loooove the status quo- because they're on top and in control, so why wouldn't they?\n\nThis TSLA company didn't care that they were getting the cold shoulder and started to build their cars that were \"never going to succeed\" anyway and they were actually pretty f\\*cking bad ass.\n\n\"...There's no way this TSLA is a viable long-term company- they don't have the recharging infrastructure, there will never be adoption by the masses and ultimately they'll run out of money, \" sneered all the GoB execs along with the know-it-all stock analysts, big banks as well as Jim Cramer and all his Wall St. buddies.\n\nAnd then something weird happened ...people started buying these electric cars ...and buying them even more and buying them even faster.   We all know how this story ends.  The GoB are now scrambling to catch up and acquire similar technologies to compete w/ the O.G. disruptor.\n\nThis is what happens with disruptive companies- they see problems and their leaders are visionary problem-solvers and refuse to follow inefficiency and the status quo.  And it's weird because when these disruptive companies pop up, you'd think they would be praised and their industries would welcome their new ways of thinking.  But that's not real life- instead they're mocked and told they'll never make it and to give up because deep down the GoB know the legacy way of thinking is in danger of drastically changing and all of the sudden the go from leader to playing catch up.   So the collusion begins and they do all they can to ensure there's a failure to launch w/ negative publicity, or just ignored altogether, shorted to hell or option D:  all of the above.  Whatever it takes to kill off the \"perceived threat\".\n\nWell, there's another company similar to TSLA that's looking to disrupt another Dinosaur industry- Healthcare- and healthcare may be the oldest most dinosaur of the dinosaurs...  This company is $CLOV and why a lot of people in the rapidly growing community refer to it as #TeslaHealth.\n\nAnd before many of you in here sneer and mock- hear me out over the next few paragraphs.  I will support my DD w/ data, Press Releases, Quarterly Financials, etc, not opinions...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER HEALTH IS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FIRST**\n\nFirst and foremost $CLOV needs to actually be seen and recognized for what it is at it's core- NOT a meme stock.  **Clover Health, at its foundation is a Technology/Software company (Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning) that just so happens to focus on the Healthcare/Insurance space.**   It's only a meme stock because it's heavily talked about here on WSB, but this is actually a long-term growth stock with rapidly improving fundamentals, massive growth... and down the list, the potential of a squeeze, but that is secondary in my mind.  I'm long on CLOV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER HEALTH's MISSION STATEMENT**\n\n*Clover is a healthcare technology company helping members live their healthiest lives with its Medicare Advantage plans. On a mission to improve every life, Clover uses its proprietary technology platform to collect, structure, and analyze health and behavioral data to improve medical outcomes and lower costs for patients. As a company whose business goals fully align with its members' health needs, Clover works with members and their doctors to become a valued partner. Clover has offices in Nashville, San Francisco, Jersey City, and Hong Kong.*\n\nCLOV is a next-generation healthcare/insurance disruptor in that it has developed proprietary AI technology called the Clover Assistant (CA).\n\n**Clover Assistant Explanation Video:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k)\n\nWhat's great about this is that it integrates with all FHIR EHR's (Electronic Health Record systems) ...hospital systems, doctor's offices, pharmacies, etc. use EHR to store and manage patient info (similar to a CRM used by all businesses) and these can now all integrate easily with CA.\n\nThis allows for real-time data visualization & reporting at doctor's fingertips so they can not only make the best possible decisions for the health of their patients based on all available info across all EHR systems, but also concurrently make the most cost-effective decision from a business standpoint (improved margins compared to competitors w/o a similar type technology.)\n\nIn short, as doctors are empowered to make the best possible decisions, patients health is significantly improved having fewer issues long term, which leads to fewer hospital/doctor  visits and a dramatic reduction in overall costs.  Clover Assistant has the ability to keep people healthier, longer.  How is this alone not something we should all get behind for the general good of our population??\n\n**Aug 10, 2021 PR Link:**  Now integrates with all FHIR-enabled EHR's\n\n[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs)\n\n**Sept 8, 2021 PR Link:**  Clover Health partners with largest EHR company AthenaHealth for seamless integration of Clover Assistant\n\n[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market)\n\nYou want to know what's also pretty f\\*cking awesome that doesn't get enough talk time?  They could also potentially license the Clover Assistant software to other healthcare orgs at some point, i.e. Software-as-a-Service or SaaS.  I work in this space and have been selling SaaS contracts to large corporations for the better part of 2 decades.\n\nMy previous company had a stock price of $15 when they were selling \"perpetual licenses\" aka, dinosaur software sales model.  ...when they switched over to a SaaS model, their stock price climbed to over $500 during the next 10 years.  Did I play my ESPP during this time?  Uh, you know I did!\n\nIn summary... just this software licensing component alone could have a massive effect on longer term company revenue, if played correctly.  Of note, I don't think productizing CA for resale is currently in the works from what I've seen, so none of this potential is priced in yet.  If/when that happens, you will wish you put every single penny you have into CLOV.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET**\n\nCLOV plays heavily in the Medicare Advantage space and potentially at some point Original Medicare as well.  Currently citizens in the US are eligible for Medicare at 65 years old and about 60M people total or 18% of the US population are on it as of 2019:\n\nTotal Medicare Growth (Original Medicare + Medicare Advantage)\n\n[Total Medicare growth in US from 1990-2019](https://preview.redd.it/xkm6dlk8o5n71.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ef0dd7523641c089b72e8da7d0f9f468cb889d)\n\nMedicare Advantage Growth (26M Medicare Advantage vs. approx. 36M Original Medicare enrollees)\n\n[Medicare Advantage Enrollment 2000-2021](https://preview.redd.it/dt9mpi6b65o71.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d2aba04aafdb94478983e2c0be05f0a95bb1f24)\n\nMedicare Advantage is gaining market share vs. Original Medicare\n\n[Medicare Advantage Penetration 2000-2021](https://preview.redd.it/ty5snobk65o71.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=68e57e18123c0369310dba08c5c0b99a997c2ed2)\n\nLook at the Baby-Boomer jump beginning around 2006 and its resulting sharp increase.  It's expected to continue this rapid rise during the next decade and if the eligible age of Medicare is dropped from 65 to 60, that could add another 24+ Million (a potential 40% bump) to its total lives managed within the program.\n\nA unique component that CLOV has when it comes to lives managed is that it has a direct contracting entity (DCE) program.  This is unique Medicare program by the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) has only offered this to Clover Health and 52 other organizations at this time.\n\nThis has been a boon for CLOV as they have nearly doubled their lives on Medicare in just over 6 months (take a look at revenue a little further below in this DD to see what just a single  quarter offering this program has done for revenue.)\n\n**Info on DCE Program:** [https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/](https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/)\n\n**Quick Video on Program:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM)\n\n(...and someone correct me if I state this inaccurately) but my understanding of DCE (and it's by far the most exciting growth component that I've seen so far related Clover's massive upward revenue trajectory from Q1 to Q1 ) ...under direct contracting entity, Doctors are able to sign patients up individually, outside of the normal Oct 15 - Dec 7th Medicare Open Enrollment period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EXPLOSION IN REVENUE GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR**\n\nHere are Data from CLOV's most recent Q2 10Q filing on Aug 11, 2021:\n\n**Total Q2 2021 Revenue was $412.5M, which was a 139.7 increase YoY** compared to $172.1M in Q2 of 2020.  $216.4M of that was just from Direct Contracting- are you seeing why I'm pretty stoked on this hyper-growth company?\n\nTotal **revenues for the full 2021 year are now expected to increase from $810-$130M which was reported following Q1 earnings to $1.4- $1.5B** following Q2 earnings (and only a $2B valuation at an $8 stock price- very low for a healthcare/technology company!)\n\nTotal Lives (customers) under Clover Health management at the end of Q2 was approx. 129,000, **an increase of 126.3% YoY GROWTH!!!**  This has mainly come from the DCE program since it has only been available to Clover since they were included in it along with 52 other companies earlier this year.\n\n**Lives under Clover Assistant management grew by 229% YoY.**\n\n**Clover expects a significant increase in total aligned beneficiaries on Jan 1, 2022**, when claims aligned beneficiaries for 2022 become active - Uh, you probably want to climb on the bandwagon sooner than later given this projection.\n\nIf this alone isn't enough to get you to jump on board blindly w/ no questions asked, I don't know what to tell you.  If you can tell, when Q3 earnings are announced on Nov 8, 2021, CLOV could rocket if Q3 report is anything like Q2, especially with a potential update or guidance on newly enrolled lives under mgmt as a couple of weeks of Medicare Open Enrollment will have been completed prior this next ER (OE period goes from Oct 15- Dec 7).\n\n**CLOVER HEALTH's EXEC TEAM:**\n\nTake a look, you have a mix of former Google, Uber, (remember how I said it's a technology company)  United Health Group, McKesson execs... Their board\n\nExec.

He is a former Director at the Centers for Medicare- he obviously knows how the program works.  Here is a brief snippet from the PR:\n\n***“...Demetrios is a significant addition to the Board. Having led the legal and regulatory affairs department of the Medicare division at UnitedHealth, he understands the opportunity and challenge of operating at scale. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of Medicare rules and regulations, combined with an incredibly astute business and strategy acumen. We are grateful that Demetrios is joining us on this very important journey....”***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CLOVER RAPID EXPANSION IN COUNTIES WHERE THEIR SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE**\n\nCLOV just expanded its market from 108 counties in 10 states to 209 counties now in 9 (11?) states (101 county increase) as of June 24, 2021 press release, meaning essentially all of the earnings data I listed above were from the smaller market, so growth will only continue to accelerate rapidly.\n\nPR Link: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets)\n\nIf that wasn't exciting enough, shortly after announcing these new counties above, Clover Health then announced on Aug 3, 2021 they will be entering yet another new state- their 12th- with a new partnership w/ ValueH.  This new state just happens to be the great state of Florida- the third most populous in the US and a huge Medicare growth potential state for obvious reasons.\n\nPR Link: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-valueh](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-launches-florida-partnership-valueh)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HEADWINDS, MISCONCEPTIONS & OUTRIGHT MISINFORMATION (LIES) CONTINUALLY PERPETUATED**\n\nMarket manipulation w/ the price is probably the biggest headwind.  CLOV, along with GME and AMC have got to be the most manipulated stonk tickers in the history of the stock market.  Market makers, HF and shorts have had an uncanny ability to nearly always pin the price on Fridays just below the options Max Pain price collecting premium and allowing them to do it cycle after cycle so they're making up their borrowing fees while making significant profit on top as well.  The more of the free float investors buy up and hold, the less ability they have to short & manipulate.\n\nThe second biggest headwind in my opinion is probably the collusion between analysts, Hedgies and who know's who else (it may be tin hat conspiracy theory, but I feel the big insurance players like United Healthcare Group, Humana etc. are all somehow involved behind the scenes) is involved in colluding with these corrupt analysts to provide totally false price targets, driving price down, while holding short positions.  Help me if I'm mistaken, but aren't PT generally upgraded and downgraded following big news like earnings, PR of new developments, etc?  With CLOV, it doesn't seem to happen that way, they're just downgraded haphazardly for no apparent reason other than those holding short positions are either in trouble, or have some quick money to be made.\n\nLoot at these situations below as examples:\n\nThere are at least two instances the community has heavily documented where Bank of America (Kevin Fischbeck) initiated a large 700K short position and within days downgraded their PT from $15 to $10.  Obviously manipulating the stock price in their favor.  What's funny, it was just a month and a half earlier he issued a buy and the earlier $15 target... just doesn't make sense.\n\nThe second was a small relatively unknown analyst from Cowen Research that just so happened to downgrade CLOV right as it was building a lot of momentum during the past few weeks.  No negative news- actually if anything, CLOV has had a ton of really positive news and it follows a blowout Q2 earnings.  I really believe it was a greasy attempt to help save a lot of Hedgies from getting stuck w/ a lot of options expiring ITM this past week when it surged 22% the day after Labor Day only to be hit w/ hard attacks.\n\nCowen just so happened to **also initiate a significant short position right before their BS downgrade.**  Cowen has a pretty greasy track record of shady dealings and has been fined  heavily and had to address many lawsuits over the years.  Why would anyone even trust them with this terrible track record??\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lawsuit-cowen-fired-top-investment-banker-who-raised-concerns-about-the-banks-business-ties-to-russian-oligarch-vitaly-malkin-301090919.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lawsuit-cowen-fired-top-investment-banker-who-raised-concerns-about-the-banks-business-ties-to-russian-oligarch-vitaly-malkin-301090919.html)\n\nI've also heard people talk negatively about losses.  Well, when you're in healthcare, and we're in the midst of the worst worldwide pandemic in over a century, your Medical Care Ratios (MCR) will get out of wack temporarily and that is the case over the past couple of quarters.  MCR was at 111% during Q2, however, Q1 of 2020 (before much of the COVID expense hit) it was 89.4% according to their earnings report.\n\n[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db)\n\nFree Cash Flow (FCF) has also been talked about and has been affected as this company is in growth mode, however, it has improved tremendously: +31% increase from Q1 to Q2 of 2021.  It will be interesting to see where it goes for Q3.  Definitely moving in the right direction toward getting into the black.\n\nAlso much of the expense costs for Q2 were one-time line items related to stock compensation and the cost of warrants to the company (warrants along added -$134.5M in debt)\n\nAs of the end of Q2, CLOV had $630M cash and cash equivalents in the bank, so they can sustain losses for awhile (years, possibly longer depending on how quickly covid-related expenses normalize) without issue or dilution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW TO TRADE CLOV**\n\nOK, this is getting kind of long, so I may type up another DD with more supplementary info, but I want to get into some of the anomalies specific to CLOV if you choose to trade/invest in this stock.\n\nShort Attacks:  Watch out for what looks like a mass selloff right at market open almost every day, shorts always short millions of shares each morning to kill off momentum and scare paper hands and inexperienced traders.  It generally comes back after about 10:30-11am ET when the shorts return their shares because they're just looking to scalp 10-40 cents or so each day and then return them for some profit.  If we're buying up all the float, and not allowing them be be shorted, HF and short's wont be able to do this and we start to gain ground.\n\nWhich brings me to this- IF there's anything I hope you learn from reading my DD today, it's this:  **DO NOT BUY SHORT-TERM CALL OPTIONS ON THIS STOCK.  If you do, they will most likely end worthless on Friday's and you will lose your money.**\n\nI know options are normally an attractive opportunity to get into a stock inexpensively because if it moon's at some point, you make a grip on a small investment, but I've been trading this for months, and seen it happen many times over- you will lose your money.\n\nInstead, BUY ACTUAL SHARES!   Help buy up the float and HODL!!  This is going to be a volatile potentially few months as we start making progress vs. the shorts to jack them with an impending squeeze, options have not been working, nor will they, it appears, in the short term.  There may be some opportunity to buy and profit from options once momentum is in bulls favor, but that time is not now.\n\nI hope this was helpful, I know it's long, but if you made it to the end here, really consider getting into this stock, it has a lot of things going for it and it's only $8 right now.  Even without the squeeze potential that exists, this could easily be $20-30 with it's extremely rapid growth of their Direct Contracting.  If you're holding it long, then when the squeeze does happen, it's just gravy.\n\nI may have missed a few things, but if so, I'll just follow this up with another post here in the next day or two.

{"title": "TMC stock has an explosive setup for this week", "selftext": "TMC (The Metals Company) is a recent \"de-SPA C\" that started trading on Friday.  It's a deep sea mining company with a market cap of $2.35 billion with 245 million shares outstanding (current price in the $9-9.50 range).\n\nThe key thing here though is that 231 million shares are locked up at least 6 months and the 11 million PIPE shares are locked for at least a month (but perhaps longer because 2/3 of their PIPE didn't pay up).\n\nOkay, so why do we care? Here's why this is potentially one of the most explosive stocks we've ever seen this week:\n\nThe current float is 2.72 million because 91% of the original 30 million shares redeemed for cash.\n\nThe short interest is around 1.77 million shares (or roughly 65% of the current float is short).\n\nBut here's the \"canary in the coal mine\": the open interest.  Market makers were selling calls based on the prior 30 million shares outstanding before last Friday, which means they've potentially sold much more than the entire current float:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/823tys3ci9n71.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&s=493a7a66e8ffbe60cf7c4ae599e422c9b9779f09\n\nThere's 25k calls for 9/17 between $10 and $12.50.  That's 2.5 million shares.  There's another 8.2k calls for 9/17 between $14 and $15.  That's another 820k shares.\n\n**That means if the stock is over $12.50 by Friday, MMs will need 92% of the current float to meet just September calls.**  **If it's over $15 by Friday, MMs will need 120+% of the current float to meet those calls.**\n\nThat's just September.  Add in those October calls (another 11.8k calls between $10 and $12.50 and another 7k calls between $14 and $15) and you'd require another 1.9 million shares for those...\n\n**So if TMC goes over $15, MMs would need 190% of the current float to account for September/October calls.**\n\n(And as I mentioned above 65% of the current float is short).\n\nI'm gonna be honest, I have never seen a situation like this (because the level of redemptions for recent de-SP ACs recently is unprecedented).  MMs have to keep this pinned under $10 by Friday or all hell will break loose.\n\nEasiest way/lowest risk way to play this is just buy stock (which should go up 200-300% in a \"gamma + short squeeze\" scenario).  September calls are super risky but will pay off in 5/10/15 baggers if the stock actually gets past $15 and rockets.\n\nOctober calls are lower risk than September but should still turn in 4/6/8 baggers if it gets past $15.\n\nPositions: 1000 shares of stock. 250 $12.50 calls, 200 $15 calls for Sept.  \n\nAs always do your own DD, I think this is the most explosive setup ever, but it may just stay pinned under $10 and then the calls are worthless.
