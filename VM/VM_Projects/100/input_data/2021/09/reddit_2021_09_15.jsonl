Taxes is the main reason it isn't IRL.\n\nWhy?\n\nSay there is a company with only 10 shares, owned by a single shareholder. The company does nothing, and has $100 000 in cash. That is all the value there is in the company. This means the share price is $10k.\n\nIf the shareholder wants to extract $20k from the company. There are two options:\n\n1. The company can buy back 2 of the 10 shares from the owner for a total of $20k. The company now has 8 shares, each still worth $10k, such that the company is worth a total of $80k.\n2. The company can pay out $20k in dividend. The company is now worth only $80k, but there are still 10 shares making the share price $8k.\n\nIn both scenarios the company is worth $80k, and the owner has $20k in the bank. This does not hold when you factor in taxes, and a bunch of other things. But in principle, when you hear \"share buyback\", think of it as an alternative to dividends.\n\n---\n\nShouldn't the share price increase?\n\nYes.\n\nIf the company actually produces a operational profit in addition to holding those assets, then you'd not only see that the share price was unchanged, but also an increased in the share price. This is because the same operational profit is now divided among only 8 shares, where it before was divided among 10 shares.\n\nIf the operational return warranted $4k extra in share price (so a total of $14k per share) before when there were 10 shares, then that extra value would be $5k when there were only 8 shares, or $15k per share. So the shares increased by $1k per share.\n\nThat all said. When you do the bookkeeping, there is no difference.

As far as capacity goes other than fully charging multiple times and checking the estimated range there are dongles you can buy that will give you greater individual details like number of cycles, cell balance, and kwh degradation. Remanufacturing generally means that the OEM has certified a used part to go back in an another car. In Tesla's case it means that parts other than the modules are replaced (as needed) and confirmation that capacity, internal resistance, and cell voltages within the modules/pack are acceptably balanced together. What Rich (source of the \"controversy\") is doing and what i used to do at my old job is alot more difficult. Swapping modules can be done but you must have extensive testing, flawless grading, and a huge inventory in order to almost perfectly match what is not getting replaced. The vast majority of battery management systems out there balance at less than a tenth of an amp per cell. If the modules are not perfectly matched then the car will be constantly complaining and be mostly useless as a commuter. If the imbalance is not too bad leaving it parked for awhile should bring the balance back to more acceptable level, I would not trust the stated range however. When I worked on Volt and Leaf packs the cell voltage delta was required by the BMS to be less than 10mv/cell in a pack of 96 cells, double that for 600v systems. Not an easy task but one that must be addressed. Eventually, Tesla will stop making these cells all together and all we have is used modules.

They also seem intent on pushing non serviceable structural packs in the future so I don't see them being motivated to even start this process. I do see them motivated in getting the raw materials out of something they see as currently worthless. If anyone wants to try swapping modules without Tesla's support then I don't see a way other than someone soon fronting the huge upfront cost of building multiple regional facilities that can start to collect these modules now. They must be able to procure and store many thousands of modules with a standardized and very accurate grading system which can sell directly to independent shops and that won't eat up the cost on shipping heavy hazmat ground rates over long distances.

{"title": "DD: Atlas Air (AAWW) is laughably undervalued and has near term catalysts for a rapid revaluation", "selftext": "*As always, do your own due diligence and invest responsibly. Author claims no responsibility for the accuracy of the facts and statements in this report. The investment (\"YOLO\") below is a large but recoverable percent of my portfolio, in-line with my personal risk tolerance. Not intended as investment advice. I may modify (add, reduce, or even close out) my position at any time.*\n\n**TL/DR:** AAWW is critically undervalued. COVID has all but annihilated international air travel volumes, driving up the price of air freight. Short term shipping disruptions have caused prices to soar, spilling over in to the air freight market. Analysts are expecting this disruption to resolve quickly, but are missing the shifts that airlines are making to narrow body jets and the impact on air freight. AAWW will have high earnings for years, and its current P/E of 4 is a joke. 13.6% of the float is shorted, and Atlas Air is free to reinitiate buybacks at the end of this month. AAWW's market cap could double and it still would trade at the rock bottom P/E of 8. Bullish AF.\n\n\\------\n\n**Thesis**\n\nAtlas Air Worldwide (AAWW) is critically undervalued at an absurdly low valuation given its great near- and long-term prospects; there several upcoming catalysts for a rapid revaluation.\n\n**Background**\n\nAtlas Air is an outsourced air services company that provides charter and other air services (\"Airline Operations\") as well as leasing out their owned aircraft. Critically, the Airline Operations account for the vast majority of revenues (>95%), and AAWW has a very, very heavy focus and exposure to air freight.\n\nYou may know that commercial flights also typically carry cargo. When COVID decimated international air travel, it left a few limited carriers to ship air freight internationally. Atlas Air filled that void and is making big money doing it.\n\n**Short Term Prospects**\n\nBeyond the COVID situation mentioned above, oceanliners have been backed up dramatically causing a squeeze in ocean freight prices. Normally, air freight costs very roughly 4-5x that of an oceanliner. But with surging rates from oceanliners, [air freight has now become competitive for many companies](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/a-perfect-storm-for-container-shipping/21804500) and it is spilling over in to a squeeze on air freight. [Here's another article joking about car tires flying first class.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/air-cargo-boom-has-car-tires-flying-first-class-11630242001) So we know that Atlas Air is going to have a pretty stellar third quarter. One for their corporate history books, to be sure. But how do they fare long-term?\n\n**Long Term Prospects**\n\nAs a side note, I believe this is where the shorts are getting it very, very wrong. *I think* they are confident that while AAWW will have a great quarter, the freight rates will come back down again and AAWW will operate with only 'modest' profits like it did pre-COVID. What they are missing is a huge transformation in the airline industry from wide-body to narrow-body jets. Narrow-body jets carry far less cargo. Greenlight Capital did a fantastic job laying this out in it's July 26, 2021 investor letter (page 4, \"Air Freight\"):\n\n>While there has been some recovery in passenger aviation, airlines are emphasizing narrow-body planes, which carry less freight than wide-body planes. Compared to 2019, current air freight demand is about 10% higher and capacity is about 10% lower. The result is that cargo rates have exploded.  \nSupply will be slow to come on-line. Some passenger planes are being converted to freighters, but conversion capacity for wide-bodies is limited and the aggregate impact of this will be modest. Meanwhile, air freight companies trade at tiny multiples of what investors assume to be peak profits. The implied cost of equity is quite high, which makes it difficult to justify adding assets. As a result, air freight companies are in no rush to order new planes, and in any case, new orders would take several years to build. The result is rates and profits are likely to be higher than expected for quite some time.\n\n(Sorry, I tried to link the letter but the spam bot didn't like the URL.)\n\n**Short Interest**\n\nFor some reason I will never understand, at a P/E of 4 with incredible foreseeable cashflows, some people have decided to short 13.6% of the outstanding shares. To be clear, this is not GameStop. But it is a high short interest in a stock with earnings prospects surging by the day as freight rates increase. It certainly doesn't hurt. But the story gets even better...\n\n**Upcoming Catalysts**\n\nOkay, so perhaps you believe me that AAWW is critically undervalued, that they're going to make some amazing Q3/Q4 profits, and that their long term prospects are pretty fantastic too. What will drive this rapid revaluation in the coming months? The answer was subtly slipped in to the last earnings call (google \"AAWW Transcripts Q2 2021 Earnings Call\"). Spencer Schwartz, the EVP and CFO answered a question and stated:\n\n>As far as the CARES Act restrictions, so the restrictions with regard to not being able to pay dividends or repurchasing shares, those expire at the end of September.\n\nI simply cannot imagine that in this time of record earnings, AAWW will not return that value to shareholders. If they were to announce a share buyback once the CARES Act restrictions lap, we could see AAWW finally get to a reasonable share price. I truly believe this could double in the short-term.\n\n**YOLO**\n\n$108k YOLO on Calls expiring in October and January.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzuyru804pn71.png?width=1268&format=png&auto=webp&s=82071fc0ff9d130964a81c208de196c9edc0d71f", "id": "pottj2", "created_utc": 1631724132.0, "score": 292, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|12|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|50|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/potqky/dd_atlas_air_aaww_is_laughably_undervalued_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pottj2/dd_atlas_air_aaww_is_laughably_undervalued_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j6tv06/entg_the_printer_behind_your_memes/) \n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Glad I caught this one.\n\nI follow you for good reason... your past DDs have been spot on.

Fundamentals look pretty good,  relatively low debt load,  revenue and earnings trends are good.  Cash flow is even better.  I’m concerned about their polar “investment” and what it might be hiding off balance sheet,  and they might be under valued because of the potential dilution from the warrants issued to Amazon. If I read their somewhat opaque disclosure,  Amazon warrants looks like it’s potentially 20% dilutive.   Also they have convertible notes that are potentially dilutive. This company has a significant basket of potentially dilutive instruments outstanding. \n\nOdd investment and warrants to Amazon aside,  I think a 4x PE ratio is certainly indicative of being significantly under valued with a 10-15x multiple being more reasonable.  \n\nAll that said,  I am skeptical that q3/q4 earnings are a catalyst. As of q2, they are sitting on 750M in cash,  less than a quarter of operating expenses, and $600 million of debt coming due in the next year.  I don’t see them having enough cash to start a material buy back program.  Put another way, q3/q4 earnings would have to be a windfall of a few times historical earnings/cash flow to make a stock buyback a reality in the next six months. \n\nIn conclusion,  I see this as a longer play,  6-9 months or longer.  Potential dilution is a concern. November 2022 options look cheap to me,  and I think that’s how I’ll play this one.

This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a position of my portfolio in $ASTS.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)\n\n**This DD contains 10 hours of research and writing.**\n\n**It is very comprehensive and will go into the nitty gritty details. It will be almost like a wiki for what we currently know about ASTS. In addition, I've went through all of the comments and tried my best to address all of the criticism in this part.**\n\nSince my first $ASTS DD, The stock went up quite a bit, but it's still no where near the valuation it deserves. The potential upside of ASTS is comparable to $TSLA in its 50$s(post split) and this is an understatement. At a valuation of 2.03 Billion(now), a **10-100X increase in valuation**(stock price) is not far away from reality, if everything goes to plan. This is literally a once in a lifetime opportunity which for me deserves the risk (The risk of it going to 0$ if shit hits the fan or going to **200$+**).\n\nOne thing that ASTS has recently shown, **which ClOV failed to do**, is that **it's not a pump and dump scheme.** When it shot up, it stayed up and for me that shows that the holders are true believers and not just pumpers.\n\n# WARNING! (Should Not be Skipped)\n\nSince this is a speculative play, skepticism is healthy especially when the stock is in it's very early stages. We definitely don't want this to become the next $NKLA... In addition, as I mentioned, this could go either way **0 or +200$+ so always keep that in mind!**\n\n# Intro (Should Not be skipped)\n\nRoughly 40-47% of the world doesn't have access to online Porn or the internet, a **Trillion** dollar market unFapped. Imagine more than **3 Billion** horny people limited to only masturbating to their imagination!!\n\nASTS is developing the **First and Only** Space based Cellular Broadband network, **SpaceMobile.** SpaceMobile will be **compatible** with all currently existing 5G and LTE smartphones without the need to do any modifications to your phones hardware. It will provide connectivity **at 4G/5G speeds** **everywhere on the planet – on land, at sea and in flight.** In addition, 5 Billion phones move in and out of coverage all the time, SpaceMobile is planning to bridge the gap of connection loss without the need of specialized equipment! Finally and More importantly, it currently has **no competitors,** not even **StarLink**(as per the CEO).\n\n# 1) The Technology in details (Too fancy and can be skipped):\n\n**TLDR;  The tech has been proven to work on smaller scales but has yet to be done at the scale ASTS is aiming for. Additionally, it's 6G forward compatible!**\n\nAST SpaceMobile has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct-to-device’ service to normal phones using a **low earth orbit satellite** array to directly connect to mobile phones anywhere on Earth.\n\n    1- Low Earth Orbit Satellites\n\nNow let's start with good old GEOsatellites so that we can talk about LEO satellites. Traditional communication satellites are geostationary and have been in orbit for more than 50 years. GEOsatellites weigh more than 1000kg and operate 36,000 kilometers above the earth. These satellites remain in a fixed position relative to any position. Despite Earth’s orbit, this allows ground-based antennas the ability to point directly at the  satellite, in a fixed position. \n\nIn contrast, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites(which ASTS is going to use) orbits between 200 and 2000 kilometers above Earth’s surface. ASTS is planning to have their satellites at 720Km using cellular spectrum primarily located between 600mhz - 2.2ghz weighing around 2000kg.\n\nUnlike Geostationary Orbits , LEO satellites move rapidly(at an altitude of 500km, it can move at a speed of 7.6 km/s)  with respect to the Earth’s surface and have a small ground coverage. In particular, the ground coverage of a LEO satellite deployed **at 600 km** above the Earth’s surface and with a typical elevation angle of 30 degrees **is around 0.45% of the Earth’s surface.** Moreover, **due to the low altitude of deployment,** LEO satellites can communicate **with diverse types of ground terminals, such as dedicated ground stations (GSs), 5G gNBs**, ships and other vehicles, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This creates the need for a relatively dense constellation **to ensure that any ground terminal is always covered by at least one satellite.** Therefore, global commercial deployments such as ASTS usually consists of more than a hundred satellites to be able to have a full global coverage.\n\n5G is a standard that incorporates many different bands of spectrum, including cellular (600mhz - 3.5ghz), which has great distance and propagation characteristics, and much higher millimeter band spectrum which has issues traveling far distances and penetrating objects.  ASTS is planning to use its partner’s CELLULAR spectrum, which can travel much further than millimeter band spectrum that is referred to by bears.\n\nNow AST satellites each will have up to 2800 user beams and two or three gateway beams. Each user beam will be electrically steered through a large phased array antenna and will be capable of being pointed anywhere within the Field of View (“FoV”) of 20 degrees elevation angle. Additionally, each satellite in the AST constellation will provide service up to 58 degrees away from boresight.\n\nThe satellites may transmit all of its active user beams on the same frequency or different frequencies. Each active user beam will track a fixed cell on the ground within its FoV without steering the boresight of the planar phased array antenna. All of the active beams can be distributed flexibly  within the FoV.\n\nThe same cell on the ground can be illuminated by a single beam, by multiple beams from same satellite, or by multiple beams from different satellites with in the view of the cell to enhance the user experience. The beam-to-beam handover and the gateway handover are based on schedules and  use a “break -then- make ” approach.\n\n    2- Frequency and User count\n\nThe large LEO concepts are mainly planning to use Ka band for Backhaul. These frequencies **enable higher data rates,** smaller antennas, narrower beams, and greater security. Moreover, improved spectral efficiency and spectrum-reuse rates can also **increase the amount of data a system delivers.**\n\nIn addition to better use of spectrum, advances in active antennas and processing have **raised throughput per individual satellite, increasing constellation capacity.** Consider a few changes:\n\n* A satellite can now deploy more spot beams, and greater power can be delivered through each beam.\n* Intersatellite links (ISLs) improve connectivity and confer particular benefits to large constellations, including improved throughput and management.\n* Improved data-compression methods reduce bandwidth requirements without reducing the quality of communications.\n\nSo, a 10 Ka-band steerable antenna can provide up to 1.6 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. In addition, two high-performance antennas, can provide up to 5.2 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. This is only for the backhaul between the satellites and terrestrial stations. ASTS btw is planning to use V bands for backhaul, which have less traffic on them vs. Ka.\n\nNow for the Fronthaul ASTS will use cellular spectrum (600mhz - 2.2ghz). These frequencies are used today by cellular phones. These frequencies are the best at covering long distances and can propagate through rain, walls, trees, etc .\n\nThe numbers for ASTS aren't out, but we can talk about Starlinks numbers since it uses LEO satellites too which is essentially the same technology. Starlink will be able to support 485,000 simultaneous users at 100Mbit/s across the entire US, according to new estimates. Additionally, Elon Musk tweeted on 26 of June \"Starlink simultaneously active users just exceeded the strategically important threshold of 69,420 last night!\". The technology works and the numbers are impressive.\n\n    3- Latency\n\nAncient geostationary satellites (at 35,786 km) already provide broadband services but their transmissions take about 500-700 milliseconds (ms) to travel up and another 500-700 milliseconds to travel down. This time-lag is why users suffer the infuriating time delay during a conversation between the broadcast studio and an outside broadcast unit. Additionally, If the OB (Outside broadcasting) is more than one satellite ‘hop’ away, then the delay is multiplied.\n\nNow on the other hand, A low Earth-orbiting satellite(What ASTS is using), between 200 and 2000 km, would manage these links in **about 25-35 ms**, a true fraction of existing satellite links and quite comparable to existing cables or fibre networks!\n\n# 2) Timeline(can be skipped):\n\n**TLDR;** **They have broken up their plan into 5 different phases spanning multiple  years with the intent of slowly expanding their satellite constellation until full global coverage is achieved.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Phase 1 - Equatorial constellation, 20 satellites by 2022\n   * Cash flow from phase 1 will support the following phases\n* Phase 2 - NA/Europe/Asia, 45 satellites by 2022\n* Phase 3 - Full global coverage, 45 satellites by 2023\n   * At this point ASTS expects to start turning a profit\n* Phase 4 - Full global MIMO coverage (increased data capacity), 58 satellites by 2023\n* Phase 5 - Scaling network globally, 16 satellites by 2028\n\n# 3) Management(Can be skipped):\n\n* CEO Abel Avellan\n   * 25+ years of space industry experience\n   * Track record of building a successful global satellite communications company\n      * EMC Emerging Markets Communications\n* CFO Tom Severson\n   * Former CFO of Emclaire Financial Corp\n* Chief Technology Officer Huiwen Yao\n   * 30+ years of experience in satcom\n* Chief communications officer Chris Ivory\n   * 25+ years of experience in satcom\n\nEmployees:\n\n* 236 full-time employees\n* 13 part-time employees\n* 161 scientists and engineers\n   * 34 of whom are PhDs\n\n**The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm,  NASA, and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom  are PhDs.**\n\n# 4) Business Model(Can be skipped):\n\n**TLDR; ASTS brings the satellites and execution while their partners bring the customers.  Projections for 2024 annual revenue are $1 billion, and for 2030 annual revenue of $16 billion with 90% EBIDTA margins.**\n\n***The Model:*** ASTS has chosen to partner with **preexisting telecom giants** to acquire a large customer base with essentially **0 acquisition costs per customer** for ASTS. They have agreed to a **50/50 revenue** split with its partners who are going to provide the customers. The 5g connection will be offered as an add-on to preexisting data plans provided by their partners or as a standalone purchase.\n\n***How Does it generate Money? :***  With its current carrier partners, Vodafone and AT\\&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide  significant operating leverage and cash flow.\n\nIn-place there are binding agreements with carriers to provide ASTS with access to  >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn). Phase 1 will  target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people. In subsequent phases, it's planning to expand into Europe and N. America by 2024.\n\nThe company is expected to generate >$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user.\n\n***ASSets:***  ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage(no competitors yet). Moreover, Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market having ATT, Vodafone, American Towers and Rakuten in it's pocket.\n\n# 5)Catalysts(can be skipped):\n\n**The most important catalyst is the BlueWalker 3 satellite launch which will be taking place between March and April of 2022 and will be launched by SpaceX.**\n\nThis will be a bigger satellite than any previous ones created but it still is not the biggest they plan to make. However, a successful launch and connection to BlueWalker 3 would definitively **prove that the tech works at larger scales.**\n\n**Expect major runup to BlueWalker3 test date. AST is currently valued at only about $2 billion ($12/share). In 2017, about 7 months prior to Starlink's first test launch, it was valued at $15 billion ($83/share).**\n\nOther smaller but still significant catalysts include:\n\n* Government approvals for servicing in each country\n* The launch date for BlueWalker3\n* Acquisition of a portion of the federal 5g fund\n\n# 6) Share Holders(Can be skipped):\n\nAccording to Fintel, 29% is held by institutional investors. In  addition, These investors are well versed in the 5G market and I don’t  think that they would’ve invested if they didn’t see a proof of concept.\n\nThe following companies are partners  and large shareholders with their percentage of capital ownership  (includes both Class A and B common shares):\n\n* Vodafone - 6%\n* American Tower - 3%\n* Rakuten  - 17%\n\nOther notable partners include:\n\n* ATT\n* Samsung\n* Safran\n* LLA\n* Telefonica\n* Telstra\n* Tigo\n* Telecom\n* Indosat\n\n# 7) Risks(Should not be skipped Asshole...):\n\nEvery play ranging from 0dte to year long investments come with some amount of risk and this is no exception.  While some may simply be setbacks they are still worth knowing.\n\n* Delays\n   * Satellite construction and launch delays.\n* Execution\n   * Building, launching and deploying the satellites.\n* Regulators\n   * Need governmental approval for satellite operations from each country they wish to provide before they can service them.\n* Tech\n   * Satellite to phone connection still unproven on a large scale.\n* Funding\n   * Not fully funded (Need to raise \\~1.5 bn) however phase 1 is fully funded and is planned to help pay for the subsequent phases.\n\n# 8) Valuation(Most important part):\n\nThe current market cap of ASTS is only 2.03 Billion for a stock with an extremely high potential, endless possibilities, and no competitors.\n\nSpaceX's Starlink(If we want to compare apples to oranges), will provide **FIXED-POINT(Doesn't connect to mobile)** broadband to customers at very high costs with unclear quality. Moreover Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices. It depends on Dish Satellites.\n\nStarLink is valuated between 40-50Billion Dollars! **Which equals around 222$-277$ of ASTS!!**\n\nJust like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE** and Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices.\n\n***Deutsche Bank most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 35$ and they added this nice comment **“If management executes on plan over the next five years, the company's intrinsic value should ultimately be \"significantly higher\"** than the $35  price target.\"\n\n**Deutsche Bank adds: \"2024 is  early in this project's lifecycle. If we take AST management's 2030  EBIDTA of more than $16 billion and apply a 10x multiple (which we think  is still conservative given the business' expected growth profile),  this implies a 2030 enterprise value of $163 billion (vs $2 billion  today). Discounting that EV back to present time at a 15% discount  yields a share price of roughly $190 today.\"**\n\n***Barclays Most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 29$.\n\n**And Most importantly my coverage:** Well, you cannot really valuate this rare breed, because it's like trying to valuate $TSLA in the early days when it was just 50$(post split). ASTS is in a very similar situation right now having no competitors with a massive lead in the industry(A proven product on a small scale with well established partnerships with Vodafone, ATT, American Towers and Rakuten).\n\nRight now, it should atleast have a market cap of 10 Billion, which is 1/4 Starlink, and there's actually no competition.\n\nMy price target remains unhinged and will be illustrated bellow with Crayons:\n\n[AST SpaceMobile Price target Illustrated with

Lots of good comments here too.  I have YANG shares, YANG 1/21 $20 and $25 calls, and have 3/18 $22 puts on HSBC.  YANG really only goes up if there is a panic across the market, contagion effect across the rest of China's economy (everyone who's worth is tied to real estate assets which will sink, and those who put down $50-200,000 for an apartment and never even got it delivered and have lost all their money and also don't have a home are going to be less likely to buy discretionary goods), or a great capital flight out of China by foreign investors.   HSBC is just a wild ass guess. \n\nSecond, agreed that a real estate melt down is worst case scenario for CCP, for all the reasons you've pointed out. \n\nThird, earlier today a fellow WSBer in London noted HSBC had emergency conference call.  HSBC was one of the top 4 mortgage lenders to the people who were buying Evergrande properties. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-21/hsbc-halts-mortgages-for-evergrande-projects-in-hong-kong It seems like a lot of these properties were never finished, and probably will never be finished.  We have no way of knowing what HSBC's exposure is, for now.  The other 3 major mortgage lenders were Hang Seng Bank (HSNGY), Bank of East Asia (BKEAY), and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia) (private).  I have not done any DD into HSNGY or BKEAY.\n\nFourth, we know that as of spring 2021, Citi, Goldman, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America were drawn to China \"like moths to a flame.\"   \n[https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3125723/five-big-us-banks-drawn-strong-economic-performance-moths](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3125723/five-big-us-banks-drawn-strong-economic-performance-moths)  Goldman had put $17 billion into China in 2020, and collectively those 5 had $78 billion in exposure for 2020; and it was growing at 10% per year.  In other words, Wall Street went brrrrrr and put it into \"broad array of cash and financing to companies and government entities\" in China.  You can't put like $85 billion into China without it being lended directly to Evergrande, construction companies working for Evergrande, other real estate deals propped up on inflated values, suppliers and vendors of Evergrande, or into government entities which will be indirectly impacted by Evergrande.  Again, we do not know what each bank's current exposure is.  \n\nFifth, this is all speculation, but we know Deutsche Bank has an appetite for the trashiest shit imaginable.  It has been facing [increased European regulatory pressure](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/deutsche-bank-may-face-higher-capital-bar-leveraged-loans-bloomberg-news-2021-06-22/).  But surprise, surprise, in April 2021, [DB became the first Eurozone bank to be allowed to be a primary dealer](https://www.db.com/news/detail/20210430-people-s-bank-of-china-approves-deutsche-bank-china-as-qualified-primary-dealer-in-open-market-business?language_id=1) for the Chinese central bank.  Now, why would the CCP decide to allow DB to be the preferred Eurozone bank?  It can't be because of transparency and stability and DB's decades-long reputation of adherence to strict regulatory structures.  \n\nThe thing to remember is that this could happen very fast, or it could still take another year to materialize.  Even if Evergrande can't make payments on September 20, we may not know which financial firms or other parts of the Chinese economy are impacted for weeks or months.  Our hindsight bias makes us remember and focus on September 15, 2008 with Lehman filing for bankruptcy and the rapid unraveling of the U.S. financial system the following week.  But things had been brewing since 2006 (home prices started to falter in some regions), October 2007 there were significant subprime delinquencies and foreclosures, Bear Sterns wasn't defunct until March 2008, and then Lehman, AIG, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Merrill Lynch, etc. in September 2008. \n\nTL;DR: YANG shares, YANG 1/21 $20 and $25 calls, and HSBC 3/18 $22 puts.", "score": 137, "replies": [{"body": "No need for explanation when you say you want to buy puts on Deutsche", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 154, "replies": [{"body": "I’m in on HSBC puts as of earlier today thanks to a WSBer in London", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Are u going long puts", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is the only way.
