Is there any advantage to choosing a higher strike price like credit for example?  Also is there any better time to roll than others?  My understanding is you buy the call right? So the lower the price the cheaper for rolling it. Is that correct? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "A lot to unpack here.\n\nThe most important point is that rolling can't fix a bad trade. Sometimes, your forecast is just wrong and rolling will just lose more money. So if a trade goes wrong, you should not just automatically roll it. Reassess the opportunity and understand that the play now has to be 2x, 5x, 10x better than what you thought it was originally to make up for any losses you'll realize by rolling. Very few plays go from having 2x upside to 10x upside *after going against you*.\n\nThis is why I'm not a fan of trying to rescue losing trades. Cutting your losses and moving your money to a better play on a different underlying is almost always a net win.\n\nOkay, now with that sermon out of the way, a roll is just closing the old trade and opening a new one on the same underlying, but possibly with a different expiration and/or different strike.\n\nHere are the goals/rules of a roll:\n\n* Only roll for a net credit or breakeven. \n\n* Assuming you can roll for a credit, never roll for an expiration that is further out that your max holding time. Personally, I never go out more than 60 days, so if the only way to get a net credit on a roll is to roll out to 2 years, I don't roll.\n\n* Even if you can roll for a credit with a reasonable holding time, if the new trade has poor probability of profit, like you have to roll a debit trade too far OTM or a credit trade too far ITM, don't roll.\n\nSo you can see that if a long call is losing money, it's very difficult to find a good roll. Suppose stock XYZ was $100 and you bought a $105 call for for $3 with 30 days to expiration. At 20 days to expiration the stock drops to $95 and your call is now worth $2.50, so you lost $.50. You would want to roll out and up to find a new call that costs less than the original $3 you paid. If you can find a new call that only costs $2, you net $.50 vs. the original call ($2.50 close - $3 open - $2 roll = -$2.50 net change to cash balance vs. the -$3.00 net change for the original call).", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Super helpful.

Also around 45 DTE at open.\n\nSecond, the \"good\" number is that the spread should pay at least 1/3 of the spread width in credit. So if the spread is $1 wide, you want to get at least $.34 in credit. This gives you a reasonably balanced risk/reward. If the credit is smaller than that, your risk increases too much for your probability of profit. At exactly 30 delta and exactly $.34 credit on a $1 spread, your [expected value](http://www.selectoptions.com/Edu-Expected-Result) = (.34 x 70%) - (.66 x 30%) = $0.04, which is just barely above break even.\n\nRather than 1/3, you can use 1/2 of the max loss.

Let me start off with why I hold so long. The simple answer is that this is my strategy, to buy and hold. To be more specific, if you look at history, the market continually grows over time, especially when you look at long periods like 10, 15, 20 years. We have obviously had some major corrections and recessions that have pummeled the market, but the market has always come back over time. Timing the market is impossible, especially for those who are not in the business of buying/selling stocks. I’m for all intents and purposes and amateur and I know there’s no shot I’m timing anything in the market. Also, I diversify my investments, which allow me to be in a position to own stocks in sectors that are up at any given point in time. Many business sectors have cycles where they perform well for several years, then go into a slump for several years. This gives me the opportunity to sell and pull some cash if I happen to need it. I try my best to never pull from my investments, as my long term goal is financial independence by my mid-50s. Hopefully this adequately explains the why, so let me know if you’d like me to clarify any of these points.\n\nAs for some of the stocks I’ve purchased showing an increase of 1,000% or more, here are a few examples:\n\nKEYS - I purchased two blocks, one in ‘99 and one in ‘01. My share cost is just over $15, with today’s price being about $175. This is just over 1,000% in gains.\n\nMA (MasterCard) - My cost in 2010 was $25.45, today it’s trading at $354 for a gain of over 1,200%.\n\nMSFT - My cost in 2011 was $26.95, and today it’s trading at $289 for a gain of 975% (I know, under a 1,000% but still pretty good).\n\nI have many others in the 700-800% range as well. One of the things you may notice is that I’m investing in larger, stable companies. I’m also strong on stocks that pay out dividends, which is what I use to fund additional positions.\n\nAgain, I’m a complete amateur with all of this. I just know over the (very) long term most stocks (and the market overall) are always up. I cannot time the market, so I’m incapable of picking short term winners and I don’t really try. I just go by history, and if something I like drops, I add to it to bring my cost down in the hopes it will go back up again over time. I hope this helps!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the detailed response. I agree with you, I have been holding Berkshire (B class) and Apple for the last 7 years or so, and I have already realized close to 600% profit.

One of the biggest manufacturers in the US, and one of the only US car companies to never go bankrupt isn't even valued as highly as racing team that also happens to make a few sportscars for rich assholes. \n\nOnly one of the legacy automakers even cracks a $100 billion valuation. For comparison, Apple has a market cap that's *10 times larger* than Toyota, and over *25 times the size* of most of the companies on this list. You could add them all together and it wouldn't add up to one Apple, or Google or Microsoft. Hell, this entire list isn't even worth, in investor's eyes, as much as a single Facebook, and that hellhole is barely worth a trillion dollars.\n\nTesla isn't overvalued compared to the rest of the industry. It's the only auto company that's valued as if it might continue to grow and be profitable for the next decade or two. The rest of these companies are valued like investors hope to get a few years of dividends out of them and then dump them before they go bankrupt. And it kind of makes sense, countries and states around the world are talking about making their only profitable products illegal to sell within in the next 10-15 years. \n\nLegacy automakers have had 20-30 years to figure out how to make EVs, the only product they could conceivably make that will be profitable long term, and they've mostly sat on their thumbs and pretended global warming wasn't happening for most of that time. It took a tech startup out of California to show the *entire industry* that it was possible to make good EVs, profitably, and the rest of the industry is still trying to copy them. Hell, Toyota, the largest automaker in the world, isn't even sure yet that EVs are worth investing in in any significant way.

{"title": "$TSLA to ATHs and your account can be too if you join in!!!!", "selftext": "Tesla has been consolidating for nearly 10 months since hitting an ATH of $900 at the beginning of the year. It has recently broke a major resistance at $760 that has stood for several months. The next resistance lies near the $850-$900 area. With all the hype around EVs and the upcoming bill supporting EV infrastructure, I believe market conditions are favorable in the EV sector and will help support such a rally.\n\n[Tesla 4hr chart, Nov 2020 - Present](https://preview.redd.it/4c9nu5hp3yp71.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=0516b653dd0adb09023f1f46487c2c2a29358447)\n\nBelieve it or not, the picture below is not a duplicate of the picture above! It is the previous consolidation period which preceded the most recent rally to ATHs. The resemblance to this most recent breakout is uncanny which leads me to believe this breakout could easily take us to new highs. This breakout below was followed by a 100% rally in stock price with two weeks of 20% gains and even one of 24%+ gains.\n\n[Tesla 4hr chart, Aug 2020 - Dec 2020](https://preview.redd.it/mibhhyku3yp71.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=a653d62da13958cbcd8ef23d1b17a15d4c872f63)\n\nObviously I don't expect Tesla to rally another 100% but I do think a 20% rally to ATHs is completely possible very soon.

{"title": "💰🦁 Lions and deSPACs and redemptions, oh my!!! A guide to the fuse (heh) that's been lit on MoneyLion's stock - $ML 💵🐆", "selftext": "I'm honestly amazed at the variety of emoji's for both money and cats - more than any other subject matter I'm aware of...\n\n# 💰💸💵💶💷💳💲🐈🐈‍⬛😻🦁🐆🐅🐯\n\n^(note some may be iDevice only, lol)\n\nOK, so depending on what Reddit social cliques you're associated with (feels like high school all over again...), you may have seen some excitement around a company called MoneyLion, ticker ML. I'm here to paint as clear a picture as possible - using my finger paint, of course - about what's going on and why some are watching so closely.\n\n**TLDR: MoneyLion is another deSPAC play that is still VERY EARLY in its deSPAC squeeze cycle... so early that it might never happen because there are still major unknowns, but if it does, then you might be able to get in on the ground floor if you pay close attention. Super fucking risky though, not that I'll sway many to consider appropriate risk management. Instead, I want to explain what I see as transparently as possible. Ultimately, YOU REALLY SHOULD WAIT FOR REDEMPTION NUMBERS (but you probably either won't, or won't have to...).**\n\nIf you aren't interested in some fluff and background, maybe jump down to like section 04 or 05.\n\n# 00. First of all, who the fuck are you?\n\nThis is one of the first times I've shared detailed DD, or any DD at all in some circles, and so it's a valid question. Here's a quick and extremely transparent history to hopefully head off any accusations:\n\n* I started following WSB in March-ish of 2020. While I've been on Reddit for over a decade (mostly lurking), it was then that my buddy pointed out some of the moronic shit that was going on and a quick look piqued my interest.\n* Both my buddy and I quickly went on to lose a few grand each buying puts in the summer of 2020. Yes, you hear that right, we were absolutely bears of the 🌈 variety. Of course, we weren't alone at the time and I considered it a \"hedge for whether I'm about to lose my job\", but losing money did get tiring quickly.\n* By the end of the summer, with my RH account sufficiently in prolapse territory and because I (un)fortunately still hadn't lost my real job, I gave up. I deleted most of my interactions with the merry band of internet idiots that had given me such bad advice and relegated the sub to more of a \"source of entertainment\"...\n* ...that is, until I saw that same merry band of internet idiots had started sending unwanted pizza deliveries to a certain Wall Street ego. Andy Left was subsequently burned at the proverbial stake, and I sank a few grand into calls in a washed-up video game retailer and made my summer put money back and then some. It was here that I gained a deeper respect for the shenanigans and realized there was something intriguing about this particular corner of the interwebz that might impact the very dynamics of equity markets, *forever*.\n\nI now frequent a handful of different trading subs, most public some private, lurk in yet a few more, and generally just look for the most interesting set-ups from which I can learn weird esoteric trading stuff. I still have my day job, and profit is somewhat secondary to my wife's dismay, but I've done reasonably well over time and I personally think my strength is adaptability to a variety of scenarios. Or at least that's what I tell myself.\n\nAnyway, enough about me.\n\n# 01. So, what the fuck is a MoneyLion anyway?\n\nWell, don't take it from me. Instead, let's check with a world-renowned expert...\n\n>*Many* *~~African~~* *\\[retarded\\] cultures praise the* *~~courage and charisma~~* *\\[redemption levels\\] of the* *~~leopard~~* *\\[MoneyLion\\]. They also* *~~fear~~* *\\[make wild guesses about\\] his* *~~stealth and his cunning~~* *\\[available float and propesntiy to squeeze\\], because he can* *~~move and hunt in total darkness~~* *\\[delay his SEC filings\\], whereas we, unable to* *~~see~~* *\\[do math\\], can only* *~~hide away~~* *\\[irresponsibly YOLO our accounts\\].*\\- David Attenborough (actual quote, modified only slightly)\n\n[you better not pee on me, you little shit.](https://preview.redd.it/zhd4xawanyp71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0c58ace3b1fb6a02d70ed196272eaa26b3e3591)\n\nRelated species include:\n\n* CurrencyTiger\n* DollarFeline\n* PeculinaryCat\n* FiscalKitty\n* etc. (but not 💵🦭 like that one guy on [r/SPACs](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/) keeps pushing... that's a fucking seal, you dork)\n\nI'm here to elaborate on what David has summarized so succinctly and, hopefully, allow everyone here to make slightly less irresponsible decisions on yet another one of these deSPAC plays (we'll be sure to use some crayons for the IRNT/TMC/OPAD/etc. bagholders at the back of the bus).\n\nActually, before we go too much further, let's go for a quick detour...\n\n# 02. First of all, what's the deal with all these deSPACs?\n\nI was fortunate enough to be burning time in an airport terminal when [the original thesis on IRNT started floating around](https://www.reddit.com/user/Undercover_in_SF/comments/pg3s2e/irnt_ironnet_cyber_security_an_actual_gamma/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (followed by the notorious pennyethers's [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/phc0uk/irnt_glitched_float_whale_oi_nuclear_gamma_ramp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). As I mentioned, I'm much more interested in the underlying technical set-ups that present an asymmetric risk opportunity and less interested in social pumps. I had just made some decent money following GREE's predecessor for the better part of 2 months but I had paper-handed before the squeeze and so I was feeling down. I tossed some money at calls, set a stop loss, and proceeded to my gate. By the time I sat down on the plane, my calls were up 400% and my stop-loss had triggered.\n\nWTF just happened? Well, here's what:\n\n1. SPACs are effectively shell companies with money to burn, looking for an investment target.\n2. In this case, that target was IRNT, and, for a range of reasons I'll get into below, the investors didn't *feel* like watching said money burn on this particular \"investment opportunity\".\n3. So when it came time to merge, the rules surrounding the way SPACs work allowed said investors to get the money back which they had put into the shell company previously, in a step called **redemptions**. In the case of IRNT, many investors elected to do this.\n4. This meant that the capital secured by IRNT through the process was well below their desired levels (bad for the company), but more importantly to us, it also meant that the number of shares on the open market was dramatically lowered resulting in a **very low float** (good for traders looking to profit off of market inefficiencies/imbalances).\n5. *Before* all of this, that shell company I mentioned earlier had LOTS of shares floating around, so they qualified for certain derivative on the market and thus, there were calls and puts available for trading. Normally a ticker with a super low float like IRNT wouldn't be permitted to trade with options.\n6. *Also before* a lot of this, and way before Reddit caught on, someone (most likely a whale) anticipated all of this and had been loading up the options chain with calls. So much so that **there was a pre-built gamma ramp**.\n7. Now, with only the tiniest bit (relatively speaking) of volume, the price-per-share started to go up rapidly due to the tiny float remaining after redemptions and merger. This forced MMs to start hedging which, very quickly, threw us up and off that gamma ramp into orbit.\n8. **For me, this was where the worthwhile trade ended.** From here on, the stock continued to be extremely volatile due to the low float and constant dynamic hedging/de-hedging of calls and puts and many people here made (and lost) a lot of money.\n9. In my opinion, though, the fundamental technical play had been superseded by a feeding frenzy that was subject to the fickle whims of social media. The asymmetric risk opportunity was gone and in its place, it became a casino for gambling on whether or not the majority of people were buying or selling at any particular moment in time.\n\n[ That tiny, tiny spike at \\(a.\\) was when I was getting on my plane, \\(b.\\) I jumped back in over the weekend and exited first thing Monday, but \\(c.\\) is where the MAJORITY of people learned about the play and took massive risks. That part I avoided with a 10-foot pole. ](https://preview.redd.it/gf0ymbc6nyp71.png?width=2346&format=png&auto=webp&s=141b20509d88dfb58f5166c0becfe0ecf3eeb531)\n\nThis all led me to look much closer at coming deSPAC plays to see which might present a similar asymmetric risk opportunity. I've been in some of those, and like many here, I've been following other very experienced Reddit accounts closely as trades are analyzed, thesis develop and are disparaged, interest builds and wanes, and these continue to be a topic of interest amongst many traders in the market.\n\nThis all led me to a particular ticker - the SPAC (shell company I mentioned earlier) which had targeted MoneyLion. Some subs don't like SPAC tickers, but you can see [my initial post on it here](https://www.reddit.com/user/space_cadet/comments/ppklh3/light_the_fuse_this_shit_is_about_to_blow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nAnd now, back to our regularly scheduled programming:\n\n# 03. So why is MoneyLion a particularly interesting play? you might ask...\n\nWell, back when I first found it before the ticker change, these are a few of the aspects that caught my attention:\n\n* **The Definitive Agreement (DA) announcement wasn't particularly well-received,** even during the height of the SPAC craze earlier this year. This is because MoneyLion wasn't a particularly enticing merge target, and thus redemptions are LIKELY (key word) to be higher, which means float is likely to be lower. A lot more on all this below, because this is THE MOST CRITICAL ASPECT TO THIS TRADE.\n* **There was an OK amount of OI on the options chain already.** Not the levels you would expect if a whale had been slowly and deliberately building a ramp, like IRNT, but more than many of the other deSPACs that were already getting some traction. Something like 2-4k contracts per OTM strike, spread out over Sep/Oct/Nov monthly OPEX dates. (I didn't record or take screenshots, but its largely irrelevant now).\n* **Even with that existing OI, implied volatility was still relatively low (roughly 80-100% on avg.).** Now, most of you dorks got into the likes of IRNT *waaaaaay* after IV was super high, but the original technical set-up I mentioned earlier was nearly risk-free because IV was so low. Essentially, that meant either:\n\n1. Those initial calls I bought on IRNT while waiting in the terminal went nowhere, and I would just sell-to-close at a nominal loss (mostly transaction fees), or...\n2. Lots of other people would do the same - buying calls - and the IV would go up. Even if the stock price didn't budge (for instance, the thesis was faulty), I would make some money off IV expansion and move on, or...\n3. **What ACTUALLY happened - the thesis was right, the price spiked massively and so, between IV expansion and delta appreciation on my calls, I walked away with plenty of low-risk profit.**\n\n* **Short interest** \\- honestly, I don't know if it matters as much for these plays anymore. Shorts seem to have adjusted and know they can wait out the whole debacle with enough capital on hand, since they're super short-lived by their very nature. But this thing has been shorted to (animal) kingdom come and back:\n\n[ note Ortex hasn't picked up ML yet, but appears to still be updating the pre-merger SPAC ticker daily 🤷‍♂️ ](https://preview.redd.it/u7nmxg88nyp71.png?width=2025&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee05efad3bf82a0978c532a8064430c11d64a409)\n\n1. Estimated current SI: **3.21mm**\n2. Current SI of FF: **11.42%** (note this obviously reflects pre-redemption float)\n3. CTB low/mid/high: **n/a (?)**\n4. **Utilization: 100%**\n\n* Finally, even though the underlying business didn't seem all that enticing to me, it does seem capable of fostering some interest in the current market. **Whether that's the \"memeable ticker\", the memorable name, it's \"fintech\" status, recent \"internet coin\" announcement, etc.**, the point is that it's got enough to catch on (unlike the alphabet soup of other deSPACs where most traders don't know the first thing about the business).\n\n# 04. So what, per your first bullet point above, makes you think the redemptions will be so high?\n\nWell before we do that, let's talk about the company a bit...\n\nMoneyLion is essentially a financial services firm offering the following:\n\n1. Small emergency loans via their **Safety Net** feature - think \"my car broke down but I still need to get to Wendy's for my minimum wage job.\"\n2. **Paycheck advances** \\- when you live paycheck to paycheck, as an unfortunately sizeable portion of the country does, getting your paycheck a few days early is sometimes necessary.\n3. Some **mobile banking**, but they are **not an accredited bank.**\n4. **NEW - \"Buy Now Pay Later\"** (BNPL) a la Affirm and a few others.\n5. **NEW -** the announced a new **\"internet coin\" trading** platform.\n\nAs I said, their DA wasn't particularly well received. I SUSPECT (and this is all conjecture and my personal opinion) that's because of a combination of some or all of the following, going point for point with the above business description:\n\n1. Safety Net - they are basically a digital loan shark, capitalizing on people who are desperate to profit off of high interest-rate loans.\n2. Paycheck advances - same issues as #1.\n3. Mobile banking - crowded field, and the simple problem that their products are limited given, well, **they're not an accredited bank**.\n4. BNPL - don't believe this was around at time of DA, but also a crowded field (Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, Zebit, PayPal, and many, many more...\n5. **\"internet coins\"** \\- yeah, well, everyone and your mother wants this on their rap sheet for \"street cred.\" Also, the simple matter that they announced this literally 3 DAYS BEFORE REDEMPTIONS WERE DUE just reeks of desperation, trying to get some good PR out the door at the last minute.\n6. Additionally, [their valuation is arguably rich](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/pqfgwx/fintech_spac_valuation_comparison/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Not the highest of the high, but in a crowded \"fintech\" field, the premiums associated with that over-used adjective are starting to lose their luster. Also, it seems that having a smartphone app and offering financial services is all it takes to add that moniker these days - returns on the \"data-driven\" stuff they shill could take years to materialize, if ever.\n\n[ you're also betting that Kevin fucking Garnett made a potentially bad investment, and he scares the bejeezus out of me.. ](https://preview.redd.it/6gypvmlfnyp71.png?width=1438&format=png&auto=webp&s=c04506a7fb662e932562227b1a2752dee0f80574)\n\nSome final context on their DA not being recieved well - it was back when SPACs were all the rage because everyone thought they were hidden gems in an otherwise unforgiving market, yet even in that environment, some combination of the above issues (my own) and plenty of others appeared to be enough for people to say...\n\n# ...𝓂ℯ𝒽.\n\nNote the current \"deSPAC craze\" is quite the opposite of that aforementioned golden era for SPACs. SPACs have fallen *out* of favor, so redemptions are generally super high as investors just want their money back, and everyone is counting on shit companies with super low floats to be the next target of technical and social squeezes.\n\n# 05. So, [u/space\\_cadet](https://www.reddit.com/u/space_cadet/), what will the redemptions actually be?\n\nThis is the all-encompassing critical question, and the answer is:\n\n# 𝕀 𝕙𝕒𝕧𝕖𝕟'𝕥 𝕘𝕠𝕥 𝕒 𝕗𝕦𝕔𝕜𝕚𝕟𝕘 𝕔𝕝𝕦𝕖.\n\nSo don't ask me.\n\nHowever, here's a few reference points that I was using in order to give me enough confidence to enter the trade a little while back:\n\n* Redemptions have generally been climbing - there are fewer and fewer decent merge targets on the market, FAR too many SPACs still looking to close deals, and the SPACs have a time limit... a *fuse* you might say...\n* [Here](https://twitter.com/TornikeLaghidze/status/1435933432719319042?s=20) are the redemption rates for deSPACs in August. There have been smaller or bigger squeezes on a range of those tickers and it doesn't need to be 95% or anywhere close to it. Some have enjoyed a nice climb up WITHOUT high redemption rates, though those tend to have a more intriguing underlying business.\n\n[courtesy of @ TornikeLaghidze on twitter](https://preview.redd.it/oo6rwetknyp71.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=d99bf03dd0b3b03786d9c36f23127f91fc535374)\n\n* There are still plenty of shareholders (i.e. a majority) that DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT SQUEEZES:\n\n1. The arbs, i.e. people playing the arbitrage opportunity of getting a few % gains **entirely risk free** by (a.) buying into the SPAC, (b.) submitting for redemption, getting back their initial $10+interest that was held in a trust, (c.) then, intentionally voting yes for the merge after the DA so the deal doesn't fall apart, (d.) bank that interest and the difference between NAV and the fixed $10/share that's returned to them.\n2. Funds and investors with zero risk appetite - they're not convinced about the investment opportunity or w/e, and have absolutely no interest in the roller-coaster that comes after, i.e. the \"will she or won't she\" make me money excitement.\n3. Investors that don't like the current market environment - there's this little hiccup going on in China called Evergrande, not to mention indecies at ATH's and a lot of talk about \"bubbles\" (not the good kind on the playground).\n4. Everyone that's soured on SPACs in general - these continue to be complex, opaque, and sometimes-boarding-on-seemingly-fraudulent deals that have circumvented the traditional IPO process and, at least thus far, have avoided significant regulatory oversight. Oh wait, [maybe the gig's 'bout up there too](https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/22/business/elizabeth-warren-spac-letter/index.html)...\n\n[look into the cold, lifeless eyes of a true SPAC killer...](https://preview.redd.it/5tdzdh8nnyp71.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dffb0aae50c70b5561db0501784a5bf52af5a10)\n\n# 06. So what could go wrong?\n\nWell, again, since redemptions are largely all that matters at this point, super low redemptions would kill the play. Why would we see low redemptions?\n\n* **Quite simply, I've misjudged the sentiment for, and prospects of, MoneyLion.** That's why you need to do your own research and make your decisions for yourself. Some things to consider:\n\n1. They did post surprisingly good numbers in their most recent quarterly earnings and revised forecasts upwards.\n2. Maybe people are actually excited about the BNPL/\\*\\*\"\\*\\*internet coin\"/etc. offerings, and they weren't just empty promises to boost valuation and solidify the \"fintech\" premium.\n\n[ pretty fucking aggressive growth targets to justify that valuation if you ask me. ](https://preview.redd.it/79td19apnyp71.png?width=1469&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d1903f2473f0d4080a483967b77b2c359ecf838)\n\n* **Lower redemption numbers as the market learns the play -** though that would actually have the OPPOSITE effect and is more dangerous for the original SPAC investors. For them, it would now be a guessing game of \"if too many other people take advantage, redemptions numbers will be too low, the squeeze won't happen, and I'll be holding the bags\". Smart money certainly isn't interested in this level of risk.\n* **Faster filings that release more shares and kill the squeeze -** again, investors including insiders, sponsors, etc. are learning and eventually, they'll get even more efficient at filing their share-unlocks (S-1's), although those still need to be reviewed and approved by the SEC before anything happens. Just keep an eye out for filing related to share or PIPE unlocks. Fortunately, there's some [helpful discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/pu68ka/trying_to_find_if_the_pipe_has_a_lockup_period/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) suggesting there aren't any surprises for the float that are atypical in these deSPACs for this one (unlike some others where un-locks, etc. meant float estimations were eventually wildly off... ahem, TMC).\n\n# 07. So when will we actually KNOW the all-important redemption numbers???\n\nThat's a bit interesting in and of itself... most of the time, those figures are released **very shortly** after the merger, like a day or two.\n\nGiven its 'material disclosure', they have 4 days to post the filing which means **the deadline is either Monday or Tuesday**, depending on how you count the days (the deal closed last Wednesday).\n\nThere are [some theories](https://twitter.com/mcspacface/status/1441175527096602631?s=20) floating around about the lack of timeliness and redemption rates, but it seems pointless to speculate further rather than just wait for the filing.\n\n# 08. Finally, so how are YOU playing this [u/space\\_cadet](https://www.reddit.com/u/space_cadet/)???\n\nWell, my positions are below. To be honest, I'm caught off guard by the traction this has already gotten (not because of me) on some subs. I think it's the memorable name and people finally understanding this deSPAC thing that gave it momentum long before the technical set-up has fully materialized.\n\nFor that reason, I'm going to play it very carefully. Like I said in the beginning, I like the idea of a sound technical set-up. In this case, IV expansion has already made me some money and so I'm already at option #2 out of 3 on those IRNT outcome examples I gave. I don't NEED to see #3 happen to walk away happy, and there's a good chance it never does.\n\n**Now, that DOESN'T mean I'm only in the play if redemptions are something stupid like 94%. In fact, that's basically not going to happen. This isn't an unproven deep-sea roomba prototype (lol), its a real company with real revenue. But in my opinion, given the OI on the options chain, there's a good chance that anything over 60% has some actual gas to it.**\n\nI'm also under no false pretenses the music will go on forever. There's a good chance that one of these deSPACs will be catastrophic as the market learns the squeeze cycle and reacts. IMO, it will be slower, softer landing while these plays peter out over time. I'm hoping I'll see that combing but, who knows, maybe they've been delaying so they can absolutely *soak* all the degenerate gamblers like me and run off with the proceeds.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I'm definitely not a financial advisor, and this is a real degenerate gamble until we see redemption numbers hopefully tomorrow, so do your own DD. I'm also basically saying to wait, but I know you probably fucking won't...\n\n[ options transactions for Friday. ffs, maybe I'm too late in saying \\\\\"consider waiting\\\\\"...🤦‍♂️ ](https://preview.redd.it/qhtb20irnyp71.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=6725450235c3b18020e9f09713bb7703678ede31)\n\n**Positions:**\n\n* Calls at 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 strike for 10/15\n* Calls at 15 strike for 11/19\n* Shares", "id": "pw8fpj", "created_utc": 1632711978.0, "score": 781, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 270, "comments": [{"body": "How the duck can I buy this right now at 1am 🤦‍♀️", "score": 30, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buy now read later ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4735)", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "didn't know whales could read.

Heat stress has both direct and indirect effects on animals. Heat stress can increase illness susceptibility, lower fertility, and reduce milk supply over time.\n\nDrought could put pasture and feed supplies at risk. Drought limits the amount of good feed available to animals grazing. Droughts could last longer and be more intense in some locations as a result of rising summer temperatures and less precipitation.\n\nParasites and diseases that harm livestock may become more common as a result of climate change. Some parasites and pathogens may be able to thrive more easily due to the earlier onset of spring and warmer winters. Moisture-dependent infections may grow in locations where rainfall is higher.\n\nIn response to climate-induced changes in pests, parasites, and microorganisms, potential modifications in veterinary practices, such as an increase in the use of parasitical and other animal health treatments, are expected to be implemented.\n\nThis may raise the risk of pesticides entering the food chain or lead to pesticide resistance evolution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Technology Solution: Artificial Meat**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pht2uivkqup71.jpg?width=3168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9e5a2bd48b9a63dec200bf7f8a66ea5f43515c2\n\nInvesting in BYND is like investing in a technology company that at the moment is marketing meat products that utilizes its technology.

It's not a super simple question to answer, but I'll try my best. The term \"processing\" is a fancy way of saying that you're changing the food. Food processing is always present at some level, because even chewing is actually food processing. You're breaking down the food with your teeth and saliva, which is part of digestion. Cooking with heat is also food processing, and you do lose some nutrients from the food during the cooking process, but most of the time it's worth it to kill harmful bacteria. The more you process a food, the less healthy it is, to the point that it will actually cause negative health effects. The healthiest foods on the planet are the ones that require the least processing, like simple cooking. The fake meat we're talking about comes entirely from highly-processed foods that are basically unrecognizable from their sources. Seed oils in particular are only collected by tons of machining and solvents that force oils out of seeds that they would otherwise not provide. This process is grossly unnatural, and the result not quite poison, but close. It's more like motor oil than food. It has no nutrients, and it causes insane inflammation. We're basically allergic to the shit, and yet it's in everything because the allergic reactions aren't severe to notice. Refined sugar and grains are right there with it. The processing causes health detriments that are still not fully understood. This is why people in the US that believe they are gluten intolerant can travel to other countries and find that they bread doesn't bother them. The gluten isn't the problem, it's the processing.\n\nIf you want more info on this, there is a documentary on netflix called \"Cooked\" that covers the subject a lot better than i have.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’m not going to waste my time explaining complex laboratory techniques.

So what's going on? Well... Lucid is having a PR event at their AZ factory this week. Word in the swamps? They are getting ready to announcing the first set of deliveries for the Lucid Air and confirming delivery dates! It's been speculated for awhile that the first deliveries was going to be sometime between Q3-Q4. There has been uncertainty with the chip shortage... but with this news, short$ will shit themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-announces-production-preview-week-at-amp-1](https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-announces-production-preview-week-at-amp-1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR;**\n\n# LCID hitting production runs hard, will announce first deliveries schedule this week. Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCredits for this DD, and a shoutout, goes to [u/ddroukas](https://www.reddit.com/user/ddroukas/). I am going to snag his work and put it here for all you apes to adore, and believe the hype!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*<begin\\_plagiarism>*\n\nLucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\\*.\n\nIn 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.\n\nIn 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\\*, with early construction already having begun\\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to > 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\\*.\n\nLucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a \"two horse race.\"\\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as \"post-luxury,\" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\\*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yj8bmpuzyp71.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0a6f9f941f2dbfc78063d5256fccdab29a04b84\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n▶ **TIMELINE** (picture version):\n\n* 2007 – Atieva founded (info)\n* Nov 2014 – ATVUS model first shown (pre-Derek Jenkins) (article)\n* July 2015 – Edna Atieva powertrain test car (video)\n* Nov 2015 - Atieva officially renamed Lucid Motors (article)\n* Dec 2015 - ATVUS redesign to Lucid Air begins\n* Aug 2016 - DIA award Formula E battery to Atieva (article)\n* Nov 2016 - Alpha fleet revealed at LA motor show (video)\n* Apr 2017 - NY Auto Show - first public display of the Air (video)\n* July 2017 - 235 mile/hour speed run record (video)\n* Aug 2017 - Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance (video)\n* Dec 2017 - Design moves into Ardenwood; Engineering move to temporary offices\n* Sept 2018 - Series D investment (PIF major funding) (article, press release)\n* Oct 2018 - Lucid announce agreement with Electrify America providing access to ultra-fast charging network (article)\n* Feb 2019 - Move to Gateway BLVD HQ in Newark, CA (video)\n* Apr 2019 - Peter Rawlinson (CTO) promoted to CEO (press release)\n* Dec 2019 - Breaking ground on Arizona AMP-1 factory (article)\n* Dec 2019 - Beta 2 fleet begin testing (video)\n* Feb 2020 - Lucid forges long-term cell partnership with LG Chem (article, press release)\n* Sept 2020 - Lucid Air makes fastest lap time at Laguna Seca (article)\n* Sept 2020 - 9/9 Event, official launch of Lucid Air\n* Oct 2020 - First studio opes in Beverly Hills, CA (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Awarded Formula E Gen3 Lucid front powertrain (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Bloomberg publishes C\\*\\*\\* rumor (article)\n* Jan 2021 - Michael Klein fireside chat with IPO Edge - SPAC rumors begin (video)\n* Feb 2021 - C\\*\\*\\*-Lucid Definitive Agreement.

Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***\n\nLucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o1stpusvzyp71.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb7eff1951a48874c28474791856d75dea6120ba\n\n***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (\"dumb range\"). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\\*:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izejluexzyp71.png?width=2155&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba9252ec9a4efe2cb550b385fa9c38099419f025\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhio20z00zp71.png?width=2191&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5baa49a33a130763584fdb952fc85abc95bf32\n\nHigher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\\*.\n\nFor battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.\n\nIt should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.\n\nSome have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.\n\n***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\\*. It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).\n\n***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their \"Full Self-Driving\" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**\n\n**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usm8geczzyp71.png?width=2452&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fffdc7aaae1f913ab3a9400a1133ad1212c0644\n\n\\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\\*\n\n**Gravity SUV**: \"Project Gravity\" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\\*. Prototypes have already been built\\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8imlj130zp71.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=210716737bce8e989efa725e986cdb45e242ac1c\n\nProject Gravity SUV\n\n**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n▶ **CHARGING:**\n\nCharging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \\~20kW and DC charging up to \\~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\\*.\n\nTesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.\n\nModern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**▶ PEOPLE:**\n\nLucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.\n\n**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\\*.\n\n**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.\n\n**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.\n\n**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blka49d40zp71.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8f1fb4ca97e2736af6a8c83c96c984716f1c3e2\n\nBesides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\\*.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**\n\n**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.\n\n**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.\n\n**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of >500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.\n\n**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:\n\n* 2021 - 577 vehicles\n* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles\n* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles\n* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles\n* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles\n* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles\n\n*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\\*\\*\\*\\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\\*\n\n**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\\*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m7ubjif50zp71.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=39d87075d7ed1e05626f32fdcb85bd59550a1c4e\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**\n\nPeter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/buq3dei60zp71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3a2698ee2c34a0a37850630aa50d9bf43d0beb3\n\nAs a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.\n\nLucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**\n\n**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:\n\n*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\\*18.33\\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.81\\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\\*0.51\\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\\*12.7\\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\\*0.37\\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\\*N/A \\*(see below)\\*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\\*N/A\n\nThis is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).\n\nFor comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.\n\nWith this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is.
