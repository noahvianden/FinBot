{"title": "How tax affects your trade (wash sale, deduction, gain, loss)", "selftext": "Hey retards, \n\nso ending normal funnies and jokes- here‚Äôs something that you all will need to understand and hopefully help you on your tax understanding. \n\nNow it won‚Äôt be much fun to read it but knowing it may be helpful to you at some point.\n\n1) what is wash sale rule? \n\n>A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar.\n\nNow the actual way to understanding this is kind of complex and even out of the scope of this post. You can be held at a tax higher than your gain (some retard got a 800k tax bill in a 40k gain because of wash sale rule since he was trading same stocks 10+ times a day). \n\nBut do know that this rule, is made to stop shady things. It usually won‚Äôt effect you because brokerages are smart enough to realize it and do mathematical calculation to your second buy to fix the wash sale rule instantly. But there can be mistakes. \n\nNOTE: you should only be paying taxes on your actual gain and deducting from your all losses (total after net year). If anything is wrong, see tax accountant instantly. \n\n2)  tax-loss harvesting\n\nThis is like algebra math where you try to add and subtract to get the best number. Say you have 2 positions, one in AMD and one in GME. You realized a gain (so you closed your position) on AMD but still have your GME options chugging along. Your GME options don‚Äôt expire until next year but they are in loss. It‚Äôs December- so you say ‚Äúwait, rather than pay full tax on my gains from AMD, why don‚Äôt I close my GME positions for a loss and now I can subtract that loss from my AMD gain and pay less tax‚Äù. \n\nThis also hopefully makes it clear why the wash sale rule is there. Because someone could be this at dec 31, and buy the same position at same rate in jan 1, and theoretically from tax point, essentially mitigated all loss on that GME position. \n\n3) deduction of capital loss\n\nYou say you have -20k realized loss in 2020. You can deduct 3000$ from your earned income every year until that 20k is used up. This means you lost 20k in stocks but made 60k in your job- you can automatically deduct 3000 from your income so now you effectively have a 57,000$ income for tax. \n\nNow some people are confused but this is only for EARNED INCOME. The 3000 deduction limit is so it‚Äôs not abused. But say you have 2021 capital gain from GME of 15k. \n\nHere if you still had -20k loss of 2020, you can deduct the full 15k gain from 2021 so that -20k loss now is at 5k loss and use the remaining 3000 from 5k to deduct the earned income (from job) of 2021. For a total net loss of -2k still left for next year. \n\n4) positions that you hold for less than 1 year will be taxed at higher % than positions held more than year. \n\nThere are more Things like Tax-optimized Portfolio and many other tax implication that are too far out of reach for a single post but be aware of all these things. \n\nSPY 460c 9/10- free money", "id": "pi2nom", "created_utc": 1630800533.0, "score": 250, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|148|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your tax system is overcomplicated imo.\n\nHappy to live in Switzerland. \n\nNo capital gains tax for private investors (unless you are declared a professional investor ofc).\n\nDividends are taxed, but it's just added to the normal taxable income.
