{"title": "Ultimate Options Selling Guide PT 2 - Detailed Trade Example (ARKK)", "selftext": "# This is how I priced the options on ARKK following the methodology from yesterday's post \"Ultimate Options Selling Guide\".\n\nTo see the original post,  [CLICK HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/pxe1wj/the_ultimate_guide_to_selling_options/).\n\nSince the last post got so much love, I wanted to make a follow up post where I break down a trade idea that capitalizes on the spread between the implied volatility and realized volatility for a given stock. \n\n# A quick recap.\n\nOptions are priced based on the markets view of how much a stock will move in the future. They try to estimate the *volatility* of the stock (implied volatility). The realized volatility is how much the stock *actually ends up moving*. \n\n**SO! If we can find stocks that have a** ***higher implied volatility than what it should be/ what the stock will actually move*****.. we can find REAL juicy premiums!**\n\nIn this post, I am going to show a couple of trade ideas to get you thinking about the value of options and how to identify better trades. I will do my best to break it down in an easy to understand way, but in the end of the day, you need to understand volatility and trading. \n\n2 book recommendations to get you up to speed with fundamentals:\n\n* Laws of Trading by Agustin Lebron \n* Option Trading by Euan Sinclair\n\n# An important clarification before we move forward:\n\nWhen I say \"mispriced\" options, we need to be clear. \n\n**The price you see when you look at the option chain is the market fair value price. It's only \"mispriced\" if you think it should be priced differently.**\n\nAs such, the term mispriced is a bit subjective, but what I will be showing here is the basics of how i go about *creating my view on fair value* to compare against the markets. \n\nNOTE: *This guide assumes that we are looking for expensive options to sell.*\n\n# I follow 3 general steps when finding and evaluating trades.\n\n**Step 1** is to find stocks with options that look over priced.\n\n**Step 2** is to understand why it is not fairly priced/ mispriced.\n\n**Step 3** is to structure a trade that expresses my view on the mispricing.\n\n# 1) The first step is to create a list of stocks to look at.\n\nThere are thousands of stocks that have options traded on them, and there's tons of opportunity to be found. I think a big mistake people make is trying to \"follow\" a small basket of stocks. Finding actual good trades is difficult, and arbitrarily picking a couple stocks because you like them or some other reason is not something I would recommend. \n\nRather, I would do one of the follow things.\n\n1. **Use a volatility scanner**. This is basically a must have. The simple reason why is they allow us to look at the entire market and apply criteria to it to \"filter\" for the stocks that meet our specific requirements. Looking for liquid stocks with and IV 1.2x our forecast of volatility , with steep call skew, and seeing what comes out the other side is much more efficient than using our eyes alone. Scanner recommendations: Predicting Alpha, Market Chameleon.\n2. **Look for stocks with major news events**. News drives volatility, and attracts a lot of people to an event. If a company released some big news, it can cause uncertainty about the future and drive up implied volatility. This can signal to us to dig deeper and really try to determine if theres an inefficiency\n3. **Look for stocks that are popular with retail investors**. This one might sting a bit to hear, but on average retail make bad decisions. They tend to be long options, focused on the leverage and the directional bias. They tend not to be price sensitive to the options. This makes room for savvy investors to come in and value the options and sell overpriced ones to unsuspecting retail. hence the *\"TSLA went up but my calls lost money?!\"* type of posts.\n\nFor the purposes of this post, I used a volatility scanner to look for liquid stocks that have expensive volatility. \n\n# My scan turned up 40 stocks to look at.\n\nI then sorted the list of stocks by expensive volatility, and began to work my way through the list. At the end of my search there were a few stocks to look at. I decided on ARKK for this analysis:\n\n*Note: There were more stocks worth looking at, but I want to keep this post a reasonable length.*\n\n# 2) The second step is to dive into the stock and understand why it appears mispriced\n\nThere are two ways to price the vol here. \n\n1. **Absolute valuation**: How is the volatility for the stock priced today vs historical and realized metrics for the stock?\n2. **Relative valuation**: How is the volatility for the stock priced today relative to other stocks?\n\nOn top of that, I'll take a look at the news and sentiment to try and add a qualitative component to my analysis. **Key questions I am to answer here are**: 1) Who is buying vol here? 2) why are the buying vol? 3) Is there a good reason why the vol would be overly inflated (example: lots of fear). \n\n# Some absolute measures I use:\n\nI will go over 2 ways that I think about absolute valuation. \n\n**First**! Is the implied volatility higher than what the stock has been realizing?\n\nin the picture below, I am looking at the 30 day options implied volatility compared to the 30 day realized volatility. basically, how well has the market been forecasting the movement of ARKK?\n\nWhat we can see is that over the last 4 months, there has been a pretty significant gap between IV and RV. What this signals to me that there has been a persistent premium for sellers. It's a good sign for selling. \n\n[IV around 40&#37;, RV around 26&#37;.. ](https://preview.redd.it/k9t7ilrl9hq71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4c96718deb478c2ca70e94591aff7bf6f8b992a)\n\n**Second**! I like to look at the ratio between IV and RV over time. \n\nTo clarify, in the above picture we are just looking at iv and rv over last 4 months and how big the gap between them is.\n\n*Now we are going to look at how they move together.*\n\n# Think of IV and RV as being in a dance together. They take turns leading the dance, but they try to stay in step with each other. \n\nSo looking at how they move together, we usually see it **mean reverts** around a comfortable spread between the two. If one strays too far from the other, they move closer together. If they move too close together, they push further apart. \n\nHere is the IV / RV ratio for ARKK over the last year. \n\n[Red lines are max and min. Blue line is a rough average. To create the line, we divide the daily IV30 by the RV30.](https://preview.redd.it/iink1ebtahq71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=063f1e04ad19dd34663d4e612ccc4cc60add2ea2)\n\nAs we can see, the IV/RV spread is towards the top of the range. meaning they are far apart right now. So we can expect either RV to pick up, or IV to come down, or them to meet in the middle (there's other combinations of possibilities, but let's keep it simple). \n\nIf we look back at the first graph, we see a small uptick in RV and a big drop in IV in the last day. So.. I could conclude that perhaps it will meet somewhere in the middle (below the current IV line!). \n\nThis would conclude my basic absolute valuation. From the looks of it, options are expensive, but what I want to know now is.. *Is what I'm seeing a market wide phenomena or is it specific to ARKK?*\n\nIf it's market wide, I probably don't have an edge here. But if I don't see the same thing in something correlated with ARKK, its a cool confirmation that ARKK options are expensive!\n\n# My basic relative valuation\n\nThe first thing I need to do is find a correlated asset. I have chosen to go with ARKW since they have a decent amount of overlap in their holdings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[a comparison of ARKK and ARKF holdings](https://preview.redd.it/sy4rf8i0dhq71.png?width=2354&format=png&auto=webp&s=55c632211ed1f28ea5668ceb4e553b5a9ab3a189)\n\nThey should be trading pretty similarly. So what I did next is I plotted the IVs **for both of them at the same time.** \n\nLet's see what we get. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Green line: IV30 timeseries for ARKK. Blue line: IV30 timeseries for ARKW](https://preview.redd.it/gwduj0hwehq71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebac6a2b1cf256f8ba4bfbd02bf158bf52bcc2c3)\n\n**As we can see, ARKK and ARKW typically move pretty close together. We see ARKK trade at slightly higher vols usually. Right now, it is trading at a 3.5% higher 30 day vol.** \n\nWhile it's not the strongest confirmation, it is in line with my thesis. \n\n# Something to note..\n\nIn the last couple of days we have seen ARKK trend down with decent realized volatility. If this were to continue, the trade would be a loser, so it's potentially worth waiting for things to calm down a bit. \n\nOn top of that, doing all this analysis does not guarantee a profit. In the end of the day, markets are pretty efficient. There will still be lots of losers, but all we need in the end is a small edge that plays out over time. \n\n# My View:\n\nSo based on my analysis, I conclude that IV is likely to either come down or continue to overstate RV. because of this, I want to be selling options with no directional view. Since my analysis has been on a 30 day timeframe, I will aim to pick a 30 dte position. \n\n# STEP 3: Structure a trade that expresses my view. \n\nSince my entire view is on the IV/RV spread, with no view on the direction the stock will go., I want to structure a trade that is short vega, long theta, short gamma,  delta neutral. \n\nHere's the trade!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short the Oct 29 $111 strike straddle for $9.55](https://preview.redd.it/q4sxih9ehhq71.png?width=2834&format=png&auto=webp&s=506ed73ba1edbc9f5cdf40b5a68ad2f3141a98c9)\n\nIf you look at the price slices, middle row, you can see that I am basically delta neutal, short gamma, long theta, short vega. perfect!\n\nI will keep this trade on as long as the IV/RV gap exists, and I will delta hedge. I will take this off shortly before expiration. \n\nI will close for a loss if the RV picks up and this thing trends hard in one direction. \n\n# In Conclusion\n\nI hope this gives you some insight into how to think about pricing volatility and finding better trades. Trade evaluation can go much deeper than this, but if you can get to the point where you are thinking this way about trading you will be well on your way to crushing it. This is not the only way to be successful, but it is something that has worked for me and the *underlying methodology* is that of the professional trading space. \n\nIf you disagree with this methodology please comment your view in the description I would love to hear what you think. I don't know everything (not even close), so I would love to hear your thoughts. \n\nIf this post is also well received by the community, I have some ideas for future ones.

No employees required. That will drive down operating cost and increase efficiency, again deflationary.  \n\nEven when food delivery service becomes standard and all the kinks worked out, now enter autonomous cars—no employee overhead—lower cost, and more importantly, millions of hours saved nationwide which increases productivity which is again deflationary.\n\nThese forces must counter the MMT run FED policies of today before the currency collapses and we lose world reserve currency status.\n\nEventually, autonomous shipping and delivery will take hold, and this will be huge.

Today, he sells his entire position to fund other projects, which is somewhat reasonable because he \"\\[doesn’t\\] have an infinite pool of capital. So when \\[he has\\] these ideas, the money has to come from somewhere\". He also says, he expects a 2-3x from here which can be almost bearish on this sub (I personally believe it will be much higher). However, he has proven he has the ability as active investor to potentially outperform TSLA stock performance, even if higher than 2-3x.\n\nHe did say his thesis changed by underestimating how big the EV market is. Which is probably not the biggest part of what many TSLA  investors are investing for (FSD).  That's a questionable statement for me.\n\nIn conclusion, it would be brash of any of us to question a billionaire of Chamath's stature and track record. But nobody hits 100% of their bets, so I'm sure most of us can respectfully disagree with him on this one. But again, if he thinks he can 10x+ his money elsewhere, then it's not an outrageous move nor does that have anything to do with him being bearish on TSLA.\n\nTLDR: Nothing has changed\n\nEdit: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRnvZ2oIlUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRnvZ2oIlUs)\n\nLooks like he does not like the direction that Tesla is going in terms of energy.

{"title": "Marqeta DD", "selftext": "Intro: Marqeta is a modern card issuing platform. They operate an open API platform that allows company's to develop custom physical and digital credit cards to solve unique problems. For example Door Dash uses it to only allow its couriers to use the card at the right restaurant at the right time to cut down on fraud.\n\nAnother use case is they recently created another platform that allows companies such as Coinbase to allow customers to spend digital currencies at any place that accepts VISA. (by instantly transferring digital currencies to fiat and vice versa).\n\nBusiness Model: Marqeta makes money on interchange. This means they take a small percentage (0.45%) on every transaction they process. In 2020 Marqeta processed roughly $60 Billion which accounts for less than 1% of the global payments markets.\n\nInstitutional View:\n\nPrice Target: (9 Analysts) Low $29, Median $35, Average $34, High $37\n\nIn Q2 many large hedge funds and large institutions bought large positions in it including Vitruvian Partners, Soros Fund Management, Goldman Sachs, Vanguard ...\n\n[Institutional Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/39g4nu6qkgq71.png?width=1385&format=png&auto=webp&s=21c96fd603acbbe9bd931eb7b6e2dc009a41af90)\n\nReasons for growth: Low market share of huge industry. Strong foothold in the BNPL market with clients such as Affirm (who has a recent partnership with Amazon), Afterpay and Klarna. They power credit cards for banks such as Square, Goldman Sach's Marcus and JP Morgan digital cards. As well they have partnered with Google to power there Google Pay virtual card. They also have inroads in the gig economy with partnerships with Door Dash, Instacart and Uber.

P/S ratio is also pretty high, compared to industry average. Looking at technicals, the stock just broke support today and is likely to keep dwindling.

If you're willing to enter now and hold for years, sure, go ahead. But there's probably a better entry point waiting around the corner.
