{"title": "AMC DD - 2.3.21 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Let’s all go to the movies, then the moon. Before we begin, this is not financial advice, if you want financial advice to lose money, turn on CNBC.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nWith no more bankruptcy worries, additional liquidity, a reopening trade with more vaccines coming through the funnel, and with additional hype surrounding the brand, revenues should increase in FY2021 and FY2022+, giving AMC potential to reach prior highs at the $35 area, w/o a short squeeze. With? $60+. Important to note: The expected liquidation value post liquidity injection this past week, would be HIGHER than the current market cap. Also Blackrock now has a 5%+ stake in AMC. Bet with the suits that the FED trusts.\n\n**Prelude**\n\nWhat a crazy time, where the internet fights against greedy hedge funds and boomers who don’t manage their risk and over-short various equities. Not a surprise, as the wise Gordon Gecko once stated, Greed is Good. Now it seems it’s legal. Because everyone is drinking the same Kool-Aid.\n\nWell, some of these funds got bailed out last Thursday in some of the largest VISIBLE market manipulation you can ever see, where individuals were only allowed to sell shares and many were FORCED to sell shares into a price well below the price equilibrium. What does that mean? To refresh the Econ 101 class lesson that the hedgies snorted coke through, when you cut Demand by say, 70%, yet force the supply to stay near the same or even increase, the price paid per, in this case, share, will be SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER than the fair market price. To Robinhood, TDA, and any other big firm that made a point to lower the fair market price of the various equities ranging from GME, AMC, BB, and others, I hope the SEC can get off their paid off asses and do their job for the American people. Also, to the Biden Administration that stands for the people, unity, and liberty, get off your lazy asses and do your goddamn job. We know many of the various representatives and organizations are corrupt, but at least catch the hand that’s still in the cookie jar.\n\nNow lets begin with AMC’s true value, and most importantly, what their future value is.\n\n**The Cons**:\n\nOne of the biggest issues that loomed over AMC’s head was bankruptcy. And it was a BIG fucking problem. So much so, the equity went from trading at $30+ to sub $5, especially hit by the pandemic and all it’s wonderful externalities. Back in April and May, two firms actually upgraded this stock with more positive outlooks, B. Riley FBR with a target of $4, and MKM Partners (sound familiar from 2.1.21?) with a target of $5 claiming that their risk of bankruptcy is lower and with the reopening of theatres possible from Covid presumably coming to more of a halt. Well today, the brilliant mind at MKM, Eric Handler, decided to downgrade the stock again with a price target of $1. Surprising, since they actually got a cash infusion recently by offering shares… Wait what? Oh yeah, wall street analysts are as much of a joke as their predictions of the future. No wonder they are so wrong all the time. Eric, I get you want to get your inner Kanye out but please take the medication before you put out a completely illogical downgrade compared to your firms last upgrade and PT. You do have a fiduciary responsibility, after all.\n\n**Financials**:\n\nRecently, AMC actually raised a ton of cash even before any offering of shares or anything of the like. To quote the President and CEO of AMC, Adam Aron, “Any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table.” Then the stock RAN from 3 to 25 in a short period of time, and AMC did what TSLA does best, they raised cash. In fact they extended their cash lines by a smidge over $1B USD. Heh, not bad to combat bankruptcy.\n\n*Lets look at YOY ER:*\n\n\nWe will get Full FY2020 results on 2.25, lets use the numbers we have already.\n\n\n\nAttribute\t|FY 2020\t|FY2019\t|FY2018\n---|---|----|----\nTotal Revenue\t|2,527.60\t|5,471.00\t|5,460.80\nGross Profit\t|1,654.30\t|3,493.20\t|3,479.70\nOperating Expense\t|5,617.30\t|5,335.00\t|5,195.80\nOperating Income\t|-3,089.70\t|136.00\t|265.00\nNet Income\t|-3,656.80\t|-149.10\t|110.10\n\nOperating Expenses aren’t pretty, but a bulk is from Q1 and since, Covid has been a slaughter.\nNow how to we recover from a very dreary year? Pretty simple: Have cash to stave off upcoming costs, start opening up your theatres so that you can get those rev. numbers up, and begin partnering with old and new media companies in ways that haven’t been as exposed in the past, creating new revenue streams. Now lets go through these.\n\n**News Events**\n\nAMC announced that they will be able to last months before raising additional cash this past week. They then proceeded to raise over a billion dollars.\n\nAMC announced that they will now be opening a majority of their theatres again. Movie releases will start to come back, per the industry.\n\nBlackrock, one of the largest investment banks on the planet, has a +5% stake within the company,\n\nJNJ and NVAX announced their Phase 3 vaccine results with decent efficacy. Reopening needs this as larger vaccine availability means a quicker reopening trade.\n\nA bolstering of hype surrounding the company by the common man, with hundreds of millions of eyes if not billions, increasing net exposure of this once beloved brand to the general public yet again. Think movies were coming back? Now they are going to be back, bigly.\n\nA short squeeze was set off recently as well, costing funds who were short AMC hundreds of millions to potentially over a billion dollars. This is one of the main driving forces brought to AMC, which we will cover below.\n\n**Needs to survive**:\n\nHave cash? Well recent funding and stock sales provides liquidity. AMC will survive FY2021. Check!\nStart opening theatres? Vaccine distribution is to expand exponentially, especially with the results of JNJ and NVAX covid vaccines adding onto PFE and MRNA’s. Biden admin ftw? Time for AMC to get some revs back. Check!\nNew rev streams? This is something that AMC will need to work on, and in my opinion, are underexposed to.\n\nIt is my belief that this is one thing stopping AMC from becoming a TITAN, with their reach and location across the country, there are many major and minor partnerships that can be started to generate revenue, especially in a post-covid world. NFLX on the big screen? Doable, even with potential discounts for NFLX customers. Disney+, same! Streaming will have its moment of fatigue and film will be a fad, but there are many many avenues to attack the entertainment senses of a theatre attendee. What if Epic Games utilized AMC to throw some of their concerts, having individuals log in to a server of that theatre or theatres to attend some crazy concerts with their parents and other kids/teens just like them? I would love for AMC to bring on new members into the board to enhance the theatre experience. Food for thought to CEO Aron.\n\n**Short Float**:\n\nNow this is something very important with the recent momentum in this stock. According to finviz, as of today, 2.1.21, the short float is at a whopping 43.82%. Issue with finviz that I am seeing, is that there are only 107 MM shares outstanding, looking like a pretty significant ~47 MM are short. I’m seeing that there are 339 MM shares outstanding, so if that number can align, the amount of shares short are triple at 120 MM, which wouldn’t surprise me given the lovely and reputable news stories we get from CNBC, Bloomberg, and whatever sorry piece of shit that thinks that reddit is targeting a short squeeze in a $1.5 Trillion dollar market in Silver, as well as other useless coins.\n\n**Longing the stock**\n\nWith the biggest concern to AMC, bankruptcy, behind them now, we can safely say it is worth it to look at the stock in a more elevated view. Let’s proceed.\n\nUpon our recent review on AMC, our projections for revs to increase to ~5.4 B from the meager numbers in 2020, with a now-healthier view on AMC’s financials and cash-on-hand due to recent strides to increase liquidity. With additional potential revenue streams of new partners who grew at WFH scenarios such as NFLX, DIS, ROKU, and others, we project that this company should be seeing more explosive growth in the next 3-5 years and have lower expectations of ~6B in revs per year, and a larger bull case of ~9-10 B in revs if expansions do occur and new revenue streams are fully actualized. Anything above is a gift.\n\nNow to actually long the equity: With RH opening up more shares allowed, other brokers allowing this equity to be traded and accepting more and more users with each day as they migrate from one of the worst brokerages around (RH), this should give more buying power into the recently popular AMC and GME trades. With such a high short rate and with many traders believing that the hype is done for, I expect additional firepower in the long trade as these traders will have to cover. Without the short %, my PT would be $20, but with, this could go quite far and squeeze anywhere between 40-60 if not beyond. It’s not really a trade as much as it is a math problem.\n\nLong AMC.🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nsomeone asked about positions: 3700 shares and will buy more soon, just focusing on managing this trade.

A $40 price target after all this dilution would be the equivalent of AMC trading at $120/share when the 5 year high is ~$36. Could a short squeeze get it there? I guess. Is a short squeeze likely? Seems to me like the older shorts can just vacuum up 100 million newly created shares and their problem largely goes away. And the new shorts can wait awhile for the dilution to catch up to the share price and for retail interest to fall back to earth. \n\nFor there to be a squeeze, there has to be massively more demand than there was for something like GME -- and quite frankly, I haven't seen mania like that since beanie babies. Combined with there being no outside catalyst that would lead to that kind of demand -- i.e. no Ryan Cohen type board member, no aws exec like hire, no business plan pivot, no immediate re-openings, etc.\n\nBack in the spring there were rumors of Amazon buying AMC and doing a movie subscription play with Amazon Prime. That seemed like it might cause a run, but at this point the company's too overvalued for something like that to happen. AMC's going to pull through now (yay) so it's back to fundamentals over speculation. \n\nWith GME there's at least room for speculation with their new hires -- some sort of stadia like play combined with an esports focus, for instance, would turn it into a growth stock pretty quickly, so fundamentals are important but not the entire story. \n\nI don't know what the story of AMC is outside of a return to normal. My personal play is more around theaters existing altogether -- it's a bet against the \"this time is different\" mindset. Movies will be back. Theaters will be back.

They only dropped 50% in \"Other Theater Revenue\" whatever the fuck that is.  Are private screenings \"Admissions\" or \"Other Revenue\"?  So total revenue is down 73% compared to the same 9-month period in 2019.  This would not be horrible if they were keeping their expenses in check.  But, whomp-whomp, they aren't.\n\nOperating expenses are, for the most part down as well, which makes sense, since they aren't fucking operating a business right now.  Film exhibition costs, food and beverage, and operating costs excluding A&D are all down, 76%, 67% and 47%, respectively.  I'm betting the operating costs are those necessary to keep a mothballed theater from turning into a shooting gallery: electricity, security patrols, whatever.  Fine.  Rent is basically flat with a 6% uptick.  Excellent.\n\nSo where the fuck is all their money going?\n\nThey wrote off 2 **billion** dollars in the first 3 quarters in \"Impairment of long-lived assets, definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill\".  ($2,047,800,000 to be exact.)\n\nAt this point I was ready to sharpen my pitchfork, but I kept reading the 10-Q and something from the college accounting class I almost failed came to mind...\n\nThis is a non-cash write-off.  They are reducing the value of the company, because the intrinsic value of the name \"AMC Theaters\" is worth less than it was a year ago (#Covid19).  If you're struggling with this think about the difference between a Rolex and a Timex.  They're both watches, but one is *a Rolex.* Companies routinely put a value on their name and reputation, and carry that as an asset. And what AMC is saying here is that \"our name is no longer as valuable of an asset as it used to be.\"\n\nSo **TLDR;** AMC's actual cash position is **a lot better** than a casual glance at the numbers would say.  If you take away the $2bn in non-cash expenses, their net loss was only 10% more than in 2019.\n\nCheck my math. **Disclosure:** LONG 4 shares (YOLO) AMC because I had $50 left over in my TDA account last week.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Going to the movies in droves 3 times a week would have an impact for sure.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nice DD.

It's because you were lucky to be in a market where you basically couldn't lose.  Anyone who got in after March this year and \"stuck to fundamentals\" got returns that would have made the most aggressive hedge funds from a decade ago envious.\n\nThe takeaway: stay humble.  I'm not smart.  You're not smart.  None of us is special, and we don't have special insight that literally millions of people around the globe right now don't also share.  If you think you have an inside track, you're deluding yourself (unless you actually do, in which case, it is probably illegal for you to be trading that anyhow.).  Be honest when evaluating your portfolio performance (don't leave stuff out because it \"didn't count\") and compare it to the big indexes.  And don't make judgements on your own brilliance based on anything less than ten years of working at it (and even then...).\n\nJust do the boring stuff.  Pay off your debts, limit your expenditures, and dollar-cost-average the rest into stuff that, if it does well, it means the rest of the market is doing well (e.g., various indexes).  If you want, keep 20% of your boring, mechanical investments to use in big bets.  Most will fail, but you might get lucky and a few will hit big.  If you're like the average person, the failures & wins will cancel out and you'll get returns similar to the rest of your portfolio; if you're lucky, you could wind up with a lot.\n\nBut not overnight. \n\nYou're young - not even out of school yet.  There's no rush to make millions; your portfolio for the next ten years is going to be stupidly boring.  But if you play your cards right, by the time you're in your 40s, it may be in the \"early retirement\" range.

[ https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta](https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta)\n* DTE: Days till expiration/expiry\n* Options positions with respect to price:\n   * ITM: In the money; strike is below stock value.  Signif\n   * ATM: At the money; strike is just at or above the stock value, often very highly traded.  Can be very effective with moderate - long term expiry.\n   * NTM: Near the money; strike is above the stock value, but fairly close.  Slightly unofficial term.\n   * OTM: Out of the money; price is at least a few strikes from the current stock price.  I would say 10-30% over stock price.\n   * Very OTM: Not a real definition, this is essentially a lottery ticket.  Cheap, but almost certain to expire worthless unless there is explosive movement.\n* Understand delta in general and how delta changes with ITM and OTM options.\n* Understand all the greeks at a high level, as you get better understand them well.  The greeks: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/)\n* IV, IV crush, and how IV affects pricing.

Θ Gang 4 life.\n* FOMO and how to avoid chasing a dangerous trend.  DO NOT CHASE FROM FOMO!\n* What intrinsic and extrinsic value are.  Know how they are affected by being exercised/assigned and how theta affects them.\n* Understand that some of WSB recommendations are straight up high-risk gambling and factor in the information accordingly.  Be careful with Meme stocks and the survivorship bias on YOLO plays.  However, I love the sub and think it’s hilarious.  It has a lot of valuable information / DD if you are comfortable with the “colorful” language.  It’s also great if you like rocket ship emojis.\n\n**Basics / Mechanics**\n\n* Understand the 4 \"main\" option types.  Buying or selling a call and buying or selling a put.  Spreads and more complex multi-legged option strategies are based off these in some way (see below)\n* You can sell calls with 100 shares of stock or if you own an underlying longer term option; see LEAPS and PMCCs later.  Selling calls naked is incredibly risky and often requires Level 4 (very advanced) permissions and usually a lot of capital.  I will literally never sell calls naked since I don't want to ruin my life and end up living in a dumpster eating saltine crackers.\n* Puts can be sold/written cash covered (cash secured), which means you have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares.  Your broker will put this money on hold until the trade is closed.  Puts can be sold \"naked\" using Margin and Level 3 (with most brokers).  Your broker will hold a percentage of cost of 100 shares (often 30-40%, 100% on meme stocks) allowing you to sell more puts.  This increases your available capital/power as well as increasing risk.\n\n**General Tips and Ideas:**\n\n* Don't EVER leave (short) spreads open on expiration day, close them.  (more details below)\n* Start off trading very small.  Slowly build up over weeks / months.  You need to get accustomed to a fifty dollar swing a day, then a few hundred, then a few thousand.  You need to ensure you don't get emotional (see below).  I started trading options with 5k, then 25k, 50k, and later over 100k.  I added my own funds over time and used my gains to build my account.  Don’t go all in immediately, that’s dangerous and unwise.\n* Especially as you build up the amount of money you have invested, keep it diversified among several stocks.\n   * Don't go all in on one thing, ever.  Be able to take a hit from one stock and not mortally wound your portfolio.\n   * A company may be doing great, then there's a major product issue out of nowhere.  If you are overexposed in one stock this can really hurt you.\n   * I had to roll options I sold that were about to expire completely worthless because FDX's CEO changed and the stock took a hard dip.\n* Don't trade emotionally.  If you realize you are emotionally trading for vengeance, you should probably exit the trade and cool off for several days with that stock.  Same if you get caught up in a wave of hysteria.\n* Have a plan for every trade, ideally with entries / exits that are specific values, ranges, or a set condition.  This helps remove emotions.  This is super important for strong movements and high volatility (see later).\n* Use an options profit calculator from your broker or an online one before entering a \"new\" trade, especially a complex multi legged trade:[ https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)/\n* “Rolling” an option:  \n Closing your existing option and opening a similar one at different strike and/or expiration.\n   * Rolling a call “Up” would be selling a call you own and buying a cheaper call at a higher strike.\n   * Rolling a put “Down and out” closes your original one and buying or selling one at a lower strike at a longer expiry.\n   * Better broker interfaces have a literal “Roll” button.  I know E-trade does.  You can manually do it by selecting relevant contract legs.\n* If you have a losing trade, re-evaluate it.  If your initial assumption is definitely incorrect, close it.  Don't stay in losing trades forever and lose the entire value of the option over stubbornness.  If you re-evaluate and you think your assumption was right, hold, potentially consider adding another cheaper option (or buy another call / put).  Rolling out sold options can help here.\n* Don't try to day trade, especially with options.  It's statistically unlikely to be profitable.  Day-trading with options introduces extra liquidity risks and is dangerous, especially with spreads.\n* Try not to over-trade, you'll likely mis-time the market over time.  When I get emotional I over trade, then lose additional money on wash sales.  If you scale your entries into positions it should help alleviate your desire to exit positions when they turn badly against you.  Whenever I buy calls I do it at larger increments after W almost made me loss my hair; luckily it eventually came back.\n* NEVER enter a position on a stock you have no idea about, especially when you read about it online or heard about it from some rando.\n* At market open options contracts are often volatile and inflated.  Buying during this time can be more expensive.  Options are usually cheaper mid-day, I read somewhere 2-3PM is cheapest.  I’ve had success around 12-1PM EST after prices settle.\n* Try wheeling on cheaper stocks once you get all fundamentals down.\n* When selling puts if you are very bullish consider \"doubling down\"; note this is higher risk.  Use the credit from your put sale to buy shares or a cheap call.  This can be roughly inversed with puts, except I wouldn't ever recommend shorting shares.\n* Learn from your mistakes.  You can’t go back in time and beating yourself up (to a point) is useless.  Make a physical &/or mental note of it so you don’t do it again.  If you don’t learn from it, then beat yourself up so you won’t do it again.\n* If you have friends that like to trade, I find it helpful to discuss strategies and planned plays.  I talk openly with my close friends about my current holdings and planned trades, it helps keep me accountable.  If I get a wide-eyed look, I might be doing something excessively risky or stupid.  I’ve over-leveraged myself in calls twice and I knew I shouldn’t have done it both times.  When I tell my friends what I did and I’m embarrassed, it exemplifies the face that I shouldn’t have done it in the first place.  You will also get ideas for new strategies or plays from them.  It’s good to stay versatile and use multiple strategies when appropriate.  \n Beware of group think/echo chambers. \n* I recommend NEVER telling someone what to buy/sell and when.  I’ll tell people MY plays or what I like and why, but I will not encourage them to emulate what I do.  Depending on the audience, I’ll tell them my exact positions along with my exit and entrance strategy.  With closer friends I’ll offer my thoughts on their trades (if asked).  If my friend is doing something really risky (one of my friends does some scary stuff) I may ask them if they want my advice, and provide it, especially if they overlooked a risk/event.  I will not encourage someone to execute/enter a trade since it has a high potential for hurt feelings or animosity all around.\n* Don’t fall in love with a stock.  \n Just because something made you money before and you have high confidence in it doesn’t mean it will keep performing.  I joke that FDX betrayed me when it started dipping and losing me money.  I was over-confident of its bounce-back and sold too many puts too quickly.  I’m in several losing trades because of it.  However, I will keep good stocks in my roster/tracking list or try different strategies or re-enter trades when they change their behavior.\n* As you start to both buy and sell options and get more experience in general, you'll start seeing the two sides to every trade.  You will likely start adjusting your strategies or trying new trades out because of this.  Things will likely click one day.  Most/all the greeks and options concepts will become almost second nature.  For me this was when I could build an Iron Condor from scratch, which was a watershed moment involving a good understanding of many strategies.\n* Understand Liquidity and volume.\n   * Trading in low volume, low open interest contracts results in wide bid/ask spreads and difficulty having your contracts filled.  Look at all the data for a contract, not just the strike and price.\n   * Monthly Expiration dates typically have better liquidity.\n   * Multi-legged trades (Common examples are 2-legged vertical spreads or 4-legged iron condors) have more difficulty being filled, especially on bad brokers like Robin Hood.  Having very liquid options for all legs is extremely helpful in obtaining timely and well-priced fills, which maximize your potential profits.\n* Time in market vs timing the market:\n   * It is extremely difficult to time the market perfectly.  If you wait for the perfect opportunity forever, history has proven you will miss out on gains.  Keeping all your money out of the market has proven to be ineffective.  Now if there is something serious happening with a stock/the market (like say a new pandemic), don’t go all in.  I recommend entering incrementally at dips.  If the stock has huge upside potential it may never go down, so it might make sense to partially enter at the current price.\n   * IMIO selling puts is a great strategy to get into a stock you like, or at least make money off it.  I think buying stock in lots of 100 is usually for suckers.  Selling an ATM or ITM put (assuming the math works out) on a stock you were going to buy and hold is ALMOST free money.\n   * I recommend keeping some cash available regardless. If you have a very large account or expect a downturn, hedging with indexes like QQQ, SPY, or VIX or calls/puts may be wise.\n* Every trade can't be a winner.  You will take some losses, you must get used to it.  I don’t like having a realized loss of 1K or more on any trade.  However, this will happen, especially with larger accounts.\n   * As long as you win more often and beat the S&P that year I consider it okay.  I’m kind of aggressive, so I consider 20%+ annually good.  30%+ annually is great.  40%+ and I’m dancing.  After trading options I am almost baffled by my old belief that 5% annual returns (mostly from dividend ETFs) was “good”.  That’s nothing to me now since I’m willing to take risks.  \nNote: While lots of people danced in 2020, realize that’s an insane Bull Run year and is atypical. \n   * Adhere to your own risk tolerance and never over-extend yourself, especially with margin use.  Don’t make huge gambles leaving you uncomfortable.  Only gamble with money you are willing to lose.\n   * My personal strategy is to make safer gains for the year and then enter slightly riskier strategies using those gains.  I can be slightly-moderately more aggressive and compound my gains.  For me I often sell puts to make money, then when I see a big opportunity I’ll sell a put and buy an OTM or moderately ITM call.\n* Understand it’s not safe to try and get rich overnight.  However, once you hit big “steps” things may start to snowball.  You can enter more positions and take more risks if you choose to.\n   * For me this when I hit 50k, then 100k.  I was able to balance low and moderate risk positions to more significantly grow my account.  I’ll even do a high risk thing now and again because my gains can absorb it (assuming I have them).\n   * I can’t wait to get to 250K, then 500K.  I know it’ll take quite a long time, but I am confident I’ll eventually be able to have 500K and (hopefully) 1M in my non-401k trading account with gains and additions from my job.  I can only imagine how “dangerous” I will be with that kind of capital.\n* If you missed \"the next big thing\" like AAPL, TSLA, or the time machine I’m building in my basement.  Don't get upset, learn from it.  Adapt and become a better trader for next time.\n   * Figure out why a company was so promising, before they mooned.  Determine how you would have traded differently in hindsight.  Apply those lessons to the next company you believe has long term growth prospects.\n   * For me that's putting in 1-2.5k towards shares and/or buying LEAPS on it.  Depending on my bullishness I may buy “cheap”, fairly far OTM calls.  The far OTM options are sort of lottery tickets.  If I'm right the (relatively) low cost will have explosive profits; if I'm wrong, they didn't cost that much so it's a calculated loss I’m willing to accept.  For more serious bets I’ll buy ITM LEAPS to run PMCCs on.  I also like to buy 1-2K in my 401k for very long-term plays.\n* The stock market hates uncertainty, it seems to crave the status quo.  A shakeup can potential tank a stock, even if it's nothing.  With shares you can wait it out, but this can be problematic for options.  If you see volatile/uncertain times ahead (politics, disease, manufacturing, earnings, etc.), you might want to reduce your overall portfolio risks or hedge.\n\n**Profit Retention / Loss Mitigation**\n\n* If selling options, it is a viable strategy to close early after a large gain with many DTE left until expiry.  See TT videos / strategies on this.\n* Don't hold options through earnings unless you literally want to gamble.  I like playing on earnings run ups, but that can be risky.\n* If you hold options through earnings, IV crush will happen immediately afterwards, devaluing the option.  However, if the option is profitable enough, IV crush won’t matter, which will still make money for a call buyer.  A sold put sufficiently far OTM will benefit from IV crush, even if the stock dips after slightly bad or lukewarm earnings.\n* Don't throw good money after bad.  Don't gamble on a recovery if your assumption appears to be wrong or the market is flat out tanking.  If you are wrong and still believe in the company, wait twice as long as your original plan (wait for your 2nd entry point vs 1st) before adding to your position.\n* Consider using stop losses to lock-in profits on rides up or sometimes use them to prevent losses.  Note, stops can be easily triggered in volatile options.  Now when I'm up a lot on calls (especially around earnings or large momentum run-ups) I always set stop losses.  I have been burned too many times.  \n In December 2020 I didn't set a SL on several thousand dollars of FDX calls I was already up on and I \"lost\" \\~$5K of unrealized gains.   If you're up big, don't get too greedy.\n* A possible strategy if a stock is on a tear and you have multiple options open:  \nClose some positions (I prefer to do this incrementally if the stock has momentum), but leave 1+ open in case the stock goes into outer space/the floor.  Next, set a stop loss with a little buffer below its current movement / range so it doesn't get hit unless the stock falls hard.  Finally, watch the stock closely and if it keeps rising, keep moving the stop loss up in little bits incrementally.  This will let you keep more profits on a hot streak, but give some protection and secure more gains.  It will also help eliminate FOMO if a stock exceeds your expectations.\n* Have rules when to roll out, down & out, or up & out.  I like TT’s roll at break even or at 1x loss and to always roll for a credit (or for me a very minor cost).  Obviously these rules need some monitoring.  Know your stocks, the news, and technicals so you don’t jump the gun.  \n   * If you roll early for a credit and you’re right, it’s not the end of the world.  You’ll just need to hold longer, which will obviously tie up capital.  Sometimes it’s better to tie up some money (especially if you aren’t paying interest) than eating a huge loss.\n   * Rolling too late can be worse though.  I currently have a very underwater FDX put I sold that is over 2x loss, rolling it does almost nothing unless you want to pay a debit or extend it extremely far out.\n* On huge options gains, **I strongly you recommend taking profits by rolling up/down** or incrementally sell your contracts at several different prices (this is why having multiple contracts is nice).\n   * Rolling up involves selling your initial call, then using a fraction of your proceeds to buy a cheaper, further OTM call with the same expiry; puts are inverse this.  When rolling up I like to ensure the new option’s cost is 15-40% of my realized gains.  I’ll buy a more or less expensive new optoin based on my convication to the stock and predicted movements.  You can also roll up and out to get a further expiry and strike.\n   * This is monumentally important if you are playing with incredibly high rising stocks or during a short squeeze.\n   * Sad story time:  \nI completely screwed up when I forgot to roll up, twice, during the GME gamma/short squeeze.  I didn’t take my own advice; I didn’t have a real exit or transition plan and I got emotional.  It all happened so fast and I was at work; the insanity of the run up and subsequent gamma squeeze caught me off guard.  I should’ve clocked out and thought through the situation for 15-30 minutes to form an impromptu plan, then executed trade(s).  My moderate risk tolerance coupled with my desire to take profits took over.  When the stock partially cratered after a run up, I sold to retain gains.  In the heat of the moment I thought the squeeze was squoze and it was going to plummet into the ground and I wasn’t being rational.\n      * On 1x 4K call I would’ve made an additional 15-25K if I rolled up to a cheaper contract with some of my profits.\n      * I know I missed out on significantly more with a 2nd call I had.  Depending when I rolled it, it would likely have been an additional 25-50k in profits.\n   * I talked about learning from your mistakes above.  **This mistake is branded into my brain due to the massive gains I missed out on** **by not rolling up****.**  I’m furious with myself as I write this 1 week after the GME gamma squeeze, I’m a planner and I didn’t plan.  If anything I own is significantly up ever again, I’m rolling up (or at least setting a stop loss).  If necessary, I’ll roll up a trade multiple times to keep extracting profits.\n   * Learn from my mistake so you don’t miss out on gains too.  I strongly recommend rolling up when you are up big on a call / roll down when you are up big on a put.  This enables you to take profits, stay in the game, and keep extracting more gains.\n* If you trade a lot of options, talk to your broker about a discount.  I was getting the standard $.50/contract with E-Trade, but I traded over 300 contracts a quarter and was able to get the fee reduced by over $.10 by just asking.  I am now doing more spreads and condors, so once my volume gets very high, I’ll ask again.\n* If you have a broker that isn’t great and you want to switch, leverage your current trading fees to the new broker.  Tell them you’ll move over $### thousand if they beat your current options trading fee per contract.\n\n**Trade Planning & Position Management Tips**\n\n* As you gain experience, start monitoring what kind of Delta, OTM, DTE, etc. you are most profitable with.  Use it in your future trades.  You'll often see the tasty trade 30-45DTE .3 Delta strategy for selling.\n* Before entering a trade, look at rough technicals like resistances and supports to consider your relevant strikes as well as entry/exit points.  Look at upcoming earnings & dividend dates as well as stock/market news.\n* Consider staggering strikes and expirations for safety and diversity; it’s nice to avoid assignment on 3 puts at once because you used the same strike for all 3.\n* Incrementally enter positions on large rises/falls.  One of my favor strategies is to buy dips after over reactions.  By doing this slowly in large price \"steps\" it helps combat FOMO and helps you avoid getting slaughtered.\n   * This will also help you avoid \"chasing a falling knife\".  It also ties into having a plan.\n   * I set alerts at several predetermined prices and I REALLY try not to enter new trades unless I hit my preset points.  It makes me less emotional and usually more effective.\n* Don't buy far expiration options with poor liquidity for shorter term plays.  I bought 1x GME 1-year+ LEAPS call before the 2021 short squeeze.  That was stupid, I should've bought 2-3x 60-120 day calls to have better liquidity.  I also paper-handed it and missed out on my lambo.\n* If selling options, consider rolling (for a credit) to avoid assignment when it makes sense / meets your plan.  Rolling closer to expiration can be a valid strategy to get theta on your side.  On the flip side, if the stock moons or plummets it could've been better to roll before it got crazy deep ITM.  See rolling “rules” above.\n* Covered Calls:\n   * If a stock has a large movement range, I think it can be worthwhile to wait to open a CC after the last one is closed/expires.  I have been more successful waiting for another opportunity vs. opening one immediately on the Monday after the second the last one expires.\n   * Consider selling covered calls at all time highs/peaks.  If you sell a CC and the stock dips significantly, and you think it’s temporary, you can buy to close your CC for a quick profit, then reopen it later.\n   * If you own Meme stocks, selling covered calls runs the risk of missing out on large gains.  On these stocks I typically only sell them further OTM than I normally would or not at all.  If I do sell CC on a Meme stock I try to ensure I have 25-100 other shares that won’t be called away.\n\n**-Advanced Beginner-**\n\n**Spreads**\n\n* Spreads (with 2 legs) are neat because they manipulate how delta and theta act.  It caps your gains and losses, but you can profit with less stock movement.  Try several spreads on a P/L calculator to see for yourself.\n* Spreads usually require margin trading.\n* Spreads allow you to define max losses (assuming you close before expiration day) and use less capital.\n   * Experienced traders will open many spreads at identical/similar strikes to heavily profit off movement.  Spreads can make you/lose you a lot of money if you are right.\n   * For example.  I could make a $200 premium off a $500 risk trade, max loss would be $300.  This is much more effective capital utilization than a naked or cash secured put, however it does not have the same downside protection or “wheel” potential as a sold put.  Higher risk, higher reward.\n* Vertical Debit spreads:  I think of these like mini calls/puts.  I personally don’t use them unless calls are outrageously expensive or the break even is absurdly high, but there’s nothing wrong with them.  A call debit spread will lower your breakeven and overall cost vs just a call.  You can do clever things like making a positive theta call spread if you’re creative.  I like doing this since I hate losing money to theta.\n* Vertical Credit spreads: \n   * Very good theta strategy to define downside/upside risks.\n   * A put credit spread is bullish and allows you to bet on upward movement with less capital and defined losses.\n   * A call credit spread is a bearish strategy that allows you to bet on downward movement.  These are very cool since they allow you to sell calls without selling naked calls, which can ruin you financially.  I see selling these as better than buying puts since it’s so much easier to be profitable; to be redundant, Θ rocks.\n   * [https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/reducing-risk-with-credit-spread-options-strategy-0](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/reducing-risk-with-credit-spread-options-strategy-0)\n* **I repeat this on purpose: Don't EVER leave short spreads open on expiration day, close them.  If you don't close, they better be VERY far from the strike on a non-volatile stock.  In after hours a stock can jump/dip below your strike and be exercised without the other leg to protect you.  This can lead to massive, life ruining losses.  This is not an exaggeration, google this and be scared.  It happened to a fair number of people with TSLA.**  \nVideo explanation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVFj9nRRDo&t=315s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVFj9nRRDo&t=315s)\n* Short Straddle:  \n\n**Trading Mechanics, Taxes, Market Manipulation**\n\n* Learn about wash sale rules.

A lower cost or zero cost broker shines here.  However, “bad” free brokers will give you poor fills, which may not be worth the discount.\n* Condors and butterflies have \"wings\" which are your purchased puts and calls.  The wider the wing the higher the max profit/risk.  The condor body can be riskier and skinny with a narrow high profit range or wider for a much greater chance of success with lower payout.\n* An iron condor is built by combining a put credit spread and a call credit spread with the same expiry.\n* An iron condor can be thought of as a modified short strangle with limited risk, and therefore a bit less profit.  I prefer defined limited risk.\n* The butterfly is similar except instead of a plateau it has a sharp peak.  My personal mental note is that a condor looks more like a strangle with wings, while a butterfly looks like a straddle with wings.\n* Pay attention to earnings dates when you open these, I have forgotten to check before and it led to bad trades.\n* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/iron-condor.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/iron-condor.aspx)\n* [https://www.theoptionsguide.com/iron-butterfly.aspx](https://www.theoptionsguide.com/iron-butterfly.aspx)\n\n**Long Condor (Debit Call Condor)**\n\n* The debit version of an Iron Condor.

LEAP calls are great for long term growth plays (downtrends with LEAP puts) or simply when you really like a company and can't afford 100 shares.  LEAPs (or any \"longer term\" option) enables you to sell a PMCC or PMCP (below)\n\n**PMCC / PMCP**\n\n* PMCC or PMCP are poor man's covered call (or poor man's covered puts).  They are diagonal options often used with purchased LEAPs.  You sell a shorter DTE call/put with a further OTM strike than your purchased call/put.  For PMCC/PMCPs it is often recommended to recoup your extrinsic value as soon as possible, some recommend with your first call CC or put sale, to ensure you are positive if the option is assigned early.  These have a lot of moving parts and strategies.  If you buy a barely ITM call/put and sell a nearby strike call/put you run the risk of the purchased option getting \"blown by\" on large stock movement and ending up with a very negative losing trade.  Keeping your purchased LEAP deeper ITM should protect you.  Check your initial PMCC using an options calculation to make sure you don't screw up.\n* I'm currently tinkering with these myself.  So far I like .7-.9 delta call LEAPS with 30-45 DTE calls on my CC.  The goal is to hold the LEAP long term, potentially until expiration, and constantly sell calls/puts on it that expire worthless.  Typically the call/put is rolled up and out or down and out if it's going to be assigned, unless you don't want your LEAP anymore.\n* Some people look at these many sold CC or puts as profits, I look at them as lowering my cost basis until it's zero (or even negative).  I have a page in my notebook I write each CC on my NIO LEAP (I Meme stock sometimes).  I find it satisfying to slowly see the cost of the original option disappear.

This lets you link one action to another.  In programming think of it like an if-then.  You’ll tie a buy/sell to another buy/sell\n   * Setting trailing stops on options is very chaotic since their price movement can be drastic due to volatility.  I prefer to set my trailing stop to a stock. \n   * What I like to do is set a trailing stop on a stock (or just link it to a stock price drop) and have it sell 1 share I own.  Then it immediately executes a market order to sell my call.  I’ve had good luck doing this with incredibly volatile plays were stop losses aren’t effective.  I’ll often have an order saved and ready saved for when a strong run up starts.  When my price alerts start blowing up my phone, I’ll immediately hit execute to turn it on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nI’m not a financial adviser, I'm actually an engineer.

The app / site both work, but they are clumsy, “weak”, and outdated.  It’s been described as “boomer-friendly” by a Fidelity employee on Reddit.\n      * Ally Invest has bad tools, is generally trash, and is unreliable, don’t use it.\n      * RH is free, but has bad fills.  It is super unreliable and has had huge stock buying restrictions in stocks and quantities for multiple days.  I don’t trade in their app anymore, but I do like using their wish lists for quick chart glances at daily activity.\n   * I really like E-Trade (and you’re about to hear why).\n      * E-trade has Power E-Trade on both desktop and mobile.  These are fantastic tools for options trading.\n      * The mobile app destroys (most/all) other mobile apps in terms of organization, data available, and effectiveness.  I think it’s phenomenal.  I can throw together a 4-legged trade in seconds.  I can easily see all greeks, intrinsic/extrinsic value, volume, and every other trade parameter I need through their option chain screen by swiping left / right.\n      * *Note, I have not tried Schwab, just watched YouTube videos of their app.  From watching those, Power E trade looks better.*\n      * The desktop version also has a trade analyzer (extensive P/L calculator) and a strategy seeker.  The strategy tool gives you suggested trades based on your expected movement direction, expiry date, and amount invested.  Both are well done and powerful.\n      * These tools are so intuitive and powerful that I would have a hard time going to another broker, even if it’s slightly cheaper.  Even if E-Trade drops the ball again, I might keep my main account with them and set up my secondary / backup account with Schwab; that’s how much I like Power E-trade.\n      * **Noteworthy downsides.**  They restricted GME buying for \\~2 hours during market hours (\\~2-4PM) and all after hours on Thursday 1/28/21 when the GME craziness was happening.  This was the only restriction on buying I’m aware of.The following week there was a day where I couldn’t execute a trade for an hour at open.  This was during very high volume, but still no excuse.  These issues made me very angry with them.  These were the first big problems I’ve had in several months of active trading through them.\n      * They are usually very reliable, but they are not perfect.  I’m staying with them unless they have more major issues.\n      * Their options fees go from $.65 to .50 a contract once you trade enough, 30 trades / quarter I think.  They’ll give you further discounts if you trade a lot for months, then call to ask for an option fee reduction/negotiation.\n      * If you decide to open an E-trade account and put enough money in, there is a new account incentive.  It scales up depending on your contribution.  If you want to use my referral link, PM me for it.  I don't want to post it and get in trouble.\n   * Rock Solid Brokers:\n      * Fidelity: Mediocre-bad tools, very reliable.\n      * Vanguard: Expensive.  Reliable.\n      * Schwab: Ok prices.  Second hand, tools look okay-good.  Very good reputation and reliable.  If I ever decide to switch / diversify from E-trade, I’m trying them.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the reply!

For 2025 we'll have a fleet of around 15M (if they have no dedicated robotaxis), at 70% take rate that would be a $12.5B gross profit from just FSD subscriptions and this part would get more than a 75x multiple because the fleet basically grows by 50%+ per year.

{"title": "SOBER REVIEW TIME - what are the actual data we can use to assess GME as of today?", "selftext": "*Edit: There's a lot of great responses and info about my questions in the comments! Will try to incorporate that into the post as I go, or make a followup tomorrow!*  \n\n\n  \nFirst off, my position: 1900 shares of GME @ 30, plus 5 calls @ $250. Peak value was nearly 500k.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/96g5d07z45f61.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e983f8d1a6b56bcf4201d32a56b0c2535886d5b\n\n*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*\n\n\\*\\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\\*\\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.\n\nHere's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**\n\nThere is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.\n\nHow do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.\n\n**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**\n\n1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.\n2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.\n3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.\n4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.\n5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:\n   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.\n   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling\n   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver\n   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),\n   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**\n\n***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.\n\n**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**\n\n* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.\n* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?\n   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7e4mes1qf5f61.png?width=277&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfb3da83d0aaaeb2256e11bf7a3e3eaf8b31de90\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yo2s5e2cg5f61.png?width=1691&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83701a452b5aaa079e3a3948cecbbb3feb77b5a\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\\*\\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\\*\\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.\n* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?\n   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?\n   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)\n\n**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**\n\n* Claim: assuming \\~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.\n* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.\n\n|Date|Trade Volume|\n|:-|:-|\n|2/2 Tue|77.8m|\n|2/1 Mon|37.3m|\n|1/29 Fri|50.5m|\n|1/28 Thu|58.5m|\n|1/27 Wed|93.3m|\n\n**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**\n\n* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.\n* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit\n* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**\n\n* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.\n* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS\n* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2\n\n* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.\n* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.\n* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**\n\n* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.\n* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors.

If delta goes up, they need more shares to cover your bet, so they buy more shares to do so in case your option ends up in the money.  ITM options follow the underlying, and typically will have a delta of 1.00, so by hedging 100 shares they cover your ITM call option.\n\nGamma, yet another greek, is the 2nd derivative.  It measures the \"acceleration\" of delta.  So for every $1 increase, option price goes up by delta, and delta goes up by gamma.

As much as one media outlet did throw out the \"charity\" card, my understanding is that Melvin's \"clients\" are 2 international charities and 4-5 pension programs. It's not like the guy was shorting his own cash or had his own money on the line here.

My understanding is Melvin was coming off a banner 2020 with about 12.5b in AUM. This means as a hedge fund, their available leverage is about 125b. If they had just a 3b loss on $GME, that requires them to liquidate up to $40b worth of other positions to cover their loss. Reportedly, they were very underleveraged to start the year and likely only had ~$50b worth of positions, but still a $6b loss (which is about what's been reported they are down for the year), occurred across several equities, but let's say it was a $5b $GME loss and $1b on everything else they were squeezed on.

It's unlikely Melvin's position accounted for even 25% of the overall shorts on $GME. They had been the most successful long/short hedge fund on wall street for 4 years running. The number of copy cats following them into trades is IMMENSE and likely makes up positions significantly larger than their own single position. Others may have covered earlier as part of the run up from $4-30, or could have covered on other dips, etc.\n\nAgain, just my two cents, not financial advice etc.\n\nPositions: 1 $GME share @ ~$13, rest exited @ $35.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "No, what I was saying is if they covered their shorts, they wouldn’t have advertised.

But it doesn't have to be short sellers.  In fact, it's the whole fucking point of market makers.  They are \"making\" the market.

And, yes, they may end up talking to each other, but that volume generally relates to liquidity which is useful to all market participants.\n\nThe stock is not dropping b/c of \"short ladder\" attacks.  If there were buyers, they would buy up the other side, and the attack would be useless.  If there were buyers, the stock couldn't be driven down without matching short volume.\n\nThe blame for this situation lies squarely with DTC who protected the short sellers, period.  They didn't even need to be evil, they just had to be self-interested.  The short side was going to blow up, so they tipped the scales in the short's favor.  As a monopolistic entity, they had RH by the balls, and negotiated their required deposit down by $1B, along with an *agreement to limit the net volume of $GME buys* over some period of time, likely until the end of this week.\n\nWhy do I suspect this last part?  Because of the way RH is controlling $GME volume by tuning their limitations \"5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 20, 100\" with the latter increase coming as $GME decreased drastically in price (so that it corresponds to roughly the same amount of dollars).  Tues/Wed of last week saw epic buy-side $GME volume on RH, but after a substantial cash raise, RH should be in a position not to be dicked around anymore.  And yet the limitations are still present.\n\nDTC's calculations didn't make sense from the start, as RH's supposed deposit requirements jumped by 10x.  DTC claims they needed to ensure that RH deposits covered the net (buy volume - sell volume) over the T+2 settlement period with 99% probability.  Supposedly this required a 10x increase in RH's deposit.  That's not due only to volume, that's due to an increased volatility estimate (i.e., the estimated variance of the net buy volume was much larger).  In other words, the 99% safety margins needed to be much beefier.\n\nBut this is an insane way to measure the net buy volume volatility, as RH simply can't keep buying without their users depositing massive equity.  Most of that buying is going to come from selling other securities, meaning that the net buy volume in a given day was likely to decrease.  There is a negative feedback effect because two days after Tues/Wed, the deposits are cleared, and all that equity is then sitting in $GME, unable to be used to keep moving the daily net buy volume.\n\nDTC knows this.

Fundamentals matter very little when looking at certain stocks (like a lot of the companies in the EV space), and I think GameStop is one of them. It is irrelevant what multiples the name trades at currently, its all about the likelihood of the scenario playing out where a company dominates the market down the road. For GameStop its all about how likely they will be able to pivot to being a dominant player in the gaming ecommerce industry.\n\nJust a few months ago, GME was viewed as a failing retail store that ripped people off (remember the memes? how much will GameStop offer me for this 1 day old console and games? $20!). GameStop's brand had little to no value, HOWEVER after this whole fiasco, the GameStop is worshiped by an entire generation of retail traders. GameStop could start selling hotdogs next week, and I have no doubt people would line up to buy them. This is huge because this generation of retail traders is generally younger, probably mostly male aka the EXACT target market that must be captured to successfully transition to niche gaming ecommerce. This essentially guarantees GameStop gets a chance at bat, and exponentially increases the odds of the scenario that GameStop will become a dominant player in gaming ecommerce. \n\nI know I said fundamentals don't matter, but lets quickly talk valuation. At $60 a share that would put GME's mkt cap at roughly $4bn. How much will this company be worth if they pull it off? \n\nCurrently Chewy has a market cap of $42bn, but the gaming sector is already larger and growing much faster than the pet supplies industry. Assuming similar margins for both companies that are now dominant players in their respective sectors. I used assumptions for current market size and CAGR assumptions of what was the average of the top few studies on google, and found that in the year 2030 the gaming sector will be more than 4 times the size of the pet supplies industry.

Back then it was one institution vs the whole Wall st, where as today it is retail against Wall st. Institutions don't like it when other institutions don't pay up but they would collude together to help rip off the retail investors. Also, it is way easier for one institution that owns 74% of all VW float to diamond hand (plus they publicly announced it to create a frenzy) than trying to coordinate 8M degenerates to hold on GME (half probably paper hand anyway). \n\nBecause Porsche was trying to secretly take over VW alone, they were slowly buying up their shares, pushing up the price from 200 Eur to 400 Eur as a one-man show. No other fund agreed that VW was worth that much, especially with dwindling sales during a crisis/liquidity crunch in the market at that time, so they all decided to short it and it dipped by 50%. Jokes on the funds, Porsche came back out saying they were the majority owner of all the floats available, which left the funds who shorted it scrambling to cover their position, resulting in a short squeeze.\n\nLastly, VW was trading at 400 Eur before it spiked 2.5x to 1005 Eur. When GME went from $60 to $158, back down to $85 the next day then finally peaked at $468, that is almost 8x from the initial squeeze, way more than the 2.5x VW squeeze. And now they got RobbingHood and all the other brokerages manipulating it at full force, which was not a factor back in 2008.\n\nI am a retard, I don't know what I'm saying.

{"title": "Are you sure Melvin is still short GME? Because if they're not then you're all just playing with yourselves.", "selftext": "Hi, former hedge fund trader here. First thing: In my 8 years trading for Wall street firms I never heard of anyone pulling this naked short selling shit like what happened with GME. In fact the only time I ever found myself naked short (accidentally) it was a huge problem, was almost fired, massive apologies to the prime broker, exchange, regulators etc. I certainly didn't make that mistake again. I can tell you that in Europe and Asia this kind of shit just doesn't fly. However, having seen the GME fail-to-deliver data on the SEC website, I'm pretty shocked that US markets appear to be riddled with corruption.\n\nSecond thing: If you're a trader or PM in a hedge fund and you mess something up then it is the golden rule that you get out immediately. You never let an error run or dilly-dally before making things right. It's my belief that this attitude permeates the entire industry. Ego, right or wrong, fair or unfair, they all go out the window and you take the loss, suffer the pain, and live to fight another day. \n\nNow let's consider what happened last week: GME  traded > 500m shares. If Melvin were covering at 1/4 volume it means they could have bought 125m shares. That's twice the floating market cap. As such I'd say Melvin is almost certainly out of this trade already.\n\nIn that case, you're all just playing with yourselves and the selloffs are a simple result of derivative brokers (eToro et al) running stops of leveraged customers.

So the only people that would lose are the ones that get scared into selling and they benefit off that?\n\n  Sorry for the long post just interested in what's happening and trying to figure it out.\n\n  Edit: If what I'm thinking here is correct then right now they're using scare tactics to get people to sell but need to keep it high enough to make a profit off people joining the craze so we should expect a much bigger dip in price from market manipulation when the squeeze is actually about to happen so they can get as much as possible for as low as possible?", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "how does melvin's cock taste like bot?", "score": -5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Your naked play with your dong.

{"title": "A skeptic’s post: Can WSB win the GME standoff even if we want to?", "selftext": "I have been following WSB as a lurker for almost a year, and this has become my favorite sub on all of reddit. Shout out to I am absolutely rooting for y’all and all your proletarian tendies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI don’t want to rain on anyone’s money parade. But after reading lots of excited posts about “rockets to the moon”, which seem to be full of excited confirmation bias, riding on [this excellent & sober post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbaktb/sober_review_time_what_are_the_actual_data_we_can/), I wanted to present a few arguments, as a total ignorant fool, about some strategic disadvantages I perceive in this battle, since I tend towards skepticism, and worry that there is too much buzz, and not enough strategic preparation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI was also inspired by [u/NHNE](https://www.reddit.com/user/NHNE)’s quote from Sun Tzu in his excellent post with a [Diamond Hand Strategy Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahcsd/comprehensive_gme_diamond_hand_strategy_guide/): \n\n*“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” - Sun Tzu*\n\n&nbsp;\n \n**My caveat: I know literally nothing about investing.**\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n***The advantages Hedge Funds have in the battle for the GME Short Squeeze:***\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Information advantage**\n\n- The hedge funds will always have quicker, better access to information than all of WSB. \n\n**Coordination advantage**\n\n- They are one big organized entity, and can move their entire “Army” of bets with infinitesimal speed. \n\n**Size advantage**\n\n- The hedges have more money at stake and in play than all of WSB put together.\n\n**Ally advantage**\n\n- They have powerful collaborators. The media, who doesn’t want a hedge fund to go bust. You can assume, the US government (and every other government), because they don’t want a stock market crash. And everyone who colludes with hedge funds, i.e. all of corporate America.\n\n**Propaganda advantage**\n\n- Whether it be social media posts, bots, articles in mainstream media, they have enough money to blast out as much fake statistics and propaganda as they like. WSB does not.\n \n**Mathematical advantage**\n\n- A lot of trading has become complicated math. You can assume that every single analyst they have/need is working on the math to get them out of the hole they have dug themselves in. We are less good at math.\n\n**Speed & Precision advantage**\n\n- They can make trades and bets much faster, with a much higher precision than WSB.\n\n**Strategic advantage**\n\n- You can assume the hedge funds know your position, but you don’t know theirs. This in my mind is the most powerful of all advantages for them. Imagine you are playing chess against an opponent and have to decide which pieces to move, but aren’t allowed to see where theirs are? But they can ever *read your thoughts* (i.e. this forum).\n\n**Legal advantage**\n\n- Given the very very light penalties even for something patently illegal in financial manipulations, it is in their very interest to do anything whose cost is “cheaper” than the potential cost of the actual monetary loss, whether it be legal or not. If you were the CEO/Fund manager, you too would decide for illegality.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the question then becomes, given this situation, in which for the hedge funds not only billions are at stake, but the narrative of their ability to make the market, and the propaganda of expertise they disseminate, how does WSB win and force the Short Squeeze? What are WSB's advantages? How do you make best use of them? Who are WSB's allies? How can they be activated? How do you deceive the enemy? How do you overwhelm them, tactically?\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nA few initial thoughts on counter-strategies (Feel free to suggest more, and I'll add them in):\n\n- The strongest narrative that might influence public/politics is that the stock market is a casino, and the house is not just taking its fees, but cheating. The stock market is no longer a \"free market\", but a place where big players make the rules, and use their wealth to make more wealth for themselves.\n\n- WSB needs to find and activate allies. These might be the company itself (GME), value investors who believe in the free market and its efficiency, political/investment figures who want investment to actually mean something.\n\n- Some disadvantages need to be turned into advantages. For example, it will be difficult to impossible for WSB to move in concert without alerting the \"enemy\" to its own ovements. So, how does one coordinate a move in which transparency becomes an advantage?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy position: One free GME share I got from RH when I signed up.:)", "id": "lbifwv", "created_utc": 1612337861.0, "score": 173, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 129, "comments": [{"body": "I'm holding.\n\nThe only thing that really matters is that a huge portion of retail was locked out of, or severely limited on buy action. \n\nThis lead to low volume ladders on the down side.

Surprise: We were underestimated in the capital we could bring to the table\n2. Focus: A huge focus of our readers was on a single Stonk\n3. Momentum: Fast growing crowd and upswing.\n\nHowever in the past few days we lost all 3.\n\n1. Surprise: The surprise was clearly gone, the second the news started reporting on us. This is theoretically ok as losing the element of surprise could be replaced by an increase in both focus and momentum. This was especially important because of the volume of short interest initially.\n2. Focus: Our bets went from a laser focus on a $200m GME to a spread out focus into AMC, NOK, Etc. This was when we needed the focus the most, as GME's market cap rose over $20 Billion\n3. Momentum: This was literally stopped dead in its tracks the second that the brokerages pulled our ability to purchase more shares. This is not something that we could have expected, it was a fundamental shift in the rules of the game, but it happened.\n\nThis is not to say GME won't or can't go to the moon, this is to say that in order for GME to move forward there would need to be a different set of elements that would need to come together.\n\nYou are welcome to hate on the post, disagree with my logic or just not agree with I am saying.

Short sellers typically hope to profit from a downward price movement or seek to hedge the risk of a long position in the same or a related security.\nIn February 2010 the Commission adopted a new short sale price test restriction, which is commonly referred to as the “alternative uptick rule.”  The alternative uptick rule is designed to restrict short selling from further driving down the price of a stock that has dropped more than 10 percent in one day compared to the closing price on the previous day.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/answers/shortrestrict.htm", "score": 46, "replies": []}, {"body": "You listed a few points but forgot the most important ones.

Microsoft tried it with Mixer but failed because they overpaid for idiots like Ninja expecting an audience. By pivoting to esports and hosting tournaments which require using their streaming platform to qualify and compete for cash prizes, they can capitalize on picking up and establishing new up and coming streamers as well as pull/entice existing talent without offering ludicrous contracts. Offering aggressive affiliate marketing opportunities to streamers who join and push gamestop products would also entice more content creators to join. They can also sell advertising space in streams as well. Once that is established as a viable threat to Twitch, they could position themselves further to capture content creators from Youtube as well who are currently unhappy with how Google and Youtube treat their content (allowing them to branching out a little further than just games).\n\nGamestop has brand awareness and digital only game consoles are still at least 5-10 years away due to a variety of limitations that prevent fully abandoning disc-consoles (some of which are outside of Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo's control - such as data caps from shitty ISPs like Comcast as well as a lack of universal access to fiber optic internet speeds). That, coupled with with the limitations of the hardware's internal storage (e.g. PS5 has the same amount of storage for digital and disc console - but next gen games range from 45 to 250 GB) and the size of next gen games, preserves the retail 2nd hand market. Especially in areas where internet is shit.\n\nI think the long term potential with the right moves under RC can lay the groundwork for Gamestop's survival beyond the eventual demise of disc based console systems and the destruction of second hand sales market for games.\n\non why disc consoles have more life to them: [This article goes in depth into the details about key limitations to a full conversion to digital so anyone doing DD for a long position should definitely take these points into consideration](https://mradyfist.medium.com/a-discussion-of-gmes-fundamentals-from-a-technical-rather-than-financial-perspective-as-636db00b1256)\n\nDisc consoles are a lock for the next 5-6 years and probably the next generation as well due to elements outside of Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo's control [mainly shitty ISP behaviours like Datacaps and a lack of universal availability of fiber optic high speed internet around the globe]: those factors are external limitations to making the full transition and will likely take a decade or more to properly address. The current gen's main limit to digital only are the file sizes and internal storage: disc and digital PS5 have the exact same amount of internal storage - but next gen games take up 45-250 GB worth of space when there's roughly 750 GB of space available.", "score": 175, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

{"title": "GME Rollercoaster", "selftext": "Listen up bag holders, 💎🖐, short bus riders.  \n\nThe euphoric feeling you had when you saw GME hit $500 intraday, with dreams of it hitting  $1,000 while yelling,”I’m gonna cooom!!” and the depression accompanying it when it hit $80 yesterday, while you glance at those big, heavy fucking bags in your diamond hands, are nothing new for GME gang. \n\nIt happened in October when it was halted based on MSFT news and then promptly fell back down to earth.  It happened in November/December RC penned the letter to the BoD, run up to earnings where it dropped so hard after omnichannel.  Then RC made a filing to up his stake mid December.  We all know when he tweeted 🥜 around 1/15 opex week.   \n\nAfter every major drop, GME or RC drops something to quell those doubts. Case in point, they announced 3 new hires today. \n\nMost of the GME DD prior to the squeeze was that the catalyst for the squeeze would most likely occur in late March/April.  I still stand by that.  \n\nThe run up to 1/15 and the subsequent para move was mainly driven by the incredible amount of GME options exp then and the gamma squeeze initiated by retail subsequently sustained by the larger hedge funds.  It always felt inorganic, which was why most current bag holders expected more.  Yes it could’ve reached $1000, 2000, 5000 even - had RH and other brokerages not royally fucked up and fucked every retail trader. Shorts may have covered through redemptions from ETFs with high concentrations of GME shares, they might have covered in other ways.  Who gives a shit.  The fact exists that there are still shorts.  We’ve learned and seen all the dirty tricks in the book thrown our way.  We now know what to be wary about.  We’re not missing our second shot.  \n \nShort Squeeze has always been the cherry on top of the GME DD.   The DD was always that it was an undervalued company.  How undervalued is anyone’s guess.  \n\nIf restrictions get lifted, and volatility drops a bit, who’s to say gamma squeezes can’t happen again and ride the tendie train every Friday? We seen how TSLA went.  I understand two different industries, valuations, etc.? But gamma squeezes are real and both have asymmetric forward return profile. TSLA rode our FDs like a motherfucker to the moon all last yr. \n\nIf you’ve lost money, you can cut your losses and do what is best for you and your family.  I’m not here to tell you to hold or sell or whatever you want to do with your money/financial decisions.  You can also hold to see how it will play out - you don’t lose if you don’t sell, because there are more catalysts to come (March earnings, 100M shelf offering, share buyback, expansion, LT roadmap).  Again, you do you. \n\nJust remember, for every high that GME has hit, it’s gone even higher than that in subsequent peaks.  I do think it will go higher than $500 at some point in the near future.  Gut feeling. Call me retarded. Call me crazy.

{"title": "US Marijuana Legalization: the next rocket catalyst", "selftext": "**Bubbles**\nAn emergence of a new industry usually results in a bubble due to the necessity of making a lot of assumptions about future growth to value a stock since there is no historical precedent. The enthusiasm for a paradigm shift causes investors to frequently overshoot and result in what may be quite astronomical valuations. Currently, the US equities market is quite frothy with unprecedented loose monetary policy causing an asset bubble of historic proportions. Jeremy Graham calls the US equities the biggest bubble he has ever seen in his investing career.  With the Democrats in charge of government, the corresponding stimulus bill will result in a melt up of the stock market along with risky equities. \n\n**Government Involvement** \nGovernment policy and actions can ignite a bubble. Chinese EV stocks were in the dumps during March 2020 due to the Covid shut downs, and the curtailment by the Chinese government of EV subsidies. NIO was on the verge of bankruptcy with only having enough cash to sustain its payrolls for 2 months at the time. But the subsequent 180 from the government for EV subsidies along with a partnership with a local government entity caused NIO to skyrocket. \n\nWe are already in an environment of risk seeking, frothy environment where a value play of a struggling retailer can turn into a short squeeze that ends up as a social moment. This is a crazy market, and it will get even crazier when Congress legalizes marijuana.\n\nUS marijuana legalization efforts has followed a similar path to gay marriage where the public opinion over the decade has shifted due to states leading the way for legalization followed by an increasingly favorable depiction in popular culture that has shifted public opinion. I believe we are on the verge of legalization now that the Democrats hold all positions of power in government, and they are willing to pass progressive policies after getting stung in the Obama administration for trying to negotiate a “bipartisan” path that went nowhere.  \n\n**Political Calculus**\nThe House has already passed HR 3884 MORE Act of 2020 that pretty much legalized marijuana. Schumer who is the current Senate Majority Leader, sponsored the S 1552 Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act in 2019, but it went nowhere since McConnell ran the show at the time. Legal marijuana is Schumer’s pet legislation he has been pushing for years, and he is under pressure to enact progressive legislation due to threats of other progressives running against him in the 2022 primary. He will most likely push to get it passed in the Senate before his primary so that he can parade it in his re-election campaign and kill any progressive challenges to his seat. \n\nMarijuana stocks have done well since the election, but I think they have more room to go due to the following reasons. Once legalization happens, a couple of things happen. \n\n1.    **Institutional money.** US banks and institutional investors cannot invest in a company that produces a product that is federally illegal. However, once legalization happens, the barrier no longer applies. You will have a flood of institutional funds buying up companies operating in a grey zone (hence my preference for US based MSOs compared to more mainstream Canadian companies). \n\n2.\t**Taxes.** Currently, IRS does not allow medical marijuana companies to deduct their business expenses so most of them are operating at a loss despite 50-70% gross margin. Once marijuana is legalized, their tax bill will no longer cause them to operate at a loss. \n\n3.\t**Availability.** US MSO who have the biggest to gain from this are trading in Canadian stock exchanges in a quasi-grey area. Once they become legalized, they can move into main stream stock exchanges like NYSE which can open them up to retail investors to trade in. \n\n4.\t**Financing.** The best US MSO can only get a 10% rate for their financing needs in order to expand due to the lack of banks willing to do business with them because of the ambiguity in the federal guidelines. When the restriction is lifted, their financing costs will go down and their payment processing fees/ availability will improve. \n\nTLDR- US based weed stocks going to the moon.
