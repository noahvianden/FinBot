{"title": "Implied Volatility — The Rubber Band That (Barely) Holds It All Together", "selftext": "Implied volatility is one of the most misunderstood concepts about options. Let’s look at it from a practical perspective.\n\n# The Only Certainty About Options\n\nBefore even mentioning implied volatility, we need to clarify the only certainty about options.\n\n**The only certainty about options is the inevitable worthlessness of an option’s** ***extrinsic value*****^(\\*)** **at the expiration of the option.** That’s it. Everything else is theory.\n\nIn their basic nature, options are standardized insurance that you can buy and sell on a whim. While the inherent insurance in options is worthless at expiration, it *must* be worth *something* before then. Right?\n\nRight. But what determines the worth of options?\n\nThe market. Just how buyer and seller pressure determines the price of a stock, buyer and seller pressure determines the prices of the contracts in an option chain. With enough participants, arbitrage removes any obvious inefficiencies in the chain. Good luck finding the not-so-obvious ones.\n\n^(\\* If you need to brush up on extrinsic value, then I highly recommend studying) [^(Options extrinsic and intrinsic value, an introduction)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/extrinsic_value) ^(by u/redtexture. It’s one of best explanations I’ve seen, and I send people to it regularly.)\n\n# Enter Theory\n\nOne of the greatest innovations of the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model and its variants is dynamic hedging and the prospect of projecting an option’s price through potential changes in the variables that *should* affect the price of an option. Such variables are …\n\n* Time - the extrinsic value is worth something now. It will be worth nothing eventually.\n* Underlying move - the distance of the underlying price from the strike price matters.\n* Expected underlying move - fear of loss and fear of missing out should affect demand for optionality.\n* Interest rates - how cash is allocated matters, and it should affect the cost of carry of an option as well\n* Other factors - dividends, short interest with HTB fees, the moving average of the daily number of mentions on WSB, etc. … should somehow affect an option’s price as well.\n\nThe BSM model mathematically organizes the top four of these factors into a neat, nonlinear and multidimensional formula. The code has been cracked, and we can move on with our lives now.\n\n# The BSM Model Is Always Right\n\nDon’t you *ever* question it. The Greeks^(\\*) never lie!\n\nYou’re holding an OTM call on AAPL through earnings. AAPL gaps up the next day. The delta/gamma projection with theta projection had your call premium to go up by 50% from the realized underlying move, but your premium went down by 10% … WTF? Even the grandmas on reddit will tell you that you got IV-crushed.\n\nFine. You were holding an OTM put on GME when the shit was all ‘tarded. GME exploded upward. BSM projected that your put would have lost 75% of its premium, but your put doubled in price. Ahhh, but you see … IV went up! Not that you’re complaining about making money on your now farther out-of-the-money put, you just want to understand what the hell is going on here.\n\nOption decayed more than projected by theta? … IV!\n\nOption decayed *less* than projected by theta? … but IV!\n\nIf you can’t tell by now, implied volatility is the get-out-of-jail-free card for the BSM model. Any difference between the market price of a contract and the price projected by theta and delta/gamma (and even the neglected rho) will be consumed by a change in implied volatility via vega.\n\nBut what the hell is implied volatility anyway?\n\n^(\\* In this post, I’m assuming that you have a basic understanding about delta, gamma, theta, and vega. A simple Google search can help you brush up on them.)\n\n# In the Beginning, There Was Volatility\n\nOne day, someone was bored and started comparing two stocks. Stock ABC traded at $100 per share in the beginning of the year and closed the year at $100 per share. So did stock XYZ. However, the low-high of ABC was 90-110 that year, while the low-high of XYZ was 50-150 for the same year. That’s a kiddy choo-choo train ride at a state fair compared to the Fury 325 at Carowinds. That someone wanted to find a mathematical way to compare the stocks, and so it began …\n\nDaily percent changes (of closing prices) of the stocks were calculated over a time period (say, 30 days). Then their average was calculated. Then the differences between that average and the daily percent changes was calculated. Those differences were squared. The squared differences were averaged. That average was square rooted … and BAM!\n\nThrough this simple process, we have a measurement of one standard deviation of the daily percent differences of closing prices of a stock. This measurement is annualized, and we get the historical volatility of a stock (or the most common calculation of it, typically done over a rolling 30-day period).\n\nOther attempts to measure historical volatility use a moving average, measuring how far the traded prices move from the average.\n\nAs sophisticated as it all seems, any statistical approach to measure volatility makes one assume that volatility adheres to a distribution (normal, lognormal, or any other). There is no substantial evidence that it does. Regular “fat-tail” events kind of suggest that it does not. Ask Robert C. Merton about his [Long-Term Capital Management](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-Term_Capital_Management) hedge fund. >!It did not fair well.!<\n\n# Implied Volatility — The Frankenstein’s Monster of BSM\n\nBSM model takes the concept of historical volatility even further, claiming that the market prices of options imply a certain probability of a certain historical volatility to be realized.\n\nLet that sink in … a *probability* is assigned to something that cannot be adequately measured, where all possibilities cannot be accounted for …\n\nWeather forecasters have infiltrated the markets. Ninety percent chance of precipitation! … sunny day, no rain … well, that ten percent is a bitch, ain’t it?\n\n# So, What Affects What Exactly?\n\nThe BSM model claims that implied volatility affects the market price of an option. However, the only way IV can be measured is through the market price of the option, plugged into the model’s formula. Non-optionable stocks have no implied volatility.\n\nFurthermore, the options market calls bullshit on the probability distribution of the BSM model. This is evident in the non-uniform IV calculated from the market prices of the contracts in an option chain. There should only be one implied volatility for an underlying. Yet, there are as many as there are contracts.\n\nThis is why we have a *volatility index*. The implied volatility of a stock? It’s actually a systematically [calculated average](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/070213/tracking-volatility-how-vix-calculated.asp) of the IVs of certain contracts in the stock’s option chain. The same formula is used to calculate VIX from SPX options.\n\n# Volatility Surface — Making Sense of the Madness\n\nSo, instead of ditching the BSM model and its variants, we find rhyme and reason to the different IVs across strikes and expiration dates in an option chain. Like good *Homo sapiens*, we find patterns (even when there are none).\n\nWe study the skew (the slope of IVs across strikes) and the term structure (the slope of IVs across expiration dates) to assess the market’s current correction to the model’s neat projections. To do this, we must first understand the neat projections (at least the [first order](https://medium.com/hypervolatility/options-greeks-delta-gamma-vega-theta-rho-23f0321b64ba) and [second order](https://medium.com/hypervolatility/options-greeks-vanna-charm-vomma-dvegadtime-77d35c4db85c)) of the model. We can then adjust our expectations, based on what the market is telling us via the volatility surface of the option chain.\n\n# Term Structure — Decay Adjustment\n\nTerm structure is probably the easiest to understand. The IV of longer-term options tends to be higher than that of shorter-term options. This is often called contango (borrowing the term from futures markets). This can be explained by the need to roll the insurance forward. The market may also see a greater probability of a tail event being captured by a longer-term option. Calendar spreaders also beat down on the shorter-term contracts.\n\nRegardless, what this normal term structure tells us is that option contracts (particularly those near the money) decay faster than the rate projected by the model. While the *volatility index* of the underlying remains the same, the IV of a single contract will drop over time as long as the term structure does not change.\n\n**The IV term structure can change.**\n\nSudden/unexpected realized volatility can cause the IV of shorter-term contracts to be higher than that of the longer-term contracts. This is often called backwardation (borrowing yet another term from the futures markets). Such conditions cause the market to value short-term protection more than long-term protection. Why? It’s cheaper. The market also expects the storm to settle sooner rather than later. More so, it takes a lot of fear to move the IV of longer-term options. They are more expensive, and they have higher vega (according to the model). This means that their premium will have to rise *significantly* for their IV to rise substantially.\n\nPlanned future events (e.g. earnings reports, TV interview with an executive, Congress voting on a particular bill, etc.) can also affect the IV term structure of the option chain, slowing down the projected decay of options expiring after the expected event. The market is attempting to price-in the expected move caused by the planned event. Come the event, expect the term structure to change.\n\nWhile an expected event causes a “sticky date” term structure, a general fear of short-term volatility can cause a rolling term-structure, where the IV of options expiring in less than a month (for instance) is decreasing, and the IV of options expiring in more than a month is increasing. Such a term structure can be short-lived, or it can persist for an extended period of time (think SPX in 2020).\n\n# Skew — Underlying Move Adjustment\n\nThere are several ways to interpret the skew. Put skew (where the IV in the lower strikes is higher than the IV in higher strikes) is the most common among equity options. This can be explained by OTM covered call writers and OTM married put buyers. The general observation of stairs-up/elevator-down may also cause it. This can also be explained by a usual rise in demand for insurance during a sell-off and a decline thereof during an uptrend. The relatively higher IV on the lower strikes is the market’s attempt to price-in the rise of IV during a sell-off, while the relatively lower IV on the higher strikes is the market’s attempt to price-in the decline of IV during a steady climb of the underlying.\n\nDoes the skew move with the underlying? It depends on how you look at it. There is a sticky strike rule and a sticky delta/moneyness rule. [Here](http://deltaquants.com/volatility-sticky-strike-vs-sticky-delta) is a quick breakdown of the two rules. Both are somewhat true and both are imperfect. Each rule is ultimately ”corrected” by the realized volatility surface after the underlying move, whether it be interpreted as rising/sinking and/or bending.\n\nIf we interpret the skew as the market’s attempt to price in a change in the volatility index of the underlying from an underlying move, then this [paper](http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/jgatheral/ImpliedVolatilitySurface.pdf) suggests that it tends to underestimate that change. Thus, the skew partially prices in the change in IV in each contract from an underlying move. For example, if a sell-off raises the at-the-money IV of the underlying from 20 to 30, the IV of a particular OTM put could go from 25 to 28. Thus, a single contract will not realize a full change of the volatility index of an underlying from an underlying move, because the market partially “arbitrages” the change due to spot-vol correlation.\n\n# There you have it …\n\nThis is implied volatility — the rubber band of the options pricing model(s) that (barely) holds it all together.\n\nIn the end, we’re all just guessing. The shittiest part of life is that every single one of us is forced to make decisions and take actions without having the complete model of reality. We’re terrible at predicting the future.

Black Scholes is not a perfect model but we all agree to use it to define the implied volatility. There are two factors at play here...The stock price and all the other variables like time/strike price which manifest themselves in the implied volatility value which I  like to call Implied Demand/Fear. When GME squeezed, it was not just stock but options...so short sellers had to buy back options for fear of unlimited losses...implied fear.. So they paid way too much for those options... How much? We plug the price of the option and stock into the BS model and spit out Implied Volatility. GME options went from 50% IV to 1,200% IV for the OTM calls over 500 strike. What does that mean? Expensive options. So with the stock at 300, I want to buy 200 puts betting the market drops but so does everyone else..Implied Demand and Implied Fear of the calls is a perfect storm for the puts due to Put/Call Parity....They ain't cheap. So we buy puts for 1,000% IV and the stock drops to 100 and those puts are worth less than what we paid? What happened..? The Implied Demand/Fear has changed..the bubble burst....GME has dropped from 500 to 100. Who wants to sell the stock now? Not many people...Who needs to buy options back that were shorted? They all blew up already...they are dead...Implied Demand / Fear has dropped...so plug in the stock price and option price into BS Model = IV of only 500%...The option price is dropping faster than the stock price so we lose money buying the put. That event is measured by the change in Implied Volatility...from 1,000% IV to 500% IV...and then on expiry to 0% IV for OTM puts... So Implied Volatility allows you to measure past prices to today and other strikes/maturities and then you can say whether one is cheap or expensive to another.

The model is nonlinear and multidimensional.

It’s not unreasonable to see it that way. This is part of the reason why shorter-term IV is more volatile than longer-term IV. For example:\n- A weekly ATM option has a vega of 2.00 with a market value of 25.00 and IV of 13%\n- A three-month ATM option (same underlying) has a vega of 9.00 with a market value of 180.00 and IV of 20%\n- A two-dollar increase in premium will increase the weekly IV by 1%, while increasing the three-month option’s IV by 0.22%\n- A nine-dollar increase in premium will increase the IV of the three-month option by 1%, while increasing the IV of the weekly option by 4.5%\n- It’s also a lot easier to move the price of the cheaper option (more people can afford to buy it)\n- I chose ATM options specifically for this example, since their vega is more or less linear. OTM/ITM vega has acceleration (vomma).\n\nAll Greeks are determined by the model used. Brokers can use different models, but AFAIK, they are all BSM variants and don’t differ significantly (MMs and HFs may have their own proprietary models, but they won’t tell us anything about them). I believe the default model for Thinkorswim is Bjerksund-Stensland, which is supposed to factor in the early-exercise optionality in the American option (which is only really relevant in dividend stocks or stocks with corp action risk).

{"title": "$BB King – The Blacker the Berry, the Sweeter the Juice", "selftext": "**BB King baby**\n\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\n\n**2.4.2021 Prelude**:\n\nIf you are new to this DD, just continue on through below. If you have been keeping in touch, I mentioned this stock back in the $6 area and we managed to hit $28+ in such a short period of time. Lots and lots of firepower. To be frank, and many who have messaged me know, I started scaling out past 15 and closed out last Monday in the $20 area. Why? Because I wanted the stock to cool off and to let the market determine who really wanted to invest and own the stock, and who wanted it for the trade cause BRRRRR BB GO UP. Well, I’m back in, and here are my updates and reasons why. In addition, BB is decoupling from the GME trade, and should see much more lift comparatively.\n\n**Intro**\n\nMan Blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.\n\nIt is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing.\n\n**Let’s begin**:\n\nBB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. \nBB stock price, 9.84 as of Close on 1-18-2021. Only 9 days since I first posted. This is just the beginning.\nBB stock price, 12 as of Close on 2-3-2021. Hit a high of 28.77 the week prior…this moved so fast.\n\n**Technical 2.4.2021**\n\nOn the 4hr, volume is really cooling down lately and it seems to me that sellers are REALLY drying up. People that didn’t even want to part with their BB shares capitulated. Now we likely wash out yesterday’s nice move upwards before continuing to the upside. MACD cross/flip, Moving Averages basing, just looks overall quite nice.\n\n\n**Recent Earnings**\n\nFiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast | % Surprise\n---|---|----|----|----\nNov 2020\t| 12/17/2020\t| 0\t| -0.04\t| 100\nAug 2020\t| 09/24/2020\t| 0.1\t| -0.02\t| 600\nMay 2020\t| 06/24/2020\t| 0\t| -0.04\t| 100\nFeb 2020\t| 03/31/2020\t| 0.06\t|0.01\t|500\n\nSurprises along the board.\n\nRevenues Q3, $224 MM.\n\nRevenues projected for Q4, $246 MM. This will be beaten immensely.\n\nFull year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. \n\nMkt cap, $4 B. \n\nTotal company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.\n\n\n**NEWS EVENTS**\n\nFB settlement\n\nBB won a suit against Zuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and whatnot. This settlement has now occurred. Check Bloomberg for the deets\n\nSomeone I know and trust let me know that there are rumors that the settlement is worth $2B and a 2 year partnership. This is not fact, just rumor, but if it is true that is MASSIVE.\n\nBlackBerry IVY – Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform\n\nThe big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”\n\nWhat does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers)\n\n**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**\n\nBlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:\n\n* Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences\n* Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models\n* Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission\n* Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access\n* Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community\nVideos on their YT\n\nWant a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info?  [Read this](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) and watch their conferences that they have done or are coming up.\n\nThe IVY deal has so much commercial promise. Manufacturers are going to buy IVY because of the data gathering, but more importantly IVY is going to become the universal app store for automotive apps. The IVY platform will be universal across manufacturers and models so a developer can build an app that will work on any car that has IVY. BB will take an app store like commission on revenue. Billions.\n\nAfter cars, IVY and QNX will move to the broader Internet of Things. Planes, trains, medical devices, EVERYTHING will be connected and needs to be secure. BB has competitive advantages over all the other players, especially Linux because it is not secure, while BB’s QNX has the highest achievable safety certs.\n\nIf the automotive biz wasn’t enough they have interesting offerings in corporate data security, anti-virus, and emergency notification systems. They are literally in some of the hottest spaces you could be right now, with no signs of cooling.\nAs of their conferences, IVY and QNX both seem to be opening up many many more avenues of revenue to tackle within the auto space. Per Steve Rai, what was typically 2-3 avenues of revenue is not 5-6, with IVY being a HUGE 7th.\n\n**Partnerships with big companies**\n\nBlackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and ServiceNow. BB’s Incident Management Response System AtHoc is integrating into the NOW platform. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY. I think this should pull above $10 MM per month, $120MM a year? Sounds enticing to me when we are at $~1B revenue with a 76% gross margin.\n\nSony announced a BlackBerry partnership, per CEO @JohnChen on Twitter: Thank you for your partnership @Sony. You are an icon and I look forward to experiencing your #ElectricVehicle embedded with @BlackBerry software. But first, where I can get a #Playstation5? #EV#PS5\n\nBB & BAIDU announced their partnership too!\n\n**Patents**\n\nBB Selling Smartphone Patents to Huawei, more $$$$ coming in. Recent Sale news here: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/?cmpid=rss&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\n\nBB JUST won a suit against Facebook for one of the patents they hold: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement. This is minimum likely worth $500 MM+, but to my knowledge off of some juicy rumors, this is a $2B settlement with FB and a 2 year partnership. MASSIVE.\n\n**Business Implications**\n\nBB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?\n\nBubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? They cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock.\n\nHere is the biggest catch: Right now the auto industry is actually selling less cars, and many of the EVs that BB is partnered with are really in the liftoff phase. When XPEV (my favorite EV and I am working on my print for them as we speak), NIO, BIDU, Hyundai, get their EV and Self Driving Cars off the ground and start growing their vehicle output, this number will grow and grow. BB is really at the brink of an explosive couple of years. You are entering at the ground floor.\n\n**CONFERENCES**  \n\nBB has just spoken at the following conferences:\nCiti’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nJP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nNeedham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference with Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect.\n\nUpcoming conference on Feb 22nd, 2 PM EST with **AMZN** and **BB**. Will update with a link when I get the chance\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThis stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. ~~This trades at $6.70.~~ They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. \n\nFrom here, 12.5 leads to 15, 28, and then probably some wild momentum to 40-50. More shorts have entered the trade, and likely more institutions have entered long. It is an exciting time for Blackberry, let’s roll\n\n**QNX CUSTOMERS** (see anyone you know?)\n\n• BAIDU• XPENG • Sony • NIO • Lucid Motors • PLUS • ARCFOX • DESAY SV • CANOO • DAMON MOTORCYCLES • RENOVO • ARIVVAL • HYUNDAI AUTRON • DENSO • JAGUA LAND ROVER • LG • RENESAS • BYTON • NVIDIA  • QUALCOMM • TATA ELXSI • DELPHI TEAMS • SpaceX • BOSCH • KARMA • AMAZON • Rivian • Lordstown • Fisker • Hyliion", "id": "leod0e", "created_utc": 1612711147.0, "score": 1444, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 156, "comments": [{"body": "Excellent DD, I will add a bag 💼", "score": 245, "replies": [{"body": "lets go", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "Title game on fucking point.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'm holding 2000 at $17 so I approve anything that mentions BB.", "score": 58, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’ll add the 🚀", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yeah.

{"title": "$BB King – The Blacker the Berry, the Sweeter the Juice", "selftext": "**BB King baby**\n\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\n\n**2.4.2021 Prelude**:\n\nIf you are new to this DD, just continue on through below. If you have been keeping in touch, I mentioned this stock back in the $6 area and we managed to hit $28+ in such a short period of time. Lots and lots of firepower. To be frank, and many who have messaged me know, I started scaling out past 15 and closed out last Monday in the $20 area. Why? Because I wanted the stock to cool off and to let the market determine who really wanted to invest and own the stock, and who wanted it for the trade cause BRRRRR BB GO UP. Well, I’m back in, and here are my updates and reasons why. In addition, BB is decoupling from the GME trade, and should see much more lift comparatively.\n\n**Intro**\n\nMan Blackberry, who the hell thought I’d be investing in you after the fall of BBM and Brickbreaker. Well, strap in folks as I take you through one of the most bullish stories in stonk history, and it all starts with one statement. Everything you’re thinking about with Blackberry at the moment, is wrong.\n\nIt is not a phone company. It is not telling you to use BBM. It is a software, automotive, and cybersecurity company that is about to make a killing.\n\n**Let’s begin**:\n\nBB stock price, 6.71 as of Close on 1-6-2021. \nBB stock price, 9.84 as of Close on 1-18-2021. Only 9 days since I first posted. This is just the beginning.\nBB stock price, 12 as of Close on 2-3-2021. Hit a high of 28.77 the week prior…this moved so fast.\n\n**Technical 2.4.2021**\n\nOn the 4hr, volume is really cooling down lately and it seems to me that sellers are REALLY drying up. People that didn’t even want to part with their BB shares capitulated. Now we likely wash out yesterday’s nice move upwards before continuing to the upside. MACD cross/flip, Moving Averages basing, just looks overall quite nice.\n\n\n**Recent Earnings**\n\nFiscal Quarter End| Date Reported| Earnings Per Share* | Consensus EPS* Forecast | % Surprise\n---|---|----|----|----\nNov 2020\t| 12/17/2020\t| 0\t| -0.04\t| 100\nAug 2020\t| 09/24/2020\t| 0.1\t| -0.02\t| 600\nMay 2020\t| 06/24/2020\t| 0\t| -0.04\t| 100\nFeb 2020\t| 03/31/2020\t| 0.06\t|0.01\t|500\n\nSurprises along the board.\n\nRevenues Q3, $224 MM.\n\nRevenues projected for Q4, $246 MM. This will be beaten immensely.\n\nFull year Guidance 2021, $950 MM. \n\nMkt cap, $4 B. \n\nTotal company non-GAAP revenue of $224 million; total company GAAP revenue of $218 million. Non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.02; GAAP loss per basic and diluted share of $0.23. Net cash generated from operating activities of $29 million.\n\n\n**NEWS EVENTS**\n\nFB settlement\n\nBB won a suit against Zuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and whatnot. This settlement has now occurred. Check Bloomberg for the deets\n\nSomeone I know and trust let me know that there are rumors that the settlement is worth $2B and a 2 year partnership. This is not fact, just rumor, but if it is true that is MASSIVE.\n\nBlackBerry IVY – Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform\n\nThe big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”\n\nWhat does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers)\n\n**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**\n\nBlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:\n\n* Fuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences\n* Drive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models\n* Reduce Costs by moving processing to the edge & reducing raw data transmission\n* Improve Operations with enhanced data visibility and access\n* Expand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community\nVideos on their YT\n\nWant a TL;DR? Automotive, cloud, cybersecurity, IOT, electric vehicles, every bubble on the planet. And this shit got all of it. Want more info?  [Read this](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) and watch their conferences that they have done or are coming up.\n\nThe IVY deal has so much commercial promise. Manufacturers are going to buy IVY because of the data gathering, but more importantly IVY is going to become the universal app store for automotive apps. The IVY platform will be universal across manufacturers and models so a developer can build an app that will work on any car that has IVY. BB will take an app store like commission on revenue. Billions.\n\nAfter cars, IVY and QNX will move to the broader Internet of Things. Planes, trains, medical devices, EVERYTHING will be connected and needs to be secure. BB has competitive advantages over all the other players, especially Linux because it is not secure, while BB’s QNX has the highest achievable safety certs.\n\nIf the automotive biz wasn’t enough they have interesting offerings in corporate data security, anti-virus, and emergency notification systems. They are literally in some of the hottest spaces you could be right now, with no signs of cooling.\nAs of their conferences, IVY and QNX both seem to be opening up many many more avenues of revenue to tackle within the auto space. Per Steve Rai, what was typically 2-3 avenues of revenue is not 5-6, with IVY being a HUGE 7th.\n\n**Partnerships with big companies**\n\nBlackberry partnered with Zoom (link: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/10/blackberry-and-zoom-together-secure-your-virtual-enterprise-meetings), Microsoft Teams (link: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-athoc-integrates-with-microsoft-teams-for-critical-event-management-301147559.html) and ServiceNow. BB’s Incident Management Response System AtHoc is integrating into the NOW platform. Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY. I think this should pull above $10 MM per month, $120MM a year? Sounds enticing to me when we are at $~1B revenue with a 76% gross margin.\n\nSony announced a BlackBerry partnership, per CEO @JohnChen on Twitter: Thank you for your partnership @Sony. You are an icon and I look forward to experiencing your #ElectricVehicle embedded with @BlackBerry software. But first, where I can get a #Playstation5? #EV#PS5\n\nBB & BAIDU announced their partnership too!\n\n**Patents**\n\nBB Selling Smartphone Patents to Huawei, more $$$$ coming in. Recent Sale news here: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-blackberry-sells-90-patents-to-huawei-covering-key-smartphone/?cmpid=rss&utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\n\nBB JUST won a suit against Facebook for one of the patents they hold: https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/blackberry-and-facebook-are-in-process-of-global-settlement. This is minimum likely worth $500 MM+, but to my knowledge off of some juicy rumors, this is a $2B settlement with FB and a 2 year partnership. MASSIVE.\n\n**Business Implications**\n\nBB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?\n\nBubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? They cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock.\n\nHere is the biggest catch: Right now the auto industry is actually selling less cars, and many of the EVs that BB is partnered with are really in the liftoff phase. When XPEV (my favorite EV and I am working on my print for them as we speak), NIO, BIDU, Hyundai, get their EV and Self Driving Cars off the ground and start growing their vehicle output, this number will grow and grow. BB is really at the brink of an explosive couple of years. You are entering at the ground floor.\n\n**CONFERENCES**  \n\nBB has just spoken at the following conferences:\nCiti’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nJP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nNeedham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference with Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect & Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect.\n\nUpcoming conference on Feb 22nd, 2 PM EST with **AMZN** and **BB**. Will update with a link when I get the chance\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThis stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. ~~This trades at $6.70.~~ They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile apps, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. \n\nFrom here, 12.5 leads to 15, 28, and probably some wild momentum to 40-50. More shorts have entered, likely more institutions have entered long. It is an exciting time for Blackberry, let’s roll\n\n**QNX CUSTOMERS** (see anyone you know?)\n\n• BAIDU• XPENG • Sony • NIO • Lucid Motors • PLUS • ARCFOX • DESAY SV • CANOO • DAMON MOTORCYCLES • RENOVO • ARIVVAL • HYUNDAI AUTRON • DENSO • JAGUA LAND ROVER • LG • RENESAS • BYTON • NVIDIA  • QUALCOMM • TATA ELXSI • DELPHI TEAMS • SpaceX • BOSCH • KARMA • AMAZON • Rivian • Lordstown • Fisker • Hyliion\n\nPositions: 4k Shs, 20 jan 21 12.5C leaps", "id": "leohs2", "created_utc": 1612711580.0, "score": 1138, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 183, "comments": [{"body": "So optimistic on BB rn.

{"title": "DD on Corsair ($CRSR)", "selftext": "  \n\n***Full disclosure, I am a shareholder so my opinions can be biased.***\n\nThis is not financial advice but I have tried to do some DD on this so please read to the end. I posted this to WSB yesterday and it didnt get much traction so i'm hoping more people here will find it useful. \n\nFor those of you who might not know what Corsair is, they are a computer parts and peripherals company founded in 1994 that went public in September of 2020. If you have a desktop PC, keyboard, mouse, or are a streamer, chances are you have seen their logo. Corsair Gaming ($CRSR) reports earnings this coming week on Tuesday. In light of that, I have put together a few insights that some of you may find interesting.\n\n**Earnings. Tuesday February 9th**\n\nFirst, a look at the previous quarter’s earnings (Q3 2020)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q3 2020 Highlights**\n\n\\- Net revenue was $457.1 million, an **increase of 60.7%** year over year\n\n\\- Gamer and creator peripherals net revenue was $161.6 million, an **increase of 128.8%** year over year\n\n\\- Gross profit was $129.9 million, an **increase of 112.4%** year over year\n\n\\- Gross margin was 28%, an **increase of 680 bps** (that’s 6.8%)\n\n\\- Gamer and creator peripherals segment gross profit was $60 million, an **increase of 200.8%** year over year\n\n\\- Gaming components and systems segment gross profit was $67.9 million, an increase of 68.7% year over year\n\n\\- Operating income was $49.7 million, an **increase of 353.6%** year-over-year\n\n\\- Adjusted operating income was $61.4 million, an **increase of 193.7%** year-over-year\n\n\\- Net income was $36.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million in the same period a year ago, or $0.02 per diluted share\n\n\\- **Adjusted net income was $48.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, an increase of 384.0% year-over-year compared to adjusted net income of $10.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.**\n\n**-** Adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, an **increase of 184.9%** year-over-year, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.9%, an **improvement of 610 bps** year-over-year\n\n**Q3 Earnings Call Highlights (quotes from the call)**\n\n\\- “This last quarter was one with very strong demand, with many major retailers running out of stock of our gear. Our stock situation has gotten better but only a small part of Q3 revenue came from restocking shelves, **with most gear selling as soon as they hit the shelves**.”\n\n\\- “We also recently launched two new microphones under our Elgato brand, Wave 1 and Wave 3, **which were sold out within the first few days of launch**.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Catalysts for Growth**\n\nAccording to data released by the International Data Corporation (IDC),\n\n\\- Global gaming PC shipments are expected to jump by 25% by 2024, while **global shipments of gaming laptops, desktop PCs, and monitors jumped 16.2% year over year in 2020 with December 2020 seeing the highest sales of PC components and peripherals on record**.\n\n**-** IDC predicts 2021 to witness a real surge in gaming PCs as new graphics processing units from Nvidia, AMD and Intel are expected to drive prices down and performance up.\n\n**- Global gaming PC sales revenue has jumped 60% in the past 5 years.** In 2015 the global gaming PC market reached $24.6 billion in revenue, which has increased to $39.2 billion in 2020. High end gaming computers represent the largest revenue stream in 2020 at $18.5 billion or 47% of combined profits in 2020\n\n\\- Not only will Corsair be able to capitalize on a gaming PC super cycle upgrade with new GPUs but on October 22, 2020, Corsair announced the launch of their first officially licensed headset for Microsoft Xbox. Corsair will also be able to capitalize on the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox console super cycle using their headsets and Scuf Gaming controllers for consoles. Corsair currently holds patents on several console controllers, Microsoft has licensed these patents to create the Xbox Elite Controller.\n\n\\- According to Corsair\n\n\\- There were 2.6 billion gamers (across all platforms) as of 2019\n\n\\- 11% of leisure time in the US is spent on gaming\n\n\\- 12 billion hours of gaming content was streamed in 2019\n\n\\- 71% of millennial gamers in the US watch gaming content on streaming platforms\n\n\\- Corsair will be able to capture this enormous rise in streaming using their Elgato line of products which enhance the ability of content creators to stream.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Market Share**\n\n\\- Pulled from Corsairs S-1 filing, they currently command over **18% of the US market share in gaming peripherals and nearly 42% of the gaming PC components market share**. This will allow them to capture a substantial portion of revenues from the global gaming peripherals market size which is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate **(CAGR) of 10.4**% from 2020 to 2025 according to grand view research.\n\n**- Ranking of Corsair’s Total US Market Share by Product:**\n\n**-** Keyboards: 2nd\n\n\\- Mice: 3rd\n\n\\- Headsets: 4th\n\n\\- Streaming Peripherals: 2nd\n\n\\- Performance Controllers: 2nd \n\n\\- Memory: 1st \n\n\\- Cases: 1st \n\n\\- Power Supply Units: 1st \n\n\\- Cooling Solutions: 1st \n\n**-** Releases of gaming content with ever-higher graphical requirements will drive consumers to upgrade their components and subsequently their peripherals as well. \n\n\\- **Corsair gaming is an ecosystem of products with a strong and recognizable brand which creates extreme brand loyalty amongst its customers.** This is more of a personal opinion but through my own experience and observation, it seems that when a customer goes to upgrade 1 component from Corsair, several hundred dollars later they come out the other side purchasing a number of internal PC components and have upgraded all of their peripherals (keyboard and mouse), but this is anecdotal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Q4 Earnings & Beyond** (released before the bell on Tuesday February 9th).\n\nThese are predictions and can obviously be taken with a grain of salt but I hope you can understand my rationale\n\n\\- I believe we will see a huge beat on Tuesday’s earnings release. This will be led by the compounding effects of the pandemic stay at home orders along-side an extremely strong holiday season. According to the site: Super Data, sales of digital games experienced a record number at $12 billion in December alone. This was the highest monthly revenue on record with PC games taking the lion’s share of this with a year over year revenue jump of 40% thanks to Cyberpunk 2077. This extremely high demand for PC games will drive the upgrading cycle and demand for Corsairs PC components and their peripherals. \n\n\\- I also believe that Corsair is a long term hold with substantial growth potential as the adoption of gaming grows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Competitor Comparison**\n\n**-** Corsair is frequently compared to Logitech. \n\n\\- Logitech currently has a market cap of $18.63 billion, Corsair has a market cap of $4.15 billion.\n\n\\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $2.9 billion, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end revenue at $1.65 billion.\n\n\\- Logitech is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $300 million, Corsair is expected to post 2020 fiscal year end operating income at $192 million.\n\n\\- Logitech currently has 169 million shares outstanding with a float of 162 million shares (6% is shorted), Corsair currently has 92 million shares outstanding with a 25 million share float (24% is shorted)\n\n\n**I believe Corsair is severely undervalued**", "id": "let2ki", "created_utc": 1612724928.0, "score": 771, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 182, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "Definitely haven’t missed it if you can get in under 45 on Monday fyi", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Up to $48 already after hours.

{"title": "Chewy DD - insight from a vet.", "selftext": "TL:DR ON THE BOTTOM\n\nHey everybody, this is my first time making a post like this. I'm a fairly new investor - I've been having a financial advisor do most of my investing and have been wanting to take a more active role in my investment - starting with my DD on Chewy so here goes. If it's not obvious enough, I'm not a financial advisors and take my post as the ramblings of a person with limited knowledge trying his best, so here goes. \n\n\n**Overview**\n\nChewy was an online retailer started in Florida. In 2017 chewy was acquired by PetSmart for 3.3 billion, and the ipo was offered in 2019. \nSales grew every year and by 2018 sales had reached 3.5 billion w/ 66% of sales being from automatic recurring shipments. Chewy reported its first loss in April 2019 selling of 270 million from its previous sales. \n**When Chewy first went public in June 2019 it's IPO offering was 22 per share. \n\nAs of 2019 the company was valued at 10.2 billion.** \n\n**My insight:**\n\nChewy has a few different areas of products to focus on that can be separated into 2 groups: basic consumer products (furniture, toys, food, etc), prescription products (medications, rx diets), and non-prescription medical products (examples - think things like supplements, medical grade shampoos, etc etc)\nI've separated it into 3 groups for a reason and I'll get to that soon. \n\nI've been a vet for the past few years, and working in the vet industry since 2012 as a vet tech until I graduated vet school in 2019. \nIn the last two years, I've worked at several vet clinics from super low income to super high income and in between. I write prescriptions every. freakin. day. It's half of my job. And historically, most vet clinics would have an in house pharmacy holding most of the needed medications and OTC medical products (shampoos, supplements, etc) and people would buy them from us. \n\nSomewhere between 2015-2019 people started asking more and more for prescriptions after realizing that they could get some of their medications at regular human pharmacies. This was a big hit to vet hospitals, but we rolled with it because we still had the pet specific prescriptions that human pharmacies didn't carry, and the OTC products. \n\nThen in 2019 - I started seeing a massive shift where we weren't able to sell OTC products anymore. It seemed like over the course of a year, it got significantly harder to sell things like medical grade shampoos, fish oil supplements, joint supplements - all things that didnt need a prescription, but previously you could only get at the vet. Chewy came in and undercut our profits by a massive amount. I'm super involved with the finances at my current clinic and saw that for us to match chewy's prices we would either have to sell for a minuscule gain or no gain at all - to the point where it ended up costing us money if you considered the man hours it took to manage inventory and the opportunity cost of losing shelf space to these products. \n\nNow in 2020 is where shit really started getting weird. All of a sudden, NOBODY was buying food from us either. SO MANY PEOPLE were already getting food from Chewy that once they needed a prescription food, there was no way in hell they were gonna drive down to the vet once a month to buy a bag. They would ask for a prescription and put it on autoship on Chewy. \n\nSo now chewy has OTC foods, supplements and products that used to be found only at the vet, and prescription foods. \n\n**BUT WAIT - THERES MORE.** \n\nIn 2020, I have literally AT LEAST 50% of my clients ask \"is this medication on chewy? is it cheaper?\" and my answer is always a resounding \"hell yeah it is\" (idgaf if my hospital doesnt sell the product as long as the pet gets its medications - doesn't change my life one bit. I literally dont make any more or less money with where you get your meds). \n\n**Let me give you an example, something I deal with EVERY. FREAKIN. DAY.** \n\nI have a dog come in w/ a real bad skin infection. I suspect its cause of environmental allergies, but we gotta treat the skin infection first. I want to prescribe marbofloxacin which is an amazing, albeit expensive antibiotic. These numbers listed below are real numbers based on my hospital in Phoenix, AZ. \n\n* Exam fee = $59\n* cone to keep from chewing = $12\n\nI prescribe marbofloxacin for the infection and apoquel for the allergies. I also prescribe a prescription strength shampoo to help clear the infection and then a sulfate free shampoo for maintenance after the infection is cleared. Lastly I recommend an omega-3 supplement for long term skin care. The client says fuck you I'm gonna get this on chewy. Listed below are prices all taken from chewy. \n\n* Marbofloxacin 50mg tablets - 1 tab every 24 hours for 14 days (30 lb dog dose) = $52\n* Douxo chlorhexidine shampoo to help clear the infection = $30 \n* Douxo calm shampoo for long term help of allergies = $34.50 \n* Apoquel 16mg tablets - 1/2 tab every 24 hours - 60 day supply = $73 dollars. \n* Welactin Omega 3 Supplement = $25 dollars\n\nSo do the math - **I spend an hour talking to this client for their dog and I make a measly $71.** \nFor my 1 hour of work - **chewy makes $214.50** - AND THEY DIDNT DO SHIT. And $130 of those chewy purchases will be long term and for life (the shampoo, apoquel, and fish oil supplement). \n\nThis is not a random scenario. This is something I deal with EVERY. DAY. I can give several more, literally. \n\nChewy is destroying vet hospital margins - and as a vet I think the reckoning has been a long time coming. Some vet hospitals will go out of  business, and some will adapt with the times. I personally think playing both sides is the best route and it's what I plan to do. \n\n**COMPETITORS:**\n\n1. Vet hospitals - I think that more forward thinking vet hospitals will adapt with the times. More and more vet hospitals are partnering with companies like VetsFirstChoice - online pharmacies that are connected with the hospital. These pharmacies allow me to put in the order for the patient's prescription products, the prices are significantly closer to Chewy's price, and it's way less effort on the client. The client now doesnt have to go on chewy.com -> order the medication -> wait for me to approve it -> wait for it to ship. Instead, I tell them we have this product in our online pharmacy and the price is the same as chewy. I order it for them and put in the directions, it automatically puts in their shipping info, and all the client has to do is check their email and pay. I think this will be a massive competitor due to convenience to the clients. Clients HATE having to wait for me to approve their medication requests from chewy (a process which will take at least 24 hours and clients are super entitled and throw a fit if they have to wait a day for anything). \n\n2. Walmart and Costco - Historically, these have been the largest competitors for pet medications. Over the last year, they have significantly beefed up the pet medications that they offer and their prices are ultra competitive with chewy. The benefits to these locations is clients can drive to a brick and mortar store and get their medications the same day. The biggest issue right now is low variety, they don't carry all of the pets needs (so clients will forsake the same day convenience in an effort to get everything from the same place), and currently I've been having a lot of issues with their customer service. The pharmacy techs will not know that those medications are not carried by walmart, and will tell the clients \"we dont have it\" when I know they do and clients get super pissed off by that obviously. \n\n3. Other pet medication suppliers - Things like heartlandvetsupply and 1-800-PetMeds. These have been around for YEARS and have never been able to make a dent, and now with otehr competition I don't think they will either. These are only found by very price savvy clients who don't mind extra effort to get meds and oftent it's not even much cheaper. \n\n**Price prediction:**\nI cant give you a price prediction - I'm not experience enough to know what the price SHOULD be. But my point is that I think Chewy is still going to grow and I think it's a definite buy. \n\n**TL:DR - Chewy is here to stay, and I think it's a definite long term buy**\n\nEDIT: Some really good points listed below.

I guess I am just looking for a more elegant short response.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": ">What is your response to people that say you got lucky with TSLA?\n\nI believe there is some element of luck, specifically: that factors outside of one's personal control contribute to success when success was never guaranteed.\n\nI got onboard as a shareholder in 2012, shortly before George Blankenship (the former Apple guy who was Tesla's VP of Retail at the time) went on stage at the Tesla factory to introduce Elon Musk and commence the delivery event for the first 6 Model S sedans.\n\nIt's difficult to understate the amount of uncertainty then.  I knew that buying shares was a vote of faith that everyone at Tesla, from the newest rookie on the assembly line, to Elon, would somehow manage to grow Tesla from a troubled maker of an electric sports Roadster, to a mass manufacturer of electric cars for the general market.  With no direct involvement in the company, and only slim connection to the Tesla owner community through participation in the Tesla Motors Club forum, I was counting on the success of others to increase the value the TSLA shares I owned.\n\nI feel very fortunate, or lucky, that the people at Tesla managed to accomplish something incredible over the past 8-9 years.  The company overcame incredible technical and logistical challenges, and did it in the face of relentless attacks from short sellers and constant disinformation about the company spread by the Mainstream Media.\n\nThe only, very minor role, I played in this battle was participation on Internet forums: debunking the lies and confronting bad actors here at Reddit and other communities.\n\nThere are people in the Tesla Shareholder and vehicle Owner's community who did far more than I did:  Many spent north of 100,000 $US on their first Roadsters and Model S/X, in addition to buying shares.  Many of these folks also spent countless hours talking to strangers about their Tesla cars, giving test rides, and promoting the benefits of Electric Vehicles.  The successful grassroots influence of the buyers who risked enormous sums of money on unproven vehicles from an unproven company, is another element of \"luck\" on the side of shareholders generally.  Model 3 and Y wouldn't have been possible without this movement of Early Adopter enthusiasts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I ask them at what point was I lucky? In 2017 when I took my future down payment in a house and put it in TSLA since I saw a bigger opportunity? When the stock went down in 2019 and I bought more shares? At the same time my Dad called me and told me to sell. Was I lucky that I didn’t sell?\n\nI think you can credibly claim this aspect of TSLA investing as skill.  It takes a good amount of research and reasoning to build the kind of conviction in a company so that one is prepared to hold shares during rough times.   It takes toughness to stick to one's course, especially when friends, family, and the Mainstream Media are screaming \"sell\" or even mocking shareholders.\n\nSo I never hesitate to say that yes, I was lucky that the people at Tesla were as great as they are, and made it happen.  But I also have a reasonably good track record in my decisions an investor, and I have the portfolio numbers to back that up.  **In sum, I credit my gains to some skill, and a lot of luck.  Both were necessary for the outcome.**\n\nAlso, sometimes it is better to be lucky than to be good.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ignore them ur rich while they remain poor, haven't happened to me yet cuz I haven't told anyone", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I say \"I believed that Tesla today would be the leader in electric vehicles by 3-5+ years, and beyond that their software expertise is unmatchable.

{"title": "$WWE. Can you smell what the stock is cookin?", "selftext": "Disclaimer: this is my first time actually writing out a DD. I don't know how to add pictures and charts and what not.\n\nThat aside, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHIN BROTHER\n\nOk, so, $WWE. World Wrestling Entertainment. The shit that nobody has watched since Stone Cold was beating the fuck out of Vince and Kurt Angle was drenching Vince's daughter with white, creamy milk.\n\nThe company is not doing great right now. COVID and wrestling do not mix at all. In 2019, WWE had 310 live shows with generally sold out crowds. In 2020, they had 42. Q4 earnings fell 26% from Q4 2019. Revenue was 238.2 million, EPS of 16 cents. Pretty well below expectations. Now, that shouldn't be all that shocking, nobody can go see the shows. So this is a rebound play, obviously.\n\nSo here's the good. Starting with Wrestlemania in March, WWE will begin having limited amounts of fans in attendance. By year end, I'd think there is a decent chance at full attendance events. Maybe, I don't know. \n\nHaving full houses soon is the obvious recovery angle, but even if houses aren't full, here's something to consider: WWE on the year as a whole increased operating income to 208 million. Thats a nearly 80% increase from 2019. The bulk of that comes from a rise in content fees. The point here is that even with limited ticket sales, WWE is smart about bringing in money.\n\nOne of the less obvious angles is the new deal with Peacock. The WWE network is a big source of revenue for WWE, but its now being completely migrated to Peacock Premium/Peacock ad free. WWE network has cost 9.99 per month forever and generally has a subscriber base of around 2 million. I don't know the details of what NBC Universal is paying for the WWE Network content (which includes every new PPV, every old PPV from WWE, ECW and WCW, and a huge catalog of original content), but what I do know is that as young as it is, Peacock already has more than 20 million subscribers. A lot of that may be free subscribers who won't get the WWE Network content, but assuming a quarter of them are paid subscribers and that 40% of WWE Network subscribers move to Peacock (very conservative), the WWE Network potential audience will reach 6 million people. And this is just a gut feeling, but if you're already paying for Peacock, why not tune in and catch a little bit of Wrestlemania? One of the undersold parts of this entire deal, I think anyway, is the potential for increased ad revenue. Now, Peacock offers an ad free subscription but WWE don't give a fuck. They have \"commercials\" during PPV events and advertise shit all through the show. Those advertisements could reach a lot more people now.\n\nNow, here's the big one that a lot of people don't know about if you don't follow wrestling: the Saudi Deal. WWE is has an agreement to do two shows per year in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis pay 50 million per show. The Saudi shows obviously didn't happen this year, and WWE was not paid for them, it simply extended the contract until shows can resume. The agreement is for ten years.\n\nNow, a hundred million dollars doesn't seem like a ton in the context of a publicly traded company, but considering that WWE raised its operating income, and I'm repeating myself, by nearly 80 percent to 208 million WITHOUT the expected 100 million from Saudi Arabia speaks pretty loudly.\n\nNow, despite the pandemic troubles, $WWE has been trading mostly flat since COVID. It's at 49.23 now, down about 6-7 percent from Thursday close. It hit a low directly after COVID restrictions started at 34.13, but rebounded 44 dollars within about a month. If I didn't mention it before, WWE revenue actually went up this year. A measly 1%, but given the obstacles it's faced I'd say thats actually impressive. \n\nThe timing of trying to play this one I really couldn't tell you. I think there's good room for growth in shares, but I wouldn't try playing weeklies on it. LEAPs I think could probably print you some money.\n\nI'm gonna go ahead and just sort of close this out now cause I'm dumb and I don't know what I'm doing. I much prefer stealing DD from the people here smarter than I am but fuck it. \n\nFuck ape gang nobody is gonna see this shit anyway.\n\nEdit: 10 1/21/22 65C", "id": "lef5cw", "created_utc": 1612671498.0, "score": 707, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 235, "comments": [{"body": "Don't let this DD distract you from the fact that in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.", "score": 837, "replies": [{"body": "Good God All Mighty", "score": 185, "replies": [{"body": "Stop the damn match!", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "Bah Gawd!

I started writing up my own DD for the first time ever, and was glad to have found this post in support of my thinking. Your call position is exactly the one I was planning to go for too. So let me tell you somethin' jabronie marks without a life that don't know it a work when you work a work and work yourself into a shoot:\n\n- There was recently a lot of insider buying within the company. https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2021/02/vince-mcmahon-and-other-wwe-executives-acquire-company-stock/\n\n>A new SEC filing by WWE shows that several executives purchased shares of Class A Common Stock back on Thursday, February 4.\n\n>The following transactions were made:\n\n>WWE Chairman & CEO Vince McMahon acquired 19,875 shares. He now has 89,496 shares\n\n>WWE President & Chief Revenue Officer Nick Khan acquired 15,310 shares. He now has 15,310 Class A Common Stock shares\n\n>WWE Chief Brand Officer Stephanie McMahon acquired 5,644 shares. She now has 82,042 shares\n\n>WWE Executive Vice President of Global Talent Strategy & Development Triple H acquired 5,644 shares. He now has 87,046 shares\n\n>WWE Executive Vice President of Operations Bradley Blum acquired 4,770 shares. He now has 29,687 shares\n\n>WWE Executive Producer & Chief of Global Television Distribution Kevin Dunn acquired 7,552 shares. He now has 81,411 shares of Class A Common Stock\n\n- The Peacock deal seems to be relatively under-appreciated for how many new viewers it could bring to the platform - including casual fans who want a low entry price, and current Peacock users who are now exposed to the product. \n\n- The recent success of the Superbowl helped lay the groundwork for a successful Wrestlemania this year in the same venue. I think it is going to be a big success for them. And no matter what happens, WWE will use all of this footage to brand their comeback from the corona virus.   \n\n- The UFC fight island events have already set precedent for hosting live events in the Middle East and what protocols to follow for a live broadcast production crew to get over there. So I think the Saudi shows will come back sooner rather than later.  \n\n- Q4 earnings are much better than I expected for a live event company during a pandemic. How much money they have made in the last year is astounding. A live event company *increased* some of their revenue during a global pandemic.  [Q4 report](https://corporate.wwe.com/investors/news/press-releases/2021/02-04-2021-211020204)\n\n>Full Year 2020 Highlights\n\n>WWE produced live, in-ring content without interruption throughout the year, demonstrating the Company’s ability to adapt to COVID-19 and unprecedented industry challenges\n\n>Revenue was $974.2 million, an increase of 1% or $13.8 million as the growth in core content rights fees was largely offset by the loss of ticket revenue and the absence of a large-scale international event\nOperating income was $208.6 million, an increase of 79% or $92.1 million, driven by the substantial rise in content rights fees, which have a high incremental margin\n\n>Adjusted OIBDA reached a record $286.2 million, an increase of 59% or $106.2 million\n\n>Digital video views were 38.0 billion, an increase of 10%, and hours consumed were 1.4 billion, an increase of 10%, across digital and social media platforms\n\n- AEW continues to grow, and this is nothing but good for the industry. Prior to the pandemic, it was very much a new golden age of wrestling feeling among the fan base. I think this is only going to continue as live events start to come back. \n\n- Reduction of house shows is smart and I don't see it as a negative. Lots of saved money for production costs, and there will continue to be televised events for all of their branded products:  RAW, Smackdown, NXT, NXT UK, etc. \n\n- The deal with FOX should not be forgotten either. WWE will continue to be featured in a prominent role on the largest television station in the United States. \n\nSo, for this and other reasons, I think WWE is a very good long-term play.

Plus this means keeping $36m on average extra coming in internationally, as the Network itself isn't shutting down. The WWE get to have their cake and eat it too here. They're getting a sweetheart deal for content that gets pumped in front of almost 20x as many eyeballs, including this year's Wrestlemania.\n\nThey also signed deals with a few indy promotions for rebroadcast on the Network, and if Vince & Co. have been planning this for a year plus, then there's no way that those freshly-signed deals with PROGRESS Wrestling, EVOLVE, ICW, wXw etc are going to not be factored in.\n\nPure speculation on this noob smoothbrain's part here, but Vince is 75 & Triple H has wanted to move in more of an NXT-style direction for a long time. If they do get to feature more of the smaller, more athletic guys a la Finn Balor & Ricochet once Vince does pass, hard to imagine people not enjoying the product a little more.

{"title": "HIMX DD", "selftext": "Disclaimer: Not a financial advisor. The below is my opinion. Do your own due diligence.\n\nThanks to  [u/yimiemie](https://www.reddit.com/user/yimiemie/) for making me aware of this stock back at $6.67. It mooned, as he projected.\n\n**What is Himax**\n\n “Himax Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: HIMX) is a fabless semiconductor solution provider dedicated to display imaging processing technologies. Himax is a worldwide market leader in display driver ICs and timing controllers used in TVs, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality (VR) devices and many other consumer electronics devices.

Himax has 3,009 patents granted and 561 patents pending approval worldwide as of December 31st, 2020. Himax has retained its position as the leading display imaging processing semiconductor solution provider to consumer electronics brands worldwide.” \n\n**Q4 ER**\n\nThey smashed it. Oddly, the company released pre ER Q4 data and everyone just ignored the great news because of reasons. Then Q4 came and their guidance added fuel to the hot numbers. \n\nFrom the ER press release:\n\n\" Q1 2021 Guidance: Revenue to increase by 5% to 10% sequentially, Gross Margin is expected to be 37% to 38%, IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.0 cents to 34.0 cents, and Non-IFRS profit per diluted ADS to be 30.1 cents to 34.1 cents.\"\n\nThey are telling you they'll moon. Telling you!\n\n**Semiconductor constraints, right? AMD, right?**\n\nAgain, from the horse's mouth:\n\n\"Have **succeeded in securing more capacity for 2021** as compared to the level of Q4 2020 when Company reached the recent peak quarterly shipment. Expect the **total capacity available to Company to increase quarter by quarter in 2021 and will continue efforts in acquiring more capacity**. Also **secured a meaningful capacity increase is automobile where the global shortage for semiconductor supply is overwhelming**.\"\n\nSo the company won't face the same constraints. Actually, they'll have more capacity.\n\n**Who are their customers**\n\nSamsung, LG, Lenovo, Huawei, Panasonic, Amazon, Sony, Mercedes, Jaguar, Asus, FOXCONN (come on), Google, and so many more.\n\n**Catalysts**\n\nDo you need more than their 2021 guidance? It's not secret the world is going EV. It's also no secret EV uses large displays instead of dinky nobs. Put 1 and 1 together.\n\n**Value**\n\n HIMX trades at a big discount to its industry at 1.5X forward 12-month sales vs. 5.1X. (from Zack's). This was when the stock was $9.90. Going by their math, to get to the industry average, the stock should have a price point of $33.66.\n\nYeah, there's still room.\n\n**Positions**\n\n5,000 shares\n\n100 03/19 $7 calls\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nHIMAX has given great guidance for 2021.

{"title": "GME, Mob Mentality, and the irresponsibility of Reddit hype.", "selftext": "\n\nThis isn't new, but the extremes have moved significantly.  Never before have I seen so many people lose so much out of sheer ignorance. \n\n**First and foremost I want to establish a fact: Short squeezes are not permanent.**\n\nI made a post a week ago telling everyone that short squeezes were not permanent.  GME opened at over $300 that day.  By Friday it would close at $63.  The mechanics of a short squeeze make this an inevitability.  They are, by definition, a short term event fueled by a sudden spike in demand, an unsustainable spike in demand driven by short covering.  That demand is necessarily going to end.  So, when you see a stock skyrocket from the 20s to over 300 in the matter of a week taking a long position is a less constructive use of your money than just burning cash for heat.\n\n**What this isn't: an \"I told you so\".**\n\n  I don't really care about that.  The red on the ledger is enough for people to eventually learn they were wrong.  Sure, they'll grovel about conspiracies for a bit, Janet Yellen called Vlad and told him to fuck the retail investors.  Hedge funds had a \"short ladder attack\" (for why that's not a rea, [see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lbib0x/the_myth_of_the_short_ladder_attack/) or [here](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1qdq0y5b79rzb/Wallstreetbets-Conspiracy-Theorists-Claim-a-Short-Ladder-Attack-Brought-Down-GameStop-Short-Sellers-Have-No-Idea-What-They-re-Talking-About).  They'll claim that the DTC intentionally stopped out retail order flow, despite retail orders being [net sells](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-29/reddit-traders-on-robinhood-are-on-both-sides-of-gamestop) for most of this endeavor.  Whatever, so you're going to see a lot of blame on anything but the fact that it's obviously not smart to go long at the top of a goddamn short squeeze.  This is the financial equivalent of doing 150MPH on a dirt road then blaming the tires, the loose gravel, the 2mph headwind, or interstellar radio waves altering your tire pressure when you crash.  No, you shouldn't have been doing 150MPH on a dirt road. \n\n_______\n\n**What this is: reflecting on the mob**\n\nThe shameful part of this is that in your foaming at the mouth rabid need to believe in this story you downvoted and ridiculed anyone who brought up risks, you attacked news agencies who called it irresponsible, you barraged threads and subreddits with hype posts.  For the first time in this sub's entire history we actually had to restrict posting\n\nI spoke with a reporter for a major publication working on this story, and he relayed that he recently interviewed a homeless man who bought three shares at $315 hoping to get himself out of poverty.  do you know how much $945 can do for a homeless person??  There's [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/la3bft/emotional_involvement_has_never_been_this_high/glob1kf/?context=3), where a disabled man on government support hopes to build a house with GME gains, again buying in near the top.  These are two examples, but there are hundreds if not thousands more.\n\n20 year old middle class kids blowing their beer money for the month on GME doesn't bother me.  who cares.  But these are people who cannot afford to  a few hundred dollars.  These are setbacks that could have equated to months worth of food, new wardrobes, necessary medical attention, etc. \n\nWe can never prevent those in poor financial situations from making poor decisions, but we can and absolutely should hold ourselves to the standard that we will at least not foster an environment that encourages poor decisions.  Many of you will lay blame elsewhere, but if you downvoted a post discussing risks of GME, accused someone of being a shill, encouraged someone to buy without first understanding their situation, etc. then you are culpable here.  \n\n------\n\n**You can, but should you?**\n\nMuch has been said about Reddit's ability to affect the outside world, and now just like with the Boston bombing everyone dove in head first without bothering to examine the risks, the drawbacks, the losses, and the ramifications for those who can't afford them.  \n\n**So, what did Reddit accomplish here?**\n\nUltimately, nothing aside from transferring a lot of retail wealth to institutional funds, again.  Sure, we can jerk off all day to Melvin's down month.  Perhaps they were hedged and they'll have a monster January, perhaps they were not.  But all of the other funds that took the long end of this early on, with managers that understood the aspects of short squeezes - they bailed out in the 200-300 range selling some to short and some to unwitting retail investors engaged in a fervent and ultimately useless battle against some imaginary foe.  \n\nThis wasn't social justice, it wasn't some populist uprising, and I don't care how much AOC, Ted Cruz, Mark Cuban, or the Pope wants to dogpile in on this.  There was nothing that happened here aside from a bunch of retail traders who didn't know what they were doing encouraging a whole lot of other retail investors who couldn't afford it to give away money they didn't have to institutions.  \n\nNext time y'all want to effect change just have a charity drive for UNICEF, or send money to a PAC focused on fighting inequality.

{"title": "Blatant Mistakes in Almost All of WSB's DD Over the Past Week", "selftext": "There have been quite a few posts over the past 2 weeks claiming some absurd things with very little proof. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost all of these posts make huge mistakes that debunk their whole argument. It's really unfortunate to read an essay of what the OP claims is DD and then realizing that the OP didn't spend 5 minutes making sure the claims he's making make sense or are accurate. So here is my attempt to debunk the big posts. I won't be spending too much time on any one post. Usually the posts have dozens of little mistakes and addressing them all will take hours. So I'll just cover the main problem of each.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Number 1: \"15 U.S.C.A. § 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)\"**\n\n\n\n\n>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the biggest thread about it but any post the mentions a \"short ladder attack\", \"ladder attack\", or \"short attack\" fall into this. \"Short ladder attacks\" and \"ladder attacks\" are NOT real and are not a term you see anywhere other than WSB and a single SeekingAlpha post by a crazy person. Short attacks are real but literally everyone on WSB is using the word incorrectly. It means something completely different from how it's being used.\n\n\n\n\nThis is what a short attack is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/11/27/short-activism-the-rise-in-anonymous-online-short-attacks/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust shorting a stock a lot is NOT a short attack. Actual examples of short attacks are Citron's \"research\" which scares investors into selling their stock. You can even view Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife as an attempted short attack since he was public about it which made investors fearful (temporarily). This has not occurred with GME recently. Obviously Citron was shorting it for a bit but the claims of short attacks have been much more recent than that. None of these claims talk about what was occurring weeks ago with Citron because when they say \"short attack\" they mean something completely different from the actual definition. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the trading strategy that people talk about when mentioning a \"short ladder attack\" or \"ladder attack\" does NOT even work. Think about for even a second. For this type of price manipulation to happen you need either do it to a stock with almost no volume or you need to trade enough to be responsible for almost all the volume. For the last 2 weeks the lowest daily volume for GME has been 40 million. With many days having a volume double that. So, the first possibility is out. The second possibility assumes that hedge fund are willing to trade BILLIONS of dollars of stock back and forth on a daily basis. That makes 0 sense but let's say that's true just for the argument. The goal of this supposed strategy is to artificially lower the price. Most hedge funds did not short GME and have no reason to allow this strategy to happen. If BILLIONS (or millions) of dollars of the stock are traded at artificially low then the rest of Wall Street would just buy these shares and make a profit. Thus, moving the price back to equilibrium. It is impossible to manipulate a stock price with this strategy if the volume is this big. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Number 2: \"GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze\"**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. ~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI've already explained what short attacks mean so this is a perfect example of a completely incorrect usage of the word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n~~Also, the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect since it depended on this to make any sense.~~\n\n\n\n\n\n~~I go more in depth about that here:~~\n~~https://ns.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmaru31/~~\n\n\n\n**EDIT #4 - 7PM: The second part of my argument is incorrect. I assumed the website worked in a way that it doesn't. I only realized this after tinkering a bunch. If you're interested in exactly why I was confused here's a link to a discussion I had which made me realize my mistake:** \n\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmixka6/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Number 3: \"Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.\"**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShort interest does not change when short-sellers hedge with options. Short interest is the number of shares sold short divided by the number of shares outstanding. Buying an options contract does not just change either part of that equation. Short-sellers can hedge with options and lessen/eliminate their losses from their shorts but this does not change short interest at all. The OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of finance. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Number 4: \"https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/\"**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, an incorrect understanding of short attacks. The SeekingAlpha post linked is a literal conspiracy theory as is the \"CounterfeitingStock\" website. There is a reason why it the ONLY website claiming what it does and does so without any proof. We do not know the author or their background/credentials. The thousands of academics that study markets have never talked about or written a paper about ANYTHING the website or the SeekingAlpha post claim. It was given 0 attention for years until WSB found it and now posts about it every 2 seconds without ever reading the contents of it. It is the equivalent of a 9/11 or JFK conspiracy website.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the OP claims that malicious naked shorting occurred. There is 0 evidence of this. Nobody that has a background in economics or finance believes this. Just the conspiracy theorists on Reddit. Does it naked shorting occur? I'm sure to some extent it does. Does it occur on a level that has an impact on markets? Nobody has evidence of that and there are a few papers on it. Did it occur here and was it malicious? No reason to believe that it occurred on a large scale or that it was malicious. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Number 5: \"How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding\"**\n\n\n\n>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/\n\n\n\n\nOf all the posts I've included this is the only one that has an OP that isn't making blatant mistakes off the bat. Not that there aren't mistakes. But, they're MUCH more forgivable than the others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOP's whole argument depends on the FINRA short volume numbers being correct. However, they are not and FINRA even warns for people not to use them to as a proxy for short interest. The numbers include any time a firm decides to sell its own shares so that it can fill a customer's sell order easier. This is relatively common so you can't use these numbers to show actual short positions. This is why the numbers are so off  compared to any third party estimate. I talk more about this problem here : https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/gmfoih1/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Number 6: \"GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers.\"**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leby2i/gme_float_177_apes_with_the_bloomberg_terminal/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that \"177% of float held\" means the same as \"177% short interest\". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here: \n\n\n\n\n>https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp#:~:text=There%20are%20instances%20where%20investors,from%20short%20selling%20between%20investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Number 7: \"S3 Partner's \"S3 SI% of Float\" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why\"**\n\n\n\n\n\n>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Number 8: \"It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers\"**\n\n\n\n\n>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/\n\n\n\n\nThe original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/gm66hgf/\n\n\n\n\n**There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.**\n\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmhufze/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs \"caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis\". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that \"greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**EDIT #2 - 3:45 PM: First piece of hatemail: https://i.imgur.com/3njZgkR.png.

I think they're shitty for many other reasons than just limiting GME buy orders. \n\nBut the difference between GME and AAPL is massive, particularly with regard to precisely the reason RH gave for why they limited buy orders - clearinghouse deposit requirements. \n\nI'm sure you're aware of this already, but just in case you missed it - during the T+2 clearing period, your broker is required to put up a certain amount of the value of the trade, in cash, to \"guarantee\" the trade. For a normal, non-GME levels of volatility stock like AAPL, this deposit requirement is ~1-3% of the trade value. So if you put in a trade to buy $10,000 worth of AAPL, your brokerage has to put up $100-$300 in cash until the trade clears. They can't use your cash to do it, they have to use their own cash for it. \n\nWhen the volatility of GME skyrocketed, so too did the deposit requirement. To the point where, when RH (and other brokers) restricted trading, the deposit requirement was 100% of the trade value. So for your $10k buy order of GME, they had to put up $10k of their own cash. But more importantly, they would ALSO be required to put up 100% of the trade value for their customers' SELL orders also. They didn't have the money to pay for both buy & sell orders from their customers, so to prevent getting into a situation where they ran out of deposit $ and couldn't clear ANY orders for their customers, so their customers are trying to sell their GME/other stocks but can't, they restricted buying so they'd have enough money to cover all the sell orders.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I don't know, they canceled my limit order at a really specific time.

Vlad finally did a decent job of explaining it at the end of the clubhouse interview with Elon Musk. Them restricting buy orders was part of their negotiation with the clearinghouse to reduce the deposit requirement to a level they could afford. \n\nBut beyond that, it wasn't just RH. There was like 7 different brokerages (who, to my understanding, all used the same 2 clearing houses). I had buy orders on RH, Webull and TDAmeritrade. None of them were filled. Webull is perhaps robinhood's biggest competitor, so if it were a case of robinhood being crooked and trying to help out their hedge fund cronies, Webull would've DOVE into the opportunity to not only steal RH's customers, but call out their bullshit and say \"they're lying. They're committing fraud. They're trying to help out their investors\", etc. instead, Webull's CEO got on national TV and said \"while we're happy to show people there are other options than Robinhood, what happened wasn't robinhood's fault.

Why they enforced a 100% deposit requirement on robinhood/other brokers selling GME ? The technical answer is because that's what their formula said it should be. They have a mathematical formula to determine the chances of being \"stuck with the bag\", and they require a deposit based on that chance. \n\nFor example, what they're worried about is if, say, 100,000 robinhood customers bought 10 shares each of GME at $350 on margin, that's $350 million. At the normal 1% deposit, robinhood deposits $3.5 million. Then, the next day, the stock drops to $10 and suddenly all those RH customers don't have the money to make their margin call, so robinhood doesn't have the money to pay the clearinghouse for the shares, and the broker from the other side is demanding their money from the clearinghouse - that's one of the main reasons they exist. To soak up the risk during the T+2 clearing period. An insurance, of sorts, that either side will get their money even if the other side defaults. Because without a clearinghouse, because the NYSE still enforces a T+2 clearing period, when you go to sell a stock to someone, you'd have to make sure they actually had the ability to pay you for those stocks. And there's no one to regulate/force them to actually go through with the trade if, say, they buy your stock at $350, and then during that clearing period the stock price drops to $50, they could (and in the past, did. Back when stocks were actual paper certificates) just tell you to fuck off, they're not paying you, and your only recourse would be to take them to court, which of course comes with it's own issues and puts a significant amount of risk on smaller traders who's trades aren't valuable enough to spend the money involved with suing someone, to enforce. \n\nOr similarly, if during that clearing period, the buyer's broker goes bankrupt. The seller's broker will still demand payment. \n\nOr potentially worse for the clearinghouse & arguably more likely, the stock gets halted/delisted by the exchange for a week because the exchange suspects significant manipulation on either end, right in the middle of the clearing period. Even though your RH account shows you have those shares in your account, you legally don't. They're still at the clearinghouse, and the clearinghouse is now stuck with those shares they can't transfer but they've already paid the seller's broker for, and that are now potentially worthless, or worth FAR less than they were before the halt, and a big legal battle ensues, etc. \n\nIn other words, clearinghouses act somewhat like an insurance company for the buyer & seller - although that's a pretty simplistic way of putting it - because the NYSE still enforces a Trading day + 2 days clearing requirement, for really no good reason. That's why so many companies are pushing for real-time clearing. We absolutely have the technology to do it now. This policy is a relic of a time when stocks were literal paper certificates, so the buyer & seller needed to physically meet up or mail the payment & the stock certificate to each other. Prior to the rule, there was an issue with sellers taking months to send the certificate, etc. so the rule was needed. But obviously that's not a problem anymore. \n\nBut since there's still that requirement, there's a lot of potential risk involved in the transaction of a trade. The clearinghouse soaks up that risk by guaranteeing both sides of the transaction. So they guarantee to the seller that if the buyer doesn't pay, the clearinghouse will pay them instead, and they guarantee to the buyer that if the seller doesn't turn over the stocks, they'll reimburse the buyer or give the buyer the shares. Then the clearinghouse will deal with the legal battle to be made whole. \n\nSo just like any other insurance company, as risk (IE: volatility) goes up, so does the insurance premium. In the case of a clearinghouse, as the risk/volatility goes up, so does the deposit requirement. So, when GME started to go \"supernova\", the volatility skyrocketed and in the clearinghouse's eyes, it was very likely that there would be brokerages that defaulted because of liquidity problems. So their raising the deposit requirement on GME to 100% was essentially them taking their ball and going home. Basically, them saying \"we think this stock is so risky, we aren't willing to insure any transactions of this stock. So if you want to sell this stock to your clients or on behalf of your clients, you have to pay for it up front\".", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Do you think there's a chance DTCC did this on purpose to stop the squeeze?\n\nConsidering the many symptoms of naked shorting in the stock and that DTCC would have to be complicit in that?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "That AAPL volume was likely institutional volume unlike GME volume being retail volume on a broker that was already cash strapped to begin with due to their business model.

As if you degenerates needed reasons but F it here we go.\n\n1. The covid-so-work-from-home BS is going to unleash the biggest transformation in Real Estate ever seen in this country. As more people exit high priced SF, NY, Seattle, etc since their work no longer requires them to be physically there, many renters in those cities now find themselves in a position to be BUYERS in another city. That means a huge net gain of buyers as people from $3000/month RENT to $1600/month MORTAGE payment, most of them aged 25-35\n2. Netflix, Tesla, Amazon should all have taught you this by now: the stocks that do well in the *medium* term are no longer the ones with the best financial metrics but the ones that are most popular among millenials and Gen Z. The ones people see on a daily basis and names get thrown around in Zoom meetings.

ZERO fking growth over the same period. Yeah Zillow site is ranked higher but that's cause boomers are still alive, the company is worth 5x more than RDFN and still has a lot of legacy crap. Do you want to invest in a company whose main growth comes from internet and sees their traffic growing ZERO over unprecedented stay at home months? I don't.\n4. Valuation: can you believe the single biggest growth story of 2021 is ONLY priced at $8 billion right now?! Holy fuking shizzle, Batman! That's right. The website your wife keeps sending you home listings you can't afford after the GME losses is only worth $8 billion. That's like 2x Gamestops right now.

{"title": "MAKES WSB GREAT AGAIN WITH SOME $WKHS DD", "selftext": "Buckle up retards cuz this autist is about to take you on a ride to tendy town. Inb4 you all check my post history and bitch about all my WKHS posts, ya no fucking shit I’m gonna post about a stock I love. Inb4 Inb4 you tinfoil hat wearing GME/AMC fucks attack me, last time I checked there’s more than two stocks on the exchanges. Anyways here goes,\n\nWorkhorse group is a Loveland, Ohio EV manufacturer. 100% American Made (insert American Eagle boner gif) and completely electric for all you who value the environment or whatever. I’m sure you’ve all come across it at some point especially when I was the top trending stock for like a week at the end of June/July. As many of you might now, this shitshow of a government we have here in the good ol’ USA is looking to upgrade their self combusting USPS fleet via a NGDV (Next Generation Delivery Vehicle) bidding process for a contract to the tune of approximately 8 billion. When all is said and done, including maintenance and upkeep, the contract in the span of a decade or more is about 20b. This NGDV contract is the “betting” portion of this stock and despite what all the retarded naysayers claim, there is a fuck ton more to WKHS besides this contract. This is the cherry on top so I’m starting top down with this masterpiece. \n\nCurrently, there are three remaining bids from companies involved in this NGDV selection process. Karsan (a Turkish company), Ford/Oshkosh (joint venture), and our beloved WKHS. \n\nKarsan - I can’t see this winning even a fraction of a percent of the contract due to it not being American. Not because it’s a bad company but if you check the requirements for the companies, they snuck in a clause that mandated 75% American made parts to be selected. Also, Biden, for the better part of his campaign and to this day has been proclaiming that he will be bringing American manufacturing to the forefront again and we will be buying American (something he and Trump miraculously had in common). For this reason, Karsan is seen as a non-factor. \n\nFord/Oshkosh - The only realistic challenger to WKHS and only bear case being made against it. Undoubtedly, Ford is as American as it gets. But even more undoubtedly, they are shitty and unreliable as fuck. Millions of recalls on Ford vehicles in the past and present. Another big issue with this is that Biden was “zero-emission”. The prototype submitted for the proposal was a hybrid and not fully EV. For this reason, I think Ford receives a portion of this contract no greater than 25%. Another reason I think they’ll get only a minor stake in this is because their prototype does indeed actually fare better in rural routes where charging stations just aren’t all that practical or possible. \n\nThe whole NGDV process has been going on for about 6 years and there’s no surprise that this inefficient government has been unable to wrap the process up at this point and then Covid took over. Yes there have been delays to the contract award as recently as October 2020. In a letter/memo addressed to the USPS Board of Governors, they were urged to not further delay this process as with the current degradation of the existing fleet, doing so would harm the project altogether and further complicate the process of removing these shitboxes that have been around since ‘87. With Covid being the last excuse to delay, and the vaccine now being rolled out, I DO NOT foresee another stalling of the process. \n\nAnother reason WKHS is my favorite in this race is that DeJoy’s current philosophy on the USPS is to cut costs and to have the entity become for cost efficient. In case you haven’t noticed, ICE vehicles are much more costly to run and maintain that a 100% EV vehicle. Fewer parts means fewer problems and much less maintenance and repair costs. Also, in their recent financial statements, the USPS had requested a 600% increase in their infrastructure spending. I don’t see too many post offices crumbling to the ground, so this can only mean they’re gearing up to install a metric fuck ton of charging stations. By going fully EV, billions will be saved over time by the post office, an entity that’s currently burning cash like it’s their fucking job. \n\nTHE LAST DELAY IN THE NGDV SLATES THE CONTRACT TO BE AWARDED FISCAL 2021 Q2 WHICH MEANS JANUARY-MARCH 2021. \n\nEnough about the contract though, let’s talk other aspects. WKHS is currently partnered with UPS in testing by out their fleet and also more importantly their drone delivery capabilities. WKHS currently owns the patents to vehicle borne drone launching technology. This isn’t talked about enough. Many people think the future of this company hinges on that shitshow of a contract when in reality the really exciting part is this drone tech. It would be extremely helpful and useful in efficient package delivery especially when there’s a whole fleet management system capabilities that the company offers. As the autonomous tech and drones sector begin to grow exponentially, WKHS has a head start on it (the commercial delivery aspect). \n\nInstitutional holdings lies at almost 50%. The big boys and big girls (BAE Cathie Wood) are in on the company and they are in heavy. My wife Cathie must be seeing something in the future of this company if she’s grown her holding to over 2.2m shares and she’s not gonna throw some money into a gamble on a fucking government contract. \n\nMany claim that production is an issue but this is more a scare tactic than an actual issue. Sister company Lordstown Motors (Ticker: Ride) is led by former WKHS CEO. They have offered their factory, which has the capability to pump out about 600k vehicles a year, if WKHS needs it. Important to note that WKHS has a 10% stake in Lordstown and will receive royalties on the first 100k Endurance EV pickup trucks that Lordstown sells. So there’s another form of revenue the company has going for it. \n\nIt’s a growth stock with a lot of potential and it’s logistically gearing up to grow. Received 200m financing from an institutional Investor during the late summer/early fall, and it entered into an agreement with Hitachi, to be assured in the logistics of the company. Hitachi is a pretty serious company to be partnered with unless you plan on slinging out vehicles. Most recently, a 6,320 truck order came in from Pritchard which totals around 250m give or take a few bucks. This is all while IKEA a company that aims to go fully electric by 2025 is testing out a fleet of WKHS C1000 vehicles. \n\nConnect the fucking dots and join the ride fellow autists. I’ve been long WKHS since January of 2020 and there’s plenty of room to run. High risk high reward with this growth stock but that’s why we’re all here right? \n\nPositions - 1000 shares, 11x $60c 2/12 (USPS BOG meeting Tuesday so these are scratch off lottos basically), 5x $60c 2/19 (see previous calls), 11x 45c 4/16. \n\nLet’s ride this horse to tendy town fellas 🤝\n\nEdit: I’m a retard blah blah blah THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I JUST LOVE THIS STOCK  blah blah blah\n\nEDIT 2 - WKHS vehicles are being showcased at the super bowl as Pritchard is using WKHS trucks to take people to and from the super bowl and various surrounding locations. Essentially they are marketing themselves by providing shuttle services.\n\nEdit 3 - WKHS is currently at about 30% short sold so a contract announcement in their favor will easily rocket this to 100+ as shorts scramble to cover. It sneaky made the list of highly shorted stocks.\n\nEdit 4 - 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 (FOR THE VISUAL LEARNING RETARDS)\n\nEdit 5 - TLDR: WKHS is 100% American made EV Last Mile Delivery Vehicle. Has Patents pending for its drone delivery tech. Frontrunner for USPS 8.2b+ Government Fleet Contract (NGDV Contract). Heavy institutional ownership including BAE Cathie Wood. 30% Short Float to be squeezed on contract announcement.", "id": "letekr", "created_utc": 1612725866.0, "score": 355, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 199, "comments": [{"body": "This is good shit.", "score": 67, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!
