{"title": "My Options Overview / Guide Part 1 of 2 (V 2.5)", "selftext": "Hello options people.  With all the new blood in the options community, I thought it was worthwhile to update my Options guide and re-post it.  It has significantly more content than last time.  This should be really useful for newer traders, I hope it helps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI spent a huge amount of time learning about options and tried to distill my knowledge down into a helpful guide.  This should especially be useful for newbies and growing options traders.\n\nWhile I feel I’m a successful trader, I'm not a guru and my advice is not gospel.  This will hopefully be a good starting point, teach you a lot, improve on your existing skills (if you already know the basics), and make you a better trader.  I plan to keep typing up more info from my notebook, expanding this guide, and posting it every couple months.  \n\nAny feedback or addition requests are appreciated\n\n*Per requests, I added details of good and bad trades I made.  Some painful lessons learned are now included.  I also tried to organize this better as it got longer.*\n\nThis guide has gotten so big it is too long for one reddit post, so now it’s two parts.  I’ll cross-link each post so you can easily jump between.\n\nPart 1 - Beginner, training, links, and concepts focused.\n\nPart 2 - Advanced beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced strategies.\n\n# Here's what I tell options beginners:\n\nI would strongly recommend buying a beginner's options book and read it cover to cover.

This is imperative since it's attrition when buying and a payout when selling. [ https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta](https://www.optionseducation.org/advancedconcepts/theta)\n* DTE: Days till expiration/expiry\n* Understand delta in general and how delta changes with ITM and OTM options.\n* Understand all the Greeks at a high level, as you get better understand them well.  The Greeks: [https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/options-introduction/option-greeks/)\n* Options positions with respect to price:\n   * ITM: In the money; strike is below stock value.\n   * ATM: At the money; strike is just at or above the stock value, often very highly traded.  Can be very effective with moderate - long term expiry.  If the stock moves favorably, an ATM option’s delta will rapidly increase.\n   * NTM: Near the money; strike is above the stock value, but fairly close.  Slightly unofficial term.\n   * OTM: Out of the money; price is at least a few strikes from the current stock price.  I would say 10-30% over stock price.\n   * Very OTM: Not a real definition, this is essentially a lottery ticket.  Cheap, but almost certain to expire worthless unless there is explosive movement.\n* IV, IV crush, and how IV affects pricing.  In general, you want to sell when IV is high and buy when the IV is low.  Increasing  IV is good for held calls/puts.  IV drop or crush is generally good for sellers.\n* Selling options can be quite beneficial.  Once you have a good general understanding, lookup r/thetagang .  Kamikaze Cash has good YouTube videos on most theta strategies (linked above).  I personally believe selling options (especially cash secured) is much safer and can consistently make you profits.  Θ Gang 4 life.\n* FOMO and how to avoid chasing a dangerous trend.  DO NOT CHASE FROM FOMO!\n* What intrinsic and extrinsic value are.  Know how they are affected by being exercised/assigned and how theta affects them.\n* Understand that some WSB recommendations are straight up high-risk gambling and factor in that information accordingly.  Be careful with Meme stocks and the survivor-ship bias on YOLO plays.  However, I love the sub and think it’s hilarious.  It has a lot of valuable information / DD if you are comfortable with the “colorful” language.  It’s also great if you like rocket ship emojis.\n\n## Basics / Mechanics\n\n* Understand the 4 \"main\" option types.  Buying or selling a call and buying or selling a put.  Spreads and more complex multi-legged option strategies are based off these in some way (see below)\n* You can sell calls with 100 shares of stock or if you own an underlying longer term option; see LEAPS and PMCCs later.  Selling calls naked is incredibly risky and often requires Level 4 (very advanced) permissions and usually a lot of capital.  I will literally never sell calls naked since I don't want to ruin my life and end up living in a dumpster eating saltine crackers.\n* Puts can be sold/written cash covered (cash secured), which means you have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares.  Your broker will put this money on hold until the trade is closed.  Puts can be sold \"naked\" using Margin and Level 3 (with most brokers).  Your broker will hold a percentage of cost of 100 shares (often 30-40%, 100% on meme stocks) allowing you to sell more puts.  This increases your available capital/power as well as increasing risk.\n\n# General Tips and Ideas:\n\n* Don't EVER leave (short) spreads open on expiration day, close them.  (more details below)\n* Start off trading very small.  Slowly build up over weeks / months.  You need to get accustomed to a fifty dollar swing a day, then a few hundred, then a few thousand.  You need to ensure you don't get emotional (see below).  I started trading options with 5k, then 25k, 50k, and later over 100k.  I added my own funds over time and used my gains to build my account.  Don’t go all in immediately, that’s dangerous and unwise.\n* Especially as you build up the amount of money you have invested, keep it diversified among several stocks.\n   * Don't go all in on one thing, ever.  Be able to take a hit from one stock and not mortally wound your portfolio.\n   * A company may be doing great, then there's a major product issue out of nowhere.  If you are overexposed in one stock this can really hurt you.\n   * I had to roll options I sold that were about to expire completely worthless because FDX's CEO changed and the stock took a hard dip.\n* Don't trade emotionally.  If you realize you are emotionally trading for vengeance, you should probably exit the trade and cool off for several days with that stock.  Same if you get caught up in a wave of hysteria.\n* Planning Trades:\n   * Have a plan for every trade, ideally with entries / exits that are specific values, ranges, or a set condition.  This helps remove emotions.  This is super important for strong movements and high volatility (see later). \n   * Hedge fund guy on YouTube stated that trading should be 90% planning and 10% execution.  I agree with this more and more.\n   * My rough trading outline:\n      * Make a list of potentially viable stocks.\n      * Perform research.\n      * Set up a watchlist of stocks you want to trade.\n      * Have entry and exit plans for your trades.  Setting stock price alerts for entries is my personal preference.\n      * Market opens / event occurs.  React according to your plan.\n      * Based on new information, adjust, open, or close positions accordingly.\n* Use an options profit calculator from your broker or an online one before entering a \"new\" trade, especially a complex multi legged trade:[ https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)/\n* “Rolling” an option:  \n Closing your existing option and opening a similar one at a different strike and/or expiration.\n   * Rolling a call “Up” would be selling a call you own and buying a cheaper call at a higher strike.\n   * Rolling a put “Down and out” closes your original one and buying or selling one at a lower strike at a longer expiry.\n   * Better broker interfaces have a literal “Roll” button.  I know E-trade does.  You can manually do it by selecting relevant contract legs.\n* If you have a losing trade, re-evaluate it.  If your initial assumption is definitely incorrect, close it.  Don't stay in losing trades forever and lose the entire value of the option over stubbornness.  If you re-evaluate and you think your assumption was right, hold, potentially consider adding another cheaper option (or buy another call / put).  Rolling out sold options can help here.\n* Don't try to day trade, especially with options.  It's statistically unlikely to be profitable.  Day-trading with options introduces extra liquidity risks and is dangerous, especially with spreads.\n* Try not to over-trade, you'll likely mis-time the market over time.  When I get emotional I over trade, then lose additional money on wash sales.  If you scale your entries into positions it should help alleviate your desire to exit positions when they turn badly against you.  Whenever I buy calls I do it at larger increments after W almost made me lose my hair; luckily it eventually came back.\n* NEVER enter a position on a stock you have no idea about, especially when you read about it online or heard about it from some rando.\n* At market open options contracts are often volatile and inflated.  Buying during this time can be more expensive.  Options are usually cheaper mid-day, I read somewhere 2-3PM is cheapest.  I’ve had success around 12-1PM EST after prices settle.\n* Try wheeling on cheaper stocks once you get all fundamentals down.\n* When selling puts if you are very bullish consider \"doubling down\"; note this is higher risk.  Use the credit from your put sale to buy shares or a cheap call.  This can be roughly inversed with puts, except I wouldn't ever recommend shorting shares.\n* Learn from your mistakes.  You can’t go back in time and beating yourself up (to a point) is useless.  Make a physical &/or mental note of it so you don’t do it again.  If you don’t learn from it, then beat yourself up so you won’t do it again.\n* If you have friends that like to trade, I find it helpful to discuss strategies and planned plays.  I talk openly with my close friends about my current holdings and planned trades, it helps keep me accountable.  If I get a wide-eyed look, I might be doing something excessively risky or stupid.  I’ve over-leveraged myself in calls twice and I knew I shouldn’t have done it both times.  When I tell my friends what I did and I’m embarrassed, it exemplifies the face that I shouldn’t have done it in the first place.  You will also get ideas for new strategies or plays from them.  It’s good to stay versatile and use multiple strategies when appropriate.  \n Beware of group-think/echo chambers. \n* I recommend NEVER telling someone what to buy/sell and when.  I’ll tell people MY plays or what I like and why, but I will not encourage them to emulate what I do.  Depending on the audience, I’ll tell them my exact positions along with my exit and entrance strategy.  With closer friends I’ll offer my thoughts on their trades (if asked).  If my friend is doing something really risky (one of my friends does some scary stuff) I may ask them if they want my advice, and provide it, especially if they overlooked a risk/event.  I will not encourage someone to execute/enter a trade since it has a high potential for hurt feelings or animosity all around.\n* Don’t fall in love with a stock.  \n Just because something made you money before and you have high confidence in it doesn’t mean it will keep performing.  I joke that FDX betrayed me when it started dipping and losing me money.  I was over-confident of its bounce-back and sold too many puts too quickly.  I’m in several losing trades because of it.  However, I will keep good stocks in my roster/tracking list or try different strategies or re-enter trades when they change their behavior.\n* As you start to both buy and sell options and get more experience in general, you'll start seeing the two sides to every trade.  You will likely start adjusting your strategies or trying new trades out because of this.  Things will likely click one day.  Most/all the Greeks and options concepts will become almost second nature.  For me this was when I could build an Iron Condor from scratch, which was a watershed moment involving a good understanding of many strategies.\n* Understand Liquidity and volume.\n   * Trading in low volume, low open interest contracts results in wide bid/ask spreads and difficulty having your contracts filled.  Look at all the data for a contract, not just the strike and price.\n   * Monthly Expiration dates typically have better liquidity.\n   * Multi-legged trades (Common examples are 2-legged vertical spreads or 4-legged iron condors) have more difficulty being filled, especially on bad brokers like Robin Hood.  Having very liquid options for all legs is extremely helpful in obtaining timely and well-priced fills, which maximize your potential profits.\n* Time in market vs timing the market:\n   * It is extremely difficult to time the market perfectly.  If you wait for the perfect opportunity forever, history has proven you will miss out on gains.  Keeping all your money out of the market has proven to be ineffective.  Now if there is something serious happening with a stock/the market (like say a new pandemic), don’t go all in.  I recommend entering incrementally at dips.  If the stock has huge upside potential it may never go down, so it might make sense to partially enter at the current price.\n   * IMO selling puts is a great strategy to get into a stock you like, or at least make money off it.  I think buying stock in lots of 100 is usually for suckers.  Selling an ATM or ITM put (assuming the math works out) on a stock you were going to buy and hold is ALMOST free money.\n   * I recommend keeping some cash available regardless. If you have a very large account or expect a downturn, hedging with indexes like QQQ, SPY, or VIX or calls/puts may be wise.\n* Every trade can't be a winner.  You will take some losses, you must get used to it.  I don’t like having a realized loss of 1K or more on any trade.  However, this will happen, especially with larger accounts.\n   * As long as you win more often and beat the S&P that year I consider it okay.  I’m kind of aggressive, so I consider 20%+ annually good.  30%+ annually is great.  40%+ and I’m dancing.  After trading options I am almost baffled by my old belief that 5% annual returns (mostly from dividend ETFs) was “good”.  That’s nothing to me now since I’m willing to take risks.  \nNote: While lots of people danced in 2020, realize that’s an insane Bull Run year and is atypical. \n   * Adhere to your own risk tolerance and never over-extend yourself, especially with margin use.  Don’t make huge gambles leaving you uncomfortable.  Only gamble with money you are willing to lose.\n   * My personal strategy is to make safer gains for the year and then enter slightly riskier strategies using those gains.  I can be slightly-moderately more aggressive and compound my gains.  For me I often sell puts to make money, then when I see a big opportunity I’ll sell a put and buy an OTM or moderately ITM call.\n* Understand it’s not safe to try and get rich overnight.  However, once you hit big “steps” things may start to snowball.  You can enter more positions and take more risks if you choose to.\n   * For me this when I hit 50k, then 100k.  I was able to balance low and moderate risk positions to more significantly grow my account.  I’ll even do a high risk thing now and again because my gains can absorb it (assuming I have them).\n   * I can’t wait to get to 250K, then 500K.  I know it’ll take quite a long time, but I am confident I’ll eventually be able to have 500K and (hopefully) 1M in my non-401k trading account with gains and additions from my job.  I can only imagine how “dangerous” I will be with that kind of capital.\n* If you missed \"the next big thing\" like AAPL, TSLA, or the time machine I’m building in my basement.  Don't get upset, learn from it.  Adapt and become a better trader for next time.\n   * Figure out why a company was so promising, before they mooned.  Determine how you would have traded differently in hindsight.  Apply those lessons to the next company you believe has long term growth prospects.\n   * For me that's putting in 1-2.5k towards shares and/or buying LEAPS on it.  Depending on my bullishness I may buy “cheap”, fairly far OTM calls.  The far OTM options are sort of lottery tickets.  If I'm right the (relatively) low cost will have explosive profits; if I'm wrong, they didn't cost that much so it's a calculated loss I’m willing to accept.  For more serious bets I’ll buy ITM LEAPS to run PMCCs on.  I also like to buy 1-2K in my 401k for very long-term plays.\n* The stock market hates uncertainty, it seems to crave the status quo.  A shakeup can potentially tank a stock, even if it's nothing.  With shares you can wait it out, but this can be problematic for options.  If you see volatile/uncertain times ahead (politics, disease, manufacturing, earnings, etc.), you might want to reduce your overall portfolio risks or hedge.\n* Brokers:\n   * Find a good broker.  This article outlines good brokers that didn’t restrict trading during the GameStop squeeze craziness.  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder\\_whether\\_you\\_own\\_gme\\_or\\_not\\_change\\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbzkbi/reminder_whether_you_own_gme_or_not_change_your/)\n   * I have personally used the following and here are my ratings:  \nE-Trade >> Fidelity >> Ally >> Robin Hood.\n      * The >> denotes they are significantly better.  Fidelity is reliable, but their interface isn’t good.  The app / site both work, but they are clumsy, “weak”, and outdated.  It’s been described as “boomer-friendly” by a Fidelity employee on Reddit.  Fidelity does have a “pro” type desktop software, it is geared toward more professional traders.\n      * Ally Invest has bad tools, is generally trash, and is unreliable, don’t use it.\n      * RH is free, but has bad fills.  It is super unreliable and has had huge stock buying restrictions in stocks and quantities for multiple days.  I don’t trade in their app anymore, but I do like using their wish lists for quick chart glances at daily activity.\n   * I really like E-Trade (and you’re about to hear why).\n      * E-trade has Power E-Trade on both desktop and mobile.  These are fantastic tools for options trading.\n      * The mobile app destroys (most/all) other mobile apps in terms of organization, data available, and effectiveness.  I think it’s phenomenal.  I can throw together a 4-legged trade in seconds.  I can easily see all Greeks, intrinsic/extrinsic value, volume, and every other trade parameter I need through their option chain screen by swiping left / right.\n      * *Note, I have not tried Schwab, just watched YouTube videos of their app.  From watching those, Power E trade looks better.*\n      * The desktop version also has a trade analyzer (extensive P/L calculator) and a strategy seeker.  The strategy tool gives you suggested trades based on your expected movement direction, expiry date, and amount invested.  Both are well done and powerful.\n      * These tools are so intuitive and powerful that I would have a hard time going to another broker, even if it’s slightly cheaper.  Even if E-Trade drops the ball again, I might keep my main account with them and set up my secondary / backup account with Schwab; that’s how much I like Power E-trade.\n      * **Noteworthy downsides.**  They restricted GME buying for \\~2 hours during market hours (\\~2-4PM) and all after hours on Thursday 1/28/21 when the GME craziness was happening.  This was the only restriction on buying I’m aware of.  \nThe following week there was a day where I couldn’t execute a trade for an hour at open.  This was during very high volume, but still no excuse.  These issues made me very angry with them.  These were the first big problems I’ve had in several months of active trading through them.\n      * My biggest annoyance.  Power e trade sometimes shows spreads incorrectly arranged on mobile.  On desktop you can adjust / fix the spread groups with the “Custom Groups” button, but mobile sometimes mixes two spreads or condors with the same symbol and expiry.  This shows you different things than what you set up, but doesn't actually change what you own.  For example I could open a 170/175 put credit spread and sell a 180 put.  It might get confused on mobile and say 170/180 spread and 175 put.\n      * They are usually very reliable, but they are not perfect.  I’m staying with them unless they have more major issues.\n      * Their options fees go from $.65 to .50 a contract once you trade enough, 30 trades / quarter I think.  They’ll give you further discounts if you trade a lot for months, then call to ask for an option fee reduction/negotiation.\n      * If you decide to open an E-trade account and put enough money in, there is a new account incentive.  It scales up depending on your contribution.  If you feel like it, you can use my referral link.  PM me for it if you’re interested.\n   * Rock Solid Brokers:\n      * Fidelity: Mediocre-bad tools, very reliable.\n      * Vanguard: Expensive.  Reliable.\n      * Schwab: OK prices.  Second hand, tools look okay-good.  Very good reputation and reliable.  If I ever decide to switch / diversify from E-trade, I’m trying them.\n* Don’t over leverage yourself, understand your own risk tolerance.  Don’t use up all your cash or margin buying power.  Leave funds available to react if the market turns against you.  If you use margin maintenance, ensure you have a cushion to prevent a potentially costly margin call.\n\n# Profit Retention / Loss Mitigation\n\n* If selling options, it is a viable strategy to close early after a large gain with many DTE left until expiry.  See TT videos / strategies on this.\n* Don't hold options through earnings unless you literally want to gamble.  I like playing on earnings run ups, but that can be risky.\n* If you hold options through earnings, IV crush will happen immediately afterwards, devaluing the option.  However, if the option is profitable enough, IV crush won’t matter, which will still make money for a call buyer.  A sold put sufficiently far OTM will benefit from IV crush, even if the stock dips after slightly bad or lukewarm earnings.\n* Don't throw good money after bad.  Don't gamble on a recovery if your assumption appears to be wrong or the market is flat out tanking.  If you are wrong and still believe in the company, wait twice as long as your original plan (wait for your 2nd entry point vs 1st) before adding to your position.\n* Consider using stop losses to lock-in profits on rides up or sometimes use them to prevent losses.  Note, stops can be easily triggered in volatile options.  Now when I'm up a lot on calls (especially around earnings or large momentum run-ups) I always set stop losses.  I have been burned too many times.  \n In December 2020 I didn't set a SL on several thousand dollars of FDX calls I was already up on and I \"lost\" \\~$5K of unrealized gains.   If you're up big, don't get too greedy.\n* A possible strategy if a stock is on a tear and you have multiple options open:  \nClose some positions (I prefer to do this incrementally if the stock has momentum), but leave 1+ open in case the stock goes into outer space/the floor.  Next, set a stop loss with a little buffer below its current movement / range so it doesn't get hit unless the stock falls hard.  Finally, watch the stock closely and if it keeps rising, keep moving the stop loss up in little bits incrementally.  This will let you keep more profits on a hot streak, but give some protection and secure more gains.  It will also help eliminate FOMO if a stock exceeds your expectations.\n* Have rules when to roll out, down & out, or up & out.  I like TT’s roll at break even or at 1x loss and to always roll for a credit (or for me a very minor cost).  Obviously these rules need some monitoring.  Know your stocks, the news, and technicals so you don’t jump the gun.  \n   * If you roll early for a credit and you’re right, it’s not the end of the world.  You’ll just need to hold longer, which will obviously tie up capital.  Sometimes it’s better to tie up some money (especially if you aren’t paying interest) than eating a huge loss.\n   * Rolling too late can be worse though.  I currently have a very underwater FDX put I sold that is over 2x loss, rolling it does almost nothing unless you want to pay a debit or extend it extremely far out.\n* On huge options gains, **I strongly recommend taking profits by rolling up/down** or incrementally sell your contracts at several different prices (this is why having multiple contracts is nice).\n   * Rolling up involves selling your initial call, then using a fraction of your proceeds to buy a cheaper, further OTM call with the same expiry; puts are inverse this.  When rolling up I like to ensure the new option’s cost is 15-40% of my realized gains.  I’ll buy a more or less expensive replacement option based on my conviction in the stock and predicted movements.  You can also roll up and out to get a further expiry and strike.\n   * This is monumentally important if you are playing with incredibly high rising stocks or during a short squeeze.\n   * **Sad story time:**  \nI completely screwed up when I forgot to roll up, twice, during the GME gamma/short squeeze.  I didn’t take my own advice; I didn’t have a real exit or transition plan and I got emotional.  It all happened so fast and I was at work; the insanity of the run up and subsequent gamma squeeze caught me off guard.  I should’ve clocked out and thought through the situation for 15-30 minutes to form an impromptu plan, then executed trade(s).  My moderate risk tolerance coupled with my desire to take profits took over.  When the stock partially cratered after a run up, I sold to retain gains.  In the heat of the moment I thought the squeeze was squoze and it was going to plummet into the ground and I wasn’t being rational.\n      * On 1x 4K call I would’ve made an additional 15-25K if I rolled up to a cheaper contract with some of my profits.\n      * I know I missed out on significantly more with a 2nd call I had.  Depending when I rolled it, it would likely have been an additional 25-50k in profits.\n   * I talked about learning from your mistakes above.  **This mistake is branded into my brain due to the massive gains I missed out on** **by not rolling up****.**  I’m furious with myself as I write this 1 week after the GME gamma squeeze, I’m a planner and I didn’t plan.  If anything I own is significantly up ever again, I’m rolling up (or at least setting a stop loss).  If necessary, I’ll roll up a trade multiple times to keep extracting profits.\n   * Learn from my mistake so you don’t miss out on gains too.  I strongly recommend rolling up when you are up big on a call / roll down when you are up big on a put.  This enables you to take profits, stay in the game, and keep extracting more gains.\n* If you trade a lot of options, talk to your broker about a discount.  I was getting the standard $.50/contract with E-Trade, but I traded over 300 contracts a quarter and was able to get the fee reduced by over $.10 by just asking.  I am now doing more spreads and condors, so once my volume gets very high, I’ll ask again.\n* If you have a broker that isn’t great and you want to switch, leverage your current trading fees to the new broker.  Tell them you’ll move over $### thousand if they beat your current options trading fee per contract.\n\n# Trade Planning & Position Management Tips\n\n* As you gain experience, start monitoring what kind of Delta, OTM, DTE, etc. you are most profitable with.  Use it in your future trades.  You'll often see the tasty trade 30-45DTE .3 Delta strategy for selling.\n* Having rough rules to close trades early can be a smart strategy.\n   * A common rule is if you hit 50% max profit in 1/3 of the contract length, close it early.\n   * A slightly more aggressive rule, that I roughly adhere to, is if you hit 66% max profit in \\~1/3 the contract length, close it early.\n   * If you sell “naked” / on margin it may make sense to keep huge winners open, especially with sold/written puts.  I sometimes keep these big winners open with only 10-20% of the value left.  I let theta slowly bleed them dry to get extra money.  I’m using my (free) naked put margin maintenance to get extra profits.  If other trades start to go bad, I’ll close these big winners to free up capital.\n* Before entering a trade, look at rough technicals like resistances and supports to consider your relevant strikes as well as entry/exit points.  Look at upcoming earnings & dividend dates as well as stock/market news.\n* Consider staggering strikes and expirations for safety and diversity; it’s nice to avoid assignment on 3 puts at once because you used the same strike for all 3.\n* Incrementally enter positions on large rises/falls.  One of my favorite strategies is to buy dips after over reactions.  By doing this slowly in large price \"steps\" it helps combat FOMO and helps you avoid getting slaughtered.\n   * This will also help you avoid \"chasing a falling knife\".  It also ties into having a plan.\n   * I set alerts at several predetermined prices and I REALLY try not to enter new trades unless I hit my preset points.  It makes me less emotional and usually more effective.\n* Don't buy far expiration options with poor liquidity for shorter term plays.  I bought 1x GME 1-year+ LEAPS call before the 2021 short squeeze.  That was stupid, I should've bought 2-3x 60-120 day calls to have better liquidity.  I also paper-handed it and missed out on my lambo.\n* If selling options, consider rolling (for a credit) to avoid assignment when it makes sense / meets your plan.  Rolling closer to expiration can be a valid strategy to get theta on your side.  On the flip side, if the stock moons or plummets it could've been better to roll before it got crazy deep ITM.  See rolling “rules” above.\n* Covered Calls:\n   * If a stock has a large movement range, I think it can be worthwhile to wait to open a CC after the last one is closed/expires.  I have been more successful waiting for another opportunity vs. opening one immediately on the Monday after the second the last one expires.\n   * Consider selling covered calls at all time highs/peaks.  If you sell a CC and the stock dips significantly, and you think it’s temporary, you can buy to close your CC for a quick profit, then reopen it later.\n   * If you own Meme stocks, selling covered calls runs the risk of missing out on large gains.  On these stocks I typically only sell them further OTM than I normally would or not at all.  If I do sell CC on a Meme stock I try to ensure I have 25-100 other shares that won’t be called away.\n* Dead cat bounce.\n   * After a huge price drop sometimes a stock will pop or partially recover temporarily.\n   * It could be a reversal or a false flag.  Be aware of this so you can react accordingly.\n   * [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/101700.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/00/101700.asp)\n* Finding stocks:\n   * u/swaggymedia publishes great lists of stocks at various price points with high and low IVs.  See r/SwaggyStocks, the new subreddit.\n   * Here are a few examples:\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kx6oh6/iv\\_report\\_high\\_iv\\_tickers\\_with\\_share\\_price\\_under/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kx6oh6/iv_report_high_iv_tickers_with_share_price_under/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l3yzo0/weekend\\_iv\\_report\\_tickers\\_with\\_low\\_iv\\_and\\_cheaper/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l3yzo0/weekend_iv_report_tickers_with_low_iv_and_cheaper/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/l3yxn5/weekend\\_iv\\_report\\_stocks\\_with\\_high\\_iv\\_and\\_more/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/l3yxn5/weekend_iv_report_stocks_with_high_iv_and_more/)\n      * [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kz5soi/iv\\_report\\_stocks\\_with\\_high\\_iv\\_and\\_more\\_expensive/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/kz5soi/iv_report_stocks_with_high_iv_and_more_expensive/)\n   * I recommend building a large roster of stocks you want to trade with and check it at least daily.  My “wheel candidate” list is 26 “solid” stocks plus 20-25 I’m lukewarm about.  I want it to be at 100-200.\n   * With a large stock candidate list it makes it easy to find targets to buy dips on and exploit opportunities.  I like selling puts at dips with some downside protection.\n* Below is another reddit user's more aggressive theta gang variant.  I think this has merits, I'm trying it myself with a few stocks.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k\\_to\\_475k\\_in\\_4\\_months\\_using\\_theta\\_wsb\\_techniques/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/lgt314/55k_to_475k_in_4_months_using_theta_wsb_techniques/)\n\n* Buying calls or puts with more DTE than you need is a very smart strategy IMO.\n   * Buying extra time becomes progressively cheaper after \\~1 month and keeps theta from hurting you as much.  See LEAPS later.\n   * I started off buying 30-45 DTE calls, then moved to 45-60 DTE.\n   * Now I am tinkering with only buying calls/puts that have 90-120+ DTE (monthlies).  I plan to close these with at least 30-45 DTE left since theta starts to really depreciate your contracts at 45 days, especially at 30 days.  If I’m playing an event or a specific date, I ensure I have at least 30 days past that with whatever I purchase.\n   * Buying longer dated contracts, while more capital “efficient”, is more costly.  I couldn’t do this when I had a small account.  There is also more downside risk; since the contract is more valuable, you can lose more.  I try to only have 1-3 calls open at a time in one stock so if I’m wrong I don’t get destroyed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nI’m not a financial advisor, I’m not an engineer.

They could drop 30-50% during a crash, but they won’t flatline.\n* Which brings me to my next point: be prepared to ride it out. It could take 3-5 years to recover from a crash. I am preparing by taking out a good portion of my gains (e.g my cost-basis value) from certain stocks so that if they crash, I’m not in tears and can also take the opportunity to buy more while they’re low.\n* Be invested in mutual funds with low-to-medium risk ratings. They are most likely to recover as well.\n\nDon’t spend your life being afraid of a crash. You should always be careful and circumspect in the stock market, and if you are, periodic crashes are just another business day (albeit a bad one). Don’t be greedy, walk away when you’ve made decent profits on your riskiest ventures, and always remain calm and don’t panic-sell.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!

Drew then deliberately corrects Elon and makes his statement \"in the future, all versions of our vehicles will at least do bidirectional power flow for the purposes of energy market participation.\"\n\nThere are two categories of use case to allow power to flow from your car into your house or grid. Either: \n\n1. Use your car's power to power your house; and\n2. Use your car's battery to provide power to the grid, i.e. as an arbitrage device.\n\nOption 1 is not possible unless you have either a Powerwall or a cutoff switch. Option 2 is possible if the car's onboard charger is updated to allow bidirectional power flow, that is all that needs to change to allow the car to be a node in the distributed energy grid. \n\nOption 2 is what makes the most sense. Tesla is building distributed battery systems in many countries. The long term goal for their energy business is to have a distributed set of generation (solar), storage (grid batteries, powerwall and vehicles) and consumption devices (vehicles and HVAC) and control all of these to maximise efficiency. Allowing the cars to pull power from the grid and also upload power makes sense as it allows the system to reach a more optimal outcome.

{"title": "NOK NOK, WHOSE THERE?", "selftext": "**Current Status Report:**\n\n* Nokia has benefited largely from the ban of Huawei and ZTE due to them being targeted by Trump during his anti-China campaign. Nokia has since netted around 40%-50% of these outstanding contracts due to the absence of these prior competitors.\n\n* Nokia fumbled early entry into the 5G space because of a bloated and expensive product line. This is now all changing and ReefShark (management's answer to this mistake) is now taking off. ReefShark is a new chipset and subsequent product line that promises better margins for the company. 75% rollout by EOY 2021. 100% by EOY 2022.\n\n* The new CEO as of last August is Pekka Lundmark. This man has demonstrated incredible financial responsibility and a very disciplined leadership modality. He is significantly more competent than the last CEO, Rajeev Suri, meaning the company's future is probably stable for now. Unfortunately, Pekka is also an old dog, you should not expect him to make any exciting or ambitious plays anytime soon.\n\n* There is some price erosion in the North American market, meaning that there are currently bidding wars going on here - leading to reduced margins for Nokia. In addition, the U.S. dollar is also dropping compared to the Euro, thanks to free money from the federal reserve - leading to reduced top line figures for Nokia. Every other market has remained relatively stable.\n\n**The Bull Case:**\n\n* ReefShark is mostly coming online by EOY 2021. This has potential to kickstart a significant bull run for Nokia OYJ.\n\n* Nokia OYJ is a profitable company, a rare thing in this economy of overinflated tech stocks and overly optimistic COVID recovery plays.\n\n* Nokia OYJ has a solid balance sheet that consists of more than $10-$12 billion dollars of liquid assets (e.i. cash/short term investments). Half the company's net worth is basically in cash.\n\n* Nokia OYJ (NOK) 23.67B is significantly undervalued compared to relevant competitors such as Cisco Systems (CSCO) 199.61B and Ericsson Systems (ERIC) 41.94B despite having a sizable market share in one of the world's most important tech markets - 5G communications is set to skyrocket due to higher demand via IOT and next-gen technologies such as self-driving cars.\n\n* Nokia OYJ is worth only about 60% of Ericsson Systems despite having nearly identical balance sheets and income statements. Ericsson indeed has a lead on Nokia in terms of profitability margins and secured contracts - but the importance of both is overstated without context. Increased profits of a few hundred million when you are dealing with tens of billions in overall revenue is an absolute joke. As for the additional 5G deals Ericsson has, Ericsson is agreeing to them at a loss - in hopes that they will be a loss leader in order to secure and lock down clients to their tech stack. Again, maybe, but ever since the banning of Huawei and ZTE, clients have insisted on more and more flexibility in terms of cloud service alternatives - thereby negating any \"early bird\" advantage.\n\n* Nokia OYJ is important politically, financially, and strategically to Europe and North American interests. You can expect help from politicians in the future.\n\n* Nokia OYJ is already at the very bottom. At $4 per share, this company is trading as if it were in the same industry as hot dog vendors in terms of cash flow and price to earnings. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that at $3 - $3.5 per share, Nokia had to take actions to prevent itself from being bought outright in a hostile takeover bid.\n\n* Nokia OYJ has one of the highest number of outstanding option contracts in the entire market. This has the potential to lead to some very funky market-driven events such as the company hitting $9.75 per share on January 27th 2021.\n\n* Prominent hedge funds were holding major positions in this stock at $4 per share at the end of December. Have they sold already during last week's high? Who knows? But what it tells us was that even without that weird peak on January 27th, hedge funds felt that $4 per share was an absolute bargain.\n\n**The Bear Case:**\n\n* Nokia is in a highly competitive market with low margins. Even with Huawei and ZTE out of the picture, Samsung poses a significant risk as the Korean conglomerate can easily undercut Nokia's margins. Samsung unlikely to be met with the same restrictions due to South Korea's diplomatic ties with North America and Europe.\n\n* Nokia is late to the game of 5G with their earlier fumble under the mired leadership of Rajeev Suri. Why bet on the underdog when you can bet on the incumbent that is Ericsson?\n\n* By investing in Nokia, you might be losing out on better investment opportunities that have been severely discounted due to COVID-19. \n\n**Summary Recommendations:**\n\n**If you are bullish)** Buy more and hold. You currently own a safe haven asset that is unlikely to be affected by further market downturns related to COVID-19. Unemployment is still sky high and the rest of the market hasn't realized the consequences of this yet.\n\n**If you are bearish)** Hold until at least March or April. Recent sell off is the market reacting irrationally to Pekka Lundmark saying the forbidden words of \"price erosion\" and \"difficult year\" in the same sentence - even though the fault of this is largely due to American companies engaging in bidding wars and the U.S. dollar shorting itself into the ground. All in all the earnings report was still good and I expect a rebound.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** \n\nNOK is a relatively safe investment, not necessarily a good one. If you find a better opportunity in another stock while waiting for NOK to moon - don't be afraid to take it.

Today Tesla is barely profitable (trading in regulatory credits that is) and no longer revolutionary. \n\nThis year already you will see EVs better than Tesla’s being released and sold. By the end of 2022, Tesla’s market share among all EVs will drop below 50% in the US; (it’s already behind VW group’s EV marketshare in Europe). By 2030, Tesla’s worldwide marketshare will be below 10% of all EVs. \n\nWhy is Tesla worth $800 billion today or will be worth $1 trillion in March? The only reason is a cult following. Tesla’s valuation should be about $40 billion to $60 billion, but given their CEO’s charisma, perhaps $80 billion would be reasonable. The downside of $TSLA is at least 90%.\n\nThere’s no way in hell for any non-hype company to be at the trillion dollar valuation while turning in $721 million in annual net profit. This net profit was only possible thanks to selling regulatory carbon credits because without the $1.58 billion in proceeds from the sale of regulatory carbon credits in 2020, Tesla would show a net loss for 2020. So, a car company that can’t figure out how to make a profit making cars for 10 years now and facing fierce competition starting now and getting only fiercer with each upcoming year is valued at over $800 billion.

{"title": "I sharpened my crayon set for this NOK dd....I hope you enjoy", "selftext": "I was in NOK before the craziness of a couple weeks ago. I still am, and have been accumulating under $5 pretty heavily. Average is right around $4.50.\n\nDisclaimer: I own 2500 shares of NOK, and 65 Jan 2022 $10C.\n\nI am fully aware that P/E valuation isn't the best method of valuation for a stock, but I did some rough math to set a PT for myself. I'm very long on this stock, and I don't foresee myself selling a majority of my position anytime in the life cycle of 5G networks. Anyway, in my math, I realized a wild undervaluation IMO on NOK.\n\n***P/E Breakdown*** *(these numbers are a bit old as I did the math earlier this week, and my first attempt to post this got removed for some reason)*\n\nCurrently NOK has a P/E ratio of just under 14 (it got down to just above 13 at it's low on Thursday)\n\n* The most applicable comparator stock we can us is ERIC which has a PE of 20.29\n* The telecom provider industry as a whole has a PE of 21.26\n* Trailing EPS is .31, and this is where it gets a bit interesting. Their previous ER yielded an EPS of .17. The previous CEO instilled a methodology to increase profitability and free cash flow, and the current CEO has been pursuing that relentlessly. These efforts were yielding results even in the midst of COVID.\n* If you forecast out a moderate EPS of .17 for the next 3 quarters and keep the PE the same. The stock price would be... **$9.52.** I'm aware that they may not achieve this amount of EPS per ER going forward, but I think that is a decent (perhaps conservative) baseline to operate off of.\n* One gap I see that the market is missing on the entire industry is giving it a very conservative outlook. As 5G networks mature and transition into 6G and beyond, the opportunities for steady cash flow and increasing margins and revenue will abound in this industry. Going forward, I feel that a ratio of 25 applied to the industry NOK operates in would be appropriate (and again...perhaps conservative). For reference, Apple's current PE is 37 and AMD's is 82. Not good comparators, but everyone knows these companies and what they do, so they can draw their own conclusion.\n* If we were to apply the conservative .17 EPS x 4 and the new industry wide PE to NOK stock, we would yield a PT of... **$17**\n\n**2 Things that could change the equation in a hurry**\n\n**#1 - Reinstate Dividends**\n\nIn their previous ER, they said they would give an update on their dividend reinstatement by March 18th (when they hold their annual \"Capital Markets Day\" event). I'm on WSB, so you know I'm a betting man, and if there were a place to wager if they were or were not going to reinstate dividends, I would be all in on that they are going to reinstate. They stopped dividends to pump up R&D into 5G (and probably 6G) and to increase FCF.\n\nIf they do reinstate dividends, just on a cursory glance of an ETF database, there is close to $2.5B AUM in EU Dividend focused ETFs. I would assume a large number of these ETFs would pick up NOK, and if they are market cap weighed, they will pick it up heftily. I'm sure there are a number of US based ETFs with a dividend focus that would add NOK as well.\n\nThis accumulation would definitely kick start a movement in the price, and could change the way boomers/HFs view NOK.\n\n**#2 - Infrastructure Stimulus**\n\nThere is no doubt that some massive stimulus packages in the EU/US will be passed at some point this year...on top of the $1.9T that is currently in process. Both the Biden administration and the ECB chair (Christine Lagarde) are big fans of infrastructure stimulus. 5G is literally mentioned on the Biden website...[https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)\n\nIn the time since trying to post this and now, this article came out about Biden/China/infrastructure. Remember, when Biden says infrastructure, 5G is a big part of that.\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56036245](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56036245)\n\nIn a time where such data intensive processes are on the forefront of the economy (transition to \"alternative currencies\", autonomous cars, etc.) there will be a desire to invest heavily into networks that can meet those data demands. There has been no signal that the US is going to pivot away from the Huawei ban, giving NOK and other companies a chance to pick up huge swaths of market share...\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/biden-commerce-pick-sees-no-reason-to-pull-huawei-from-blacklist)\n\nThat should give you comfort that NOK's ability to compete and be an \"oligopoly-esque\" player in mobile networks going forward in the US.

But what is it? Why have they seen an 800%+ increase in three months? Where are they headed? Allow me to explain.\n\n**About Them**\n\nMicroVision, Inc. (MVIS) makes futuristic-as-fuck laser technology that's used in self driving cars and augmented reality headsets. This already sets them apart from a major competitors like Velodyne (VLDR), which focuses solely on LiDAR for self driving cars.\n\nSumit Sharma, the CEO, was head of operations at Google's Project GLASS and has worked to map hardware development at Motorola, also worked at Jawbone.[ Source](https://www.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/brooklinerunner?challengeId=AQG9ZZGeKX9VWgAAAXec1fLslGoC7UaTFwCgduU3ajjeIw_gMofulYMLCHKxKwfCHu5xLOoDIeF-4bS-FWdNj62xNtLfDVTmBQ&submissionId=a9151f8a-df64-6316-dda0-24150063286d)\n\nWhy have they been increasing 800% in three months while similar companies in the same sector see a fraction of that gain?\n\n**Because their tech is much more advanced than the competition, and they were (are) criminally undervalued.**\n\nThe reason they're so undervalued is because the first thing hedge funds see when they research a potential investment is the balance sheet, and on paper MVIS looks like shit. (Low assets, high liabilities) Even I saw the movement back in December, did some research, and was like \"Wtf is this? I need to get puts\" But once you do research into their product, who their customers are, and the future of the industry that they are involved in, you see that MicroVision is a turnaround story similar to that of Plug Power; both are 90's futuristic companies that people got way too excited about in 2000, have struggled to make it to 2020, but now are about to finally have their heyday. And they got a $13 million [equity facility (loan) in December](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/29/2151422/0/en/MicroVision-Announces-13-Million-At-the-Market-Equity-Facility.html) that greatly improved their balance sheet, making them appeal to institutions, and bringing [Vanguard](https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/vanguard-group) and [Blackrock to invest](https://fintel.io/so/us/mvis/blackrock) in MVIS days later. I actually had a hedge fund manager tell me that MVIS was doomed to run out of cash in Q1 2020, but if they secured funds then they would have a lot of potential. I go over that in the comments.\n\n[ MVIS \\(left\\) vs PLUG \\(right\\) 1990's until present ](https://preview.redd.it/803a6oge9dh61.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=d889603b5691f3b12126c5807db5752804598a63)\n\nAnyways, what is this \"much more advanced\" technology? I'll just let this chart do the talking:\n\n[ The MicroVision Consumer LIDAR being compared here isn't even their model designed for self-driving cars, that will be coming in April.](https://preview.redd.it/c3zdfgwh9dh61.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae8c428f74846c15e06c16c0bbdf270a9fcb9bf8)\n\nThe resolution it can take as input/second, the points per second, is key when it comes to how clearly the LiDAR sensor can see, how accurately it can identify what it is seeing, and how quickly it can react.\n\nThat chart is from 2 years ago and *still* the best resolution Velodyne can provide today is only 4,800,000 pps in their most advanced model, the \"[Alpha Prime](https://velodynelidar.com/downloads/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)\"\n\n>3D Lidar Data Points Generated 2- Single Return Mode: \\~ 2,400,000 points per second- Dual Return Mode: \\~ 4,800,000 points per second.\n\nVLDR has not publicly announced a price for their Alpha Prime yet, but historically their top of the line devices cost[ $75,000](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020). I have seen unsourced numbers of the Alpha Prime[ costing $100,000.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiDAR/comments/emp7h4/where_to_get_a_used_velodyne_alpha_prime_vls128/fdqguty?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) That was last year, will probably be brought down to be more reasonable for automakers to purchase. They did [announce a $500 model](https://www.forbes.com/sites/samabuelsamid/2020/11/13/velodyne-announces-500-velarray-h800-lidar-production-in-2021/?sh=4a37f2246e8f) called the Velarray H800 in November, but the only thing they said about its pps resolution is that its [\"outstanding\"](https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-unveils-breakthrough-solid-state-lidar-sensor/)... lol.\n\nAs for Luminar (LAZR),[ they will launch the new model \"Iris\" in 2022, which will cost about $1,000:](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/luminar-eyes-production-vehicles-with-100m-round-and-new-iris-lidar-platform/) (the[ same price](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html) as MicroVision's device to be revealed in April). It will also only operate at 10Hz. This is similar to playing a racing game at 10FPS. If you know anything about video games, you know that **this is unplayable.**\n\n>Iris will cost less than $1,000 per unit for production vehicles seeking serious autonomy, and for $500 you can get a more limited version for more limited purposes like driver assistance, or ADAS. Luminar says Iris is 'slated to launch commercially on production vehicles beginning in 2022,' but that doesn't mean necessarily that it's shipping to customers right now. The company is negotiating more than a billion dollars in contracts at present, a representative told me, and 2022 would be the earliest that vehicles with Iris could be made available.\n\nA[ lengthy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/k7bzrk/race_to_mass_production_luminar_lazr_vs/) has been make comparing Luminar's resolutions with MicroVision's, which was not easy to calculate because Luminar said their resolution was \"300dpi/spdeg\", a statistic that is incomprehensible for shareholders because its not the common specification of millions (3D) points per second. Here's the math, I sum it all up at the bottom:\n\n>Luminar's Hydra claims resolution of \"**up to** 200 points per square degree\" and a FOV of 120° x 30° (degrees). (and 300 points for Iris, the one coming in 2022.)  \n>  \n>However, the vertical FOV can be configured from 1° to 30° , which likely explains the use of \"up to\" in the resolution numbers. Generally, as FOV expands, resolution shrinks, assuming a constant pixel stream. This is why Alex Kipman made such a big deal about MSFT maintaining resolution in Hololens 2(YT links aren't allowed apparently) while expanding FOV because it required more pixels to do so.  \n>  \n>Specifically, regarding Luminar, is 200 points per square degree available when FOV is at the maximum 120° x 30°? Or is it available only at a lesser FOV such as, for example, 120° x 5°? The use of \"up to\" suggests the latter.  \n>  \n>Even assuming 200 points per square degree at 120° x 30° is available, which is not conceded given the stated \"up to\", that would yield a total resolution of 720,000 points. MVIS claims capacity in excess of 20M points per second. At a resolution of 720,000 points, Luminar would require a frame rate of 27.7 Hz to equal 20M points per second. Luminar's specs do not suggest that its technology is capable of such a high frame rate at this resolution. This is not surprising given it does not use MEMS micromirrors but something more \"mechanical\" including, as per a recent patent,[ spindles and a drive belt](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10310058B1/en?oq=US10310058B1)  \n>  \n>(1) At video time **19:56**, Luminar compares the specs of its Iris product to industry requirements. The graphic reveals that Luminar's 2022 production lidar, **Iris**, will support resolution of **300 points per square degree at 10 Hz**. Assuming that resolution applies to the entire FOV of 120 x 30 degrees and not just a portion of the FOV, that would imply a points per second value of 120 x 30 x 300 x 10 Hz = **10.8M points per second**. If the 300 points/ sq. deg applies only to a smaller FOV, the points per second figure would be proportionally smaller. Microvision claims **20M points per second** for its current MEMS lidar. The company also advises that its technology is capable of more than 20M points/sec.\n\nTLDR: The best case scenario for Luminar is that their 2022 model will have 10.8 million pps, but in reality its probably much lower than that because of FOV configurations, careful wording by press releases, and Hz limitations. Additional Interesting insight on Luminar and their tech lagging behind is in the comments, this post is long enough already.\n\nAgain the [MicroVision Consumer LIDAR](http://www.microvision.com/consumer-lidar/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) ([specifications](http://www.microvision.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MEMS-Based-3D-LiDAR-Engine-Product-Brief.pdf?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)) being used for comparison here isn't even their model designed for self-driving cars. Their device specialized for cars, the \"1st gen Long Range LiDAR (LRL) Sensor\",[ will be coming in April](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microvision-inc-announces-progress-automotive-210500945.html).\n\n>We expect our 1st generation LRL Sensor to have range of at least 250 meters and the highest resolution at range of any lidar with 340 vertical lines up to 250 meters, 568 vertical lines up to 120 meters and 944 vertical lines up to 60 meters. This **equates** **to** 520 points per square degree.\n\n(For those who read the math on LAZR, notice he doesn't say **up to**)\n\nIt testing is successful, the 1st Generation LRL Sensor will be able to calculate velocity of objects relative to itself, and be able to be used in Level 3 and Level 4 self-driving applications\n\n>Our LRL Sensor will also output velocity of moving objects relative to an ego vehicle across our dynamic field of view in real-time 30 Hz sensor output. This sensor would accelerate development of Level 3 (L3) autonomous safety and Level 4 (L4) autonomous driving features that are important to potential customers and interested parties.\n\nWhat is Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4c8831l9dh61.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=0652984c72da3159b53a4fc4058c9d9e33cc6b05\n\nLevel 1 is feet off, level 2 is hands off, level 3 is eyes off, level 4 is mind off, and level 5 is full passenger (you can sit in the back). So basically, they have that 2045 technology **today**, while everyone else is trying to play catch-up. How is it so advanced?

I hired him for $150 and he said he runs a hedge fund in India and owned 95% percent of it, I asked him how much capital he works with, and he said... a big number, idk if he wants me to disclose that. More than DFV has. This is apparently his website https://ruskinfelix.com, and if you scroll down it says\n\nABOUT RUSKIN FELIX\n\nWith 8+ years of overall experience, he has experience into Business Consulting, Strategy, Financial Audits (Internal and External), Taxation, Market research. He also has a good network of VCs and Angel Investors through his work in Investment banking and Private Equity Space. He is a Chartered Management Accountant, Qualified Member with CIMA (UK), and AICPA (US). He is also a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), Certified Stock market Professional (NCMP L-5). Currently working as the Founder of Ngen-ko Investments, he has also been working in other businesses in Media, Fashion and Web Development Industries.\n\nAnd then below that it says “book with fiverr” and it brings you to his fiverr profile, so seems legit. And if it seems weird that a hedge fund would use Fiverr, he did say he has Fiverr stock, so he’s probably trying to give it exposure. From the beginning, after he saw the equity and liabilities, he wouldn't budge on his bear stance. He kept saying they will fail and run out of money in Q1 2021, even with recent momentum. The funny thing is though, that after enough arguing, even he eventually agreed that if they can make it past Q1 2021, and pass their April tests, then it has lots of potential and could be a greatly profitable company with good fundamentals. He says so in his report, I’ll link it below. (So I guess get in before the hedge funds find out about this shit) The other analyst, Tuna, was hired for $80 and he was interested in the tech and the possibilities of the devices made by MicroVision from the start, especially after I mentioned their use in the Hololens 2 and IVAS systems ordered by the military. Then once he saw the superiority of their technology over every other competitor, he was like ok this is a great opportunity. This scenario with two analysts with opposing viewpoints was actually ideal, because you want to hear both sides of the story, one bear take and one bull take, and there I was in a zoom call with two professionals arguing with each other over who was right. As they were writing the reports for the \\~4 hours that I hired them for, I told them to research all the aspects of the company using this post, since it linked to a ton of DD on MVIS. [https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/lbeila/the\\_best\\_of\\_rmvis\\_meta\\_thread\\_v2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/lbeila/the_best_of_rmvis_meta_thread_v2/) Ruskin kinda skimmed it a little bit but then basically spent 90% of the four hours going through MVIS’s financial reports found here: [https://microvision.gcs-web.com/financial-information/quarterly-results](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/financial-information/quarterly-results) Of course, when you are 100% focused on the past of a company that has 90% of its value in the future, you will not see what others see, and you won’t have a positive view of the company. Like, he was literally going through every report all the way back to 2017, that’s how he found the IVAS money trail, even r/MVIS hasn’t found that yet. He had some bad takes, and missed some news that hasn’t showed up in financial reports yet that could have drastically changed his view. For example, he says \n\nWith a very high burn rate and unsustainable operations, the company is looking at going out of cash reserves by Q1 2021 (as mentioned in their Quarterly Report (as on 30 Sept 2020)\n\nBut he missed the news that on December they secured extra funding. EVEN WITH him having missed the equity facility they got, he gave them a 50% chance of having the price of $25 by March, that really says something.\n\nTuna however, he listened and went through all the links I gave him, and he found projects that MVIS has worked on in the past for the military (additional hints that IVAS was made by MVIS), found good news videos, found a good ABC video on IVAS, the volkswagen thing, and he was the one with the idea about the airbags. He also found some nice images to include and much more. He actually understood the position this company would be in a year’s time, and didn’t seemed overly worried about an already fixed balance sheet. I can understand where Ruskin is coming from to an extend, he tried explaining why he was such a pessimist: he was managing other people’s money, so you have to only pick the stocks with the best fundamentals to avoid risk. Ironically though, he said he would short it, which is literally infinite risk lmao. I don’t know if he will still short it after seeing the loan MVIS was given, maybe he’ll even buy some.\n\nThis is the google document where we all wrote our analysis: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PI16z7eR\\_Brj5kjYNltlMyxSRps6mAOlIDHrKGWRFeo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PI16z7eR_Brj5kjYNltlMyxSRps6mAOlIDHrKGWRFeo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see from the contents of the original and what we have here, I had to basically delete everything he wrote and use what Tuna wrote as a starting point, didn't help that Ruskin's english wasn't the best.", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Microvision was not named but is the demonstrable leader in MEMS based lidar by a large margin. **Russell did not answer the question**. He did not address MEMS at all. Instead, he pivoted to a commentary about \"pure solid state\" (i.e. no moving parts whatsoever, unlike MEMS) vs. Luminar's custom built mechanical approach, declaring Luminar's solution as the only viable one while criticizing the pure solid state approach as unworkable. He specifically alluded to companies that raised a lot of money for pure solid state with initial fanfare which have since fallen by the wayside (read[ Quanergy](https://quanergy.com/products/)). The answer given by Russell was astounding and revealing. If anyone in the industry knows that MEMS cannot be lumped in with other \"pure\" solid state technologies, it is Austin Russell. Yet that is exactly what he did specifically to avoid a difficult question in what was, in effect, a 2 hour infomercial for Luminar. Asked about MEMS, he erected a non-MEMS straw man and knocked it down. See video time **1:41:40** and following.\n\n(3) Luminar states that the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for automotive lidar is **$150B**, expanding out to **$500B**.\n\n**UPDATE, December 8, 2020 at 12:50 pm**\n\nEagle eyed internet sleuth[ u/s2upid](https://www.reddit.com/u/s2upid/) has unearthed a[ very recent patent application by Luminar](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200256960A1/en?oq=US20200256960A1)\n\nsuggesting that, despite what Russell has said or implied above, **Luminar does recognize the importance of MEMS mirror scanning for lidar**.\n\n\\[0037\\] In particular embodiments, lidar system 100 may include a scanner 120 configured to scan an output beam 125 across a field of regard of the lidar system 100. As an example, **scanner 120 may include one or more scanning mirrors configured to pivot, rotate, oscillate, or move in an angular manner about one or more rotation axes**. The output beam 125 may be reflected by a scanning mirror, and as the scanning mirror pivots or rotates, the reflected output beam 125 may be scanned in a corresponding angular manner. As an example, a scanning mirror may be configured to periodically pivot back and forth over a 30-degree range, which results in the output beam 125 scanning back and forth across a 60-degree range (e.g., a Θ-degree rotation by a scanning mirror results in a 20-degree angular scan of output beam 125). \\[0038\\] In particular embodiments, **scanner 120 may include one or more mirrors, where each mirror is mechanically driven by a galvanometer scanner, a resonant scanner, a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device**, a voice coil motor, an electric motor, or any suitable combination thereof. A galvanometer scanner (which may be referred to as a galvanometer actuator) may include a galvanometer-based scanning motor with a magnet and coil. When an electrical current is supplied to the coil, force is applied to the magnet, which causes a mirror attached to the galvanometer scanner to pivot. The electrical current supplied to the coil may be controlled to dynamically change the position of the galvanometer mirror. A resonant scanner (which may be referred to as a resonant actuator) may include a spring-like mechanism driven by an actuator to produce a periodic oscillation at a substantially fixed frequency (e.g., 1 kHz). **A MEMS-based scanning device may include a mirror with a diameter, length, or width between approximately 0.1 mm and 10 mm, and the mirror may be pivoted back and forth using electromagnetic or electrostatic actuation**. A voice coil motor (which may be referred to as a voice coil actuator) may include a magnet and coil. When an electrical current is supplied to the coil, a translational force is applied to the magnet, which causes a mirror attached to the magnet to move or rotate. An electric motor, such as for example, a brushless DC motor or a synchronous electric motor, may be used to continuously rotate a mirror at a substantially fixed frequency (e.g., a rotational frequency of approximately 1 Hz, 10 Hz, 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 500 Hz, or 1,000 Hz). For example, the mirror may be a polygon mirror that is continuously rotated by the synchronous electric motor in one rotation direction (e.g., clockwise or counter-clockwise relative to a particular rotation axis).\n\nOf course, Luminar does not make or own the IP for MEMS scanning mirrors. The leader in that category is, of course, Microvision whose own automotive lidar product will be available for OEMS by April 2021 for mass production in Q3 2021.", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "Where are you plagerizing all this from?", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Dude I'm good at writing", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "I’m gonna fucking hire you so you can write some nice autistic twits for me.

(NASDAQ:MVIS), a leader in innovative ultra-miniature projection display and sensing technology, today announced it has completed an agreement for its April 2017 customer to take over production of the components MicroVision had been producing for the customer. Beginning in March MicroVision expects to earn a royalty on each component shipped that is approximately equal to the gross profit it earned on each component it had previously produced.\n\n“We are pleased to complete this agreement to support our customer’s needs which provides manufacturing stability while at the same time reduces our cash requirements. The agreement with our April 2017 contract customer is expected to generate the same gross profit dollars that we would have earned if we continued to be responsible for the production. The new arrangement would allow us to enjoy the upside if the customer’s product experiences much higher volumes in the future, while allowing for a lower cost structure and reducing our expected working capital requirements in 2020,” said MicroVision CEO Sumit Sharma.\n\nAs part of the agreement, MicroVision also sold certain assets needed for production for approximately $525,000. The net book value, after previously recorded depreciation of the assets sold, was approximately $81,000.   \n\nMicroVision began selling production components in the third quarter of 2019 that it had developed for a leading technology customer under a development and supply agreement announced in April 2017.

We used spinning pucks on those trucks combined with radar sensors. There point density was no where near 20 million pts per second, it wasn't even close to 100k pts per second. Admittedly there was other layers of safety for people in the autonomous operating zones through high precision GPS on the cars that communicated locations and bearings and speed to the trucks. The trucks where allowed to run over anything up to 300mm (obviously a car can't 😂) but the perception system worked incredibly well, so well infact people drove around to tell the controllers in the office all day to tell them the truck is fine to go forward it's just a wheel rut.\n\nDrills, well they went 3km/h so an xbox kinect resolution sensor was fine for them.\n\nIn my experience spinning mirrors and pucks despite sounding fragile are more then hardy enough to survive a decent lifetime on a car.

I'll start from the start of how these systems work. They all work the same way. The data is all essentially the same for perception. I'll go into depths of why a 20m pt per second cloud is unnecessary necessary and un usable.\n\nI'm sure you're aware of the basics. A laser goes pew pew. The unit knows exactly when it fired that light beam. The time to return provides distance from the unit. Its very accurate. \n\nSome other data is captured. The angle that light beam originated is also temporarily stored, both bearing and dip. Now to be meaningfully accurate these measurements of dip and bearing are ran out to multiple decimal places. Anyone familiar with shooting as an analogy will understand just how accurate something has to be angle wise to achieve centimetres precision at hundreds of metres. So you'd no doubt be aware how data is stored. In bits, yeah sure we can read and write billions of these a second, but here's where the issues start coming in.\n\nI don't think you truly understand how significantly large a 20,000,000 million point cloud is. Let's look at the distance measurement for the data capture. Let's assume the average point distance is 100m (well use an average simply for the fact it's easier numbers wise), the sensor picks up that as a time, it's obviously light so it's a tiny amount of time. Somewhere in the order of...\n 3.3356409519815⋅10-7\n\nThis time HAS to be measured. To a ridiculously small number. Or the data is useless at such small distances.\n\nNow there is a shortcut here and all lidar producers use it, we can significantly reduce that distance measurement before any system has to use it. Using the Application specific integrated circuits the distance is outputted by the sensor as a distance not a time. Without doing this no computer in the world would be able to process lidar data in a reasonable time period. The read write files are simply too large.\n\nNow we're down to a seemingly manageable size of data, we have an X, Y, Z table. Ran out too 7 or so (not exact, they can use whatever they want depending how accurate they want the system but it's generally around there) digits. Less digits is less processing but you start to lose accuracy significantly as you reduce them.\n\nBut that's for a stationary lidar, a moving one requires another set of tables. Here's where IMU's come in. As lidar is naturally a scanning system the exact bearing and dip of the Lidar unit needs to be known, otherwise this running table is useless, we now have to add an extra two columns to the table for the lidar unit bearing and dip to offset the movement in the lidar. This can't be gotten  around as we need tiny percentages of accuracy in angle remember. Where now up to a 5 column table, with a rolling 20 million row data stream. Ever opened a massive except spread sheet? Yeah it's not a specialised program but even on fast computers a file that large takes a considerable amount of time, definitely longer then the amount of data 20000000 points a second will output.\n\nThat table will generally be done by ASIC chips within the unit, they're designed to do it very quickly and I don't doubt that the MVIS units will be able to do that.\n\nWhich is great, it'd actually be manageable and a drop in solution. Lidar says there's an obstacle there's one, car slows down.\n\nBut here's where the problem comes in, autonomy in all current and future planned systems uses multiple sensors. Lidar, radar and photogrammetry are the common ones.\n\nAs MVIS only does the lidar that table has to go some where that will do the rest, it will end up in a dedicated perception system that will compile all of the data from all of the sensors. Radar will be great for velocity as that can easily be measured with Doppler shift and saves processing a point cloud for movement. Photogrammetry is great for deciding what the obstacle the point cloud picked up is and discern what it is (we've all been training artificial intelligence in this for years through captchas, Google you cheeky buggers making us do your work)\n\nSo now we compile all these tables, into one computer, the perception system. Radar will always be the smallest and depending on the camera quality photogrammetry can be as crazy big as the lidar data table.\n\nObviously if we're dealing with tables this big you need quite a powerful computer, sure we can chuck hundreds of cores and processing units in it to deal with it but it is gonna use alot of juice which is not a great thing in a battery powered electric car. Which is all happening rather quick now.\n\nOk we have this data and we need to trim it down, as a lot of people have suggested we just reduce the point count. In spatial data processing this is referred to as \"decimating the cloud\". Its a simple process and there's quite a few ways it can be done. The more complex ways require processing to decide which ones to get rid of. Now a 20 million point cloud is utterly unusable and that's the lidar alone. I'm telling you now it's too large for general processing, wouldn't even want to think about the power it takes to do real time at a safe frame rate for driving at 100+km/h.\n\nThe one way to do it with minimal processing is, we ignore a large percentage of points, a more manageable cloud for 360 degrees is around 1-2 million (in my experience in autonomous haulage systems it definitely picks up everything, it will see a cone on a road a hundred metres before it gets there), decent resolution, enough to see anything that should be on the road and decide if it's an obstacle. So 360 degree coverage of the MVIS system will take what, 4... 5 units? You're going to have 100,000,000 points per second. So now we're deleting 98% of points. Do you see why that's ludicrous. Why capture all of that data to get rid of it.\n\nSo here's the next step in the processing of this lidar data in the perception computers. Lidar has a rather big problem. Light can be reflected by dust, condensation, rain, snow etc. He'll I've had instances using them on a perfectly clear day and still having hundreds of what are known as \"outliers\". These HAVE to be removed, because if they aren't the next step in processing lidar data does not work. And the car will constantly stop for obstacles that don't exist due artefacts in lidar data. There's a rather simple process for removing them fully automated however in my use I always cleaned them manually. To do it automatically, the outlier removal will look for any points that have a large distance to the closest ones compared to surrounding points. It will remove the point if it is clearly not supposed to be there because it doesn't fit into the Digital Terrain Model (DTM). It isn't the best tool in even specially developed survey grade software. It removes points it shouldn't, it leave points it shouldn't. It's It's rather messy process hence why I done it manually.\n\nLet's assume we perfectly optimise the process, removal is perfect. The outliers are deleted, the data is down to a manageable level with suitable latency. We process as little as possible and take the simple decimation route, usual outlier removal process everything went smooth. We have a DTM and it's safe proceed forward. Or is it....\n\nOk let me put forward a scenario taking all of the steps above. A steel obstacle is on the road, it's thin, directly in front of the forward facing lidar, for lidar optimisation the overlap allows only the front facing sensor to see it.\n\nNow keeping the 20 million point cloud, great we see it, it's covered by that many points it wasn't removed as an outlier. Obstacle detected, car stops everyone is safe. Here's the problem with decimation. Lets assume randomised decimation at the sensor removed (it can and does happen) the bottom half of the points on this pole. Now the outlier removal sees a cloud of points floating. All around it points are 1cm apart, this clouds floating in the air 5cm up. As far as the programs concerned it's an outlier, pff points are gone. But the obstacle isn't. If the ducks line up and decimation scan after scan removes those bottom points we all of a sudden don't see that pole. We hit it.\n\nHere's where a legal side comes in, as MVIS CHOSE to remove those points they are liable. There system detected the obstacle but due to programming it ignored it. They are 100% liable for whatever happens in that circumstance.\n\nNow let's go back to a lower density point cloud. In a lower density point cloud automated outlier removals are a bit more accurate. Lets assume we don't decimate anything. We only have 1 million points. Naturally they're a bit more spread out, the chances of that pole getting picked up are still just as high as a dense cloud because the one point that does pick it up will have less chance of been classified an outlier due to the more spread out cloud. The distance relationship from that one point is close enough to the surrounding points distances it is assumed it actually exists.\n\nIn short, lower density point clouds are more suitable for automation, sounds counter intuitive but it is. Decimation can cause dangerous situations where removal of existing data can cause invalid data. Its better and safer to have less data then it is to have more if you can't process it and spend time processing data multiple times to compare to new data as a fail-safe. It fail safes outlier removal to repeatedly process data. If your constantly pushing processing power you won't have the time to do that. Safety is the key aspect in this, processing is better spent testing data again and again then it is seeing in a 3d model if someone has a crinkle in there jacket.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The alpha prime takes 28v and it has 5m pps....

{"title": "Inminent bull run for the Uranium market?", "selftext": "# The world needs clean-air energy\n\nThere is growing recognition of the role nuclear power must play in providing safe, reliable, affordable carbon-free baseload electricity and achieving a low-carbon future. Examples of this growing recognition include:\n\n* Many countries, US states, and utilities announced net-zero carbon targets in 2020. While most of these targets are further out in the future, many of the plans include an important role for nuclear. For example, a study suggests that for China to achieve its net-zero target by 2060, will require a 382% increase in nuclear power from 2025 levels.\n* In the US, President Biden’s campaign included positive statements about the need to maintain the existing nuclear power fleet and to build advanced reactors as part of an overall shift to non-emitting carbon power sources.\n* Japan’s Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, announced that the country aims to become carbon neutral by 2050. Regarding nuclear, he indicated Japan will continue to develop its nuclear energy supply with “maximum priority on safety”. Japan’s current energy plan calls for 20% to 22% nuclear by 2030.\n* In France, President Macron stated in December that nuclear will remain a pillar of the French energy mix for decades to come and pressed for preparatory studies on new next-generation EPR reactors to be wrapped up in the coming months.\n* The Netherlands announced they will begin a process that considers building up to 10 nuclear power plants.\n* According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, there are currently 443 reactors operating globally and 52 reactors under construction. With a number of reactor construction projects recently approved, and many more planned, the demand for uranium is growing.\n\n# Supply-Demand\n\nLike other commodities, **the uranium industry is cyclical.** History demonstrates that in general, when prices are rising and high, uranium is perceived as scarce, and a lot of contracting activity takes place. The heavy contracting that takes place during price runs, drives investment in higher-cost sources of production. Once that production is in the market, it tends to stay in the market longer than is economically rational, creating the perception that uranium is abundant and always will be, and prices decline. When prices are declining and low, like we have seen over the past number of years, there is no perceived urgency to contract, and contracting activity and investment in new supply drops off. **After years of low investment in supply, as has been the case since 2011, security of supply tends to overtake price concerns at some point, and utilities re-enter the long-term market to ensure they have the reliable supply of uranium they need to run their reactors.**\n\nCustomers do not go to the market right before they need to load uranium into their reactors. To operate a reactor that could run for more than 60 years, natural uranium and the downstream services have to be purchased years in advance, allowing time for a number of processing steps before it arrives at the power plant as a finished fuel bundle. The longer the recovery of the long-term market is delayed, the less certainty there will be about the availability of future supply to fill growing demand. **Recent data from the US Energy Information Administration shows that utility inventories are starting to decline and are approaching levels that could put security of supply at risk, there is a significant amount of uranium that needs to be contracted to keep reactors running into the next decade.**\n\nAs utilities’ uncovered requirements grow, annual supply declines, demand for uranium from producers and financial players increases, and with trade policy potentially restricting access to some markets, the pounds available in the spot market will not be adequate to satisfy the growing backlog of long-term demand. As a result, **there will be increased competition to secure uranium under long-term contracts on terms that will ensure the availability of reliable primary supply to meet growing demand.**\n\nGlobal population is on the rise, and there is a growing focus on electrification and decarbonization. With the world’s need for safe, clean, reliable baseload energy, nuclear remains an important part of the energy mix. With demand increasing due to restarts and new reactors, and supply becoming less certain as a result of low prices, production curtailments, lack of investment, and end of reserve life, unplanned production disruptions, shrinking secondary supplies and trade policy issues, a market transition is expected.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis post is not a financial advice.", "id": "ljiul3", "created_utc": 1613282984.0, "score": 384, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 286, "comments": [{"body": "URANIUM FEVER", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "I’m in", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Has gone and Got me down", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "My confirmation bias likes this.", "score": 33, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm loaded to the tits with NXE and CCJ stocks and some June calls.", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "I also loaded some $NXE 8/20C 🤞", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This comment was removed because automod thinks it mentions a stock with a market cap below $1B.

There are peak solar angles and wind speeds needed for optimal generation, and anything outside of that range has diminishing production capability. California learned this the hard way as they overbuilt solar and then experienced surprise blackouts over the summer precisely when the sun dropped out of the proper angle for their solar farms.\n2. Batteries just aren't efficient enough yet and we will likely need to find new battery technology (e.g. something other than lithium) to break the barrier to grid level storage. Liquid air or hydrogen batteries are being developed but they're in their infancy and are fickle to work with.\n3. The battery production process is insanely detrimental to the environment. From the mining of the rare earth minerals out of the ground, to the manufacturing, and finally the disposal of the batteries, they are anything but carbon neutral and produce a lot of nasty toxic byproducts and waste.

Took my profit and exited.\n\n# \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright- I posted a position in Trivago on Friday and I wanted to follow up with a list of reasons why I think Trivago could be a great play for 2021. For those that know about Trivago, it essentially serves as a price comparison tool for multiple travel sites and it allows you to book hotels.  This is a recovery play that may or may not pan out, I believe that the floor for Trivago is probably around 2.00 right now so you may see those prices should this fail to pan out. Also, Expedia is a large owner in Trivago and Trivago is a European based company. Trivago is a cost per click business that essentially puts multiple pricing on the same site and lets the customer compare. With Leisure travel picking back up and companies desperate for cashflow, Trivago might find companies being more aggressive on customer acquisition. Trivago may benefit with these surges.\n\nI am buying shares and selling covered calls A 5.00. I believe 5.00 is my exit price for the stock as of right now. If something big happens like an adjacent expansion then this might move, but I am going to sell monthly covered call @ 5.00.\n\n# All my holdings:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My entire position allocation](https://preview.redd.it/fozbv5jd2eh61.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=25251535097cda0c16a00ddcff47671ebf68a66a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Beaten Down Stocks Respond Aggressively to good news\n\n* Often time stocks that are at all time lows just need a single small catalyst to respond aggressively to the upside.\n   * Gamestop's investment from Ryan Cohen is an example of a catalyst that drove a huge increase in Gamestop's game price.\n* A few years ago Trivago was trading at \\~23.00 dollars per share.

Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.\n\nThe main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) \n\nThe perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)\n2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.\n3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . \n4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.\n\nTo recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID \n\nI have my retarded position 80x 150c mid June", "id": "ljp713", "created_utc": 1613312363.0, "score": 2043, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 719, "comments": [{"body": "The real reason AMD is going to succeed is because WSB pumped AMC and AMD comes next alphabetically", "score": 325, "replies": [{"body": "Bought $AME to stay ahead of the game.\n\n(Also, not actually a horrible stock)", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "Ame is rain in Japanese.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Ame is love in portuguese.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Âme is soul in french", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Welp that does it.

I’m bullish on AMD as a company in general (my last few desktop CPUs have been AMD and I’m currently rocking a 5600x), but not as a stock in the medium term. Few reasons for this.\n\nFirstly, the competitive landscape. In CPU land AMD have the upper hand at the moment. This *may* be fleeting, with leaks relating to the next gen Intel chips looking promising (obviously we need to wait and see). It’s possible that they can’t take advantage of their market leading position because of constrained supply. AMD aren’t historically the CPU leaders across the board as they are now, so you have to wonder whether Intel will take the lead again just as supply constraints loosen, taking much larger volume than is currently possible. They may have missed their window. Other competitors come from ARM based CPUs, where you’d have to consider AAPL a threat given the astonishing per w performance of the M1, and Qualcomm amongst others. And then there are the GPUs, where AMD are at least a generation behind on two key technologies compared to Nvidia (ray tracing and DLSS) that are becoming increasingly important. DLSS in particular, and AMD’s dismissal of it as an approach up until recently is worrying as it’s the difference between a game being playable or not. Mining is a consideration, not for Bee Tea Sea as others have pointed out (not used GPUs for well over 5 years now), but for others. This is going to push up demand, but I think there’s another issue.\n\nThe other is their corporate strategy of being a chip designer and renting out the foundry. Intel have their own. This means that when there is constrained supply they are going to end up in bidding wars against other customers for foundry resources. At the very least this will drive up costs (Ryzen 5000 series chips are more expensive than their predecessors) and at the worst they simply won’t be able to get sufficient resources and their supply will remain constrained. Remember that their competing against companies like AAPL for foundry resources (AAPL have their own foundry, but are still heavily reliant on external suppliers for volume). I wouldn’t want to be bidding against the biggest company on earth. Generally, I think outsourcing the actual manufacturing of chips to external suppliers has been a good thing, but in supply constrained economies like the one we’re currently in it doesn’t look quite the home run it has been to now. Remember that when the next gen Intel chips launch, Intel can fire up their own foundries to fab them where AMD cannot. If you need a new chip, you’ll probably go with Intel just because of availability even if it’s 2% worse than the AMD competitor. These are manufacturing issues, the distribution issues remain worldwide so if the distribution is more problematic than the manufacturing, then this may not be an issue.\n\nThere’s just one other, possibly incredibly minor, issue too. AMD Ryzen CPUs have been using the same socket design for years now. This means that there’s a relatively simple upgrade path for users who can literally just swap out a CPU and get significant performance improvements. Zen 4 is moving to a new socket design, which means people will need a new motherboard should they want to upgrade. This may suppress demand a bit. I don’t think it will have a massive impact, but it does mean that if there are any supply constraints on motherboards (there are currently) this may further suppress demand. Hard to predict this one though, and Intel have been changing socket types seemingly every 6 months without too much issue (although again, they’re a larger player to motherboard manufacturers might be more willing to throw resources at meeting the market).\n\nI’d love to be wrong.

AMD's not switching to that node for another year and who knows what TSMC or Apple will have then in terms of capacity and node use. (You'd expect more TSMC capacity, right?

This may suppress demand a bit.\n\nIt won't. It's been the norm for Intel for many generations to need new boards as you said, and Intel boards have generally been more expensive, so it's practically going to be a non-factor for AMD in the same way as it was for Intel. Some uninformed enthusiasts will probably bitch about it, but they've no right to, this has been on the cards for years. In the end they'll upgrade because it's one time vs every time with Intel, and it's not like Intel offers them a better system.\n\nLastly, you're much more optimistic about Intel's products than I am as someone who's following AMD closely. I think it's going to be 3-5+ years before Intel has a long term competitive product at this point.

The per watt performance is so far ahead of X86, even though the M1 is first generation, it’s going to set expectations in customer’s minds and I can see more consumers going in that direction over Windows (and therefore X86). \n\nI’m bullish on Apple though. I think some of the engineering work they’ve done recently has been incredibly impressive (not just the A and M series chips but also with APFS and Rosetta 2 on the software side) and I don’t buy in to the whole “they no longer innovate” narrative. This may taint my view a bit, but I certainly see more people cross shopping MacOS devices with Windows and choosing Apple going forward. It’s a compelling product and it’s going to be interesting to see if they can replicate the YoY improvements they’ve been making to the A series chips on the M series. I suspect so for at least a few years whilst they explore the thermal and power consumption headroom a bit.\n\n>\tPeople have been talking about RISC killing x86 for years, yet here we are, and Qualcomm doesn't have a product announced, nevermind one anyone can buy. They completely gave up on their server CPU plans, and that's where the real fat margins are.\n\nAgree, but I think the difference now is that we’ve got a compelling, mainstream, RISC offering in the desktop/laptop space. This may or may not make a difference but I’d argue the number of RISC processors currently shipping is the highest it’s ever been both in absolute terms and relative to X86 (apart from the obvious). I’ve not checked the numbers, but I’d be incredibly surprised if that wasn’t true.\n\n>\tIt won't. It's been the norm for Intel for many generations to need new boards as you said, and Intel boards have generally been more expensive, so it's practically going to be a non-factor for AMD in the same way as it was for Intel.\n\nEntirely possible it plays out this way. I think it’s only a minor consideration in the scheme of things anyway. My concern is not really about demand but rather supply and getting the motherboard chipsets out to the market in sufficient quantity. Not an issue in normal times, but we are where we are. Even riskier because, as you say, it’s a new manufacturing process.\n\nIt’s been compelling for motherboard manufacturers to support AM4 because of the forwards and backwards compatibility. You’re not just supporting the current gen, but also the previous gen and the gen before that. The AMD/Intel market split is roughly 30/70 so manufacturers have a great chance of addressing most of the 30% with AM4. That incentive will go away. Also worth considering whether the motherboard manufacturers will believe AMD will have constrained supply and therefore not go hard in that direction. Who knows. We do know though that new Intel chips still outsell new AMD chips, to the market incentives are to go with Intel over AMD for the motherboard manufacturers if supply constraints remain.\n\n>\tLastly, you're much more optimistic about Intel's products than I am as someone who's following AMD closely.\n\nNah, not really. They’ve let me down too many times in the past (professionally). I do think they’ve made some positive moves in senior leadership recently though and the leaks do look promising (bearing in mind they’re unconfirmed). My theory with Intel is that they’ve actually got some decent improvements in the pipeline that they can roll out (particularly around IPC) and they haven’t until now because they didn’t need to due to lack of real competition at the high end. Now they’ve got AMD on one side (and not just consumer with Ryzen, but also Threadripper) and ARM on the other they need to, so will. But, there’s a valley of death in there somewhere, probably in two generations, where their recent lack of progress is going to bite. I’m more optimistic about AMD, just more long term as I said. \n\nI think it’s the foundries that will make bank though because they can effectively auction off their services to the highest bidder, increasing their margins substantially, even if (maybe especially if) the distribution and logistics challenges remain.\n\nEither way, interesting times, and I don’t feel particularly confident in any prediction due to the unprecedented worldwide situation.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Preface: I'm not taking a shot at you with any response, I like a good respectable discussion!

Sure, battery life matters, but not many people are choosing laptops based on performance per watt, and you can buy cheap x86 laptops with 20 hour battery run times already. \n\nOn top of that Apple is using a more advanced process node. It should be no surprise it has better performance per watt. It also means their wafers are [significantly more expensive](https://hardforum.com/data/attachment-files/2020/01/322533_cropped-cost-yield-node-compare-1-1155x719.jpg) and lower yield for now. \n\n>I’m bullish on Apple though.\n\nSure, I'm definitely not saying Apple's a bad investment for a moment. I think M1 is a good move for them in terms of margins and ecosystem control. I just think they're not going to threaten x86. People buying Apple will buy Apple no matter what the CPU. I don't expect too many people switching to Apple for M1 though.\n\n>Agree, but I think the difference now is that we’ve got a compelling, mainstream, RISC offering in the desktop/laptop space. \n\nApple is <15% marketshare. I'm not sure that's really mainstream as such. On top of that Apple has an ecosystem that makes it easy to transition their architecture like that, but that's an outlier. It will be nowhere near as easy for the rest of the market to transition, and no one's even trying to make chips to do that that we know of. (Edit: Qualcomm was for servers but abandoned that around about when AMD came out with Ryzen and EPYC)\n\n>We do know though that new Intel chips still outsell new AMD chips, to the market incentives are to go with Intel over AMD for the motherboard manufacturers if supply constraints remain.\n\nAgreed, but that's a more complicated equation than that. Again I'd suggest you look at revenue vs profits last quarter for Intel. Their revenue went way up but their profits barely increased. They're selling but at lower margins. That's not at all where Intel wants to be. They're now the cheaper-but-not-as-good vendor. Consider EPYC CPUs give 4x the performance per $ and as time goes on and AMD comes out with even better products opening up that gap, Intel either gives up yet more marketshare OR starts losing money to maintain marketshare. Either way that's not a company I'd want to invest in.\n\n>Either way, interesting times, and I don’t feel particularly confident in any prediction due to the unprecedented worldwide situation.\n\nYeah, I think this saved Intel face for the last year to be completely honest. They'd have been in a much worse position in terms of stock price if demand hadn't picked up.\n\nAs for foundries, TSMC knows which way their bread is buttered. AMD is a golden goose to them if AMD knocks chunks out of Intel. The smarter play for them is to act more partner-like than vulture-like, and benefit on growth, not margin, and TSMC aren't exactly known for being stupid.\n\nMy money's still firmly on AMD.

This means that ARM, which already dominates mobile market, now gets a sensible chunk of laptop market as well (to wit, about 10% as of 2021). Latest demonstrations from Microsoft suggest that its principal portfolio of products, at least end user facing, are fully functional on ARM platform. This means that, were someone to give the push necessary for market adoption of ARM based laptops and PCs, the difference in end user experience would be unnoticeable. A major obstacle in adoption is therefore nullified. Who is that someone and why would they give a push?\n\nIntel's mainline CPU business has always been intricately woven into two other dependencies: IBM PC architecture and Windows. The remnants of the original IBM PC are still present in the nowaday motherboards and they severely complicate board design and composition. The convergence phenomenon causes various parts of the original architecture to compress and migrate across components (consider for example the mutation of \"super-IO\" into \"embedded controller\" which collected all sorts of bizzare and useless functions on the way, or the path the memory control logic took from a separate logical unit to the north bridge which then converged into the platform controller hub and following that, memory control began moving out into the CPU itself). The end result is that boards carry around a ton of disparate garbage that is not really useful in modern computing, it's just there because it can't be removed as subsequent generations of technology depend on it. Case in point: an average laptop board will have no less than three different low speed buses (I2C, SMbus and LPC), as well as PCI, PCI-E, 2 or 3 different types of USB and so on. The embedded controllers have literally dozens of built in devices which barely serve any useful purpose. This essentially means that each new generation of intel CPUs, owing to the improvement in silicon manufacturing, makes the previous architecture inefficient, and parts of it have to be moved closer to the CPU, turning it more and more into an expensive system-on-a-chip arrangement if Intel wants to maintain the levels of performance that the new manufacturing methods allow, which it has to do if it wants to sell new CPUs. In fact, system-on-a-chip laptops already exist and they are a complete disaster. If a SoC dies, the laptop goes to trash, because replacing the SoC in many cases is not cost efficient. Part of the current right of repair uprising against technological vendors is caused by this exact problem.\n\nThis is where Microsoft comes in. Microsoft has, for years, demanded that Intel retains all backward compatibility with their previous chips. Current Intel CPUs are still forced to be able to execute 16 bit and 32 bit code, and there is a significant amount of software that depends on it. On top of that, AMD occasionally invents some new extension that Intel is forced to implement. The end result is that Intel assembler is internally a nightmare that complicates optimizing compiler design, which in modern computing is responsible probably for a third, if not half, of performance at runtime execution.\n\nIn other words, Intel (and AMD) CPUs are literally full of useless crap and the current board architecture is also full of such crap.  At this point, if aliens showed up and wanted to help silly humans to improve their computers, they would probably say something like \"Intel-based computers need to go, better start with something fresh.\" And that something fresh is ARM technology. It's way tidier compared to Intel architecture, it can deliver comparable performance at lower cost and lower power consumption, the tooling around it is stable and solid, and the flag day - the hypothetical switchover threshold - can eliminate all the remnants of PC architecture, replacing them with freshly designed, sane and standardized solutions. ARM, in fact, is already present everywhere in PC architecture - just not in the CPU slot. The only thing that was preventing it from doing so until now was the trivial reason that people weren't sure Windows and Microsoft Office would run on it. Now turns out that not only they do, but there is even fully working x64 emulation on ARM, which means you can seamlessly run all Windows software that was written for Intel on an ARM PC, without having to rewrite it. \n\nNow consider what happens if Nvidia buys ARM. They already own the GPU market, they have a solid foothold in the datacenter market (hello from Mellanox), and ARM gives them the key into the CPU market, and pretty much the whole mobile market. This makes Nvidia a direct competitor to Intel and AMD. If the ARM architecture is able to divide the PC market, then its benefits will eventually overshade the IBM PC architecture, as the end consumer wouldn't be able to tell the difference except on the price. While AMD stands a chance on the GPU market, Intel has nothing of value to offer, and would essentially have to come up with a new clean architecture in order to compete on the same terms with ARM based PCs.  It tried to do this a couple of times in the past and failed. AMD's latest work showed that they are fully capable of delivering technology that's as good as Intel if not better. The end result is that ARM is likely to end up as the world's dominant CPU architecture, and produce the dominant PC architecture, as long as Microsoft plays ball and someone starts marketing ARM based laptops, and AMD has something in its pocket that Intel doesn't.\n\nIn any case the real winner is going to be TSMC.

That would break out into seperate markets for seperate levels of chip based on complexity, and would explain how, in a major shortage, different companies could target different segments of the market and all make a killing.  The non-retard question is; after the highway starts working again does that additional manufacturing capacity crash the price of chips?

However something is on the horizon because we're at levels ABOVE the dot com bubble.\n\nhttp://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php\n\nMaybe I'm wrong. Hell I hope I am and I want you to convince me that I am.

Maybe this is the new norm where we're constantly above the GDP and life is booming. Or perhaps this is from Uncle Sam printing as much money as it pleases. Just remember, at some point it has to come down and when it does you can make a lot of money if you know where to put it. I'm not going to tell you, I encourage you to research this on your own time; however, here's a hint... Look at the volume over the last few weeks of BEAR ETF Stonks, PUTS, and fucking learn to hedge you cocksuckers! Things don't go up forever. If you think I'm wrong I'd agree with you... Except! People in 2000 had the exact same mentality and I'm a student of history who believes that history always repeats itself. Good luck and stay safe.\n\nP.S. Keep an eye on the US inflation rate, VIX, and US treasury bonds. I know we're smart but the people on Wall Street have played this game longer than us and we at least have to have the mental capacity to admit that.\n\nP.S.S.

CNBC has it wrong - this didn't start with WSB. People are losing faith in the dollar and wanna hold fucking metal.\n\nYou don't think there's a shortage? Go try to buy a 1,000 ounce bar of silver. Google it. If you happen to find a dealer who isn't out of stock, you'll be paying an insane premium over the spot price.\n\nI'm not gonna get into all the silver manipulation conspiracies. Let's stick to Retard Economics 101: if there's a shortage of the good it means the price is too damn low.\n\nBecause of the differential between the physical spot price of silver, and the futures price in the COMEX there's an arbitrage: Anybody with any serious cash today could take silver delivery from the COMEX at $27, and quickly flip it for well over $30. Futures deliveries last year were already at a record:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/djlle4wb8hh61.png?width=1466&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd198b6fa8db58121a9654f2e46fe668ec342268\n\nBut the amount of folks standing for March delivery might just break the bank... because there's just not enough Silver to deliver to everyone who wants it. That's why (as another WSB post already detailed) The SLV ETF amended their prospectus to basically say [we can't actually get the silver that we need.](https://twitter.com/BullionStar/status/1360703958029905921)\n\nIf silver futures start creeping up, this thing could completely snowball. Because those industrial consumers of silver - Tesla, Apple, Medical stuff - absolutely cannot afford to have their production lines shut down for a month because of one input, and will pay anything to make sure they get those 1k bars in hand.\n\nHow to make tendies? Look what happened to AG and SILJ a few weeks ago when Silver went up 9%. Those two tickers FLEW. Buy calls on them for July if you're responsible, April if you're a degenerate gambler.\n\nHow to do your part and make sure the squeeze happens? Buy PSLV. That fund is going to actually take delivery of 1,000 ounce bars on your behalf.\n\nPositions: $PSLV shares, $AG July calls, strike 20,  $SILJ August calls strike 25.\n\nDON'T BUY $SLV\n\nEDIT: I received a message from a smart dude suggesting that this news actually means that $SLV is vulnerable, and buying it is also a direct way to create tightness in the silver market.

There was big money going into these ETFs. Physical silver was selling out. Premiums on physical were exploding. Then there was a post on WSB about a silver squeeze in the middle of the GME frenzy. It didn't get all that much traction on WSB, but enough that the media saw it and ran with it. They saw all the silver being bought up, they saw a post on WSB about a silver squeeze, so they just said that WSB is buying all the silver. Then the people on WSB were like \"hey, it's not us buying all this silver... we're busy buying GME at $300 a share\".\n\nSome of the GME bagholders thought that Melvin was long silver and was pushing the silver squeeze in a pump and dump to cover their GME losses. That was a dumb theory. Silver went up maybe 10%... nothing all that significant. I suppose it's possible that Melvin was happy to promote any post that said to buy anything that wasn't GME, but I don't think Melvin had anything to do with this. \n\nSo now here we are. Seems like people are still buying silver. Doesn't look like too many people on WSB are long silver, but clearly there is major money moving into silver. I think that there is a lot of money floating around out there. Asset prices are at record highs. Lots of people are worried about the value of fiat currencies as asset prices move higher. And when you've got all this money out there, and silver prices still about 50% below all time highs from a decade ago (and half the price from the high 40+ years ago)... it doesn't take much to buy up all the silver. There's lots of fiat money around, and not any more silver than there usually is. \n\nUltimately, the fundamentals supporting the #silversqueeze theory were correct. There is a squeeze happening. It's not WSB who is buying the silver (obviously there are some silver bulls here, but not all that many relatively speaking). So we'll see where this goes.

Then you have to drill lots more holes in the area to figure out where the ore vein is, and of course all this needs analyzed. Once that is all done (we've likely spent 3-5 years and $50m+), we need to get permits to actually mine. We need more permits to process the ore. Then we actually start digging the mine and building the processing facilities. If you have hired experts in the mining industry you might be actually producing silver in about 5 years from the time you start exploring. And by that time silver prices may have collapsed to the point you could buy it cheaper than you can mine (which has been the case for most of the last 8 years).\n\nWhen folks say the market is screwed up, they mean the price is artificially low. That is why silver production is down despite newer and better technology and equipment. Most mines aren't profitable below $20, and even at $20 silver it takes a long time to pay off the initial investment.

For years there has been a lot of extra supply. But as younger generations scorn silver as an investment or hedge, there has been less investment demand. Silver is used in film, and obviously that's a lot smaller industry than it had been. \n\nAs silver prices spiked in the previous decade, miners could afford the capex to expand production. But as prices fell, they needed to mine increasing amounts to keep their profits up. But once they burned through the high grade ore and cost of production exceeded the market price, they had to shut down (starting with the least efficient mines mining the lowest ore grades). Capex has been minimal for most of a decade.\n\nDemand has been increasing, but it has been gradual, slowly soaking up the excess supply that has been available. Now supplies seem to be much tighter.\n\nBut the real story is price manipulation by the banks, and we don't need to go back far to see an example. At the end of January and beginning of February, SLV (the world's largest silver trust) had record inflows, supposedly adding 110M oz of silver in 3 days. For perspective, annual mine production is less than 1B oz, so in 3 days, about 12% of annual silver production was purchased in 3 days. (Oh yes, online dealers had to shut down over the weekend due to overwhelming demand for physical silver, and they still haven't shipped all the silver they sold that Friday and Saturday before shutting down). So the price massively spiked, right?\n\nWrong. The price ended the 3rd day lower than it started the first day (I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact that JP Morgan published a report on Feb 2 downgrading silver and miners.

If you had that 1 dollar in fiat, its value would have reduced 99% aka down to a penny.\n\nAnd if silver becomes hot to trade in then your 1 dollar in silver may even be worth 2 or 3 dollars (200-300 post dollar collapse).", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You shush.

{"title": "INTC - Catalysts for a breakout of all time high and the road to Trillion dollar market cap 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Hello again lazy slush brained degenerates. I'm putting rocket emojis just for you guys! I know you love them  **🚀**  **🚀**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: There are a few short term catalysts that can propel this sleeper stock to the moon. Buy INTC on Tuesday, or wait till the end of the week and see if I am right and its at near 70$ and buy then. Or just wait till its already overvalued and spiked parabolically to enter as usual.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday I expressed (but not nearly enough) how Intel is like a beautiful meal. You got an appetizer yesterday with Mobileye and today I planned on giving you a dessert focused on Intel's AI/machine learning/neural network play but ill leave that for another day like I will with the main dish (Data).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIll wait for the price to be more ripe (which it will in the coming weeks) to expose these valuable long term prospects for the legacy chipmaker. I think you will take my valuations more seriously when INTC is around 70$ per share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nToday I want to look at possible catalysts for INTCs 2021 bull run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.) The most obvious is one that is already partially in play, and also partially responsible for INTCs 24% YTD returns. The changing of leadership at Intel. As you might know this Monday (markets closed) Pat Gelsinger officially takes over as CEO of Intel. Catalyst 1.1 was his appointment, catalyst 1.2 is him stepping in officially as CEO and his first announcements. When he stepped in for the earnings call last month he mentioned he had many ideas and thoughts that he would share publicly when he was officially in the role and had a chance to look through things more carefully (which he has been doing lately). There is guaranteed to be interesting chatter in the grapevines this coming week. If you believe Pat is one of the good ones this chatter is bound to be positive. Ill leave your uncreative brains to think of the myriad possibilites of the things Pat can say in the first few days/weeks that can tremendously impact the market price and corporate perception.  **🚀**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSmall side note, the leadership change is not exclusive to Pat, there are several top silicon valley pros coming back at Pats request (some returning from retirement). INTC knows it has been hit and is rallying its troops. All hands on deck to get this shit rolling back to the top. These people don't fuck around and they bleed Intel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.) Semiconductor shortage. As you may or may not know there is a relatively large chip shortage that is affecting many industries. GM for example had to shut down two of its plants recently, but this is not just affecting the auto industry, it is affecting dozens of different industries (some more than others). What does this mean for Intel? Well, Intel makes chips. They have the largest foundries in the world and there are at least a handful of ways a company like Intel can leverage this situation to their advantage.  **🚀**  **🚀**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3.) This one is at least in part linked to the second point, but goes beyond that. Biden administration intervention in the US semiconductor industry. Last week the SIA (Semiconductor industry association sent a letter to President Biden calling for governmental support of the industry). Please read the one page letter, and your conclusion will be the same as mine. This rally call is exceptionally bullish for the industry. [https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf) It is especially bullish though for one of the signatories of the letter: Intel. Intel unlike AMD actually makes the chips and does not outsource the production to a foreign company (a Taiwanese company for that matter (risks associated with this I have discussed in another post)). Having an actual American fab is extremely big both short term and long term. This is a national asset and Intels future and well being is intertwined with Americas. Any Presidential administration will come to this conclusion. What does this mean? It is in the best interest of the United States for Intel to be bigger, richer and more dominant than TSMC and there are many ways American top brass can go about this.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExpect tax breaks and subsidies soon (that will asymmetrically impact Intel positively). In fact, as part of Covid relief packages you can expect executive action pretty here pretty soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4.) Look at the power of memes and momentum over the last year. The market has been permanently tainted and so the unexpected can happen. Intel is one of the few profitable tech companies that has not shot parabolically (yet) although from a technical standpoint its starting to hint at that this year. Soon people especially retail will want a play that hasn't already been exhausted, that can still give them strong returns. I mean is it really appetizing to buy TSLA or even AMD after they have multiplied so much? There is a cognitive bias for a pre parabolic company with potential, and in a parabolic industry (semis). This bias may not be super rational but if price action continues to side with INTC it will be part of the reinforcement process for the potential parabolic play. You get this stock to be memetic and it flies.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5.) Strong market correction. As you know many smart and stupid analysts have been predicting a crash since last March. They have all turned out to be wrong (so far). Last week though several bearish indicators started reappearing (from bearish insider transaction numbers, yield on the 10 year, and the bizarre VIX action). To be clear I do not think the market will crash anytime soon and I'm quite bullish on all sectors for the coming months (so long as the fed and white house play along(and they have no reason to not until inflation actually passes 2% or something crazy happens with commodities including that coin that cant be named)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn any case in the event a crash happens INTC will be in a much better position than most. Speculation in the stock is low for now, large long term (boomer holders). The company has very little debt and is extremely cash rich. It can self fund all its operations for years and even lose revenues. Essentially Intel is an underleveraged company. AMD and NVIDIA for example are much more leveraged companies as is normal with rapidly growing tech companies. The reality is a market crash would damage the competition much more than it would INTC and it could even benefit Intel's market share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurther if the correction is not a full blown panic it is quite possible that Intel may actually appreciate in price as the majority of the nasdaq depreciates (again due to risk perception and lack of leverage) Intel can easily be seen as a safehaven.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI get it, its not easy for you to part with your emotional investment in NVIDIA and AMD, besides they have treated you spectacularly especially the past year. You like their product and are angry at the fact INTC has been treating their retail customers poorly the last few years. You are sick of the machinations of the INTC leadership and their total focus on $$ losing track of the most important thing, product quality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't let the past cloud your judgment for future investment opportunities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou see Intel has its tentacles in everything that matters related to chips. They truly are Chipzilla as you will discover, in time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCome back to this post when Intel opens Tuesday up 2% and closes the week up 10% sniffing 70$ per share.\n\nI reiterate my position:\n\n1700 shares, 500 April 16 80$ strike calls, and 50 February 26 65$ strike calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2yw8zen6mih61.png?width=381&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f124b02abe4da3c28b05ba06aecca3eba4afbcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/70tm973bmih61.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=50693c58cd2cea298db594b62074092c17957829\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cx02rh65mih61.png?width=375&format=png&auto=webp&s=1621b412132c7a91b77b44cab1f58ce8f7c3c425\n\nThe missing 500 shares as well as the 180 contracts for April 16th are in another account that I am not going to access at the moment.

There's plenty of positive catalysts coming up.**\n\n**If you want to get in this play right away then better buy shares because IV is very high at the moment. $5 seems like a price floor. If you do want to buy calls I suggest Aug expiry between $7-$9, or better yet LEAPS Jan 22 at $10-$12.**\n\n**My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40. I'm waiting for IV to drop a bit before I buy LEAPS.**\n\nLet's start at the beginning:\n\nAMC is the largest movies operator in the world. It has 1,004 theatres and 11,041 screens worldwide. The biggest, by far. They made $43bn revenue for movie studios in 2019.\n\nWhat we know from the Q3 2020 results:\n\nAfter 5 months suspension of Operations theatres started to reopen.\n\nFirst domestic theatres reopened 8/20 and int'l ones as early as June. However, most of Europe has been in lockdown since Nov/Dec 2020 and all domestics operate on a 20%-40% limited capacity. As of Oct 30th it operated 539/600 domestic locations and 261/358 int'l locations.\n\nRecord high scores in cleanliness of theatres.\n\nMarch 2020 raised $900m in debt and equity. $1bn concessions from creditors and landlords, $80m asset sales.\n\n* Q1 of 2020: drew down $325m from existing credit lines\n* April 2020: issued $500m of debt due 2025. Suspended cash repurchase and dividends. Received $7m in tax cash refunds\n* July 2020: debt exchange reduced debt by $555m, reduced interest expenses by $120m for one year (up to July 2022), extended maturities on $1.7bn of debt until 2026 and issued $300m of new debt due 2026.\n* August 2020: sold Baltic region theatres for $77m.\n* Sept 2020: sold 15m shares for $56.1m.\n* Oct 2020: sold another 15m shares for $41.6m.\n* Dec 2020: Prepared 50m shares for issuance, should they need to. Total shares outstanding on Dec 28 2020 were 164m Class A and 51.8m Class B.\n* Jan 2021: Total shares outstanding as of Jan 22 2021 were 287,276,58 Class A and 51.8m Class B (Class B can't be sold unless converted to Class A).\n* Jan 27th: SLA converts debt into equity and sells $600m worth of shares in the market. Total shares added to float: 44.4m. Debt reduced by $600m\n* Feb 5th 2020: Wanda converted it's class B shares to class A shares. This means they can sell them in the market at any time now. There is no specific # on how many shares it converted, but we know it owned 51.8m of Class B shares.\n\nOperationally they proceeded with layoffs and a series of cost cutting measures, renegotiated theatre leases, eliminate contractor roles and all sorts of expenses. **This is important as these savings will persist throughout the reopening of the theatres, so they will improve their profit margins going forward.**\n\n**Cash position on 9/30: $417.9m**\n\n**Total debt on 9/30: $5.82bn**\n\n**Q&A with myself**\n\n**Are people really returning to theatres?**\n\nAttendance was 6.5m tickets in Q3 2020 vs 87.1m in Q3 2019, representing about 7.5% of seating capacity, which was limited to about 20%-40% of total seats. While this may look like they are not utilizing their existing seating capacity, remember that theatre ops in USA were suspended for 2/3 of the 3rd quarter. I am guessing (no data) a similar restriction at the international theatres. Had ops not been suspended for 2/3 of Q3 then we'd be seeing roughly 3x the tickets, about 19.5m, or 22% of total seating capacity. That would suggest people were returning to cinemas before the end of Sept 2020. That's despite no blockbusters playing. **Only 2 films were released theatrically since mid-March to end of Sept and theatres were open mostly on weekends, so there wasn't much to watch anyway.**\n\n**Are people spending at the theatres?**\n\nAverage ticket prices in Q3 2020 were $9.37 VS. $9.45 in Q3 2019, so pretty much the same.\n\nIn Int'l markets ticket prices were actually higher, at $9.80 vs $8.45.\n\nSpending on food and beverage was the same in USA, at $5.35/patron in both Q3 2020 and Q3 2019, and higher in int'l markets ($4.10/patron vs. $3.59/patron in Q3 2019)\n\nAgain, that's positive in relation to how customers feel about AMC managing the cleaning of its theatres and safety practices. That level of spending suggests people are comfortable watching movies and eating/drinking in the theatres.\n\n**From the Q3 ER call:**\n\nThe critical movie-leading markets of Los Angeles and New York City remain closed.\n\nThere has been massive focus on improving liquidity and deleveraging the balance sheet and cutting costs and spending. **A lot of those cost saving and spending cuts will continue even after revenue recovers,** which means higher profit margins, which means higher EPS, which means lower multiples to comps, which means share price will go up as it will be perceived as 'cheap'.\n\nStroke a deal with Universal for a PVOD window. Basically, that means that AMC will not exclusive rights to play movies for 74 days at theatres before the movie can go on video-on-demand. The time window is shortened, and after that you will have movies both on theatres and on demand online at the same time. AMC will take a cut for any movies that go on PVOD before the theatrical release period ends. As they said later in November, they have made more money with the PVOD deal than the standard exclusive theatrical release.\n\nTheatre count in Middle East tripled in 2020, and it will further double in the first half of 2021.\n\nCash burn for Q3 2020 was $324m, inclusive of the costs for raising capital.\n\n**44 major film titles have been rescheduled to play theatrically only in 2021. Once theatres reopen, say in summer, there will be a blockbuster every single week and some more.**\n\nThey have gotten out of 40 loss-making theatres in USA as well by not renewing leases.\n\n**Breaking even?**\n\nIn 2019 AMC sold 17% of their available seats and had the biggest revenue/profit of any year ever. It all hinges to NYC and LA reopening basically as other individual theatres break even at 25% capacity. What this means is that you don't need COVID restrictions to lift fully before AMC starts making profits, you only need LA and NYC to reopen. This makes AMC a bit of a dark horse because most people will be waiting for full economy reopen before they jump at the stock, but its financials will be in the black long before then, and that means that it will most likely surprise upwards on ER going forward and exceed wallstreet's expectations.\n\n**Innovation. Ok, they will reopen, but will they grow?**\n\nThey have launched a private theatre rental program, where you can book the whole auditorium. They have had 80,000 incquiries about it, and that's with a soft launch (no press releases yet or advertising).\n\nThere have been a lot of articles in the second half of 2020 about Amazon or Netflix partnering or buying them out. That would drive the price high instantly. Bear in mind that the streaming giants are facing pressure on growing their market share and AMC makes perfect sense. Also, given their balance sheets the financial risk of buying AMC out at roughly $2bn market cap is negligible.\n\n**Won't streaming kill the movie theatres?**\n\nNo, absolutely not. AMC provided $43bn of revenue to film makers in 2019. No studio will forgo that kind of revenue. In fact, from the pilot testing of PVOD they've done, it's actually more lucrative for both theatres and studios to have a short exclusive theatrical release followed by concurrent streaming, than either/or. It's a new model of releasing movies and a much more profitable one. In summary, streaming will actually increase profits for AMC, not take away any.\n\n**Ok, that may be true for the big blockbuster Avenger-type movies, but what about smaller releases? won't they be best stream-only?**\n\nNo, they have tested the PVOD deal with small releases (e.g. Kajilionaire which made under $10m revenue in cinemas) and the combined profit for studios/AMC was higher than the older model or what it'd have done streaming alone.\n\n**Analyst ratings:**\n\nAccording to marketbeat: 4 sell and 6 hold\n\nAMC has the lowest, by far, P/E ratio against its competitors. This means it is perceived as cheap.\n\n**Earnings date: 25 Feb**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Major shareholders:**\n\n* Blackrock 2.9% (increased it's position by 70%)\n* Vanguard 4.5% (reduced its position slightly by -5%)\n* Mittleman 1%\n* Norther Trust 0.5% (increased position by 40%)\n* Stifel 0.2% (increase position by 285%)\n* Bank of NY Mellon 0.2%\n* Wells Fargo 0.15%\n* Charles Schwab 1% (increased its position by 10%)\n* Goldman Sachs 0.6% (increased position by 160%)\n\n**Risks:**\n\nFurther dilution in case AMC decides to sell more shares. This can be avoided if theatres start reopening faster or attendance picks up. With vaccinations underway in USA we should soon hear about LA and NYC reopening (NYC already lifte some restrictions in hospitality). People are worried about dilution, but do remember that shareholders were happy to pay high prices for those shares, so they believe they bought in cheap, and they aren't all idiots.\n\nDebt holders pushing hard on AMC. However, this is unlikely to their benefit as any restructuring will take forever and they stand to lose a lot through a prolonged asset sale. It's preferable for debt holders to convert debt to equity and sell - and for that they'd need a good/high stock price.\n\nFurther COVID lockdowns because of new variants or whatnot\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Catalysts**:\n\nDefinite: Vaccination roll out means NYC and LA announce reopening of theatres soon.\n\nPossible: Esports partnerships\n\nWho knows: Buyout or partnership with Netflix, Amazon or Disney\n\n**Other**\n\n* Short interest remains high, I believe it was around 68% on 1/31, but someone may correct me if I got this wrong. In any positive newsflow the shorts will be pressed a bit.\n* People are gagging to go to the cinema, AMC has had it's best revenue year after year up to 2019. They are not a dying business by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny error you see, or additional piece of info that would be useful, let me know and I'll edit accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# EDIT: follow up DD with more details and addressing most concerns: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpfti/amc\\_blockbuster\\_dd\\_the\\_sequel/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkpfti/amc_blockbuster_dd_the_sequel/)\n\n# Disclaimer: None of the above is investment advice.

And with all the debt and money they've raised that value can be estimated at over $15 billion. It shouldn't be worth more now than it was before anyone knew about the pandemic.\n* As the OP's DD described above, people weren't going to the movies even before the pandemic. Attendance was way down in 2019.\n   * Foot traffic was down by 8% in 2019 over 2018 and this has been a long trend for AMC.\n* Theaters are open now and people still aren't attending. Who wants to watch a movie with the chance of getting sick, wear a mask throughout the movie, and pay those prices when you could watch at home.\n   * Here's how they are doing attendance-wise since reopening in August:\n      * September: Down 88%\n      * October: Down 92%\n      * November: Down 93%\n      * December: Down 95%\n      * January: 93%\n* Big TV's are more accessible now than ever and streaming is easy. In fact many of the movies are getting released in the theaters and streaming services. Over time the movie theaters are losing patrons and not gaining them. This does not look good for long-term growth.\n* If the movie producers continue to offer streaming services in place or along side of theatrical releases, AMC is done by 2022. \n\nThe argument that once this pandemic is all over, people will be back in the theaters is compelling but based on the numbers, I doubt it. Less people were going to the theaters every year before the pandemic and when big movies like Wonder Woman and Tenent rolled out, no one came. They streamed the movies. \n\nAMC will just issues more shares and take on more debt to keep carrying them through this and that share price will keep gradually going down.
