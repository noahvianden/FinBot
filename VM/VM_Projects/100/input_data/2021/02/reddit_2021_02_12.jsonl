The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY\n\n**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**FAQs:**\n\n**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**\n\n**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.\n\n**2) Should I invest now or later?**\n\n**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP\n\n**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**\n\n**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.\n\n**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**\n\n**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n###**Now for the details.**\n\nRead this for DD on BB's achievements, certifications, markets, QNX products, EV growth, Spark software and clients, BB Radar, software pricing, and BB challenges:\n\n[Comprehensive Guide about BB and how it shall take off in coming years](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lc67bo/comprehensive_guide_about_bb_and_how_it_shall/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Full List of Clients and Partners:**\n\nBlackberry Clients and Partners\n\n**Automakers:** Honda, Audi, Jeep, Mitsubishi, Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamboghini, Byton, Mini (cooper), Toyota, Subaru, Fiat Chrysler, Mazda, Nio, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Kia, Land-Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Buick, Jaguar, Visteon, Skoda, Chevrolet, Nissan, Acura, Continental, General Motors, Baidu, Motional\n\n**Other:** Denso, Aptiv, Bosch, Panasonic, Harman, Bugatti, LG, Vodafone, Bell, Carahsoft, CACI, Telus, iSec, KPMG, Tableau, Qlik\n\n**Major:** Amazon, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, Li Auto, NVIDIA, Canoo, Microsoft, Intel, Verizon, Qualcomm, IBM, LG, Samsung\n\n**Major Investors:** PRIMECAP, Hamblin Watsa, Ontario Teachers’ Pension, Vanguard, Harris Associates, ETF Managers Group, Wells Capital, Arrowstreet Capital, Kahn Brothers Advisors, Norges Bank Investment\n\n**Governments:** Albania, Andorra, Angola, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Benin, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Canada, Congo, Croatia, Czech Republic, DR Congo, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Gibraltar, Greece, Guadeloupe, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Kuwait, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macau, Macedonia, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Malta, Marthinique, Mauritania, Mauritus, Mayotte, Mexico, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Netherlands Antilles, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Réunion, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Turkey, USA, Uganda, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Uruguay, Vatican City, Western Sahara, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry Current Revenues:**\n\n[BlackBerry Revenues: How Does BlackBerry Make Money? -- Trefis](https://www.trefis.com/stock/bb/articles/472099/blackberry-revenues-how-does-blackberry-make-money/2019-09-17)\n\n--> This display the biggest bearish argument to BB.

This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX\nmore commentary on this: [Analyzing Blackberry Bear Argument - Case No. 1: Ford Deal](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldcahf/analyzing_blackberry_bear_argument_case_no_1_ford/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n##**Pretty Charts**\n\n[The New BlackBerry Everyone is Talking About $BB](https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard/t.bb/blackberry-limited?postid=32093887)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Facebook Settlement with BB**\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)\n\nThis is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents.

Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry New Partnerships**\n\nWithin the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.\n\n[A sum-up of all the recent news on $BB](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lhpztu/a_sumup_of_all_the_recent_news_on_bb/)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**BB's Technical Page on QNX Security**\n\n[Link](http://support7.qnx.com/download/download/26406/QNX%20OS%20Security.pdf)\n\n--> Very technical.

It's quite revealing:\n\n[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)\n\n**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**\n\nAlright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)\n\nFor one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.\n\nAs for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)\n\nsee \"Is BlackBerry Stock Undervalued?\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\nsee \"Roadmap to $180 a share (BlackBerry Stock)\" by Wealthy Mindset on the forbidden video website\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**\n\nBlackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Really, no competitors?**\n\nWell it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n#**Conclusion:**\n\nAll eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.\n\nInitially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n*This is not financial advice, just my own opinions.

In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:\n\n*Bearish possibilities*:\n\n1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: \"What gives?\". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.\n\n2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs. Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market\n\n3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS. This means that if one part of the system goes down, it doesn't affect the other parts. Which is pretty critical for a product like a vehicle, making sure that a bug doesn't seize of up the whole car and cause it to become unresponsive and crash. Another related thing to security is just the general security of the company. How do we know BB will succeed? There is an easy answer here. Amazon. Amazon is *partnered* with BB. They could have just bought BB outright, but instead they made a 50/50 partnership. That is truly unprecedented. Amazon will want BB to succeed and will work to make it happen. Taking down BB will require taking down Amazon in part. And with their resources and capabilities.... good luck!\n\nThese are the top bearish concerns I could think of. They all have their merit, but they also have their own counter-arguments. I welcome anyone who also has bearish arguments to share. I learn the most from bearish arguments!

The idea behind the first book analogy is that you get a lot of attention and a lot of buys. It doesn't need to make the revenue. QNX is used in the majority of the EV market share, see the post content above on their clients, and in a huge number of governments. They *absolutely* smashed it in terms of customer acquisition. They are the predominant leaders in customer acquisition by a long shot.\n\n>QNX is secure but it at the end of the day just the hardware correct?\n\nQNX is software not hardware. \n\n>Companies will be pushing their own software to be compatible with that and will most likely try to implement their own software as it would give them much much more leverage and flexibility in any changes down the road.\n\nThis is very vague, but also the answer is no. What BB has done is no light task that any given company will put their hand into and try and develop. BB has been developing QNX for *7 years*. By the time any other company attempts to do something similar, BB will be installed on 90% of the market share for autonomous vehicles at this rate (I am speculating here). They have a moat on their OS for a reason.\n\nIt is to BB's advantage to both collect and sell data. That will be part of the package deal of auto makers using their IVY software. It benefits all parties: the automakers, BB, and industries that will buy the information. Also, BB has stated that IVY will be a subscription-based model. It will NOT be licensed, which is really important because the deal will allow for BB to take ownership of that data and sell it.\n\n>Apple will never use outside software or allow other companies to peek under the hood. They are super selective in their project as well.\n\nThis is very true.\n\n>Google has the capitol to achieve this by themselves. The 3 potential giants wouldn't be using this??\n\nGoogle and Apple in my opinion will be the two tech giants who are most likely to become competitors in this space, if at all. Both have similar problems, relating to the time, certification, and safety requirements and barriers. Both will have to overcome these factors as well as convincing others that their product is more secure than Blackberry's, which will not be an easy task.\n\n>Most embedded systems are designed this way.\n\nSuch as which ones?

However, Google's product does not use a microkernel\n\n>Amazon partners with thousands of companies it doesn't mean that they are going to be throwing their weight for BB.\n\nPerhaps we are using this word a different way. Amazon partners with lots of companies in less tangible ways, kind of like a 'you're doing great kid', kind of way. They do NOT partner with many companies when it comes to development. They usually outright buy these companies. The partnership with BB is a 50/50 split revenue development contractual partnership. They will not be able to easily pull out, nor will they have the incentive to. Jassy is a huge fan of Blackberry, and it's because he and Chen like to hang out on the weekend. He sees huge technical benefits in BB software, and realizes the need for their utilization.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your response. It is true that I am biased, so I really appreciate the feedback. I would still like to counter and expand on some of your thoughts:\n\n1) A plan to lose money sounds a bit harsh. Perhaps more of a plan that focuses on long-term growth rather than short-term is more appropriate. BB was on a downward trend to be sure, but as of this year they are reporting increased YoY revenues, and expect the same for 2021. [see this link](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BB/blackberry/revenue). I do think that their revenue models regarding QNX have been too safe. I think that they also commented on some of their mistakes regarding sales in an interview that I saw on a video website (not sure I can mention it here), but I don't particularly want to go digging for that link right now. You are absolutely correct in that their revenue and business model right now is not the best. I don't think it is liable to fail necessarily, but it is a glaring issue. The risk is in believing that they will be able to turn this around, that is, believing in that future market value. BB is definitely a short-term risk, but with exposure from Amazon, good things are likely to come\n\n2) This point is also very true! The major difference between then and now is that BB's biggest old competitors are now partnered with or working with or using BB products. It is very possible that Apple or Google (if I had to guess the most likely to compete head to head in the EV software OS space) could produce a product that could knock BB out of the market. The main reason I am not worried about this is based on incentive, certification, security, and time. Apple is a big company, but when such a company already as a very successful OS, do they really want to spend the resources to develop a new one, or optimize their current one? It could take multiple years to do, if they haven't started already, and by the 2023-2025 time period, it will be far too late. If they have started such a project, say multiple years ago, they would also need to get the project security and safety certified, which is no guarantee as well. Look at Tesla and their efforts in getting their OS certified. They're struggling. I encourage you to look into this if you haven't, this is no easy task. Additionally, let's say that Google or Apple or a different company does manage to produce and certify their product, in a short amount of time. When considering the potential liability of autonomous electric vehicles, are you, as an auto maker, going to choose to use the tech giant with a more recent, less-tested product, although it is certified, or a more-tested, better certified product, that is going to have the upper hand in security? Whereas products such as IoTs may not need that level of certification and security, it is essential in products that introduce more liability. This is why the US government continues to use Blackberry products rather than the bigger tech giants. Security is a liability, and they can't afford to pick a tech giant just because they have an app store that offers 'Candy Crush'\n\n3) You're wrong about the Amazon deal. You need to look at your primary sources again. This is a 50/50 split revenue and development partnership, not a license. This is very different than all of BB's previous clients. Amazon is not a client, but looking to utilize IVY software through integration and development with their AWS system. In what ways they will do this, we do not know yet, but we do know that the contract per their agreement is not a licensing one.\n\nI have no idea how you roped crypto into the argument.

If you're talking about bearish analysis, here's something I wrote from another comment:\n\nHere's my biggest bearish analysis. In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:\n\n*Bearish possibilities*:\n\n1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: \"What gives?\". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.\n\n2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs. Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies.

So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market.

In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:\n\n*Bearish possibilities*:\n\n1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: \"What gives?\". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.\n\n2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs. Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market\n\n3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS. This means that if one part of the system goes down, it doesn't affect the other parts. Which is pretty critical for a product like a vehicle, making sure that a bug doesn't seize of up the whole car and cause it to become unresponsive and crash. Another related thing to security is just the general security of the company. How do we know BB will succeed? There is an easy answer here. Amazon. Amazon is *partnered* with BB. They could have just bought BB outright, but instead they made a 50/50 partnership. That is truly unprecedented. Amazon will want BB to succeed and will work to make it happen. Taking down BB will require taking down Amazon in part. And with their resources and capabilities.... good luck!\n\nThese are the top bearish concerns I could think of. They all have their merit, but they also have their own counter-arguments. I welcome anyone who also has bearish arguments to share. I learn the most from bearish arguments!

I really appreciate it. I have been spending a lot of time these last few months researching and reading.\n\nHere's some bearish analysis from a different comment:\n\nCopied from a different comment:\n\nHere's my biggest bearish analysis. In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:\n\n*Bearish possibilities*:\n\n1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: \"What gives?\". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.\n\n2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs. Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market\n\n3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS.

In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:\n\n*Bearish possibilities*:\n\n1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: \"What gives?\". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.\n\n2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs. Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market\n\n3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS. This means that if one part of the system goes down, it doesn't affect the other parts. Which is pretty critical for a product like a vehicle, making sure that a bug doesn't seize of up the whole car and cause it to become unresponsive and crash. Another related thing to security is just the general security of the company. How do we know BB will succeed? There is an easy answer here. Amazon. Amazon is *partnered* with BB.

In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:\n\n*Bearish possibilities*:\n\n1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: \"What gives?\". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.\n\n2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs. Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market\n\n3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS. This means that if one part of the system goes down, it doesn't affect the other parts. Which is pretty critical for a product like a vehicle, making sure that a bug doesn't seize of up the whole car and cause it to become unresponsive and crash. Another related thing to security is just the general security of the company. How do we know BB will succeed? There is an easy answer here. Amazon. Amazon is *partnered* with BB. They could have just bought BB outright, but instead they made a 50/50 partnership. That is truly unprecedented. Amazon will want BB to succeed and will work to make it happen. Taking down BB will require taking down Amazon in part. And with their resources and capabilities.... good luck!\n\nThese are the top bearish concerns I could think of. They all have their merit, but they also have their own counter-arguments. I welcome anyone who also has bearish arguments to share. I learn the most from bearish arguments! However, simply stating that a company will do poorly without any evidence helps no one. So keep that in mind as you analyze this company or others\n\nAs to your point about Ford:\n\nIt was misinformation the media picked up on. Ford only changed infotainment systems.

And they also did disclaim that coronavirus has negatively impact their business.\n\nHere's some info on more cons:\n\nCopied from a different comment:\n\nHere's my biggest bearish analysis. In retrospect, I should have included this as well, but it slipped my mind. For me, bearish analysis is really important--only a bad investor would not want to consider both sides of the argument. Anyways, here it is:\n\n*Bearish possibilities*:\n\n1) *Revenue*- As mentioned in the main post, revenue is a big issue for initial investors. YoY growth has been disappointing for investors, particularly when looking at BB, which has so many clients and software products--the natural response should really be: \"What gives?\". QNX has been sold so far through one-time fees to clients. This has the advantage of easily grabbing new customers, but the disadvantage in that one-time fees is a horrible revenue model for a company. It requires constant customer acquisition YoY, or other revenue streams to support the model. BB does have other subscription-based revenue streams in their other products, but still lags behind in revenue compared to expectations (there's never a 'surge' in growth for this reason). The counter-argument here is that this is actually BB's plan in the first place. BB's disappointing and rather monetarily uneventful last 7 years was mostly spending developing their software and certifying it, as well acquiring new customers and governments. This helped them build a huge advantage in this emerging market before the big players really caught in to what was happening. They began developing technology ages before anyone else thought to, and now little to no competitors in the EV embedded RTOS space. But couldn't they have at least sold QNX for more, or perhaps for a subscription model? Perhaps, and perhaps they regret not instituting a different revenue model. But nevertheless, here's an analogy: Book authors and writers often sell their first book that they write in a series for free, or for a very low price. This is pretty common now for emerging authors who are trying to get noticed, particularly for e-books and selling in the online space. The first book isn't the money-maker, its the second. The second book is sold at full-price, as will the third, fourth, and fifth books should there be that many in the series. Once you buy the first book (or get the first book for free), you are hooked. You have to buy the second book if you enjoyed the first one. This analogy might be the same business strategy of BB. QNX is not the main product, but just the hook. IVY will be the big money maker, both that companies will want to use and also feel forced to use. IVY will run on top of QNX and will save the automaker lots of money, and BB will also make money from the automaker from a subscription-based model, and also from subscription models from selling data to different enterprises, such as insurance companies, governments, and other large institutions. So the bearish argument is valid in that BB's current revenue streams are weak, but the bearish argument may not hold up under new revenue models which will pick up over time.\n\n2) *Competitors*: BB has competitors in sectors such as cybersecruity and IoTs, but when it comes to the EV market, they have a huge moat. The bearish argument here is that BB is going to be crushed in all these sectors. So let's examine these possibilities. First off, BB has focused on security as their number one priority for their software products. This is the main reason why governments have readily adopted their software products into their products and military, including high-risk security products such as jets, rockets, and other computer-based technology. They are picked because they are the most secure. IoTs vary, and often times do not need the greatest amount of security. This sector will most likely be the one that experiences the most competition. Now for the EV market. Who is BB's biggest competitor in the EV RTOS market? Tesla? Apple? Google? VxWorks? Someone else? Tesla is building their own software based on Linux. They are having a lot of trouble certifying their software. A lot of trouble. This is important when it comes to autonomous EVs. Autonomous EVs will not be allowed on the road until they have the right certifications when it comes to security. QNX is the most certified and the most secure product out there by a mile. Tesla may achieve what they are looking for over time, but so far they have not gotten there. This is concerning for anyone looking for an alternative, but even more than this, Tesla is an auto maker, which means that other car companies are not going to use their OS product since Tesla is their competitor. This can immediate root out other auto makers from beings competitive threats as well. That leaves Apple and Google. Apple has not announced any such project, but they do have great software when it comes to security. However, they would still have to nearly build this product from the ground up, and this would take a lot of time and resources. Considering they were recently looking to teaming up with Hyundai to do this, it is probably safe to assume that they are way behind on this front. They will likely compete in the infotainment sector instead for EVs. Google most likely will be the single greatest competitor for this space. They have two products, AOSP and Android Automotive. Android Automotive is a similar RTOS, but lacks completely in certifications and security clearance. However, if you look into its technical details, it will become apparent that this product is actually being used and focused on more of an infotainment system as well. Just look it up on Wikipedia. So, where are we on the competitor front? There is VxWorks which is operating in eight different automotive related companies. However, if you look at the list, BB is also partnered with four of the eight companies that VxWorks is partnered with. Hmmm. So it remains unclear if they are truly competing with QNX or are focusing on other sectors in the market. VxWorks seems to have better focus on the IoT market, rather than the EV market\n\n3) *Security*: The big worry here is a big hack affecting BB software. Any software company is liable to hacks like this, but so far BB has a great track record. I won't go so far as gl say that they have never been hacked, but I will say that they haven't been hacked in such a way to cause massive damage (they used to sell phones and things, i wouldn't be surprised if there were issues there a long time ago). A big hack could severely damage BB as a company, but again, this could be said about any competitors for BB as well. BB is used because of its great security, not that it is completely indefensible. There will never be a software product that is completely indefensible. If it happens. BB will work to fix and recover the hack or error that occurred, and move on. Not much more can be said about such an event until it happens. QNX is well-poised to not experience any hack that in completely incapacitating due to it being an embedded microkernel RTOS. This means that if one part of the system goes down, it doesn't affect the other parts. Which is pretty critical for a product like a vehicle, making sure that a bug doesn't seize of up the whole car and cause it to become unresponsive and crash. Another related thing to security is just the general security of the company. How do we know BB will succeed? There is an easy answer here. Amazon. Amazon is *partnered* with BB. They could have just bought BB outright, but instead they made a 50/50 partnership. That is truly unprecedented. Amazon will want BB to succeed and will work to make it happen. Taking down BB will require taking down Amazon in part. And with their resources and capabilities.... good luck!\n\nThese are the top bearish concerns I could think of. They all have their merit, but they also have their own counter-arguments. I welcome anyone who also has bearish arguments to share. I learn the most from bearish arguments!

{"title": "Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together", "selftext": "TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. (This post has a lot of sources but in order to push this through I've had to remove most of the link, you can pm me for sources if you'd like)\n\nI was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:\n\nOne of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist. Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is covering using synthetic long shares or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.\n\nI’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started withreading SEC Regulation SHO which deals with naked short selling. “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”\n\nInteresting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.\n\nAccording to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**.\n\nIn a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent \"irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to \"the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**\" and that the SEC is \"concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**\"\n\nAs another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**.\n\nI also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create \"**phantom\" or \"counterfeit\" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a \"push\" into extinction from \"a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling\".\n\nAll these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.\n\nOn 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when RHood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at RHood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between RHoodand Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of RHoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.\n\nApparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to RHood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars. So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.\n\nThen I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These \"failures to deliver\" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.”\n\nApparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.”\n\n\"It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**.\n\nAs a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.\n\nFrom the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This \"phantom stock\" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”**\n\nFrom everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:\n\n* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122%\n* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close\n* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float\n* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares\n* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME\n* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.\n\nWith the GameStop hearings coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez [https://twitter.com/AOC](https://twitter.com/AOC), email: [us@ocasiocortez.com](mailto:us@ocasiocortez.com)\n\nAl Green [https://twitter.com/repalgreen](https://twitter.com/repalgreen), email: [al.green@mail.house.gov](mailto:al.green@mail.house.gov)\n\nMaxine Waters [https://twitter.com/maxinewaters](https://twitter.com/maxinewaters), email: [maxine.waters@mail.house.gov](mailto:maxine.waters@mail.house.gov)\n\nNancy Pelosi Email: [https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi](https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi) email: [sf.nancy@mail.house.gov](mailto:sf.nancy@mail.house.gov).\n\nAnd you can find other members of Financial Services Committee here to reach out to: [https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm](https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm)\n\n**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**\n\n**This brings up another interesting thought experiment a Redditor brought up: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**", "id": "likb1g", "created_utc": 1613162692.0, "score": 1165, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "> if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag.

The most likely and logical scenario is they're likely both aware, its a symbiotic relationship as hedge fund benefits from the illegal shorting and prime brokers benefit from fees or whatever arrangement they have:\n\n\"Bear in mind that in the case of illegal naked shorting, hedge funds have plausible deniability of wrong doing. They can simply claim that they are entering a short sale order and are not aware as to whether the order was executed with legal shorting or illegal naked shorting.

While this is a pretty solid legal argument, it is hard to imagine that these hedge funds are not totally aware that Prime Brokers will create counterfeit shares through illegal naked shorting to facilitate their stock manipulation schemes. There is reason to suspect collusion.\"\n\n*Taibbis 2009 article in rolling stone is really good for illustrating, I recommend you giving it a read https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/. Excerpt below:*\n\nAs time passed, Prime Brokers increasingly allowed their hedge-fund customers to use automated systems and “locate” the stock themselves. Now the conversation went something like this:\n\nEvil Hedge Fund: I just sold a million shares of Bear Stearns. Here, hold this shitload of money for me.\n\nPrime Broker: Awesome! Where did you borrow the shares from?\n\nEvil Hedge Fund: Oh, from Corrupt Broker. You know, Vinnie.\n\nPrime Broker: Oh, OK. Is he sure he can find those shares? Because, you know, there are rules.\n\nEvil Hedge Fund: Oh, yeah. You know Vinnie. He’s good for it.\n\nPrime Broker: Sweet!\n\nWhen one considers how easy it is for short-sellers to sell stock without delivering, it’s not hard to see how this can be such a profitable business for Prime Brokers. It’s really a license to print money, almost in the literal sense. As such, Prime Brokers have tended to be lax about making sure that their customers actually possess, or can even realistically find, the stock they’ve sold. That point is made abundantly clear by tapes obtained by Rolling Stone of recent meetings held by the compliance officers for big Prime Brokers like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank. Compliance officers are supposed to make sure that traders at their firms follow the rules — but in the tapes, they talk about how they routinely greenlight transactions they know are dicey.\n\nIn a conference held at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort in Phoenix in May 2008 — just over a month after Bear collapsed — a compliance officer for Goldman Sachs named Jonathan Breckenridge talks with his colleagues about how the firm’s customers use an automated program to report where they borrowed their stock from. The problem, he says, is the system allows short-sellers to enter anything they want in the text field, no matter how nonsensical — or even leave the field blank. “You can enter ABC, you can enter Go, you can enter Locate Goldman, you can enter whatever you want,” he says. “Three dots — I’ve actually seen that.”*", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "So this leads into understanding the purpose of a clearinghouse, which will provide you a clearer picture behind dtc’s motivation", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Can you elaborate?

The point he is making is different one to one you responded to.\n\nWhen the clearing house accepts a transaction that involves a short sale of stock, the OP is saying that DTCC have a responsibility to record who the stock is borrowed from. When the broker is shorting the stock they have to reasonably believe that they can receive the stock in future from the borrower. OP is saying DTCC is turning a blind eye to brokers saying they can borrow shares from a borrower who even DTCC knows is unlikely to be possible (This is evident in the GME case because greater than 100% shares were already short- if this the case where does DTCC think they are getting these shares from?).\n\nTo be honest, it’s not clear to me that it’s DTCC’s responsibility to reject a trade if they don’t reasonably believe the short seller can actually borrow that stock or not (arguably a good way to manage this is by setting a 100% collateral limit, which is what we saw happen). Maybe the regulator needs to step-in to adjudicate on who’s breached the regulations? However I do agree with OP that this is a failure of the system in some sense, and we need answers to understand why short selling can still continue when greater than 100% of shares are already short. DTCC should respond to this point.\n\nClearly DTCC understand the risk to some extent which is why collateral limits were raised to 100%, and I actually think the majority of short selling comes from market makers, so DTCC might even argue that they need to accept short selling transactions as it maintains a liquid market. It doesn’t help that DTCC has essentially a monopoly on that business, with 95% of the market apparently though, so I think it is right to view how they acted with caution.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">When the clearing house accepts a transaction that involves a short sale of stock, the OP is saying that DTCC have a responsibility to record who the stock is borrowed from. \n\nThis isn't accurate, maybe OP is saying that's what *should* happen, but it's not what happens.\n\nThere are other settlement systems outside of DTC, so DTC can't reasonably know where you received your stock from.

I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”\n\nHe added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.\n\nBut then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:\n\n“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”.

(I'm ignoring the very high latitude polar regions for now - very low population and Starlink will cover them anyway.)\n\nIt's much, much cheaper to expand Starlink than to expand existing intercontinental fiber networks.\n\nFor this reason it's also much faster to expand.\n----\n\n**2)** Starlink is the ideal mobile network data carrier.\n\nStarlink enables 'self-contained' cellular mobile network macro and micro-cells. The ~5 msecs short distance latency is still perfect for voice or data networks.\n\nIndividual cells on the ground can be installed in low cost areas, and they don't require a connection to existing fiber networks. They don't even require an electricity source in more remote locations, if backed by solar power and overnight battery backup.\n----\n\n**3)** Starlink allows the breaking of urban Internet monopolies. (!)\n\nWith cable Internet being a monopoly in most of the US, they are ripe for disruption even in urban centers.\n\nIf Starlink is able to allocate its own frequency spectrum, and can be used to create urban mobile cells, then they can offer broadband internet to customers even without a Starlink receiver. The 'last mile' monopoly can be broken via mobile networks.\n\nThis can scale Internet services to arbitrary densely populated urban centers as well.\n\nI expect Starlink's frequencies to be a big fight for this reason ...\n\n----\n\n**4)** Starlink access increases the value of non-urban real-estate.\n\nWith Covid removing the corporate reluctance from work-from-home approaches, and moving more of the entertainment industry (movies, etc.) online, the physical location of about ~50% of the workforce in modern economies can be anywhere in the country or even on the globe.

A small but wealthy minority might prefer to move to scenic locations, if broadband Internet connection is given.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR:** The quadruple forces of superior scaling & coverage costs, the ability to compete with terrestrial Internet services even in urban centers, and the economic value-add of democratizing Internet access to remote locations will be a powerful force IMO.\n\nThe end state will be that IMO a couple of space Internet constellations will cover all communications requirements of Earth, and terrestrial fiber becomes an obsolete hindrance to a legacy network that new construction projects will skip.\n\nThat's a couple of decades out still.\n\nAnyway, many of these economic forces are short-term in nature, and thus the Starlink IPO will be a very nice opportunity for long-term investors to enter into this disruption process. 🤠", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Haha, you triggered a favorite topic of mine - Starlink constellation physics & economics, and I had some time to spend on this as well. 🤠\n\nHere's my abbreviated Starlink thesis (split into multiple comments):\n\n#**Starlink Internet advantages, physics:**\n\n**1)** Starlink has a fundamental long distance latency advantage:\n\n- Speed of light in the overwhelming majority of fiber is 70% - it's 100% in space. So even in a straight line Starlink has an advantage.\n- But fiber is rarely laid in a straight line. \n- Fiber loss requires periodic repeater-amplifiers which add to optical latency. Starlink line of sight laser cross-links.\n- Fiber can in principle hug the curvature of the planet closer and create shorter connections - in practice fiber links are much longer.\n\nTo give a practical example that should be beneficial to fiber networks: the New York to Frankfurt Internet connection is almost straight line, on the bottom of the Atlantic.\n\nYet actual practical ping round-trip times are ~88 msec:\n\n> https://wondernetwork.com/pings/New%20York/Frankfurt\n\nWith Starlink, if we assume the long-term ~350 km altitude of their orbits and a reasonably dense network of 10,000+ satellites, then the estimated line of sight Starlink distance between New York and London is:\n\n    (350 km + 6,440 km + 350 km + 50 km) × 2 = 14,380 km\n\nThat's with 5 hops and a ~50 km positioning fuzz, because the constellation won't be 100% dense.\n\nIf we estimate low-latency equipment of <10μs at each hop, and a speed of light of 299,792 km/sec, then we get a photon propagation Starlink round-trip latency of:\n\n    14,380 km ÷ 299,792 km/s  = 47.96 msec\n\nIf we add in the 5 hops of 0.01 msecs each, we get to around 48 msecs latency - almost twice as fast as a fiber optical connection of 88 msecs.\n\nBut New York and Frankfurt are two financial centers, where 90% of the distance can be crossed on fiber optical cables laid in an almost straight line at the bottom of the Atlantic, i.e. they are connected via almost line of sight fiber connections.\n\nLet's take two less optimally connected first-world capitals, say Helsinki to Taipei:\n\n> https://wondernetwork.com/pings/Helsinki/Taipei\n\n373 msec best-case ping latency.\n\nWith Starlink (I'll spare you the calculation details), it's 58 msecs (!) - more than 6x faster.\n\nThere are even less optimally connected capitals - say Buenos Aires to Shenzen, or Wellington (NZ) to Mumbai - both above 500 msecs today.\n\nSo for long-distance Internet backbone connections - **even if you live within an urban center**, Starlink is the superior solution.\n\nThe break-even point between Starlink and terrestrial fiber connections is somewhere around ~700 km distance.\n\n----\n\n**2)** Data Center distance advantage:\n\nMost Internet users interact with some sort of datacenter - Google servers, YouTube or Netflix, placed near population centers.\n\nIf we check the density of say Google's data centers, we get such a map:\n\n> https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/\n\n90% of the world population is actually outside the 700 km circle of all Google data centers - **even if they live in urban centers**.\n\n----\n\n**3)** Data center location advantage:\n\nThis is a longer-term advantage, but if you think it through then it will make sense for SpaceX to put data centers into space:\n\n- infinite energy source (solar),\n- no weather impact,\n- perfect global distribution of resources by way of orbital mechanics.\n\nIn this case the break-even distance circle to the nearest data center is reduced to around ~350 km. Even fewer people live within 350 km of the Internet data centers they are using, especially if we factor in fiber network layout inefficiencies.\n\n----\n\n**TL;DR**: on the physics side, Starlink is essentially unbeatable in terms of offering low latency global Internet infrastructure. All large carriers will be using it, and I believe developing countries will prefer to connect to Starlink, not just because it's much, less expensive, but also because it gives them a superior connection on equal terms with everyone else - the \"democracy of orbital mechanics\".\n\nIt will be **fiber** that will be a niche in the long run: for short distance communication between specialist projects that need to be connected via a public fiber network.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Talking about the guy who predicted the banks to fail and the fall of the housing market in 08", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "And the gamestop squeeze iirc", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Before or after the split lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I feel like most people on these subs seem to think it'll go up forever. -\\_- I definitely think it's okay to stay in your position if you got in early but I wouldn't enter into one now.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "That's an executive summary of the last 10 years of the AAPL and AMZN bear theses: \"overvalued\", while not properly estimating growth potential.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "In 2010 AAPL had a pe ratio of 17, tesla has one of over 1000, dont even try to compare these two.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> In 2010 AAPL had a pe ratio of 17, tesla has one of over 1000, dont even try to compare these two.\n\n**1)** Just to demonstrate how silly your P/E valuation argument is: early 2016 Amazon GAAP P/E ratio was **482** and it was trading at $550.

If the propeller spins too fast the tips will go supersonic and the shockwaves will put a lot of strain on the propellers. Electric GA aircraft are feasible if we find something significantly better than lithium-ion, but large aircraft won't move past combustion engines in our lifetime.\n\nAdoption of electric GA aircraft will also be much slower than cars. First of all, the pace of technology in aviation is significantly slower. The C172 was first made in the 50s and are still being made today. I've flown C172s built anywhere from the 60s to the early 2000s and they're about the same. Certifying an aircraft with the FAA takes years and costs insane amounts of money, so we're still flying the same aircraft our grandparents learned to fly in. \n\nIn addition to this, the incentive to move to electric planes isn't as strong. Electric cars can make up for the lower energy density of batteries compared to gasoline with regenerative braking. Planes use drag to bleed off kinetic energy, so the amount of energy that can be recovered is much lower. At oshkosh 2019 I talked with the representative of a company that converts aircraft to electric. They had the ability to recapture some power from the windmilling propeller, but I asked them how much energy they could recover, and they said 'not much at all, but the propeller is going to windmill, and the energy is there'.

At that time, I was just starting to have enough capital for speculative share purchases.  \n\nHere's a summary of what I planned:\n\n* I'd keep at least 6 months expenses in cash as an emergency fund, so that I wouldn't be forced to immediately sell volatile assets if markets declined and I was simultaneously out of a job.  No YOLO plays with emergency cash. \n* Keep my retirement accounts in low-cost Index Funds.  I resolved not to jeopardize my future retirement if my decision on TSLA turned out to be incorrect.  No YOLO plays with retirement funds.   \n* I would sell TSLA shares only under specific conditions: (1) I no longer believed that the company's value would increase, and that my capital was better invested somewhere else, (2)  I needed cash for a large purchase such as a home or vehicle, (3)  I was no longer comfortable with my asset allocation in TSLA and wanted to re-balance into other assets to reduce risk. \n\nThe first 2 points were specifically deigned so that I wouldn't have to worry if the stock had a steep decline (50% or greater).  Short term volatility would have no effect on my ability to pay bills, and I would have zero concern that my retirement funds would ever be in jeopardy from the investment in TSLA.  Stock declines 50% for reasons unrelated to why I invested in the company?  I don't care because I can ride out the FUD or other temporary problem.  \n\nThe third point was to define my exit strategy.  I set no price target.  When I exit is entirely dependent on my evaluation of the direction of the company and my financial needs.  I made this decision in order to avoid the possibility of \"locking in gains\" and selling too low.   Also to minimize regret of selling too low if I needed to buy something like a house.  If I needed to cash out some, I would cash out -- no regrets.  \n\nHope this makes sense.

But even had I known, I'm not sure I would have bought TSLA in an IRA back then.  The company was incredibly speculative in 2011 and 2012.  This was before the first Model S had even left the Fremont factory.\n\nGenerally, I believe the best plan for each investor, is an individually customized plan that allows them to rest easy at night.  Everyone has different goals and risk tolerance. \n\nFor myself personally, I know that I would be far too stressed over short term options and GameStop type plays, so I deliberately avoid those as part of my strategy.

So to limit the upside for Tesla by institutions that want to slow tesla down, keeping a lid on the share price makes sense. If right, this goes away next week.\n\n* Reduce options volatility.

But the share price is not cooperating due to low supply. Shorting is a bad idea with the current prospect of Bidens green energy focus and teslas undeniable expansion.

It's kind of like running a marathon, except there's no marked course and no one's sure exactly where the finish line is.\n\nI'd say there's four companies that have a decent chance of really solving self driving. Besides Tesla and Waymo, there's Cruise and Mobileye. They're all taking different approaches (with Waymo and Cruise being the most similar), and they've all made really good progress, while other companies have slowed down or quit. And I think they're all probably capable of doing fully driverless trips in some areas or routes.\n\nWe don't know yet what will really be the best solution, and since these four are doing things differently, there's a good chance one of them will figure it out. And it's also possible all four will be able to essentially solve the problem in different ways:\n\n* Waymo is doing fully driverless rides for the public already, but relies on HD maps, and could potential have problems with weather and places where road markings/conditions aren't as good. They also have Google's tech, and probably money, to rely on\n* Cruise made very fast progress, and has been doing a lot of testing in difficult cities. Plus they've got GM's resources for manufacturing and cash\n* Mobileye is doing a very interesting split between using cameras and using lidar to verify results. Plus they've been showing driving in extremely challenging traffic\n* Tesla is the only one that's not relying on lidar or HD maps at all, so they're heading towards a very different potential solution than the rest. They're also the only ones with lots of hardware on the road, and are already doing a public beta\n\nThere's also probably a dozen or more other companies that are working on the problem, but haven't shown any real results yet. Most of them probably don't have a real chance, but there might be someone that's just being very secretive? Or someone might stumble on a great solution others have missed?\n\nIf lidar turns out to be really important, Tesla will probably have problems. If lidar is a crutch, then Tesla is probably ahead. But maybe lidar is a possible part of the solution, in which case google is probably furthest along in that direction.\n\nBut if we assume that FSD is a solvable problem that's one or more companies are going to figure out in the next 5 years or so, then Tesla is way ahead. Just because they've got over a million cars already on the road, that's several years of manufacturing that they've done already, and every year they add more cars to the fleet.

In fact, there's every likelihood that the lack of control will be a problem for them. Right now, how much utility does the ability to follow the money have vs. immutability?  How many of the regulations and control structures that bitcoin specifically tries to avoid are actually there for good reasons? I don't think the mainstream is ever going to really prefer immutability vs. regulation and control.\n\nSure, there are hardware wallets and a few things that try to avoid some issues.  What happens if those fail or get lost?  Do the non-power users actually understand how to back up their private key / recovery seeds with hardware wallets and how to store that backup safely?  Or are they going to lose that backup 10 minutes after they make it?\n\nAs bitcoin moves from power users and enthusiasts to everyday people, all the little details about how to manage crypto safely and securely are going to be ignored, forgotten, or never understood in the first place.\n\nSo...

In the vast majority of cases, there's not even that.\n\nIdentify theft... well, ok. I'll give you that one for now. However, you don't need crypto for that. At least, not a cryptocurrency.  Europe's done way better with credit cards than the US for sure... but a lot more can be done. Crypto isn't the only game in town.\n\nA lot of that stuff goes away with proper usage of digital signatures. Modern credit cards are doing a lot of the same hardware token public key private key authentication. IMHO they're better... because it's just a key tied to that card and not your account. When you lose the key, the bank sends you a new card with a new key. You don't lose access to anything. As smartcard-like security tokens become more widely adopted, the traditional financial platforms will become more secure and yet maintain the accountability, visibility, and reversibility that regulated currencies provide.\n\nIf the financial world (or more practically governments) would just wake TF up and actually push for use of authentication protocols and standards that would mandate you authenticate transactions digitally (pick a standard or make one like Google Pay that is not tied to any specific company) then we could finally get away from the ridiculously insecure credit card number/expiration date/security code crap we are currently using.\n\nI LOVE pubkey private key stuff.

{"title": "Why you shouldn't secure your puts with cash: The SPAC-secured Put", "selftext": "Now I'm not saying don't sell cash secured puts, I'm saying don't hold the cash after you sell the puts. Instead, use that cash to buy near NAV SPACs. \n\nFor those who don't know, SPACs are blank check companies whose purpose is to bring a private company public via reverse merger. The important thing to know for this strategy, though, is that the money raised by SPACs is held in trusts. When a SPAC finds a company to merge with, shareholders get to A) vote in the merger, and B) are able to redeem their shares for cash at NAV (net asset value). For almost all SPACs, NAV= $10 + a small amount of interest that accumulates offer the life of the trust. \n\nThis effectively creates a hard price floor of $10. While they can and occasionally do fall below this, it is rare and the share price never stays there for long. During the crash in March, some went to like $9.50, but pretty much all recovered back above $10 within a couple weeks. \n\nSo, the point of all this is that near NAV SPACs have extremely limited risk. If I buy a spac at $10.20, my maximum downside is 2%, if that. On the other hand, their upside is limitless. One was up 15x from $10 at once point. This makes SPACs the perfect cash park. \n\nBy buying SPACs with the cash you were using to secure puts, you expose yourself to the daily potential for 20-30%+ gains if you get lucky and a merger is announced while you're holding a specific SPAC, with the aforementioned marginal downside risk. \n\nIf you get assigned on your puts, you can simply sell the SPACs you bought and wheel the assigned shares like normal. Maybe you lose a few dollars on the SPACs here and there, but usually you'll make a small profit, and occasionally you'll make huge profits. Some weeks you'll make more money from theta gains, some it'll be SPACs, but the point is you'll be earning from both as opposed to just one, all without really increasing your risk levels. \n\nThis strategy technically uses margin buying power, but your cash balance always stays positive, and you aren't charged margin interest.\n\nDisclaimer: not a financial advisor\n\nEdit: r/SPACs is a great resource and the mods generally do a great job\n\nEdit2: it appears this strategy won't work with all brokers. I use Webull (options level 3) and it works exactly as I described without being charged any interest for margin, and there's the added benefit of 0 options fees (and that's really for everything $0).", "id": "lie23p", "created_utc": 1613145877.0, "score": 113, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 134, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "Both of those are easily addressed.

However when you do this you have to give maintenance of 25% to 100% depending on how dangerous the stock is, so you lose some buying power.\n\nAlso now that the stock is backing your options trades a huge decrease in the stock could lower your available margin to the point you get a margin call.  Also it could go way up and increase your margin value.  So you need to be careful exactly what stock positions you are taking and what your total collateral make up is in your account.\n\nYou never want to put 100% of your collateral into one thing.

For the smoothbrains that means CRSR is about to go 🚀🚀", "selftext": "I've been posting my retarded YOLO play on CRSR .\n Position: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhqgxt/crsr_postiv_crush_discount_yolo_211_am_update/ \n\n100 x 3/19 70C + \n500 shares avg $39.5\n\nAm I really eating crayons? Yes, I butt-chugged a 60 pack of Crayola this morning so DYOR and decide for yourself.\n\nFirst and only thing you really need to know is **RGB = buy.**\n\nBut since this sub has been infiltrated by FUD-filled, paper handed wrinklebrain-bears, heres why I am on my way to the moon and it’s not too late for you...\n\n*********************** \n**RECAP**\n\nBreif history of CRSR, the stock blew up post IPO from $17, riding epic gaming industry performance throughout the pandemic.  It hit a high above $51 in Sept '20 before correcting and trading between $41 and $36. The float is low so swings are volatile. Also lots of short volume bla bla\n\n**1/13** - a little stock called G M E more than doubled in a day causing to CRSR tank to $36 with some momentum. Possibly a direct result of liquidation in reaction to the squeeze (maybe retail and/or institutional....Citadel is 2% owner of CRSR float)... or maybe just normal volatility fluctuation by the puppet masters, who knows?\n\nCool, so now the stock is oversold with puny market cap. It starts climbing back to the average peak levels, then ...\n\n**1/27** - CRSR announces a secondary PO of 7.5 million shares...it hits a high of $49, before a 2 day selloff.  Crash Boogaloo.\n\nAfter the selloff it picks up momentum running up to the 2/9 earnings report, with expectations of excellent numbers. IV is through the roof. Debate kicks off whether earnings are already priced in and an IV crush was inevitable.\n\n**2/9**  -  **CRSR delivers an amazing earnings report.** EPS beats estimates, $1.7B revenue for the year, profit margins way up, debt is down, and they said THEY HAVE SO MUCH DEMAND THEY CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH IT. The only thing that kept them from possibly crossing $2B was semiconductor supply shortages (which every other tech company is dealing with too).\n\n After this amazing ER, the stock tops out at about $48 premarket....before nosediving, nearly hitting $40. \n\nNow many were saying that the runup to the ER was all just hype, so of course it tanked post ER like LOGI AMD and all the rest. \n\nBut looking at what actually happned, it wasn't actually just hype. The pre-ER runup was almost all attributable to upward correction from the previous 2 selloffs.  The only reason it crashed was because other companies crashed post earnings in 2021, so paper hands sold in expectation of the IV crush...sell limits were triggered, self-fulfilling prophecy.   \n\nSo the price starts to fall into oversold territory. Quote from Barron's \"Of the 11 analysts that cover the stock 10 rate it a Buy, and one has a Hold rating on the name.\" Literally almost everyone thinks this thing is a bull. Price is already starting to completely recover by Close on 2/9\n\nBut then yesterday some genius at Goldman decides to downgrade the stock to \"Neutral\" from \"Buy\", causing the selloff to dip even lower, hitting just above $40. Their justification? They think gaming demand could wane in 2021, and also are worried about the fact that CRSR hasn't been able to meet 100% of demand due to shortages of chimps. (ha!)\n\n**************************************************************************\n**CURRENT SITUATION**\n\nThat brings us to today. CRSR is way oversold. $1.7B profitable revenue...yet $3.9B market cap for a fast-growth tech company? pitiful. Almost every analyst, including Goldman, has increased their price targets, many above $50. \n\nCompare that to LOGI..$2.9B revenue ($4.4B+ TTM), at $19.9B market cap and climbing fast.  Speaking of LOGI, check out this [chart](https://imgur.com/3ORH329). **1/19 Post-Earnings dip, before running to ATH 2 weeks later.** \n\nBut CRSR price is still down, why my neuro-atypical friends?\n\nMaybe has to do with the fact that the daily short volume has been above 50% every day? http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html \n\nOr maybe a bunch of boomer bears actually think the gaming industry will really pull back (we've already seen this isn't going to happen anytime soon.)\n\nBut pressure is easing, as of 1/29, short interest dropped 44% from the previous report. And daily short volume dipped below 50% yesterday for the first time in months (this isn't a squeeze play, this means that short downward pressure is backing off).  IVs starting to return to earth.\n\nAnd what also happened today? The P OTUS just [announced](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order) by executive order they're launching an initiative to ease the semiconductor shortage as a top priority. Exactly the thing holding back CRSR from meeting full demand, and one of the factors leading to Goldman downgrade.  \n\nThe gaming industry is not magically going to drop from the sky as soon as the the pandemic eases. We all know new players get hooked, and there are tens of millions of them since last year. The more they game the more they’ll be looking to buy new gear. They will continue to game even if they start traveling or going to restaurants more. \n\nThey also currently have a big stake in the streaming market, which 1000% isn't going away\n\nWithout the shortages, there's nothing holding this company back from achieving full earnings potential. \n\nWith the rest of the rockstar fundamentals, this is a $65-$70 stock EASY. You will not beat this entry point. \n\nVery minimal risk with a shares play on this at the very least. \n\n**TL;DR** RGB = Buy. Get on the 🚀. You’ll thank me in a month. \n\nOr don’t listen to me because that 60 pack was just breakfast. DYOR\n\n**Clarification for all the recently acquired WSB dipshits confused how a stock could be good without 200% short interest and near bankruptcy fundamentals, this isn't a squeeze play...short pressure is backing off because they know it has actual legs.**", "id": "lhywc2", "created_utc": 1613088892.0, "score": 2506, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 681, "comments": [{"body": "Goldman thinks gaming demand could wane in 2021?

Share lock-up ends soon, many people are anticipating employees selling their stock onto the open market. Not technically dilutive, but a likely sell-off that will increase the float\n2. Biden will not be able to relieve the chip shortage for CRSR. ~~Most of the chips CRSR sells are high end gaming.  All that shit is made oversees by Samsung and TSMC~~. Bidens concern is the auto industry as F and GM are looking at large production halts. They use a much wider array of chips from a wider array of suppliers both oversees and domestically.\n\nEdit: Okay I was focusing more on gaming GPUs for CRSR, but my point still stands on big auto taking priority.\n\nIf you want a play on Biden relieving supply, you're barking up the wrong tree", "score": 93, "replies": [{"body": "They have sold off millions of shares on 1/27", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "That wasn’t the lockup period that was scheduled 180 days post prospectus.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I know, just stating that insiders were dumping shares on the 27th", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I’m not worried about lockup period.... if it dips it won’t be hard if there’s momentum at that point. \n\nI’m not sure your point is valid about the chips. In fact some of the chips used in consumer electronics are the very same used in automobiles (especially things like MCUs). Not something like a smart phone which uses much higher tech chips, but something like a Corsair keyboard or headset that doesn’t require a lot of umph.\n\nRegardless, As I understand this problem runs all the way up the supply chain. Consumer electronics, automobile, and everyone else are competing for the same suppliers, even if  chips are different they’re bottlenecking at the source in China/Tawain etc\n\nHere’s a good article on it: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Fair point, but Biden admin didn't make this announcement until big auto announced production shutdowns. \"Analyzing supply chain\" short term means prioritization.

CRSR would fall low on the pecking order....if the gov't even has the reach.\n\nAll depends on how he decides to approach it in the end, but I think semi-conductor companies stand to benefit more than CRSR if Biden starts throwing money at the problem.\n\nPositions: shares/options on  MU  ON  INTC  AMD  SHC, not financial advice", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I'm buying calls for $ON first thing in the morning.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "AMAT skyed for me today, since December really.

Even state of the art DRAM (one of their most technically advanced product lines), is using older processes, 15nm and up.

And even though they don't break it down on thr earnings call, I'd be surprised if RAM of all things is a big factor in Corsair's sales, they have quite a bit of good competition there.\n\nThe high end processes are something like TSMC's 7nm and below. There's a shortage there as well, but not so prominent, as big players which need it (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, etc etc) have reserved capacity well in advance anyway, and these chips are expensive, so not a lot of places where they can be used, except when you need the absolute best in performance per cm2. This is basically just PC/console CPUs and GPUs, maybe some motherboard ICs and SSDs (have no idea about the manufacturing of SSDs so). \n\nOn the other hand, PSUs, DRAM, headsets, keyboards, mouses, stream decks and all the other shit CRSR sells uses cheap legacy nodes for its ICs, because they're not really very complicated or compute-intensive chips and so it's much better if they are cheap than efficient. These categories are a race to the bottom anyway, no matter how high end your brand is. This is what the automotive industry needs as well, and what Biden wants to relieve. \n\nThe shortage there is a much bigger problem, but also easier to solve, as there's a metric fuckton of fabs doing these old nodes, even in the US. A bit of capital injection to build more capacity (where it makes sense) can go a long way.\n\nNow the risk of being bullish on CRSR just because of that is that the admin might do the absolute minimum to unblock automotive and related boomer industries, and it might still take some time until CRSR finds some capacity for their stuff even after your gov steps in.\n\nSo make of this whatever you want, I'm not a WSB regular, just have a little bit of knowledge about chip manufacturing.

TSLA's all-time PE graph should not be compared to AMZN's all-time PE graph - the 2 companies are not in the same stage. Rather, TSLA's graph is comparable to AMZN's graph between 2012-2013. \n\nI'll reiterate. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how PE works. No company in growth stage will have low, stable PEs. The nature of a growth company is high YoY growth, low/negative profit. By extension, their PEs will be overstated due to low earnings. As the company grows and matures, their earnings increase and PE comes down. This is the natural business cycle of a company, something which seems to have flown entirely over your head.\n\nImagine thinking you can use one broad paint stroke to compare every company.

Corsair makes shitty RGB products, sells decent PSUs made my Chinese OEMs, and a bunch of corny gamer related products. Is the lack of a new shiny GPU or CPU preventing John Q Gamer from buying a headset? No. A dumb RGB RAM cover or rebadged Asetek AIO? No. A PSU? Sure, if he doesn't have the an RTX 3090 then he doesn't need that 1300W PSU (and there are separate PSU shortages right now). So you've got one out of three main product lines impacted.\n\nMight Corsair go up with the market and with Zoomer/Millennial stimulus checks? Sure, but so will most everything else. That's not an outperform argument, its a clue to look elsewhere.\n\nLastly, it takes two years to build a fab. Even if TSMC broke ground right away (which they did 6m ago actually) to address the semiconductor shortage, PS5 and Xbox demand will be past its peak in 18-24m. Silicon will already be flowing into GPUs and CPUs even without the new fab, but at least this will help with older 10-40nm that PCIe devices, IoT, and car manufacturers need.\n\nRecap: Don't buy what this guy is selling.

To your point, the assets are depreciating, but when you are holding a property there are a lot of expenses. Taxes, utilities, insurance to name a few.

I expect that is less common with many counties now having all recorded title transfers posted online. I’ve done a lot of research of properties through county databases, it’s a bit messy for some properties, but most builds post 2000 are cut and dry.\n\nThe lawyers paperwork is copy paste, the contracts are nearly identical for most homes, and would be identical for Opendoor.

Fucking semiconductors. You know what that shit does? CPUs baby, basically everything electronic needs this. This industry is the foundation, the building block of all of tech.\n\nGuess what, INTC designs their own chips but more importantly they produce them. Listen carefully this part is important apes, Intel is the only western fab that has any relevance. Intel's competition in production is TSMC. A fucking Taiwanese company, which basically means at any moment it could be a Chinese company (In case any of you decide to look at world affairs and geopolitics). Intel is red, white and blue, an American stonk. Ill let you guys mull that over in your big brains.\n\nLiterally go look at any major cap tech company and look at the parabolas that have been formed (AMD, NVDA included). Parabolas most of you didnt enjoy. Well Intel is a parabola you can still enjoy. Im posting today as it is up 2% and has just passed 60$ an important milestone if you care about shit like technical analysis and the Wizard of Oz. I also know you guys dont like to buy things when they are in the red because you have simple circuit breaker brains, but Intel actually literally cant go tits up. Buy calls if you are a degenerate and you are (IV is low so super cheap still), alternatively just buy and hold and in a few months its 50-100% up.\n\nMost of you guys and girls dont know what a 10k or a 10q is but if you have any curiosity go read the balance sheet and income statement of Intels last quarter. This is the titan of titans, its finances are superb. Low debt, high equity, large and growing revenues in the most valuable and ever growing industry in the world. But thats enough fundamentals for WSB.\n\nIntel is still under the radar of most degens and the euphoria of the current market. It will gain favor, and it will gain favor soon. Do yourself a favor and buy INTC now and not at 100$ when its literally 30$ over all time high.\n\nI didnt mention it, but there is a chip shortage, and Patrick Gelsinger (one of the smartest people in silicon valley) is taking over this giant on the 15th. I guarantee this stonk will moon, might even break the trillion dollar barrier in the next year.\n\nIm long INTC with 1700 shares and 500 April 18th 80$ strike calls.\n\nPS: I told one of my girlfriends husband to buy INTC but all he wants to do is HODL sun fucking dial.

($BB)", "selftext": "Listen up reta.....err, I mean memelords.   I know we’ve all moved on from the meme era into the weed era (and  hopefully people stick around that one due to the fundamentals for a  while, but if not....) and soon to be a redux of the vehicle era, but  there’s one meme stonk we need to have a real, honest heart-to-heart  about (and hey, it even ties into cars):  Let’s talk about Blackberry  ($BB)\n\n# First,  let’s get some misconceptions out of the way: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBlackberry was never a  short squeeze stonk, even though it ended up getting roped in with the  other squeezers we were denied squozing  because of Wall Street cheating.  A lot of people thought it was and  that’s simply not the case.  Blackberry was, is, and always will be, a  phoenix rising from the ashes story, nostalgia peppered with  functionality.  You know, kind of like how you sometimes go watch some  classic porn to beat off to and don’t stop to think about the fact that  the actress is now in her 60’s and probably has super saggy tiddies.\n\nNext  misconception:  It’s not a Boomer mobile phone company.  They don’t  make phones anymore – phones that are branded with their logos are made  by another company that pays licensing for the logo and some of the  patents.  Blackberry sold all their mobile patents months ago.\n\nThird misconception:  No matter how much we ask,  they’re never changing their name back to Research in Motion so that we  can talk about Rim-jobs.  Sorry, just isn’t going to be a thing.\n\nSo  what are they?  It’s simple really:  They’re now an enterprise level  software security company.  When you think about it, it’s not such a big  pivot, given that their security encryption in their heyday was so  powerful that they ended up having to set up offices in certain nations  because it was impossible to crack and ran afoul of certain  international laws.\n\n# Let’s take a dive into the financials before we get into the story:\n\nAt the time of this writing, BB is a 7 billion dollar  company with shares trading in the $12.50 range.  Even after the meme  war collapse, they’re still worth double what they were when the ball  dropped in New York City with absolutely nobody watching in person and  everybody at home wondering why even Anderson Cooper was using an autotuner.   They generate a hair over a quarter billion dollars in revenue each  quarter over the last year and in 2020 had a negative EPS of about 32  cents a share as they retooled, though they trimmed that to .23 cents a  share for their last quarterly earnings report.  They have about a  billion dollars in cash on hand and receivables, and they have about  half a billion dollars in debt.  It’s not a great fiscal outlook there,  but it’s certainly manageable for a growth company (which is what they  presently are).\n\n# Where do they make their money?\n\nAlmost  half of their revenue is legacy income from selling endpoint management  and secure communications licensing.  A third of their revenue comes  from licensing their patents.  Oh, they also own Cylance, for you IT  help desk monkeys.\n\n**That shit’s pretty boring, not gonna  lie.**  Your wife’s boyfriend might find it interesting, but only because  he can use it to laugh at you that you know this shit.  But the rest?   The rest is where things get interesting.  Blackberry Radar is a fleet  management solution, and the most interesting thing is....well, for  that, we have to go back in time for a moment:\n\n# (Wayne’s World flashback/dream noises)….\n\nJuly 29th,  2017.  Las Vegas Nevada.  50,000 of the world’s most feared hackers  descend upon Sin City for a weekend of debauchery, drinking, and talking  about all the new and interesting ways they found to break shit or in  general cause chaos - aka DefCon 25, which was NOT cancelled, contrary to what you might have been told.  A young hacker from Wisconsin positively stuns  everybody at a panel by revealing how it is that he found he could  effectively hack almost every late model vehicle on the road that  possessed connected features – from range and while the vehicles are in  motion – using.....music  theory.  It’s an absolutely stunning revelation, something matched only  by how terrifying the implications of it are.  And all anybody needed  was a $300 RF modulation tool.  Using this, he found he could take  control of every mass produced  car on the market except those made by Volkswagen Group and Tesla, and  those only because they had randomized frequencies they used.  This guy  fucked.  This process was so dangerous that, for one of the only times  in DefCon’s history, they didn’t publish the how-to publicly.  Oh, and a  team from a then relatively unknown EV company in China called $NIO won  the car hacking capture the flag tournament in less dramatic fashion.   If you didn't hear about any of this, it's because you were too much of a square to be there.  Sucks to be you, chump.  Something had to be done.\n\n# Enter Blackberry\n\nI’ll  spare you all the things that have happened since then, but what you  need to know is this:  Blackberry came up with a solution to defend  against this and a myriad of other problems (not to mention Europoor  compliance in the form of ISO 26262) not to mention autonomous security  - and their security software suite (QNX) is now on almost every new  car rolling off a factory line today.  This software is also critical  for EV’s, because it controls battery management ECU’s (that’s the shit  that makes it so you don’t have to drop 10 grand on a new power plant every 2 years).  Or, for those of you with IQ’s of 60:  Computer make car gooder.\n\n# OK, so that’s cool.  But how does this get me TENDIES, man?  How much can these guys make?\n\nThey’re  coy about this and won’t give hard numbers, but there are ways we can  estimate what they’re pulling.  But to do that, we need to go back in  history again, and take a look at a stock nobody cares about\n\n# (More Wayne’s World noises)\n\nEnter:   Nuance Communications ($NUAN).  You’ve probably never heard of these  guys, but you and almost everybody you know has used their products at  some point.  They used to be best known for their Dragon Naturally  Speaking software suite, which your grandparents who decided they were  too old to figure out how to use a fucking keyboard bought so that they  could talk to their computer and send you messages that you hated  getting unless it came with a 20 dollar  bill, but which they thought you cherished forever.   However, at some  point around 2010, IBM – whom the Nuance CEO at the time was close  friends with the management of, literally just \\*gave\\* about 125 patents  around voice recognition to Nuance thinking that they were worthless.   Nuance took these patents and – for a brief moment – became one of the  coolest techs on the planet, because their tech is what made Apple’s  Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, Samsung’s whatever it was  called and a billion other voice recognition platforms work.  That is,  until Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Steve Ballmer, and everybody else Nuance  was dumb enough to trust to let look under the hood of their secret  sauce came along and all stole the IP to made their own platforms, leaving  Nuance rotting in a hole in the desert.  But one of the really cool  things Nuance expanded into before they went full retard was  they bought a couple of companies around 2013 or so– Tweddle and some  other company I can’t be bothered to look up – and got into the  connected car space.  At one point, Nuance’s Dragon Drive virtual  assistant was in every new car made by 9 of the world’s top 10 auto  makers.  \n\n# OK, dude, my wife’s boyfriend is asking me to bring him a beer.  Can you speed this along?  What does this matter?\n\nIt  matters because we can look at what $NUAN was getting in licensing for  putting their virtual assistant in these vehicles, and use that data to  extrapolate an estimate of what $BB is getting for their software.  With  just their 9 car makers at their back, they were generating over 300  million dollars a year – and that was almost a decade ago, and just for  something that would tell you where to pick up your Down’s Syndrome  medication. Add a premium for security, include all the auto makers,  carry the one, smoke a bowl to help you concentrate, adjust for  inflation.....\n\nThis  is a market worth about...oh, roughly 750 million dollars a year for  Blackberry on the conservative side once they actually start charging a  market rate for this product.   Right now, they’re adopting the same  go-to strategy Microsoft has been employing with Azure, which is to  basically GIVE it away in order to gain market share and penetration,  and then send Fat Tony to collect once the car maker is reliant on it.  Plus  all the other stuff we already glossed over because it’s boring as  shit.   Applying the average multiple of earnings for cybersecurity  firms out there, their lack of competition in the space, etc. And you  come up with a market cap valuation target of....oh,  roughly between 45 and 50 billion dollars once they’re firing on all  cylinders.  And they don’t have to worry about Google or Apple throwing  10,000 engineers at this to make a competing product, because it’s just  not worth it to them, so they’re largely gonna get left alone.  \n\nOr, by using maths....a  share price of somewhere in the neighborhood of $87.50.  Give or take  10 bucks.  Make it 15 to the downside, just to be safe.\n\n# Yeah man!  Cool.  So I’m in.  It’s gonna go to that by like, Friday or something?\n\nAn enterprise level cybersecurity company with a sub 10 billion dollar valuation is basically unheard of in this century.   But this is not a burn play where you’re gonna  get 50% gains every day with no work.  It’s a company that’s going to  have to melt up to that.  It still won’t be to that point this time next  year. \n\nBUT....that  doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a great story.  It just means that this  isn’t something you do a 0DTE YOLO on and expect to get something out  of.  And making an Avengers meme about it isn’t going to send it to the  moon.  This is something you buy and stash in a musty corner of your  portfolio so you can tell your Boomer parents that you’re being  responsible with your investing and you were just joking about betting  your inheritance on weekly FD’s for shitty online dating sites where the women have to talk to your sorry ass first.   Oh, and it’ll make the lambo you buy with the money from this safer.\n\nBecause I know it matters, here are 69 rockets so you apes understand what all this meant.\n\n.....no, there aren't going to be any rockets.

{"title": "BMBL: I Hate the Stock", "selftext": "TLDR: yeah you can laugh about how I'm a salty neckbeard because no one swipes right on my pic with a fedora, sword and anime body pillow of [Kanna Kamui](https://www.google.com/search?q=kanna+kamui), but the $15B valuation is not going to last.\n\nOptions start trading 3 days after IPO, so with the holiday it's this coming Tuesday 2/16 \n\n*Edit: the meme strike will be $69p 4/20. JK, the chain at single dollars and that date don't exist, so I think $60p June is fine.* \n\n**The Financials:** From Jan 2020 to September 2020 (I mean, like last year, the year of basically the highest possible growth as everyone was stuck at home)\n\n* Total Revenue of $376.6 million\n* Bumble App Revenue of $231.5 million\n* Badoo App and Other Revenue of $145.1 million\n* Net loss of $(84.1) million, respectively, with a net loss margin of 22.3%\n* Adjusted EBITDA of $98.9 million, representing Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 26.3%.\n* Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.0 million\n* Free Cash Flow of $(4.7) million\n\nWe can't use P/E because there is no earnings. The net loss margin >20% is quite impressive for a company that really shouldn't have any expenses (not that much advertising... it's all by word of mouth really). That total valuation to revenue is 40x. Facebook's is only around 9x.\n\n**Gamification of meeting people**: This is where r/wsb and Grindr gets it right. There's a certain addictiveness of these two because you never know when you're going to hit a 200 bagger with OTM calls on TSLA or get a 2 bagger on your face (both great success). When using all kinds of dating apps, especially Bumble, there are a lot of speed limits.\n\nThat speed limit? Well, their tagline: women responding first. I've asked my online sister about this and she says most women will not answer first because after the initial high of matching, they come back to normal realization much sooner. Men would always want to initiate and keep the conversation because of possible tits, but women would think \"oh, why do I want to meet this guy again? He's not going to provide for me financially, and I can just use a lightsaber.\"\n\n**Diminishing returns**: All the dating apps aren't in the matching business. They're in the data business. Data is driven by continuous activity, even if it's by only a small portion of users. Because of the above restriction, they're severely limiting activity. Most users are men, and by cutting out a large base of activity generation (even the possibility of saying hi and dreaming), Bumble is limiting activity and time spent on the app. It's like r/wsb. Most retards who got burned by GME aren't going to come back, no matter how good the DD will be.\n\n**Social Networking?**: No. LinkedIn is already good enough to polish my helmet. I personally don't want anyone to find me professionally through a dating website. This is one of the arguments to its high valuation, but honestly it's dead on arrival.\n\nAlso, why would I need to meet someone? Mom knows how crispy to fry my tendies.

Some very valid points.  I, however like this stock.  IMHO there are a couple of misses in your analysis.  \n\n1. Don't look at historicals.  This is a \"new\" company.  Lots of money on R&D and infrastructure.  This will turn into a cash cow.  They don't own any inventory, real-estate, or employees that are directly related to the service.  They have fixed corporate overhead, but they can scale up or down with minimal impact to the bottom line.  They will be printing money in a couple of quarters.\n2. The audience is not limited and they do come back.  Millions of new singles enter EVERY day, break-ups, divorce, coming of age.  It's a rotating door.\n3. Less than 30% of singles currently use online dating.  The addressable market is HUGE.  on-line dating had a stigma that is almost gone.  More singles will try dating for the first time in the next 3 years than the last 10 (my guestimate).\n4. They have a niche.  As someone that's used several dating websites over several years Bubble is one of the best (at least in my city). Met my ex-wife, a LTR of 1.5 years, and currently dating, the latter two met on Bumble.  Some of the highest quality women, connections, and dates.  I've heard the same thing from everyone in my city that has used Bumble.   There is a free option, but paid is the best.  Match, Tinder, PoF, et all have A LOT of casual users and a lot of time is wasted because the females are \"just looking around\" on free accounts.  Bumble women are serious about dating and relationships.  I match with fewer women but have more quality connections and more quality dates.\n5. I don't believe many of the articles I've read about a COVID spike.  ALL dating sites have been on a tear with exponential growth in the last 3-5 years.  Yes, online dating increased during covid...but it's increased every year for the last 20 years since [Match.com](https://Match.com) started.  Hinge is one of the newest to the market, their numbers don't mean anything.  They were on a rampage pre-covid.  There isn't solid data to show a COVID spike.  I think the real spike is hitting now as people start going out and socializing in public again.\n6. Extremely hard for new competition.  It's very hard to start a dating site.  You have to have users before you have users.  As Match, Hinge, Bumble havevery strong brand equity it becomes harder and harder for new entrants.  And in this case, all boats rise with the tide (#3 above).  If a new entrant does squeak in it only helps the others.  Data from [Match.com](https://Match.com) shows that the average single uses 2 - 3 dating apps.\n\nThose are my opinions.  Time will tell, I like this stock for a long play.  I like $UBER, $LYFT, $ABNB, $EXPE, and other digital intermediaries for similar reasons...all cash cows with no inventory and low overhead.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Started with $4,500 in November, >1.5 mil in February.", "selftext": "https://imgur.com/a/RDa86Np\n\nStarted in November with $4,500 that I cash advanced from my credit card and saved by paying my rent with that card for 2 months. I initially bought 75% shares and 25% calls and just pressed buttons on my phone a few times here and then for the next couple months. I didn't want to post this until GME wounds started healing for others. I did, however, go down with the ship in my Fidelity where I lost about 25k on shares. Nothing I did was smart, I got lucky. DON'T FUCKING GAMBLE WITH MONEY YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE. THERE WAS 1 SPOT IN 10 MILLION WHERE THAT SHIT ACTUALLY WORKS AND I ALREADY TOOK IT. Please don't test your luck because you will lose your shirt and your wife will go stay with her boyfriend permanently. Otherwise, keep those Wendy's Tendies flowing you fucking retards.\n\nEdit 1: Getting a lot of PM's asking for money. Bitch, I'd love to help everybody and will be making sizeable donation to charities and bringing video games to kids for Christmas. However, I don't just have cash everywhere. I actually adjusted my quality of life DOWNWARDS. Also, if you wanna PM me to ask where to learn about options, you better have some experience in business, logistics, trucking or brokering freight, so you can return the favor.

If you are interested in that, you can go through my post history.\n\nEdit 3: Can't I get a flair or something for being an absolute retard?\n\nEdit 4: Yes people, this was my FIRST play in the stock market, I'm not a guru that could do this again. The first's one's always free or at least it was in my case! I am lucky, not skilled.\n\nEdit 5: The week of the gamma squeeze, I was up to 90k. I pulled out 46k which was more than 10 times my initial investment. Had I not done that, I would not have had the balls to make this play. My best advice, **SET YOURSELF UP FOR AN OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU CAN PLAY RISKY LIKE THIS AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU ARE STILL BETTER OFF THEN YOU WERE WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED!!!**\n\nEdit 6: Volatility. How did I not wanna die with such large fluctuations? Well sometimes I did, that's what the liquor was for. Otherwise, as you can probably tell, I was born in the bytecorn space but way out of even the top 25 or 100 corns. I'm talking microcap that would put even the worst copperstonks to shame. This volatility pales in comparison and I became comfortable there, sometimes even happy. Learn to hold onto your pants trading the most volatile asset known to man, and options will be a walk in the park.  Also, I learned a ton about greed and chasing gains in the pop of 2017.

{"title": "Oil Stocks - Summer 2021", "selftext": "Hey everyone! I understand that I may get bashed or called a boomer for this, but I would like to discuss the possibility of oil stocks making a recovery this summer. While the popular consensus is that clean energy is taking over (Teslas on the road, Amazon using electric trucks, fuel economy improvements, federal EV mandates, pipelines being banned, etc.), and I agree with this consensus long term (by 2030), I don't think oil is going anywhere in the short term.\n\nBack in early November 2020, oil stocks started climbing their way back to their pre-covid averages, but most have not reached their pre-covid averages and some have almost 50% more to grow (such as Suncor or British Petroleum). My thought process is that with Covid vaccines rolling out/restrictions letting up, we will see increases in summer travel and an increase in manufacturing (which often requires oil). This paired with climbing oil prices will bring an increase in oil stocks in my opinion.\n\nFor a well thought out bull/bear thesis on oil see this post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/lhwmhu/the_bull_bear_case_for_oil/\n\nAs of now, it looks like summer calls or 2022/2023 leaps on oil stocks are pretty cheap. \n\nWhat do you guys think?

The ease of access and the grade of oil. Ease of access is pretty straight forward. The higher the grade of oil the less resources are needed to actually refine the oil into usable products. \n\nThat’s why places like Saudi Arabia or west Texas tend to be the more profitable oil producing areas. \n\nThe best way to explain crude oil grades is by 4 values: sweet or sour, then light or heavy. \n\nSweet and light crude oil is the best type due to ease of refinement. Sour crude oil contains a high sulfur content which is not wanted. Whereas sweet does not contain high levels of sulfur. Oil weight is measured by comparing it to that of water. Lighter oil is easier, uses less energy, and produces more final product than heavy oil. \n\nWest Texas produces both sweet and light grades of oil. Whereas the Gulf of Mexico and Canada produce sour heavy oils. \n\nSo especially up north in the Dakotas or Canada finding potential new Wells to drill in hopes of finding sweeter/lighter oil is definitely worth it in the long run because it will save and make more money at the refining stage.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "We're all getting wage cuts and reductions to our benefits to stay competitive as well", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is why you should be bullish on oil.\n\nNo one expanding production.

{"title": "Exposing Sundial growers, ticker SNDL", "selftext": "UPDATE Feb 23, 2021: **I told you it would drop,** but I'm still going to spend a lot of time reading their next financial reports, because all this news about how much money they have is absurd. I'm skeptical, but even if it's true, being cash heavy isn't always a good thing.\n\nAn example of a good cash heavy company is Southwest, LUV. Why? Because they've proven to have a good business model. Nobody hates Southwest, and even their competitors fear them. They have a position of security that none of their competition has. It will drop, but that's gonna be my sign to buy more. With Sundial? They are cash heavy is a commodities business that has revenue which has been dropping YoY, QoQ, DoD, etc. Their cash is not from any profits, but from speculation of profits.\n\n**Thus, I expect it to keep dropping in price, and I expect them to put up another bad quarter.** If that's not the case, I'll gladly eat my own words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease put up with my smooth brain analysis, here. Like many of you, I consider myself a connoisseur and producer of modern aut. I am autist in my own right, and as such I have spent hours looking over the shady financial reporting of this shady company.\n\nOf course, I am in no way certified to give financial advice to anyone. I am simply concerned that this company, if it is really fraudulent, is going to destroy investor's savings, and I think it's only fair that I express these concerns.\n\nI'll try to keep this concise, and not miss any details, because there is a lot going on here, and it really does get complicated.\n\nFair warning, my decision has been to invest in some put options on February 11th before the price started dropping, and it's up to you whether you want to as well. I give no advice on such an investment, but I personally think I made the best choice, and I know for a fact that their financials do not add up, so this is more to call attention to anyone who might be convinced to invest just how bad of a decision that would be...\n\nHere are some reasons:\n\n**A. OBVIOUS SHILLS**\n\nI won't name names, but obvious shills like [u/Masternewworldorder](https://www.reddit.com/u/Masternewworldorder/) have been trying to pump up the stock price through a social media campaign and ride the coattails of the GME debacle. I would not just simply post this guy's name on here if I had any other way to show how all 18 posts on his account are about hyping Sundial using the GME fiasco as a model for doing so. He even mentions GME, calling SNDL the \"next\" SNDL. To you, buddy, if you're doing what everybody knows you're doing, and the SEC finds out, you and those you work for or with will probably be arrested. Not only that, but his page clearly breaks a few rules on the sub. Pump & Dump most likely, advertisement, market manipulation, etc.\n\nIf you're just riding the hype wagon, you should really choose another company to hype up. If I'm correct in my math, they don't have the funds to operate through the quarter, nor can they get a loan to continue operations. I'll discuss their lies about their debt at the bottom of the page. I'll just say for now, it's my belief that they are either doing a pump and dump, or using share capital to have enough cash that they can file for bankruptcy and walk away with cash and hand.\n\n**B. DISGRACEFUL FINANCIALS**\n\nFinancial reports must comply with a ton of SEC and FTC laws about documents that they have to file. This is to protect those who would wish to invest their money so as to be protected from the sort of activities that would destroy them, and any trust in the stock market that they had. Maybe I'm cynical, but that last part is the most important. SEC wants trust, because then they have a functional system.\n\nA company that is traded on an American stock exchange must fulfill certain requirements regarding their financial reports, that usually allow for an exception in the case of international filers, but Canada is very similar in this regard, though perhaps notable from this stock, that's not the case at all \\[1\\]\n\n1. Their most up to date report shows **$500 million** in share capital with **$70 million equity.** (I believe that's Canadian $)\n2. leveraged against the share capital is a **$500 million** accumulated deficit, up **$140 million** from the year before. Coincidentally, their **debt** obligations are **down $140 million** from the year before as well. This suggests they are using issued stock and general market manipulations to pay off their debt. They say that the issuance of more stock is for a few things, depending on which report you read. I can't find them all, but trust me, [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001766600&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001766600&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0&count=40), it's in here somewhere. They say it's for purchasing of new properties, or maybe operation activities, but they never clearly state that they are paying off their debt with the new stock. I don't know if that's illegal or not, but it's definitely untrustworthy.\n3. For the 9 month period from January 1st, 2020 to September 30th 2020, they had **$12 million in revenue**, which cost them **$10 million to sell**, but they also lost **\\~ $20 million to inventory obsolescence**, and **$60 million to asset impairment**. As an investor, I would like to know why that happened, but their reporting makes absolutely no mention of it in their section **Risk Factors** on all **F-3** filings \\[2\\]. They may not have to include that, but again, you should really be given the opportunity to find out, and any company acting with the foresight to know stockholder trust is important - any company who wants to succeed - will make these things abundantly clear.\n\n**C. LETTER FROM THE AUDITOR**\n\nThis is the icing on the cake, and which verifies to me that there is so much more going on here than I could even understand. The auditor is paid by the company to look at their financials thoroughly to see if the condensed info meets standards, and fairly describes the company's information to the potential stockholders.\n\nThis auditor has time and again given them the same letter more or less, stating that their financials show that **the company has been acting in breach of their debt covenant**, which is the most evidence of a serious issue here. They also say that various other issues in Sundial's reporting gives them concern that **the company should not, and probably will not be able to continue operating** the way that they are \\[3\\]. This is all I need to know, really. And why any speculative raise in their market capitalization on the stock market gives me serious concern about the current state of our economic system. It's examples like these which destroy investor confidence, and lead to seriously tough times. Shorting this position is **not just profitable**, it's necessary to **save the soundness of our economy**, in my opinion.\n\n**D. SUSPICIOUS REASONS FOR FULFILLMENT OF DEBTS**\n\nIf securities on an exchange are linked to the equity of a firm that goes bankrupt and cannot operate, then all that money goes out of investors hands, and into the hands of debtors, or is liquidated and given to the preferred stock holders.\n\nLuckily for the executives and majority shareholders of Sundial Growers, Inc, they have a tiny little clause hidden in one of their reports which says that all liquidated funds must first be given to preferred stock holders before any is given to issued common stock traded on any exchange \\[4\\].\n\nThis is important, because they have clearly stated that **they can issue indefinite numbers of preferred and common stock**, and that **preferred stock gets first right** in the case of liquidation. Essentially, they can use the extra stock issuance to dilute costs and trick investors into thinking **EPS** is getting closer to that **above 0** marker (total earnings continues to drop further every statement), while also separately securing any cash left by issuing more preferred stock to themselves upon liquidation so that you, the investor, **get absolutely nothing** while they get any proceeds from going bankruptcy, possibly even millions.\n\n**E. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE COMPANY EVEN**\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923\\_1sc13g.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000110465920114508/a20-32923_1sc13g.htm)\n\nSome guy named **Ryan Dunfield**, who is mentioned nowhere else in their financials, received 25,000,000 shares in preferred stock for absolutely zero dollars in cost to him, well, actually, it's that Ryan Dunfield gets **25 million share**s,\\[redacted company name\\]**,**\\[redacted company name\\]**, and 1920576 ALBERTA LTD** all get shares as well. However, these are 3 companies of which **Ryan Dunfield is the president and/or CEO**. Ryan Dunfield got **1/10 of all stocks** available, not to mention voting power from these stocks, without paying any money for them, This was filed very recently too, It was filed after the last known financial report on September 30th. I haven't calculated all of the other people's issuance of preferred stock either, but this is definitely suspect to me. These sorts of dealings are **being done all the time by this company**, but they drown out the sec filings by naming **every single filing under the exact same document name**, so it's damn near impossible to keep track of any of it.\n\n**F. NUMBERS DONT ADD UP**\n\nIt's also convenient that they just issued common stock to fill the company with cash, and actually **did away with all of their debt.** If that is to be believed (sorry, I can't find any proof in their filings), then they are a rarity among companies to have done so **and maintained a $600 million cash reserve**. Not to mention that the **$500 million accumulated deficit**, **the $100 million total debt** and **accounts payable**, along with a **$90 million operating loss** all is somehow accounted for by **$18 million in financing income** (stock issuance I presume) before September 30th of last year, and supposedly **$100 million in stock issuance** if you read any related news, and less than **$200 million in illiquid assets**. Honestly, I don't know how these numbers can turn **$20 million cash into $600 million cash in 3 months**.\n\nHowever they managed to pull that off this year, I'm pretty sure that they will continue to leverage this as a deficit against their Share capital. If that's the case, they now have **$600 million share capita**l with **$690 million in deficit** leveraged against that.\n\nI'm not sure if anyone is aware of this, but if you owe a bank money, you can't simply say \"Sorry, this isn't actually a debt, it's a deficit\". It doesn't work that way, and **reporting it that way is serious fraud**. They may not actually be prosecuted for this fraud, but it still exists, and it is damaging to those who would invest in it.\n\n**G. SHOW THE INSTITUTIONS AND THE SEC WE CAN HANDLE OURSELVES**\n\nThe institutions have not invested anything in this company, and I suspect it has everything to do with their financials. I bet you if a company with a large amount of institutional ownership operated the way this company does, then the SEC would be their to protect the institutions so fast.\n\nInstead, it's left up to the little guys, who don't have enough money to pay Treasurers from the shady San Francisco political bubble $800k in speaking fees, to fend for themselves. We all take the most risk in the market because we're targeted by scammers, immeasurably larger competition, and indifferent regulators. In my opinion, this **short position against Sundial would be exactly what we need to show regulators what it's like to do their job.**\n\nBy the way, I'm pretty suspicious about the timing of this sudden increase in cash, given that I'm pretty sure tax season, and financial reporting season are very soon. Showing really large capital on their filings (which actually disappear the day after) would help secure them a new loan to save their ass. It's no wonder why a small company with 90% of their capital lost would want their financials looking a bit crisper on their sec filings.\n\n**H. MAGIC NUMBER**\n\nIf all of this is lost on you, at least realize that they potentially have a $690 million deficit if my math is right.\n\n69\n\nWhat else do you need?\n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000156459020053193/sndl-ex991\\_6.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000156459020053193/sndl-ex991_6.htm)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000119312521012712/d245855df3.htm#toc245855\\_2](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000119312521012712/d245855df3.htm#toc245855_2)\n\n\\[3\\] [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000119312520268504/d47001dex991.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000119312520268504/d47001dex991.htm)\n\n\\[4\\] [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000156459020014358/sndl-ex24\\_347.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766600/000156459020014358/sndl-ex24_347.htm)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I don't have any positions in the company expiring today, nor do I think them staying on will stop the inevitability of my position making money.

Share cap and equity - this point you made means absolutely nothing, the company has accumulated carried forward losses. This is normal in early stages. What you are buying is the future prospect of profit. Tesla's paid up capital is far greater than it's shareholder equity, but that doesn't necessarily reflect the value of the Tesla.\n\nB2. Accumulated deficit - this is simply it's carried forward losses since inception. There's nothing untoward about it. Read the cash flow statement and accompanying notes. Not all the debt was paid by way of share issue, $45m was through the assignment of debt to Bridge Farm on sale of it's investment. \n\nThe prospectus definitely talks about the company's indebtedness and one of it's stated use of funds is to reduce it through the issue of shares. There's nothing illegal about this. \n\nB3. i) Revenues to Sept 2020 - you're looking at the wrong column. \n\nii) Inventory obsolescence - this is in the notes, it is only a provision and very likely related to the fact cannabis has a shelf life. They are provisioning it for what they could sell it for.\n\niii) Asset impairment - again, it's in the notes. It relates to an internal assessment of on of its cash generating units. Their calculations are based on estimated future cash flows and a subjective discount rate, they believe the book value is more than what could be recovered if the asset was sold at 30 September 2020. However, the method they used was value in use, which is pretty subjective as one of the inputs is a discount rate. Pick and choose the discount and the impairment would be +- $10m at each 1% interval\n\nC. Audit report - yes, the going concern assumption has been addressed in almost every one of their reports. The debt covenant they breached was that their earnings couldn't cover interest expense at a level set by the credit providers. However, they've raised plenty of cash following prospectus, the debt problem is essentially no longer an issue. I'm sure the audit opinion for the financial reports at 31 December 2020 will be miles different.\n\nF. Cash balances - there is nothing about this point that makes any sense. Neither one of the things pointed out have anything to do with each other. The only comment i'll make here is that the total raised in the last 6 months, together with restructuring of some of it's businesses and cash receipts from their own debtors, was able to repay debts, cover operating losses etc.\n\nG. Preferred stock - this is common, and not an issue, they aren't trying to hide anything. Preferred stock also receive dividends ahead of commons. But the downside is they usually don't have voting rights as is the case with SNDL. They may rank ahead of commons in liquidation but they rank behind other creditors, so if the company goes down the toilet, they'll likely be in the same boat with the commons.\n\nI'm in under $1 so the volatility above $2 isn't an issue for me.

The agreement plans to develop and market BlackBerry's Intelligent Vehicle Data Platform, IVY. BlackBerry IVY is a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights from that data both locally in the vehicle and in the cloud. Automakers can use this information to create responsive in-vehicle services that enhance driver and passenger experiences.\n* Partnership with Baidu: On January 25, BB announced the [expansion](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology) of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX® Neutrino® Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.). The milestones build on the company’s [January 2018](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/blackberry-and-baidu-partnering-to-accelerate-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology) agreement to make BlackBerry QNX's industry-leading operating system (OS) the foundation for Baidu's ‘Apollo’ autonomous driving open platform.\n* BlackBerry QNX: BlackBerry is entering into the auto industry by using their QNX real-time operating system that is already built into over 175 million vehicles today and is already being used by automakers like Audi, BMW, Subaru, Volkswagen, GM, Toyota, and Honda. NVIDIA is even building its AI self-driving platform off of BlackBerry’s QNX technology.\n* BlackBerry IVY: [In addition to the QNX](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/) Operating System, their partnership with AWS allows them to store all of this vehicle data through BlackBerry Ivy, which is a cloud-based software platform that allows these automakers to view data and insights for their vehicles.\n* BlackBerry Spark: Another major service that BlackBerry offers is its Unified Endpoint Security, which is a comprehensive security approach to endpoint security that is essential to protect against and remediate cyber threats while providing visibility across all endpoints. Through their UES, they plan on improving **cross-platform visibility, cyber threat prevention, and remediation,** while **simplifying administration.**\n\n**Okay, so why is this important?**\n\n1. BlackBerry QNX was created to expand and improve autonomous driving vehicles and is currently being used in over 175 *million* vehicles.\n2. BlackBerry IVY helps these automakers (Audi, BMW, Ford, etc) view data and insights on their vehicles. This means that if there is a recall on a vehicle, even like a problem with the sensors, **the automakers can find that issue much faster and quite possibly even fix it through a software update.**\n3. They are REVOLUTIONIZING the automobile industry because of these two products. \\*\\*In the future, we could see a shift from hardware-driven vehicles to software-defined vehicles.\\*\\*\n4. Not only are they focusing on this, but they also have successfully created cybersecurity software that received the **HIGHEST score in the industry for the Enterprise** [**Unmanaged/BYO use case**](https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2020/09/blackberry-achieves-highest-score-in-gartner-critical-capabilities-report-for-unmanaged-byo-use-case)**.**\n\nGartner Research (who published the study) even placed BlackBerry higher than VMWare, IBM, and MSFT basically signaling that their products and services are better than their competitors. In fact, NONE of BlackBerry's customers that use BlackBerry Guard were affected by the SolarWinds hack. And the stock price is still $12.\n\n**The Sobering Part of this DD:**\n\nAfter taking a look at their balance sheet, I can agree with the skeptics that they’re not raking in a ton of money right now, but anyone can see that their current balance sheet makes the company appear to be undervalued, especially when compared to their competitors.\n\nI mean, based on this information ALONE, the price of the stock should be much higher than it is right now. BlackBerry's current market cap is around $7 billion, with its competitors like Palantir, a software company that I’m sure you’ve heard other YouTubers talk about, hovering at 60 billion. And funny enough, Palantir is also focusing their software on electric vehicles and cybersecurity, just like BlackBerry. **If BlackBerry had the same market cap as Palantir, its stock price would be $110.**\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nHere’s what the skeptics don’t realize though. They don’t realize that BB is still very focused on product development and customer acquisition, and that boomers probably still think it’s a phone company. Well, it’s not.\n\nWith their partnership with Amazon, Baidu, their UES and UEM product known as BlackBerry Spark, BlackBerry IVY, and their QNX operating system for vehicles, it seems like the market is not correctly pricing in BlackBerry’s **future growth**.\n\nMaybe one day if BlackBerry receives the same amount of hype that Palantir is getting right now, maybe then it’ll be taken much more seriously. **But only, once people realize that it’s not a meme stock.**\n\nEDIT: Well, WSB mods have banned me for linking my video. Oh well.\n\nEDIT 2: By the grace of u/DeepFuckingValue, mods reduced my sentence for being a good boy.\n\nAlso, I forgot to mention this: to all the retards out there saying “BB is not PLTR” lemme let you in on something.\n\n**BlackBerry’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.1B**\n**Palantir’s Fiscal 2020 Revenue: $1.05B (ESTIMATE)**\n\nAnd again...\n\n**BlackBerry’s Market Cap: $7.3B**\n\n**Palantir Market Cap: $55.6B**\n\nSo, you retards are telling me to sell my undervalued stock to buy *OVERVALUED* stock?! LMAOOO 💎🙌🏻🚀\n\nEDIT 3: Position is 500 shares @ $20.35, and no, I did not make this post to “recover losses.” Please, if you are a cynic, do yourself a favor and realize that not everyone is cynical.", "id": "liixji", "created_utc": 1613158850.0, "score": 5110, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 609, "comments": [{"body": "I bought in too high.

{"title": "PLTR DD - brain cells required if you are an ape!", "selftext": "Hello fellow retards\n\nI know these are difficult times for this sub and it’s almost impossible to post something solid which is not about the current meme stocks.\n\nInstead of jerking to some porn i did some research on PLTR and want to share my DD with you. This might be a longer text for your love dopamine level so maybe you should grab some your Adderall before.\n\nThe following text might you give your eyes aids since English isn’t my native language. I will try my best.\n\n**Palantir as a Company – the beginnings**\n\nPLTR was founded by some people and one of them is Peter Thiel who worked alongside with our holy papa Elon at PayPal. As a payment-service they had concerns about money laundering and founded PLTR to tackle this issue early. The CIA also funded PLTR (they are always funding stuff like this – Siri as example). This actually might be the reason why people think that PLTR is a company which aggregates data and do data analysis for the government….but this is not accurate and not correct at all if you see the big picture. I will explain this point later.\n\nYou retard still reading? Nice here some rocket emoji’s to pump your dopamine and keep you happy. 🚀🚀🚀\n\nLet’s start with the DD\n\nFirst of all my POV is looking for a midterm to long term investment in PLTR. My valuation considers PLTRs current state and predicting from now on for the next few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **1. The Management**\n\nBefore I start with the product I rather start with the management. You can sell the nicest thing in the world. I can guarantee you that the product definitely won’t be considered as the nicest thing after a while if you have a shitty management (Intel). With Peter Thiel on the leaderboard we got a competent asshole and CEO is Alex carp (co-founder) Peter Thiel is well known and Alex Karp is one of us. He yolod his heritage into some business and become a chad. Seriously tho, I trust Peter and if Peter holds on Alex since Decades so do I. Peter proved so many times how cunning he is and showed how to pick adapt problems early and create solutions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **2. PLTR Business model/ products**\n\nBefore we understand how important PLTRs products are we have to understand that we are simpeltons who don’t have any business with PLTRs. We create data. We don’t fuck with it. We creating with using our phones or working in the office. Only a few of us may working with accumulated big data. PLTRs customers’ base isn’t neighbor Joe or Aunt Nancy. The products they offer are not even for midcap companies they are more designed for whole industries and governments. That’s the reason why their products aren’t so tangible for many people.\n\nPLTR basically offers systems to big companies/governments which import their data into these systems. PLTR doesn’t sends workers to the client to collect data and analyse it. They sell platforms. They got 2 Products called “Gotham” and “Foundry” You may think wtf is this guy talking about? Let me explain it in 2 examples:\n\nFirst example is Syria with Gotham. It was impossible in the country to know who the good guys are and who the bad ones are. I know u muricans only know yourself and the rest of the world is the “rest of the world” for you. But this wasn’t so simple in Syria you had many factions with different intentions and some of them were allies and some of them were enemies. The lack of information or the ability of recognizing and sorting these information’s are crucial in a war. PLTR solved the struggle with creating a map which provided resilient information for the marines so they can operate safely. Civil problems over there could also be fixed.\n\n[https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/10/04/palantir-using-big-data-to-solve-big-humanitarian-crises/)\n\nActually what the John Hopkins University does with the covid numbers and the map, is some sort of what PLTR offering with their solutions. There are rumors that the tracking of Covid and the vaccination will be done by PLTR.\n\nIn their S1 Form PLTR describes it this way\n\n“Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for.”\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406\\_11](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520230013/d904406ds1.htm#rom904406_11)\n\nThe second example is about “Foundry” and it’s directly from the S1 File of PLTR (page 121)\n\n“An Airbus A350, for example, has five million parts and is built by hundreds of teams that are spread across four countries and more than eight factories. Companies routinely struggle to manage let alone make sense of the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. The platform transforms the ways in which organizations interact with information by creating a central operating system for their data.”\n\nBoth of these systems solving big issues with less effort. The arms industry as example would took billions for drones and stuff in Syria for the same job. The important fact is that PLTR does not spend so much resources for new clients they only have to provide access and support for their services and the client feeding the “machine” with data.\n\nThe key point is to understand that PLTR benefits very huge from economy of scales. This is very important since their costs for additional revenue is basically flat while the profits growing exorbitant with new customers. They offer a software and platforms and not kind of services where they need man power. All they do is working on their platforms and improving it.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palantir-ipo-breakingviews-idUSKCN26E3I2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **3. PLTRs big issue during the last decade**\n\nPeter Thiel was a great supporter of Trump and funded his elections campaign. The market thought that when trump wins then PLTR will get all the government (especially military) contracts.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/technology/peter-thiel-bet-donald-trump-wins-big.html)\n\nBut this didn’t happened. Peter got cucked by the huge authority apparatus in pentagon. These dudes loves bureaucracy and they do it for a good reason. If you retire from your job in pentagon you usually get a high paid luxurious position at Lockheed, Raytheon or Bae Systems to make additional free money for your retirement. Many thousand people working in pentagon just to select and buy stuff for the government. They spending billions of dollars for purchases and then PLTR came around and said like „look guys we can do this job for a few millions instead billions“. Of course the arms industry was pissed and the pentagon boomers helped them out. PLTR got constantly scammed from boomers and didn’t get the contracts. This was also the „swamp „trump was talking about.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-28/inside-palantir-s-war-with-the-u-s-army)\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2017/03/27/palantir-trump-army-military-procurement.html)\n\nA fun fact to this matter: Before James Mattis got summoned as the Defense Secretary of the USA he was a general in Afghanistan. He ordered services from PLTR despite the fact the pentagon was against it. But the marines praised PLTRs software and valued it over the trash they used to know from the defense/arms industry.\n\n*Processing img 2os8izwwe4h61...*\n\n[https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software](https://www.military.com/defensetech/2013/07/01/special-forces-marines-embrace-palantir-software)\n\nEven with a James Mattis as the defense secretary, trump as president and regardless that PLTR does it better and cheaper than the arms industry, it wasn’t possible for PLTR to get the government contracts.\n\n[https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/06/11/palantir-defense-jim-mattis-inner-circle-239373)\n\n[https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/](https://fortune.com/longform/palantir-pentagon-trump/)\n\nHow it’s ended? Well Peter’s wife doesn’t have a boyfriend because Peter is the fucking boyfriend of their wifes. All ended at the court and PLTR won. All this injustice ended at the court. The judgements on these cases are true circuit breakers for PLTR. Not only because PLTR spent shit tons of money for law suits. The lawsuits were perfect uppercut hits on the arms industry and they ended some fraudulent behaviors and „best practices „in the government\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2016/10/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-palantir-in-lawsuit-against-us-army/)\n\n[https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/29/palantir-who-successfully-sued-the-army-just-won-a-major-army-contract/)\n\nPLTR will profit from a Biden who wants to decrease the military expenditures. They will get the job done and at the same time the costs will go down. With the recent judgements the door looks open.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **4. Valuation problems**\n\nI could spam some multiplication on revenue or even a DCF but I think it’s not necessary. Expect the costs of research and development (maybe marketing) the costs of PLTR stood mostly flat in the last quarters. It’s a growth stock and the pricing is mostly in the perspective of PLTR. This is actually all we need to know that the revenue increases while the costs staying mostly flat. Check out the balance sheets at page 12 on the S Form 1.\n\nLet’s talk about the market. The whole market seems overpriced but it isn’t tbh. Due to the low cost of capital there is no alternative than to throwing your money on stocks or on real estate. There is nothing with a solid interest rate around (not even in emerging markets). At the stock exchange like in 70s, the companies had to offer a return, a perspective which should be more attractive as putting your money on a saving account with 8% interests without risks. These times are gone since the 2000s. So before people discuss insane valuation they should check out the fiscal and economical policies.\n\nNow back to PLTR and why the price is difficult to set (cheap imo). First of all PLTR did a direct listing without an investment bank for their share offerings. Its lacking of the valuation which they usually would get through such a process.\n\nPLTR wanted to do IPO with Morgan Stanley but it was mess.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-04/morgan-stanley-s-long-romance-of-palantir-pays-off-as-ipo-nears)\n\nMorgan Stanley proved themselves many times as stubborn communists when it comes to valuations. I mean you guys remember their disgusting price targets for tesla like 100$ post split or stuff like that.\n\nThese guys are very focused on numbers and I know it’s difficult to price in the potential and perspectives. But you can’t ignore these things for a fundamental valuation. If you want to consider these things in the price you have to understand the business of the company.\n\nThis ended that one team at Morgan Stanley valuated PLTR with 5 billion while another team thought they worth 40 billion.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2018/11/14/palantir-ipo-valuation-morgan-stanley.html)\n\nHow is this difference possible and why is this happening? Because people don’t understand what they are valuating. This happened a lot in the last decade because the decision makers in these banks and many analyst don’t have any idea which metrics they should use on companies like that. They are using the metrics from classical industries on new business. They freaked out when Facebook was valued with 100 billion as IPO. Same with Twitter and in the last years it was Tesla. They said apple going to tank every damn year in the last decade. I honor Warren Buffet so much since he has the dignity to realize that he don’t understands something but at the same time he sees the potential and the trend. That’s why he hired 2 Chads who bought Snowflake for him. The transformation and the generation change didn’t happened yet. That’s why they try to use the metrics from Caterpillar on Tesla.\n\nGuys the whole market is mooning with the cheap liquidity. Pennystocks and zombie companies transforming into billion dollar market cap companies. Facebook as IPO had a market cap of 104 billion back in 2012. At that time it wasn’t possible for Facebook to monetize their users with selling ads. They just paid 100 billion for the potential in more difficult market conditions.\n\nLook at the IPOs like doordash, Bumble. I’m not going to call this a bubble. Just check out their business cases and use the metrics. Maybe its easier for people to understand Bumble and Doordash…\n\nOn page 12 of the S1 (balance sheet) Form you can already see the huge positive trends in PLTRs revenue and their costs. All this without all the positive events and contracts PLTR recently got.\n\nPLTRs valuation is difficult and I think it’s miscalculated by pessimistic communist who don’t understand that their products are game changers for industries, governments and defense forces. Because of these points I think there is huge price potential for PLTR\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **5. Risks for PLTR**\n\nDespite the general market risks PLTR mentions at page 29 of the S1 Form the competitors as the main risk: “We face intense competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.” The S1 Form didn’t aged well. Actually I don’t think that PLTR would have any trouble with offering new shares. Also with Peter Thiel as one of the founders the financial side should be stable.\n\nAs PLTR competitor people use to mention IBM. The boomers from IBM already surrendered with their Windows95 computers and decided to cooperate. The biggest threat would be big tech with big money like AMZN or APPL. You all now the stories about APPL and Spotify or AMZN and all the merchants. Even if the big players would step into PLTR markets it would be difficult for them since PLTRs products doesn’t rely on an Amazon store or on apple devices. PLTR is years ahead with their products.\n\nI think the greatest risk (still) are the boomerish arms industry and all the boomers in pentagon and other authorities.\n\nThere are very corrupt infrastructures when it comes to decision making and assigning contracts. People fear changes but they can’t avoid the changes. With the recent judgements we can see a turn on the tables but the transformation will still take time. It’s a circuit breaker with an avalanche effect.\n\nThe risk factors on page 16 on the S1 form mostly aren’t relevant anymore. People complained that PLTR wasn’t profitable for 18 years. Well PLTR was never designed to be profitable and Alex Karp once said “love us or leave us alone”.\n\n[https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/09/09/palantir-ceo-makes-livestreamed-pitch-to-investors.html)\n\nBut even this changed recently. PLTR became profitable in 2020 with 130,000,000§. Now the same people complaining about how high the stock price compared to the profits. Well just you wait.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **6. Conclusion and Outlook**\n\nIf you still reading I have to admit that this was a lot text and i am sorry again about the lingo. Let’s connect the dots and bring this information to a point\n\n1. The boomer coalition in the pentagon and in the arms industry is taken down by PLTR. They will able to get the governments contracts and the classic arms/defense industry is no match for PLTR products. The judgements of lawsuits were catalyst and the effects should be already shown in the next earnings. These were such underrated events but I think there still will be some odds but PLTRs situation is much better as it was a time ago. The chains are off!\n2. Military expenditures rising worldwide\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqcv8vzee4h61.jpg?width=744&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98d264f091b7ff80926038660f43c57b87fc8ef2\n\n[https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2020/global-military-expenditure-sees-largest-annual-increase-decade-says-sipri-reaching-1917-billion)\n\nWith Bidens presidency we will see more disruptive technologies chosen by the government. Biden want to reduce the military expenditures. PLTR is able to provide better service for lower cost. Not only the recent judgements also the political change will help PLTR. Ironic if you remember that Peter supported Trump and getting his tendies from Biden.\n\n3. PLTR superior products profits hugely from economy of scales. They don’t have any significant costs when they acquire new customers. Making the big data usable for decisions making is already very important and step by step people realize that this issue growing fast. We creating everyday more data than we did yesterday and leaving the majority of it as trace and unstructured data. We don’t work with it but big Institutions does.\n\nHere is the passage from the S1 and I fully agree with it:\n\n“The systemic failures of government institutions to provide for the public — fractured healthcare systems, erosions of data privacy, strained criminal justice systems, and outmoded ways of fighting wars — will continue to require both the public and private sectors to transform themselves. We believe that the underperformance and loss of legitimacy of many of these institutions will only increase the speed with which they are required to change.”\n\n4. PLTRs value. The current situation of the market with tons of liquidity seems like a bubble. People don’t know what to do with the cheap capital and people throwing it even on meme pennystocks.\n\nFacebook had his ipo back in 2012 during much harder market conditions as now. The valuation of Facebook was over 100 billion and people called it insanely overvalued. They did it because Facebook didn’t had a way to monetize their users (especially on mobile platforms). Facebook has a market cap of over 750 billion now and nobody calling it over valued.\n\nA remember the recent examples? Bumble?! Bruuuh. Don’t get me wrong if you invested in Bumble but they have nothing special to offer and their business case can easily copied or improved by others. Its shows the current state of our market with the crazy liquidity that even zombie companies got astronomic valuations. Use these metrics on PLTR with great products, great management, low cost base and less odds as ever before….\n\nPLTR price is wrong imo especially in this market and with PLTRs current state and perspective.\n\n5. Do you use PLTR? Me Neither! It’s not designed for us and we have to inform us about the success. PLTRs new contracts and their future are shining bright. With the settled lawsuits the sky is clear for PLTR. But their customer base is not only America. I’m not a murican and 3 weeks before I just find out that the police departments in our state using PLTR products. I don’t need to link endless evidences here since you can google it by yourself and see how many contracts PLTR recently got. Especially after the circuit breakers we talked about.\n\nI have genuinely trust into Peter Thiel and Alex Karp that their will make the best of PLTRs potential. The odds getting removed and the demand for PLTR is increasing.\n\nIf all these information would priced in correctly we would have a share price of at least 60-70$.  With upcoming and ongoing positive events PLTR share price should soar more..\n\n**What’s next?**\n\nNow we have earnings ahead and the lock up period ending.\n\nFor the earnings I think the number will be fine and keep up the positive trend on revenue with a disproportionately trend of the costs. The most important part will be guidance for 2021. We should listen closely and see if the magic is already happening.\n\nThe second event is the ending of the lock up period. You all remember the end of the lock up period of Nikola? Just 1-2 days after they announced they don’t got the GM deal? The stock tanked – for a good reason. You know the guy Trevor Milton.\n\nBut in PLTRs case everything is different. Despite the successful deals they got, does a guy who says “love us or leave us alone” sounds like someone who going to drop his shares at the first possibility? I don’t expect such a behavior from Alex Karp and neither from Peter Thiel. If some employees drop their shares it should be fine.\n\nI would appreciate if the stock prices would go below 3ß. It would create a healthy bullish chart pattern and would be actually a nice discount to get in or stock up. I don’t think that the shares going to dump a lot because of this event. The earnings and the guidance are more important and the key events if you want to invest mid – long term.\n\nWhat does all this means for you? Nothing! Please don’t do any market activity based on my DD. I’m just sharing my knowledge and looking for critics so I can reevaluate my theses. This is not a financial advice.\n\nMy hearts bleeding for all the GME holders. My last Reddit account got banned because I criticized “the pumpers”. In one of the comments I called the mods gay and got banned permanently (bye bye 20 k karma). If you are new to this please don’t do any decision based on this so I can sleep gladly.\n\nI’m not well positioned and not trying to pump this stock. I have 70 shares and a CSP. Fair play and fuck all the bots and pump and dumper we recently got in the sub!\n\nLeave an upvote if this post helped you.

{"title": "$RKT ready for take-off...", "selftext": "Warning this is HIGHLY speculative, but data points to it as a possibility.\n\nFirst, Dan Gilbert and Warren Buffet are friends. This we know.\n\nSecond, according to the IPO, RHI (AKA Dan Gilbert) via the Class D shares retains 79% of the voting power, but currently has 94.2% of the economic interest based on his holdings of 94.2% of the total stock. It's therefore likely out of any deals he wishes to retain that 79% interest in the stock/voting(this becomes important later).\n\nThird, between Berkshire's 13f filing on 11/16 (with a portion submitted separately as confidential), it was widely reported Buffet had plans for a \"secret\" investment, but how much and in what company?\n\nThe how much we know, the difference between their 13f and 10q filings (minus some foreign investments) is approximately $9 billion. Then there is the what? We do know his largest reductions were in bank stocks(the biggest reduction being in Wells Fargo), but does buffet really want to move away from finance or maybe he just wants to reposition in finance away from traditional banks.\n\nIf it's the latter, $RKT makes sense, but how do you buy $9 billion of a $40 billion company without anyone knowing? Timing....\n\n$RKT reports on the 25th after various organizations have to report on the 16th (15th is a financial holiday). Over a 5% stake has to be reported within 10 days. RHI reported it's holdings early in the month. If RHI wants to they can convert 15.2%(94.2% - 79%) equivalent of the total outstanding stock from Class D to Class A in a private equity sale(AKA Black Book) so as not to directly affect the stock price, not report it for up to 10 days, and keep their 79% vote share/Economic interest. Then Berkshire can report their 13f and a bit later file their 10q on the purchase. With $RKT reporting the \"big partnership\" just before ER to maxmize momentum going in to it. \n\nRelationships, nummbers, dates for filing and chosen, all lead me to believe $RKT is the secret Buffet investment and plans to acquire about 25% of the company. This also means with four profitable quarters(the fourth being announce on the 25th) $RKT would also be eligible for S&P inclusion(due to the float increase) adding further value to the acquisition. All that plus the high short interest scrambling to get out(and Buffet followers scrambling to get in) and $RKT could soon be a multi-bagger in short order.\n\nNote: 9 billion was likely based on the original $27 for 150 mil share original prospectus, but likely the deal changed after $RKT hasn't performed as well and likely the $1 billion buyback was announced to help that performance(Buffet thinks buybacks should be used for price support by companies so it follows his theory on their use).\n\nEdit: I'd watch to see if the 13f still shows confidential as the lock-up didn't end until 02/02 and the transaction would likely be scheduled for the 16th so it doesn't need to be reported for 10 days, aka the 26th which just happens to be the day after RKT's ER call. Also, no other company has reported 5%+ new economic ownership by Berkshire since their Nov. 16th 13f.\n\nEdit 2: It also makes sense from a non-investment business perspective. It would provide synchronicity with other Buffet holdings. It would help with Gieco(mortgage customers to Geico and Geico customers to RKT), Berkadia(multi-family/commercial lending which RKT doesn't handle), Berkshire Hathaway Automotive(sells cars, but doesn't handle direct financing, but RKT Auto does), Cavalier and Clayton homes(new homes which can be passed to RKT to increase sales there), and finally Home Services(realtor group).\n\nEdit 3(Links for more confirmation bias): \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-quicken-lending-clayton-idUSKCN0Z00FI\n\nhttps://fortune.com/2016/06/14/buffett-quicken-yahoo/\n (Similar to Reuters article, but behind a paywall)\n https://highflyinginvesting.com/2020/12/13/200121213_RKT/\n(Similar to post here, but likely one of the sources of the original speculation)\n\nBasically, Vanderbilt(BRK sub) buys Manufactured Home loans from RKT. That started in 2016(when RKT was Quicken) and was ongoing at least through 2018(after it became RKT).\n\nTL;DR 🚀+Buffet=🤑💵💲\n\nStay tuned as we'll know within two weeks... 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the 🌝\n\nForgot Positions: \n\n420 shares,\n69 2/26 26.5c,\n15 3/19 40c\n\nEdit(02/16): Calls down big today, but still holding. I think today will be the bottom before the ER run-up.\n\nEdit 2: Berkshire put out it's holdings as of 12/31. Looks like the \"Secret Position\" was a combo of Chevron and Verizon. Best I can tell nothing is currently marked \"Confidential\". \n\nER is the next big event on 02/25 and the \"new financial partnership\" is likely to be announced then, but as to who it is, that's anybody's guess now. Today doesn't discount Berkshire, but it does mean RKT wasn't the \"confidential\" position.\n\nEdit 3: I still don't discount Bershire as the new partner, just not as a direct investor.

{"title": "I can't believe I have to say this, but a lot of people need to hear it: THE STOCK MARKET ISN'T FAIR", "selftext": "All I read now on \"new WSB\" is about how robinhood stopped the GME squeeze, and they \"robbed\" investors. \"This was going to $1,000, we got robbed!\" is every other damn post.\n\nNow, personally, I don't buy that this is all a big conspiracy, and that all the brokers halted trading to save one hedge fund. As a long time trader (who has witnessed a lot of halts), it seems far more likely that the brokers were at risk of getting fucked, and they protected themselves. But, I won't get into that, because that's not the point of this post.\n\nThis is the point:\n\nTHE STOCK MARKET ISN'T FAIR. Never has been, never will be. For example:\n\n1) Big money has access to so much information you don't have. They have access to order flows and shit that cost a fortune. They have entire departments and insiders that do nothing but research and investigate. Is that fair?\n\n2) Big money trades on platforms like bloomberg terminals (and similar), and they can literally see more accurate prices and trade quicker than you. Is that fair?\n\n3) Big money has access to advanced algos that you could never dream of accessing, that auto-trade for them. Is that fair?\n\n4) Big money has so much money that they can literally alter the prices of stocks by buying/selling. They can rotate between stocks and ETFs that hold the stocks to remain invested while manipulating pricing. Is that fair?\n\nI could literally write a 500 point list, but my point is clear: the shit ain't fair. It's no secret. As a retail trader, you are a little guppy punk-ass bitch in a big dick shark pool.\n\n*But we all know that.* It's never been about being fair, it's about profiting from the landscape that we are in.\n\nIf you buy into GME at $50, and that shit goes to $500 in a matter of days, then you see some sketchy shit happening and think \"wow the hedge funds and market makers are gonna put an end to this shit...\" Then you hold until it crashes back down to $50 and cry \"it's not fair,\" then you're a fucking idiot. I'm sorry, but that's the deal.\n\nWe know big money has the power to crash a stock, so if you see it happening, sell. Better yet, sell and switch to shorts, and play both sides. Don't lose all of your money and then claim the market isn't fair. No shit it isn't fair. What's your point? Profit off that unfairness, ya dumb bitch.\n\nThe millions of new WSBers all posting about how \"it isn't fair\" and \"we got robbed,\" it's basically like a little bitch crime boss making a deal with the rival big dick crime boss, then crying because the big dick crime boss lied and stole his money. Hey, no shit. Criminals do that. If you're a crime boss, you know the other crime boss is probably fucking lying, so you hedge against his lies and use that shit against him. That's how it works.\n\nAnd that's how it works here, too. In the criminal world, people lie to you. In the stock market, big money manipulates shit. You can punch the sky, or you can accept that and play the game with those realities in mind.\n\nWhen I am in a trade, sure, I'm thinking about the fundamentals and future company performance. The news cycle. All the boring shit. But I'm *also* thinking about big money, retail traders, who is involved and how they are involved, and how all they will react to shifts in the stock price. You *have to,* because that's how the market ticks.\n\nYou only win by playing by the rules of the game, and the rules of this game are that the market is largely smoke and mirrors, and you'll never have even 1% of the knowledge or power that a typical hedge fund has. Don't fight it into bankruptcy like a fucking dongus. Play the game.\n\nAm I being negative? Nah, I'm being realistic. You want to fight to make the market more free and fair? Go on. Fight to make it better. It's a good thing to do, and I support it. And I'll help you. But in the meantime, accept what the market is *right now.* Don't throw you and your family's money away as a moral martyr, saying \"well i wouldn't have lost all my money if the market was different!\" It's not different. It is what it is.\n\nAnd if you legitimately can't disconnect yourself from that idealism, then it's probably just best not to trade.

I said the week to a friend that “this is actually happening unless they pull out all the dirty stops.” That’s the thing - I sold my options knowing it was time to take profits but held my shares thinking it was fine and the fact that I missed my share sell window **is my fault.**\n\nYes it wasn’t fair, but the game was never fair and all the information about these practices is public and had been discussed endlessly. I’m\nstill happy to hold for a GME turnaround cuz I got in at 20 and do have my options profit (268K), but the fact that I didn’t sell is on me.

There are a lot of things they did that were shady. Here are a few examples:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)\n\nNow I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.\n\n1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH, did they wanted to drive the price down!?**\n\nDTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RH and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.\n\nWhen RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren’t transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.\n\nIf the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, \"Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.\"\n\nNow, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.\n\nThe concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.\n\n**2. But I was allowed to sell!**\n\nOf course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.\n\nUpdated Information:\n\nThe DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.\nOn the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.\nDTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.\nBack to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.\n\n\n**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**\n\nThinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.\n\n**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**\n\nMelvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. \n\nThe short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.\n\nHedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.\n\nThe whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.\n\nMany hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.\n\n**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**\n\nIt could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don’t get margin called, which I don’t expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let’s say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let’s say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.\n\nConsidering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.\n\n**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**\n\nA lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?\n\nWell, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nAssigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).\nThe volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter.\nExample: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC.\nIIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.\nIF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.\n\n**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**\n\nSure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.\n\n**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**\n\nCitadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.\n\n**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**\n\nNot necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nHedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)\n\nBut many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not taken from thin air.

There are a lot of things they did that were shady. Here are a few examples:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101515/3-biggest-hedge-fund-scandals.asp)\n\nNow I want to address some of the misconceptions that new traders have about the markets.\n\n1. **I was not allowed to buy shares on RH, did they wanted to drive the price down!?**\n\nDTCC, the clearinghouse for WeBull, RH and other brokerages, recently raised the collateral requirements for GameStop transactions to nearly 100%.\n\nWhen RH takes a buy order it goes to it's clearinghouse to exchange it's clients money for shares. The shares are immediately and conveniently transferred to the client, but the funds aren’t transferred for 2 days. There's this gap between the broker and the clearinghouse for these unsettled trades that the clearinghouse will require some cash upfront (margin) for but otherwise accepts exposure for the rest.\n\nIf the stock being bought is extremely volatile, expensive and has a huge amount of recent volume and therefore unsettled trades, the clearinghouse will eventually realize they are floating quite a lot more to the broker than they are comfortable with on the back of a very risky equity. GME fits all these characteristics. It's this point in the GME scenario where DTCC sets margin requirements to 100%. They tell their brokers, \"Hey if you want to get GME stock from us, we will not accept your word that this trade will settle in two days. Instead we need the money upfront since we are already way too exposed to this one ticker from you.\"\n\nNow, if RH wants to continue filling buy orders for it's clients it needs to come up with ALL the money for each trade. RH does not have nearly enough cash on hand to handle this, hence the recent draw down from of RH's credit lines as they try to get enough liquidity to keep buying shares for their clients. Eventually the brokers just don't have enough cash, throw in the towel and stop accepting buy orders until they can settle more trades or the clearinghouses release the margin requirements for these stocks.\n\nThe concept that RH would fuck over basically their entire user base on purpose to help a minority investor's minority investment in a hedge fund that already closed their fucking short position doesn't stand up to even the smallest amount of scrutiny. It's just a boring case of the market plumping going wild because it's not built to handle pumps of this scale.\n\n**2. But I was allowed to sell!**\n\nOf course you were. Selling is exiting an already created position. The liability that RH would get if you were not able to sell and the price went down would be insane. They can not stop you from selling an asset that you own. They can, however, block the purchasing of new assets through their platform.\n\nUpdated Information:\n\nThe DTC only requires collateral on the buying side of the trade. That is the side at risk because the buyer might have bought on margin or with funds that haven't fully settled in their brokerage account (like RH's instant deposit). There is no guarantee that the buyer actually has all the money to complete the trade until it clears 2 days later.\nOn the sell side, however, you're sending stock to the DTC which doesn't have the same sort of questionable backing. They can accept that stock with a high level of confidence and debit the broker's clearing firm whatever the stock was to have sold for. So selling is pretty easy for a broker because they can debit you and get a reliable debit from DTC which clears the immediate credit risk for the broker.\nDTC is the one left holding the bag if the buyer fails to come through. [I'm not 100% sure about the next part, but I think it's right.] DTC will then keep the collateral payment as well as sell the orphaned stock at market price to recoup part of the loss and write off the rest (or they might make a profit if the stock rose in value during the clearing process). This is where another risk to DTC comes in - if the buyer defaults and the orphaned stock drops steeply in value during the settlement period (as $GME is very likely to do), then they have to rely on the collateral for most of their coverage. That's why they raised collateral for $GME.\nBack to the original point, Robinhood didn't shut down selling because of liability risk - but because they simply didn't need to do that. DTC was only making buys difficult to complete.\n\n\n**3. But Fidelity and ThinkorSwim allowed people to buy and sell.**\n\nThinkorswim and Fidelity own their own clearing houses and have enough shares to satisfy the orders. Also, they do not need to pay collateral since they are a clearing house.\n\n**4. Okay, but what about the 120% short interest, Melvin will be closing their position soon, and a short squeeze will happen.**\n\nMelvin claims that they closed some of their positions. There was enough volume for them to do so. \n\nThe short interest are just estimations. Short interest information gets released on 15th and 30th of each month. Next week we will be able to see the short positions.\n\nHedge funds keep taking short positions and are much better prepared for now, because there is more money to be made on riding a stock down to 40 from 400, then from 5 to 1.\n\nThe whole assumption for a short squeeze incoming is built around the assumption that there is still short interest of over 100%, however, there is not confirmed data, as it comes out on 2/9.\n\nMany hedge funds are also riding the wave up, and have long positions in GME. Blackrock, one of the biggest money managers already made insane profit, and will probably ride this on a way down.\n\n**5. But a short squeeze will happen!**\n\nIt could, or it could not. The interest in not high to a point were they will go bankrupt or have to buy back the shares to cover. They can comfortably hold for 6-12 month as long as they don’t get margin called, which I don’t expect them too, tbh. The payoff makes sense, think about it this way. The interest is I think 30% yearly. Let’s say you short a billion dollars worth GME. You pay annual interest of 30-40%. Hedge funds definitely have enough money to pay that 300 million a year. Now, let’s say in a year a price goes down from 400 to 40. A fund will make essentially 900 million dollars minus the interest fee and etc. it is a no brainer for some bigger funds to take this position and enjoy their easy 40% profit.\n\nConsidering many funds have insane amounts of collateral, they will not get margin called from this.\n\n**6. But if options expire in the money they have to sell their shares!**\n\nA lot of options expired ITM on Friday, so why did the price not go up?\n\nWell, how many retail investors that were holding their options actually had enough money to buy 100 shares at a strike price? Not too many.\n\nAdditional information:\n\nAssigned/exercised options move stock between people/institutions. However, this movement does not affect the current stock price. (UNLESS someone sold uncovered calls).\nThe volume of calls or puts being assigned does not matter.\nExample: stock ABC closes at $11 on expiration. Investor A owns a $10 call, and it is exercised. The seller of the call (investor B)  already owns the shares (or owns another call at different strike). The following transaction occurs: Investor A gives B $1000, Investor B gives A 100 shares of stock ABC.\nIIRC, no volume is reported for ABC, neither a buy nor a sell occurred, and ACB price does not change.\nIF they were uncovered calls (not really allowed, its significantly more risk than naked shorts), then Investor B would need to by 100 shares of ABC at current price, prior to the call being exercised.\n\n**7. Okay, but Hedge funds are still bad and evil!**\n\nSure, I agree. Some are. Some hedge funds get their funding from managing pensions and endowments funds.\n\n**8. But Citadel was manipulating the markets!**\n\nCitadel and Citadel securities are two separate LLCs. They are only allowed to open long positions, they can not short a stock. One is a market maker that processes option orders and has no say in the markets. In fact, the more volume there is, the more money they make on the spreads. Would jot be surprised if Citadel made a lot of money on market making in the past week.\n\n**9. But Hedge funds are insane investors with 50% annual return.**\n\nNot necessarily true, an average hedge fund has been underperforming for the past 20 years. You probably had better returns then them just by investing in index funds. Don't get me wrong, a lot of smart people work in the funds, but their main goal is to hedge, in other words, be safe from market movements in any direction.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nHedge funds are bad, but they are not retarded (except for Melvin, who overextends on a short at $5)\n\nBut many of the rules that came in play were written decades ago, they were not taken from thin air. Battling against hedge funds is okay, but throwing different theories that will be easily disapproved once they file 13F will not take them down.
