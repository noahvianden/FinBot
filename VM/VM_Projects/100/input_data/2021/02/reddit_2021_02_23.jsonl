{"title": "$AMD - Stealing from Market Makers - AMD Swing Trade Thesis", "selftext": "**__$AMD - Stealing from Market Makers - AMD Swing Trade Thesis__**\n\nHey everyone, Flux here! I initially wrote this thesis for WSB, but people from other subs seem to enjoy my posts, so I'm sprinkling it around! I want to apologize in advance for any the vulgar language and memes which slipped through the cracks. Most of it has been edited out, but if there's still some left, I apologize.\n\n---\n\n#**Introduction**\n\nWhat’s poppin’ fellas? Ape gang professor Flux here with another heater post. You may know me from my AT&T DD post which taught you how to follow unusual options flow to make some coin, or from my Hut 8 DD post which taught you how to make money using financial arbitrage. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday, we’re going to be learning how to identify optimal entry and exit prices for our trades, by analyzing simple charts and spotting trends. This will be done using the chart for my favourite ticker, AMD. **To all you illiterate, paint-huffing apes who dropped outta highschool and don’t like learning, I’ve attached a TLDR at the end of the post which tells you which contracts to buy to get some free money**. Let’s get to it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Building The Foundation**\nTo begin, let’s take a look at the [AMD one day chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/X5hkIw6s/), and see if we notice anything odd, or unusual.\n\nDo you see anything in particular? Does anything jump out at you? No? [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1DzmPafE/)\n\nStill nothing? If you still don't notice anything, that’s fine, these patterns can be difficult to spot initially. [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uHY32HCB/)\n\nAs you can see from the final chart, for the past year, AMD has traded within very tight, specific ranges. I have highlighted these areas on the chart using the pink boxes. As we can tell; \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Box #1)** Starting from mid February to mid April, AMD traded within a 10$ range, between $39 and $49. It started at 49$, went down to 39$, back up to 49$, down to 40$, before once again going back up to 49$, where it then smashed through the top of our current trading range, creating a new range.\n- **Box #2)** Now, starting from mid April, going all the way until earnings in August, AMD traded within a 10$ range **again**, between $49 and $59. This range was extremely tight and pronounced, bouncing from the bottom of the channel up to the top of the channel **seven** times throughout its lifetime, before smashing through the top of the channel again.\n- **Box #3)** August through December. $74 to 87$ channel. This range was slightly messier, but still pronounced nonetheless. 6 clean bounces. Smash through the top into our new range.\n- **Box #4)** This is where our most recent range lies, with an $85 bottom and a 95$ top. We haven’t surged out of this range in either direction, so it is safe to assume we are still trading within this range. **How can we use this information to our advantage?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Applying our Knowledge**\n\nTo summarize our findings from above, for the past year, AMD has consistently traded within a predefined range before surging higher and entering a newer, higher range. These ranges have held and contained **27 different bounces without breaking**. Only one single trade has bounced lower than a given range, but it recovered within hours. **Twenty seven times, this thesis has held true, so why the fuck would it be different on the 28th**?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point, I assume most of you glue sniffers know how we can use this information to our advantage. We know that AMD trades within a tight range. We know that we are currently within the $85-$95 range. We coincidentally also happen to be sitting right at 85$. As a result, we know that it is **extremely** likely that a bounce off of $85 is going to take place.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince we know that $85 is likely a bottom, and a bounce is likely going to take place, we can enter a monthly position here and make some awesome money. Personally, I picked up some 03/19 90Cs, as well as some 04/16 95Cs. And just like that, we managed to catch the literal bottom of a trade, and have the opportunity to make some free money. We can also use our findings to know when to exit our trade.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Extending our Knowledge**\n\nSince we know we are trading in a channel, we also know roughly when we can expect to exit our trades! We know that the closer we get to $95, the more likely it is that we will bounce, so we can plan accordingly! Personally, with my 90C, I will look to set a stop loss when AMD is trading around 90$, and manually sell out of the position if AMD manages to break $92/$93.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven though I’m a perma bull, I also trade the flipside of the channel as well. If I see AMD trading at $95+, I’ll enter a short position and play the trade on the way down. In this case, I set my stops a little tighter, and keep a greater watch over the trade, since we all know that stocks always go up. Furthermore, since every single channel ended with a blow off top, I don’t want to get caught in a random blowout and have my options expire worthless. I would rather be conscientious beforehand, and manage my risks accordingly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nAs you can tell, we can learn a lot about the price movement of a stock by simply looking at its chart. Although the AMD example was painfully simple, it’s also painfully effective. The best part about all this is, that there are dozens of opportunities like this within the market, simply waiting to be discovered. I hope you all learned something new today, and had fun while doing so. If you guys want to check out my other DDs, or follow me on my socials, they can all be found on my profile (Discord saw this DD first!). I love you all, and wish lots tendies upon each and every one of you :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TLDR**\n\n- Buy **$AMD 2021-03-19 C $90** and **$AMD 2021-04-16 C $95**\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2/23 Update** - AMD held $84.50 on this brutal red day, and stayed within the channel (wow! shocker!). I am extremely confident this is the bottom.

This will require additional margin, but the margin is reduced by the long option.  Putting on the 80/90 vertical credit spread for a net credit of $3.50 would put $350 in your account, but you will have to keep additional margin for the duration of the trade.

What's happening in parallel with that is a) competitors introducing technical evolutions b) changes in competitor pricing strategy.  \n\nSo actually getting the forecasting right isn't trivial.

The earliest use of the phrase dates from 1985\nwhen the Singaporean and Malaysian stock markets bounced back after a hard fall during the recession of that year.\nJournalist Christopher Sherwell of the Financial Times reported a stock broker as saying the market rise was a \"dead\ncat bounce\". A similar expression has an older history in Cantonese and this may be the origin of the term.\nVariations and usage\n\nA short rise in price followed by a price decline of a stock is the standard usage of the term. In other instances the\nterm is used exclusively to refer to securities or stocks that are considered to be of low value. First, the securities\nhave poor past performance. Second, there is no indication of an impending rise in price. Lastly, there is no\nindication that sustained growth is imminent should a major upward shift occur in the market.\nSome variations on the definition of the term include:\n\n• A stock in a severe decline has a sharp bounce off the lows.\n\n• A small upward price movement in a bear market after which the market continues to fall.\n\nTechnical analysis\n\nA \"dead cat bounce\" price pattern may be considered part of the technical analysis method of stock trading. Price\npatterns such as the dead cat bounce are recognized only with hindsight. Technical analysis describes a dead cat\nbounce as a continuation pattern that looks in the beginning like a reversal pattern. It begins with a downward move\nfollowed by a significant price retracement. The price fails to continue upward and instead falls again downwards,\nand exceeds the prior low.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If your portfolio is 100% technology there might be a problem.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is in fact true", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I agreeee", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "SP500 was 4% down today from ath few days ago.

{"title": "Let's not panic here - This selloff is a healthy market reaction to rising treasury yields", "selftext": "**Disclaimer:** I'm heavily simplifying a very complex topic for the sake of keeping this post brief.\n\nFolks, close your trading app. Take a deep breath. Relax.  This is not the apocalypse. This is not the armageddon. \n\nBefore I get into what's happening, here is a bit of perspective: Even with yesterday's selloff, NASDAQ ended at 13,533. I can't see what the index is like pre-market, but QQQ is down 1.35% as I write this. So let's assume it opens 13,350. \n\nThat's still 280 points higher than the post-January selloff (low of 13,070). That's also still 462 points higher than December 31st (we closed at 12,888). In %, that's 2.14% and 3.58% higher, respectively.\n\nNow I know that a lot of you are trading on highly volatile stocks (looking at you, CRSR and PLTR), so obviously they are hit much harder than NASDAQ. That's the nature of the beast. Volatile stocks = large swings, both up and down. Welcome to the flip side. I have some of those in my portfolio, and also some defensive and cyclical stocks. It sucks to see my positions that were up by 350% now up by 300%. I know how you all feel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, what's happening?\n\n**Treasury yields are rising.** That's what's happening. There's obviously more to it (I.e.: vaccination seems to be going relatively well, Biden's stimulus, etc.), but that seems to be the catalyst. In fact, the 10-year yield rose to its highest level in the last year, at 1.37%. **That's a good thing:** Rising yields are a sign of economic recovery and increasing economic activity. It's a good thing.\n\nWhy are yields rising if interest rates remain low? Because of one of the fundamentals of yields: As bond prices rise, everything else being equal, yields will drop. And the inverse is also true. As bond prices drop, yields will rise. And right now, bond prices are dropping. People are becoming more and more optimistic about the prospect of recovery, with Biden's stimulus and with the vaccination that is (once again, relatively) going well. So they are exiting \"safe\" investments with lower yields in favor of riskier investments with higher yields: junkier bonds, stock market and alternative investments.\n\nWait, if rising yields are a sign of people exiting the bond markets to go towards the stock markets, why are prices dropping????? Great question, and my answer is twofold: (1) NASDAQ is not even in market correction territory, Chill. It closed roughly down 5% from all time highs yesterday. (2) Look at S&P500 and DIJA. DIJA is a winner in this, and S&P is barely phased.\n\nSo back to my explanation, people are leaving bond markets for markets with higher potential returns, and the stock markets is one of them. Now, the reality is that rising yields are not always immediately good for markets, especially overheated markets like NASDAQ: This can spook a lot of investors and cause a selloff, which is essentially what's happening right now. This doesn't mean, however, that the apocalypse is upon us. Remember one of the reasons why the markets have skyrocketed so much in the last year: Actual interest rates, not yields, are near zero, and will remain near zero for the foreseeable future. This is crucial. New bond issuance will still have shit for yields, this isn't changing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What should we do?** That's entirely up to you. I'm no financial advisor. I'm no expert. Take everything I say with a massive grain of salt. I'm no expert. But really, I'm barely doing anything.

Assume 4% growth and a 6% discount rate on those earnings for 20 years this component alone would $1T for Tesla in 2030. That alone is $250/share if we assume 15% discount rates for the next decade.\n\nThat's one aspect of the business in one country in the world which in my model is responsible for about 30% of the world market. At 40k miles per year we would need a fleet of 22.5M cars out of the 75M autonomous cars in the US. The autonomous car utility will be approximately 3 times that of personal vehicles, so the total fleet to sustain all personal travel would be 225M cars, of which 150M are personally owned versus the 250M today (would be 370M with no autonomy).\n\nAutonomous fleet will be roughly 1/3rd total fleet but do 60% of the miles. At a replacement rate of 15 years there'll still be a consumer car market for about 10 million units per year in the US of which I estimate about 20% would be Tesla in the shape of Model 3/Y/compact. These cars still drive profits and are a platform to sell personal use FSD/insurance subscriptions. At 2M units per year at $38k ASP and 15% operating margin plus \\~$400/car/year profit in subs/insurance for a 15M fleet and 30x forward earnings that adds another $500B to the market cap for a total of $1.5T in the US alone.

Everything I could afford and still pay rent. When I bought them the buy price was 8.5 and sell 0. Yes 0. I thought that was because they were just so far OTM. Today I watched Tesla tank and neither the buy or sell price moved. I looked at some of the other Tesla options available on IG (there's only a really random assortment available, not a whole chain). I realized they were all 10000+ and calls at 60000 were something like 5x the price of puts at 60000. I'm now convinced that for some stupid reason IG prices option strikes in cents for equities (I have traded VIX options with them before and they're priced in dollars). So I'm 99% sure I just YOLO'd into $6 puts. I can't sell them cause they're worth exactly 0. I can't believe I've been so stupid. Guess I 💎✋with my only hope being Tesla going bankrupt (I think they're overvalued but never going bankrupt). Wish me luck I guess.

I'm trying to explain that it's impossible for them to be for $600 pls help.\n\nEdit 2: called them back when the market opened. The guy again told me they were $600 I asked him to check so he did and came back and said yes they're $6 but as they're sold in sets of 100 that's why all the strike prices are x100. Go figure? Instead of writing $6 X 100 they just write 600. Then he told me as I bought them on the platform and not over the phone they can't refund them.

{"title": "I think PLTR is invincible rn and in the long run.", "selftext": "So... this could be a bit long, but let me double down  on my thoughts on PLTR. Recently, we’ve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.\n\nA lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don’t disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.\n\nNow we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us 🦍 have to be wary of.\n\nAs much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market’s back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We’ll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.\n\nAnd well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 regardless and we can cap the discussion here.\n\nSo here’s where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn’t REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.\n\nBut that’s not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.\n\nNow, the thesis is that growth firms’ future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here’s the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.\n\nLet’s go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).\n\nEssentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.\n\nBut think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.\n\nThey faced the same problems. I’m only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn’t have the cash to survive in the EV market.\n\nI watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. \nHe shore could.\n\nYes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn’t? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain’t cheap. \n\n(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).\n\nAnd if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. \n\nIs it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.\n\nBut no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes 🤮🤡.\n\nFuck the shills who say Palantir can’t continue robust growth or be profitable. (I am looking at your trend-seeking bots Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley).\n\nOn top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov’t clients at roughly 52%, but let’s pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don’t want to get too political here, but broadly, you’re a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon, if not looking to HEAVILY EXPAND given the monumental threats we face- geopolitical foes like China, Russia Iran; climate change; police reform; EV adoption/renewables more broadly; 5G and cloud/quantum computing, i really could keep going (amongst all of them, these agencies have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).\n\nNot too mention PLTR also has massive contracts with numerous EU members and Asian allies like Japan/S. korea, but there’s honestly so many positive examples about how scalable this beauty is both domestically and internationally.\n\nAnd let’s take what Cathie Wood said the other day on CNBC: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.\n\nGiven PLTR traces its roots to the CIA’s venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this lengthy history will continue providing much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.\n\nFurthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.\n\nThe answer is yes. But Wall St doesn’t want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren’t underwritten by investment banks, and thus don’t receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI LITERALLY PAY FEES TO analysts/associates at bulge bracket banks to shill like a damn used ‘98 Honda Accord (and that’s exactly what these other SAaS names are compared to PLTR)\n\nBut we always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir’s demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.\n\nI believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.\n\nAnd I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Karp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.\n\nAs a conclusion, can someone give me a firm answer on a company that can actually compete with PLTR in terms of solving a complex issue like tracking down Osama Bin Laden or expanding a niche industry into international markets??? And if your only comment is on valuations, see Snowflake (quite the value investment Mr. Buffett ;).\n\nFor disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice. And as always, do your own reading/research, but these are the frank sentiments of a PLTR believer.\n\nNow with the lock-up fucking history, PLTR TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n**UPDATED PART 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr1l80/pltr_extensive_dd_part_2_what_makes_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "id": "lq8rw4", "created_utc": 1614053305.0, "score": 659, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 188, "comments": [{"body": "As soon as jim cramers starts telling people to move from Plantir, I know it's time to buy in.\n\n6600 shares @ $28.14", "score": 227, "replies": [{"body": "Jim Cramer is such a broken record.

Hospitals, Logistics, Manufacturing, Pharmacies, etc. across the supply chain are the data partners.  \n\nThe Federal Government stepped in to create Tiberius using Foundry and probably a heavy dose of extra customization thrown in for “free” think of the health care supply chain experience pltr  is absorbing right now going to be great for commercial future.\n\nNow,  Palantir spent its early years with government interconnecting old systems.  Lots of the Manufacturing, Logistics, and Health Care systems still to this day use old systems on the back end.  They are large organizations who have applications written on old code and getting the data out in real time and writing it back to those systems (a recent feature rolled out to existing foundry customers) is a whole ball of wax in of itself.  all the ml/ai, big data, crm, or any other way you explore manipulate view delete copy replace that data is all secondary to this “plumbing” problem\n\nOn top of that Palantir’s foundational code (which is the bines of both gotham and foundry) is designed to solve the problem of authorized access to this data.  A field operative, an intel analyst, a 1 star general, and a liason from a completely different branch or agency all need different access to different interconnected intel on a situation right?  so that the other side of pltr\n\nso when you marry these two ideas of being able to read and write data from anywhere (private cloud, public cloud, private datacenter, colocated datacenters, the excel spreadsheet that marge from accounting leaves\non her desktop, publicly available statistic feeds like how many people registered at the dmv this year, the information from the on board computer of the drone buster Andruil (Lucky Palmer ex-oculus founder’s new start-up with a few ex-FDEs) and add the ability to ensure government (il-5 soon to be the only company rated with il6) trusted levels of access and authentication as if every piece of data was a national top secret clearance file you get those base bones that make up Gotham and Foundry\n\nSince this has turned into a wsb style DD post at this point ill just continue and hope i make it to a point on your original question.\n\nright so Palantir built Tiberius problem is (and I would rather not get political but to be fair I cant vote for president currently and I dont live on mainland US currently so I guess you might call that objective of at least certain biases I have lived the entirety of my adult life in Puerto Rico so I dont have much love for either party only preference on policy, ethics, and morality insert grain of salt if you want)\n\nTrump wasnt exactly interested in getting involved in State level issues,  he had opinions on them and used his off hands approach as a way to scape goat members of his own party and anyone else.  \n\nPalantir can only do what they are asked and contracted for.  My purely keyboard quarterback opinion is this prevented any possibility of smooth roll out of the vaccine when it was ready.  Sure the manufacturers, scientists, and other non state entities involved up until the moment of the vaccine (probably many of those were more modernized systems) were easy to do the plumbing on for palnantir and relatively few end points but if Palantir was only given the nod to do work at the state federal interconnect level and below then none of that matters now.  \n\nMany States and Many Health Care systems have to begin to feed the system directly from the source for the system to work as it should..\n\nThe reports that came out a few weeks ago indicated that the early experience was issues getting the data from states pushed into the system and getting the information pushed back down.  A single bottleneck was unnecessarily created where from that point down the line communications was not plumbed.\n\nI think Palantir was setup to be thrown under the bus in this situation and public perception of what they do (when all they really do is sell the shovel to the government and other industries that have similar needs) feeds right into this idea that an FDE would be making any kind of decision on what to do with the data especially after the whole Cambridge Analytica scandal.  the threat of scandal  will forever be Palantir’s largest cross to bear.  That is the price of working so tightly with governments, well that and all the R&D money they will blow in ways we as investors will have no vision into.\n\nCramer said around DPO days Palantir wont run in price because they do “secret stuff” with the Government and I think he is both right and wrong.  We wont know they why or even the when will this project stop on the R&D side but the Intellectual Property and experience on the other side of it is massive.\n\nfuck it im done for now.  hope that clears it up shoot me back any follow ups and i promise i wont act like an ass or a prick\n\nedit: some quick sentence fixes i hate typing large walls of text on mobile \n\nalso remember Palantir has been at it for 18 years.  Dems and Rep have signed contracts with them and allowed them to grow into their role.  Each Administration and more importantly agency or branch has their own agendas and their way of view the world.  Palantir is just a tool for them to achieve it.  So what I guess Im saying is remember to vote and trust your democratic system works well enough to be the custodian of such power.

{"title": "The Real Big Short: Passive Investing, Positive Feedback Loops, and The Massive Ark Bubble", "selftext": "tl;dr: Long Dated ARKK puts and/or debit spreads.\n\n\"Shut up gay bear!\" \"Don't short meme stocks!\" \"Cathy will bury you!\" Over the last year, you'd probably be right. However, every single bubble ends the same, it's just the underlying assets and catalysts that vary. You feeling a little bearish? Are you fingers itching to YOLO some puts like last March? Don't short SPY, short ARKK.\n\nThis is not a case to short ARKK just because the stocks it holds are too high. Shorting a bubble just bc it's up is a bad time. This is a case to short ARKK because of how it functions as an ETF. For starters, an ETF is essentially a bundle of stocks. You buy ARKK and you indirectly invest in Tesla, Square, Paypal, Zillow, etc. However, the inner mechanisms at work are quite interesting. Every x amount of dollar inflows leads to ARKK buying more shares of its underlying stocks. Why sometimes so are buying ARKK shares from a willing seller, the money usually goes straight to Ark Invest, where it is routed to the underlying shares. People buy ARKK, ARKK has to buy shares of Tesla, Square, etc. to create new ETF units, the stock buys help the ETF price go up, more people want to buy ARKK because it's performing well, so more money flowing into underlying stocks, etc. You see what's happening? More inflows = more buys = better performance = more inflows, and so it repeats. However, stocks only have so many shares, and Ark has more than quintupled its holding sizes in the last year. Ark now owns more than 10% of the shares of several of its portfolio companies. It is difficult for Ark to offload this many shares in a short time if the company wants to rebalance, as it will move the stock price significantly. Ark has since \"diversified\" by buying speculative \"growth stocks\" such as 0 revenue reverse merger plays.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what? Well a number of Ark's holdings have increased by 400% or more from last years HIGHS in February, yet the underlying companies are largely unchanged. Tesla's meteoric rise is a prime example. Many of these holdings are now struggling to break out to new highs, and appear to be either consolidating or breaking down. ARKK itself is up 400% from the march lows and 180% from last February, by far outpacing the indices. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIronically, more and more people are talking about Ark now, though it is mathematically much harder for the company to outperform simply due to its bloated size. Combine this with Ark's tendency to largely ignore valuations and hold a number of incredibly pricy \"growth\" stocks, and the stage is set for an unwinding. The FAANG stocks are not massively overvalued, IMO. Apple and Amazon are fine and unlikely to crash. Tesla and other Ark holdings are a different story. Sector rotation is real, and Tesla appears to be falling victim. Other high flyers may soon follow. If and when investors start taking profits on their ARKK positions, the company will be forced to sell  off a portion of the underlying assets. This will cause increased selling pressure on the already sputtering growth names, thus pushing a stock decline. This decline will impact ARKK's price, leading more investors to sell off, thus accelerating a massive reduction in holdings which will continue to tank ARKK's price. Momentum works both up and down, and Ark's illiquid 10% holdings in a number of companies may be its grave as it will be forced to sell off its own positions if outflows begin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe it's because we are approaching the one year anniversary of March 2020, but my bear senses are tingling. The high flyers of last year are most vulnerable, and the mechanisms behind ETFs make ARKK a prime target.

When covid started, sectors rotated rapidly into tech, growth, innovation, and some consumer staples/defensive.  Now that Covid is a late stage game, \"people\" are rotating into oil/energy, into equities with a re-opening story (DIS, AMC), and into bonds.  But really, as this new sector rotation continues, we truly don't know how the dust will settle.  Are \"people\" truly leaving behind giant wins such as MSFT, V, AMZN, AAPL, and shifting to Oil, Bonds, and Companies that need people to physically breathe on each other to buy crap(DIS, AMC)?  Maybe, maybe not.  Also, are the people rotating into Oil, Bonds, Finance, and the re-openers actual humans, or are those just shitty evil hedgies going into safe, value boomer plays?  I say, it's just a narrative that boomers can understand, big funds are rotating their sectors around as the economy re-opens, but there is always another growth story.   \n\n\n2) We are only looking at the start of another sector rotation, the last beginning was in 2016 with  new president and corporate tax cuts, the past 4 years felt like a chainsaw vasectomy.  Maybe your story about Tesla shifting to a mature stock, from a growth stock is true.  Or maybe that's what a boomer would want me to believe, and tesla actually has more growth stories to tell, as it creates new segments of the market to grow into (automated driving, robots that build cars, batteries that can be sold to outdated electrical grids in texas).  So yeah, if a sell off happens in one of the ARK funds, maybe it will hurt TSLA and ARKK if daddy musk can't pivot the momentum of his growth into a new segment.  Or maybe, as the dust is settling from this sector rotation, things change direction again?  also yes.  If TSLA truly does unwind in value as it shifts from a growth story to a mature company and can't pivot to another sector to grow into, then yes the ARK funds could unwind like a basket of toxic mortgage backed securities, technically you're right there.

So \"forcing someone to cover their short\" would be the bear equivalent of \"forcing someone to sell their shares\". The only entity that would force someone to cover their short (or force you to sell your shares) is the broker, e.g. if you've bought your shares on margin, can't pay the short interest (or credibly prove you will be able to) etc etc. During the short squeeze on GME, people were forced to cover their shorts because the short interest rose so much that the brokers got cold feet and basically said \"we can't let you go this deep into debt, you have to cash out at a loss now\".\n\nnaked shorting is different (and somewhat illegal) but there's a huge amount of flexibility in the rules. MMs for instance are allowed to do naked shorting for set periods of time, and some brokers are allowed to sell you a short \"naked\" without it counting as such, as long as they eventually locate a share, roll the short over someone elses account/etc. If the broker fails to do this correctly, they end up on the fails-to-deliver list from the SEC, but even that doesn't mean they necessarily get punished right away, think of it more like going into debt. The SEC doesn't care all that much about this (this used to actually be fully legal until 2008) \n\nThere's been a lot of conspiracy theories floating around recently as to whether anything illegal has happened with GME and whether the SEC will take action or not, and likewise there are schools of thoughts that believe that naked shorting (for brief periods of time) is necessary for market liquidity. I have no opinion or insights on either of these, but I don't see a reason either way why this would help GME to go through another short squeeze.\n\nIf you feel like it, give [this document from the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#V) a read. It's a bit dense, but basically more or less says \"you don't have to locate a share before shorting as long as you reasonably and in good faith believe you will be able to locate the share within the given time-limit. Having a stock categorized as 'easy to borrow' is sufficient justification to believe you will be able to locate the share\".", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You are right, i mixed up naked shorting with shorting and i was indeed referring to the naked one.

If anything they will go ahead and say everybody has to locate their shares over some period of time, and for any day you're over, you might have to pay some fine or something like that. And this is already a pretty extreme scenario to imagine I think.\n\nSince the GME float is huge (10M-20M shares traded each day over the last week) it'll be easy to cover a large amounts of shares in a day or two. Often when a retailer buys a share, it becomes locatable for a broker, because many brokers implicitly lend from customers holdings.\n\nAlso if you look at the latest fail-to-deliver data you can see that the GME fail-to-delivers have already chilled down from 2.1M to 138k failures, which puts them on place #2620 of the worst fail-to-deliver stocks.

I try to post good information so everyone can make money and my previous posts has helped many.  Hope this helps you too.\n\n-  This is a real recovery play.  Look at IMAX as the perfect example.  They have a big market share in China, and China being first out of lockdown (still some partial lockdown in different cities), is recovering and everyone want to go out and watch movies.  That is why IMAX killed their earnings.  This will happen in the US as well, 100%.  New York partially opened their theatres, and this will continue across the board.  It is just a matter of time.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/12/11/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-imax-ceo-on-the-movie-industry-amid-covid.html\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210222005894/en/AMC-Theatres-Statement-on-the-Reopening-of-Movie-Theatres-in-New-York-City\n\n- **Very Important**  They will not go into bankruptcy.  This is the key factor here.  They just raised another 917 million, so bankruptcy is completely out of the question.  This in itself is already very bullish, as you don't have to wake up one morning and find your company filing for chapter 11.  Yes, they won't be able to restructure their debt, BUT, it is much easier for them to raise cash and your shares won't turn into fairy dust.  \n\nhttps://torontosun.com/business/money-news/u-s-theatre-chain-amc-says-bankruptcy-talk-is-completely-off-the-table\n\n-  There is a lot of interest from the retail public/publicity on this stock from the whole saga a month ago.  \n\n- look at the options chain, there are a lot of interest further out so there are a lot of bullish investors.   Since there is an dilution of 3x the outstanding shares to avoid bankruptcy, everyone should note at $10/share today it is already at it's ATH.  So play your options carefully.  But then again, valuation multiples are much higher today than it was before.

{"title": "$AMD - Stealing from Market Makers - AMD Swing Trade Thesis", "selftext": "**__$AMD - Stealing from Market Makers - AMD Swing Trade Thesis__**\n\n---\n\n#**Introduction**\n\nWhat’s poppin’ fellas? Ape gang professor Flux here with another heater post. You may know me from my AT&T DD post which taught you how to follow unusual options flow to make some coin, or from my Hut 8 DD post which taught you how to make money using financial arbitrage. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday, we’re going to be learning how to identify optimal entry and exit prices for our trades, by analyzing simple charts and spotting trends. This will be done using the chart for my favourite ticker, AMD. **To all you illiterate, paint-huffing apes who dropped outta highschool and don’t like learning, I’ve attached a TLDR at the end of the post which tells you which contracts to buy to get some free money**. Let’s get to it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Building The Foundation**\nTo begin, let’s take a look at the [AMD one day chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/X5hkIw6s/), and see if we notice anything odd, or unusual.\n\nDo you see anything in particular? Does anything jump out at you? No? [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/1DzmPafE/)\n\nStill nothing? If you still don't notice anything, that’s fine, these patterns can be difficult to spot initially. [What about now?](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uHY32HCB/)\n\nAs you can see from the final chart, for the past year, AMD has traded within very tight, specific ranges. I have highlighted these areas on the chart using the pink boxes. As we can tell; \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Box #1)** Starting from mid February to mid April, AMD traded within a 10$ range, between $39 and $49. It started at 49$, went down to 39$, back up to 49$, down to 40$, before once again going back up to 49$, where it then smashed through the top of our current trading range, creating a new range.\n- **Box #2)** Now, starting from mid April, going all the way until earnings in August, AMD traded within a 10$ range **again**, between $49 and $59. This range was extremely tight and pronounced, bouncing from the bottom of the channel up to the top of the channel **seven** times throughout its lifetime, before smashing through the top of the channel again.\n- **Box #3)** August through December. $74 to 87$ channel. This range was slightly messier, but still pronounced nonetheless. 6 clean bounces. Smash through the top into our new range.\n- **Box #4)** This is where our most recent range lies, with an $85 bottom and a 95$ top. We haven’t surged out of this range in either direction, so it is safe to assume we are still trading within this range. **How can we use this information to our advantage?**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Applying our Knowledge**\n\nTo summarize our findings from above, for the past year, AMD has consistently traded within a predefined range before surging higher and entering a newer, higher range. These ranges have held and contained **27 different bounces without breaking**. Only one single trade has bounced lower than a given range, but it recovered within hours. **Twenty seven times, this thesis has held true, so why the fuck would it be different on the 28th**?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point, I assume most of you glue sniffers know how we can use this information to our advantage. We know that AMD trades within a tight range. We know that we are currently within the $85-$95 range. We coincidentally also happen to be sitting right at 85$. As a result, we know that it is **extremely** likely that a bounce off of $85 is going to take place.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSince we know that $85 is likely a bottom, and a bounce is likely going to take place, we can enter a monthly position here and make some awesome money. Personally, I picked up some 03/19 90Cs, as well as some 04/16 95Cs. And just like that, we managed to catch the literal bottom of a trade, and have the opportunity to make some free money. We can also use our findings to know when to exit our trade.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Extending our Knowledge**\n\nSince we know we are trading in a channel, we also know roughly when we can expect to exit our trades! We know that the closer we get to $95, the more likely it is that we will bounce, so we can plan accordingly! Personally, with my 90C, I will look to set a stop loss when AMD is trading around 90$, and manually sell out of the position if AMD manages to break $92/$93.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven though I’m a perma bull, I also trade the flipside of the channel as well. If I see AMD trading at $95+, I’ll enter a short position and play the trade on the way down. In this case, I set my stops a little tighter, and keep a greater watch over the trade, since we all know that stocks always go up. Furthermore, since every single channel ended with a blow off top, I don’t want to get caught in a random blowout and have my options expire worthless. I would rather be conscientious beforehand, and manage my risks accordingly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nAs you can tell, we can learn a lot about the price movement of a stock by simply looking at its chart. Although the AMD example was painfully simple, it’s also painfully effective. The best part about all this is, that there are dozens of opportunities like this within the market, simply waiting to be discovered. I hope you all learned something new today, and had fun while doing so. If you guys want to check out my other DDs, or follow me on my socials, they can all be found on my profile (Discord saw this DD first!). I love you all, and wish lots tendies upon each and every one of you :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TLDR**\n\n- Buy **$AMD 2021-03-19 C $90** and **$AMD 2021-04-16 C $95**", "id": "lqutlp", "created_utc": 1614119069.0, "score": 333, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": " I've been watching these channels for months with AMD.
