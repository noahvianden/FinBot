Again, this is not rational.

If inflation was actually a threat and the pandemic was over, the market would not, as a whole, essentially be begging for another stimulus round. \n\nYour portfolio having some tech and ARKK is getting hit extra hard because investors temporarily make the market a zero sum game. When inflation is thought to occur, there is this grand idea that consumer cyclicals, energy, and commodities will go up and tech must come down. Of course - because the market is irrational - this is not how that works.\n\nBut where the market is rational: many stocks especially those in technology and services (the COVID economy stuff) have not had a reversion to the mean (average price over a period of days) for quite some time.

What's causing it? Institutional money managers are rebalancing their portfolios and taking profits. \n\nLook at a daily chart for two years for the Nasdaq or S&P500. Blow it up full screen. Measure the downtrends for distance and steepness. \n\nYou will observe two things. The long term trend is always up and mostly steady. But, the downtrends are almost always really steep and fast.\n\nNow look at a daily chart for ARRK for two years. You will observe some similarities to the index charts, but the mood swings are wilder, with the uptrends and selloffs being steeper than the index charts. \n\nSo what should you do? It all depends on *your* timeframes, when you entered these positions, and when you plan to exit them. If you got into ARRK three days ago, if you sell you lose that much money for sure. If you hold, you might lose more, unless your timeframe for exiting this six month from now. \n\nOn a daily chart, it looks really risky. But look at a weekly chart. On the weekly, the last three days is a pullback slightly larger than the last pullback, which makes some sense. Each stock in a strong uptrend tends to overshoot what large investors expect it to hit, and then they take profits, driving the price back down, which scares the shit out of retail investors that just got into that stock and they sell, which drives the price down more. That's why selloffs are so steep; it's a positive feedback loop.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you bought ARKK last June, there's no reason for you to sell, unless you have changed your opinion of how high the stock can rise before your exit timeframe is reached.\n\nThis is how I deal with this kind of event. I look at the larger picture by looking at daily and weekly charts (I'm a swing trader; if I was investing for multiple years, I'd look at monthly charts).

The lower you go the less sense it makes to use LEAPS and the more attractive regular shares become.

Some facilities had to be shut down, workers laid off, expansion plans delayed. Lots of teeth grinding at the C-suite level of chipmakers.\n- As a result these chipmakers put legacy auto on their customer shit-list, served after everyone else: \"New orders? Expansion?

(ECU)\n- Tesla uses consumer grade electronics - and is cooling/heating it and uses a Faraday cage to turn it into a automotive garde platform.\n- Tesla didn't cancel chip & board orders in 2020 - they have a single board assembly manufacturer who was ramping up for the GF3 expansion anyway. Tesla has a single waver producer - Samsung - and didn't cancel HW3 chip orders either.\n- By all means Tesla is a perfect chip customer: not only didn't cancel orders in 2020 but grew, expected to grow 50% per year for the next decade, and is buying high complexity designs with commodity consumer grade electronics - with good margins and a robust multi-leg supply chain.\n\n\n>Unaffected by the chip shortage\n\nCorrect - see above.\n\nThe Samsung Texas ice storm wafer production interruption - speculated to last 7-10 days, is entirely separate from the big \"legacy auto chip shortage\" problem.\n\n> Just not releasing that they will be affected by the chip shortage\n\nTesla, as usual, hedged their 2021 forward looking statements with a \"possible semiconductor shortage\" language - but per the thesis above their robustness against semiconductor chip shortages should be a lot higher than legacy auto.", "score": 23, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not uneffected.\nA big issue with the shortage is silicon ingot production and the availability of raw materials.\n\nSilicon ingots require meticulous \"growing\" to achieve the correct crystalline structure within a certain spec.

Hence, the yeild is somewhat small if you consider all the highly complex sub-13nm chips in demand.\n\nThe entire market is affected in most stages of the supply chain. Raw goods were not lined up back in 2020 because of the uncertainty in the market. Production was shifted to prioritize consumer electronics. And a lot of production was simply scaled back. Unfortunately, demand (for commerical chips) skyrocketed and the market bounced back faster than anyone expected. \n\nNow, we're facing an issue where not only do chip makers need to shift back to making a high volume of commerical chips, but demand for consumer electronics hadn't really died down either.

Essentially that belief dictated many policies in the Clinton administration. When it came time for Obama to push the stimulus, they were concerned about the effect, but then it never materialized and the rates actually went down. No one is completely sure why (lol), but they think that it essentially is related so much money being invested, partially as a result of the Fed money printer working overtime, thus creating a surplus of dollars willing to go into bonds. So fast forward to last year and today, there shouldn't be a major concern about large stimuluses and their effect on interest rates because there is plenty of money willing to buy bonds (Brrrrrrr).

That is the single biggest Zoomer and Millennial workforce collective in America. With this change, businesses can no longer target any iPhone user after they‚Äôve visited their website while using the trigger of the ad that they visited the website.\n\nIe, you visit a red shoe page. You forget about it. Tomorrow you see an ad for a red shoe.\n\nOr, you look at concerts online in Austin. Then you get distracted and don‚Äôt do anything. And then you get an ad for a discount to a concert the next time you‚Äôre browsing.\n\nNo more ads like that with ios14. That is dangerous because 80% of the digital marketing budget is devoted to remarketing and retargeting efforts (across the entire industry)\n\nSo, that‚Äôs concerning to me because while we can convert customers that have visited the website of Our company and that knows who we are, we make 9.7x what we spend on ads. But, with raw new first time interaction we see a return of .43x. This update will essentially fuck all the small businesses that have put in the time to build their marketing structure around Facebook, and even more so removes the ability for e-commerce to use this as their primary driving factor as e-commerce has an even worse initial introduction return but retargeting they make bank.\n\nSimply put, all ads have to be written like you have no idea who exactly you‚Äôre talking to beyond a few details of their interests. You lose all ability to check if they are interested or even know about your company based off non-Facebook interactions. With this, Facebook interactions aren‚Äôt even valid anymore due to their far right audience consuming a 76% majority of their usage, you result in clients that are legit fucked. So you have to limit your buyer persona a ton and in turn your average ad cost will be raised significantly as it has for the last year as costs have eclipsed an all time high of being ~400% higher than last year.\n\nAll in all, you‚Äôd now spend $15000 for the same thing you would‚Äôve paid $900 for previously (unless you‚Äôre part of the .00001% of FB advertisers). Due to the increased costs of Facebooks bottom line but also because of all these other factors combining to make it harder to even find the person you want, much less be given the time needed to convince them.\n\nWhile tracking isn‚Äôt the nail in the coffin, the further downsides of Facebook remove further value. This isn‚Äôt about Facebook though. This is to show that Apple is making an incredibly, multi-industry impacting move with an attempt to bring Facebook to a 0% market share of iPhone users.\n\nWhy the fuck would Apple do this? They would never hurt their brand. They would never make a dumb money decision. They are the biggest company on the NYSE and that didn‚Äôt happen by making off the cuff decisions nor did that happen because of a ‚Äúprivacy play‚Äù Apple has realistically taken as much of the market as they can while touting privacy as their primary benefit to buy an iPhone.\n\nWith this Facebook filed an antitrust lawsuit that is literally going to create a War Between Giants. This very well may be the single largest business brawl ever seen. The number one most valuable company in America that‚Äôs geared to fight the number four most valuable.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well typically, Apple will stay hush-hush since they aren‚Äôt making the move for publicity or branding. That‚Äôs not what happened this time. Instead, as soon as Apple was asked for a comment they stated they‚Äôd be fighting it.\n\nFollowing this, Facebook sends out an email at 3:00am talking about the impacts this will have on all Facebook advertisers. They were burning the midnight oil and they decided fear was the best way to motivate the Facebook advertisers. Fuck Facebook for that tbh.\n\nWell, Facebook has a secret solution. They can basically bundle an internet browser into Facebook and just serve the ads through there. Suddenly, they can track you again because suddenly you are never technically leaving Facebook. This is sketchy as fuck and is a simple one-line fix for Apple to again remove this ability. Like a game of cat and mouse as Apple plugs Facebooks bullshit side skirt attempts.\n\nAdditionally, Apple doesn‚Äôt historically allow skirts as you can see in the most recent time Apple denied a product that competed with a market they are in: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation and this move was super controversial. \n\nWant another example? Maybe a high profile one? Well Apple said fuck Epic Games and went for the jugular when they straight up removed Fortnite and all Epic Games products from the App Store. They straight up murdered another billion dollar company and Apple didn‚Äôt even get scratched. Literally said ‚Äúfuck off, you can come back when you will pay your bill‚Äù\n\nApple didn‚Äôt care. They were going to get their money whether the company or retail investors cared. Apple is going to get paid when you‚Äôre on their platform.\n\nBut currently Facebook pays Apple $100 a year to list their app. That‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt get a cut of ad share. Nothing. So Apple can monetize these small companies making millions but can‚Äôt take a cent from the fourth largest company in America. That‚Äôs not something they‚Äôre gonna be chill about especially as Facebook continues to damage their own reputation. You‚Äôve seen Apple swing once with ios14 and you‚Äôll soon see Apple swing with punch two.\n\nBut before punch two could even happen, Facebook files an anti-trust lawsuit and tries convincing their advertises with that 3am email to support the lawsuit. Uh oh. Must be hot in the walls of Facebook.\n\nSo why would Apple finally pull the trigger?\n\nBecause for years they‚Äôve been building a secret digital marketing ad delivery platform. Where‚Äôs it been tested? In the App Store and they are currently sitting at a 50% conversion rate on average. That means one of two people that see an ad, download the app from that ad.\n\nThat is fucking crazy numbers as Homeer is currently sitting at 3%. That‚Äôs a  16x difference. That means we could theoretically pay 16x less due to the difference in their ad delivery model or potentially see 16x the amount of impressions.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the difference that makes Apple so different? They don‚Äôt want to spend your whole budget unless they‚Äôve found the perfect person. With Apple, you can set a maximum budget of $10,000 a month currently. Facebook currently has small e-commerce shops spending multi-millions a month. In the App Store, there is a ton of money left on the table currently but that‚Äôs not the juicy bit here. The juicy bit is that for the last years they‚Äôve been testing and building this platform while also updating all user experience with Apple products. Finally, Apple has reached 100% control of the apps found and used on their phone, but what they don‚Äôt control is the ads inside those apps.\n\nThe five obvious big plays here.\n\nüëâ Mobile game ads\n\nGame ads have become a meme about how bad they are. Additionally, they are essentially the very last item that can give Apple a bad look while also largely deceiving the users of iPhones. You know how bad they are. An additional upside to this is that not only does Apple look better as a whole, but this is before you consider that suddenly small businesses would have access to an even deeper level of targeting.\n\nImagine now, I know my perfect client is 34, has two kids and plays candy crush before she goes to bed. Well finally I can run ads under that scenario without having to go through some shady venue while also maintaining the trust aspect.\n\nüëâ Ads for kids\n\nFinally parents can prevent their kids from seeing unregulated ads. Honestly, I can‚Äôt give example of revenue benefits here but this does help early adoption and public support a fuck ton.\n\nüëâ Safe for work toggle\n\nFinally, we can have not safe for work ads for those that opt-in. Alternatively, this would function as SFW only but this is again, just another public perception possibility.\n\nüëâ Apple News \n\nNow, Apple has been going hard after news apps for the last year. Why would they do this? Because they have Apple News but it‚Äôs not monetized by Apple currently. Again, they have third party providers displaying ads that Apple gets zero share of.\n\nBut oh don‚Äôt worry, soon Apple will finally monetize all of their software because they have ads running in every platform imaginable.\n\nüëâ Privacy\n\nAnother major benefit is that we can deliver high quality ads as business, will get better ads as consumers all while maintaining the fine line of quality and privacy.\n\nNow, ignoring all of that, Apple has seen a moving average growth of 50% YoY for the last four years. They have a solid growth path with products and for the last two years they‚Äôve built their cloud platform to not only consume massive amounts of data, but also process that data. Just look at how they can now search through all of your photos instantly and show you them instantly without a single bit of that photo data being physically on your phone. They are geared to the fucking tits on software innovation and no one even cares.\n\nTo put it in perspective, Apple introducing an ad delivery platform with 50% avg. conversion rate would be like the day Steve Jobs announced the first iPhone.\n\nSecretly for years they‚Äôve worked towards this moment and they finally swung first in a fight.\n\nEven without ads I fully expect them to hit the target of $165 by the end of the year while reaching $220 safely at the end of 2023.\n\nRealistically, business adoption will take at least 8 months before Apple sees enough profit to even recoup the cost of the lawsuit, but this would be the single largest business pivot ever seen in the world.\n\nSo if Apple goes from a product business to a software business what does that mean for their value? Let‚Äôs look at Stripe since we have recent data and we know what they‚Äôre doing has the same kind of user life-changing benefits.\n\nStripe does $450 million in revenue. They were just valued at $115 billion. That‚Äôs a P/E ratio of 255%\n\nCurrently, the P/E ratio of Apple is 34% so not only do I expect them to land in the high middle range of the two, I also additionally expect never before seen returns for an ad company. Not because they have the largest audience but because they can genuinely show your ad to the exact person you want.\n\nFrom a business perspective, digital marketing is entirely about quality over quantity when it comes to potential consumer eyes and this would be the very first ad platform to operate with this ideal.\n\nFinally, Apple is currently underperforming and is trading on rumor of a bullshit electric car and is sliding, all while literally no one on the internet has considered the idea that they‚Äôre doing all this because they‚Äôre introducing an ad platform that will soon print billions of profit within months of releasing.\n\nNow finally we can cover the aspect that we don‚Äôt have to try and time them developing and releasing this. They already tested it, got crazy fucking results and no one bats an eye. Everyone is so consumed by Facebook they totally missed the play Apple just made.\n\nThere‚Äôs a major war brewing and it‚Äôs only begun. But we‚Äôve all watched the idea that all media is good media be proven true as Robinhood received 3.5 billion in funding during the biggest retail investor controversy in modern day. Regardless initial interaction, Apple investors don‚Äôt get scared by that. Apple investors are Apple investors because they know they will bring hell to earth before they accept not getting a cut of the money.\n\nThis company is down on the month incredibly and there has never been a better time to buy Apple IMO while being prepared to hold for about 8 months for potentially a massive, massive payout. This is not an option we will sell quickly. This is a weather the storm and wait for the announcement to set into reality.\n\nDisclaimer that this is pure personal intuition and this idea came from nowhere but my ass and Facebook sent the email literally Monday so this is as hot off the press it can be.\n\nAll this to say, people like targeted marketing both businesses and consumers but not when it‚Äôs in Facebook hands. \n\nWhat company in the entire market is most trusted to do right by the consumer while delivering an incredible cost at likely a higher cost to those paying while also maintaining 100% of their self-made market? Apple.\n\nI am jacked on 3/17/23 @ 190 for 10.60\n\nEdit: due to an awesome fucking user we now know they are hiring a massive amount of jobs for their ad platforms: https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/search?search=Client%20Partner%20Manager-%20Search%20Ads&amp;sort=relevance&amp;location=united-states-USA\n\nHere‚Äôs the snippet: \n&gt; ‚ÄúThe Ad Platforms EPM team is looking for a highly-functioning, self-driven, and versatile leader who can manage a team of EPMs to drive our site reliability projects.

{"title": "$BB‚Äôs Time Has Come", "selftext": "This BaBy is taking off. BB these past 3 weeks has gone through a shit storm and none of us BB holders know why. It is the most undervalued stock I‚Äôve ever seen in my investing life. BB is your wife‚Äôs boyfriend when he comes over for dinner dressed all nice and shit to impress you so that he can fuck your wife after dinner.\n\nListen to me when I tell you this. Blackberry is a company that used to sell phones back in like 12 BC, it flourished for a bit until Apple came in and beat BB into the multiverse.\n\nLast few years blackberry floating around in time and space realized that it missed some sweet juicy titties and decided that it wants to go back to the physical world so that it can get a taste of some good ol‚Äô titty juice. And decided to move into cybersecurity, or just a security company in general. And I mean the absolute best security the world has to offer, just a few hours ago BB won as the best autonomous cybersecurity company in 2021. And that‚Äôs just scratching the surface. World governments still use Blackberry phones and services because of how much they trust it. Including the US government.\n\nBB has a product called QNX that ensures the safety of the next big thing - Autonomous vehicles. And it‚Äôs working with every fucking one. just to name a few giants using QNX - Ford, Motional, Baidu(China‚Äôs google), Audi, GM, Toyota, VW, BMW and more. All of these auto giants are currently working on AV‚Äôs and use BB‚Äôs QNX, except for Apple and Tesla, but they‚Äôll join in soon enough, Why? Because Blackberry‚Äôs QNX was approved by the government, whereas Tesla has yet to do that. QNX is currently installed on about 200M cars and that‚Äôs just the beginning. No we won‚Äôt see profit this March because it is yet to boom. \n\nanother product BB offers is only the best cybersecurity software available for you an I, called - Cyclance. It is basically like CRWD but better. And it‚Äôs only one of their products. It‚Äôs a subscription based software that protects you as if you were walking down the street with 3 Tyrones backing you up.\n\nIVY - A partnership with AWS(Amazon Web Service) That BB has been working on. It‚Äôs basically an App store installed in AV‚Äôs, and Blackberry will be the backbone in it. Well knowing Amazon, they don‚Äôt fail. And knowing BB, they know how to ensure that nothing around them fails.\n\nThis is probably one of those once in a life time chances to get in before the floor goes up. Watch when the revenue starts to kick in, the floor will be 60$, and mark my words.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is a long term investment, not a get rich in a day kind of stock, but if you are willing to make a solid and rewarding investment, go for it. It may take weeks, to months. But I truly believe that Blackberry is making a revival. And that‚Äôs why I yolo‚Äôd 80% of my portfolio into this, sold all my BA shares to put more in BB.\n\nAlso, I am not a financial advisor, nor am I above average intelligence. This is just me sharing what‚Äôs on my mind. And you should take this with a grain of salt.\n\nPositions: 500 @ 12\n\nEdit: Thanks a lot for the rewards retards, but shouldn‚Äôt you just buy more BB?", "id": "lrznso", "created_utc": 1614232871.0, "score": 465, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 112, "comments": [{"body": "I‚Äôm still holding BB shares.

{"title": "Can GameStop Destabilize the Entire Market?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n* **GameStop** Volatility is picking up\n* **‚ÄúMeme Stock‚Äù** phenomenon is not going away\n* **Success in GME** could unleash coordinated runs that will swamp the system\n* **Instant clearing** will not occur quickly\n* **Regulators** will need to step in or the markets may destabilize under the speculative assault\n\nAfter a few weeks of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 20%-30% intraday moves GameStop stock is once again becoming parabolic nearly quintupling in yesterday‚Äôs regular market trade and after hours session as it rocketed from $46 to $200 before finally settling at $168.\n\n#### Volatility is picking up\n\nThe volume in after hours alone¬† surpassed regular hours trading with more than 41M shares changing hands. It is very possible that GME volume today could exceed 100M shares matching the average daily volume of such trillion dollar capitalization giants such as AAPL.\n\nThe fact that GME‚Äôs volume could approach the volume of AAPL ‚Äì a company whose sales are more than 30 times larger is of course absurd. But GME is not an investment idea on any normal cash flow analysis basis. It is the preeminent ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù which moves strictly on the highly reactive buy and sell flows created on the Reddit r/wallstreetbets bulletin board.\n\n#### Copycat trading could overwhelm current clearing processes\n\nThe GME phenomenon represents a completely new dynamic in the markets that combines social media dissemination, mobile access and commission free trading to create a giant, highly directed pool of capital that could verticalize any stock at any time for no other reason than flow.¬†\n\nWhile this is certainly fun and perhaps profitable for traders involved it creates massive externality problems that could have very negative effects elsewhere in the market. We‚Äôve already seen how such massive volatility swings forced RobinHood to suspend trading in the stock in order to meet margin calls from its clearing house. RobinHood has since shored up its balance sheet, but it is unclear if it will have enough capital to withstand a fresh wave of activity, especially if the GameStop gambit proves successful for the speculators involved and will then attract 5X or 10X new flows that could propagate through many thinly traded, financially dubious securities creating massive 200%-500% daily moves.\n\n#### Regulators Will Need to Step In\n\nWe have arrived at the moment where the market execution technology is completely overrunning the clearance and settlement protocols that haven‚Äôt changed much in centuries. It is absolutely clear that if ‚Äúmeme trading‚Äù is to continue markets will need to go to instant settlement of transactions ‚Äì a task easier said than done. The clearing of trades is a multi-trillion business with thousands of actors and a million moving parts that cannot just instantly switch to a 99.99% uptime regime in order to accommodate swarms of speculative flow. Yesterday‚Äôs FEDWIRE wire issues that deal with clearing banking transactions ‚Äì a much larger and more important business ‚Äì is testament to the fact that financial systems are vulnerable to a ‚Äúbrownout‚Äù event ‚Äì much like the one that occurred in the energy markets in Texas as abnormal demand completely overran supply.\n\nThe events in Texas were tragic and in many ways preventable but the laissez faire attitude of regulators exacerbated the problems a thousand fold. The very same dynamic may occur in the financial markets if regulators do not take control of the situation.\n\n#### Long term Bans may be the Only Policy Play\n\nAt this point it is unclear what regulators could do given the absence of quick legal, cultural and technological directives to instantly move to real-time settlement. The only choice of the regulators is to simply suspend trading in any security that moves more than 25% in a day absent any material financial information from the company. The suspensions would have to be far more draconian than the current¬† versions that are in place. Regulators would in effect have to create system wide bans on any trading in the ‚Äúmeme stock‚Äù security for days and perhaps weeks rather than minutes.

TL/DR at the bottom for the most autist...**\n\nHere is why- \n\n1) **We are still up huge from the close of yesterday** and have seen a solid ground at the 106 range. This establishes a floor, i.e. the minimum amount of money the stock can go if paper hands sell.\n\n2) I have read multiple articles claiming **that Short Sellers just on Wednesday lost a total of 818 million.** Why is this important you may ask?? Well simply put for you fellow atuists, with these HF down nearly a billion in one day, they can't continue the squeeze because they have no capital to buy the calls back. **So this might leave us with no large increases until Monday until capital can be raised to cover.** \n\n3) We know from the past, that without capital **A) there can't be any short latter attacks B) the HF will be forced to pay high interest on these positions if they don't cover them. C) there will be a continuation of a squeeze if we hold.** \n\nIT won't LET ME POST THE LINK- just look it up it's the first article.\n\n4) **Other shorted stocks have a good chance at rising too.** Rember GME is the big whale while other shorts like AMC, NOK, and BB are more like fishes (still valuable but not like the whale). So while HF gathers capital to cover shorts on GME, **they will have to pay BIG BIG BIG bucks on interest with the other smaller stocks.** \n\n**TL/DR: don't panic because you see a drop right now, there is a good chance that it is because of limited capital from HF because of Wednesday's crash, leading to no money to cover shorts.** This means HF will be forced to pay interest on the positions they still have and will lead to a bigger squeeze in the next few days.

Better to take a loss you can recover from reasonably than to see you made a mistake and then compound it to where you can't clear it up without hurting your life in big ways for an extended period of time. Always learn something from trades and try to position yourself so that one trade doesn't  break you long term. All trades won't be positive dollar trades but they can all be positive long term education trades. That's contrary advice to what you usually get here and YOLOing all you have can be enticing just know what you're getting into and mentally prepare for the consequences of what you choose to do.   \n\n\nSounds like you have about $2500 in. Not to minimize your potential loss but even if you're completely broke that can be recovered from in a reasonable amount of time. So while I don't think you should panic I do think you should be smart going forward. You aren't going to lose all of that no matter what. You have to do what works for you individually though so if you need to sell some because you get in a bind then do that. In the meantime start preparing a plan to hustle up what you need to stay afloat in a worst case scenario if worse case scenario here could hurt you badly. Hold what you can and realize that in the long term the stock should see some good days ahead even without crazy squeezes etc. if you do round up funds and it drops to the $30's etc. again that might be worth averaging into IMO if you're looking longer term. But chasing a squeeze that may or may not happen with money you can't afford to lose should probably not be on your menu unless you really understand the risk and are comfortable with the position that would put you in.   \n\n\nKeep in mind that I'm just an ape who wants to be an astronaut so listening to me might or might not be the smartest thing.

Sure you are down $2000 or whatever so far, but think about everyone that held since the last spike and realize they still have massive shorts to cover (buy back).  \n\nNo one will really give you much shit if you sell back off to recoup losses, its your money.  If you want to place a limit sell @ 187 so the moment it hits that today or Monday, so be it.  \n\nHowever there are quite a bit of data to suggest it will go +200, possibly up to 400 a share  either today or Monday.  \n\nOne thing I have learned is to stop watching it in real time, its too much stress.  \n\nSet a stop loss order if you want and close the app.  If you are in @ 187 average, and you don't want to loose much more money, maybe set a stop loss order for $100 a share, so it triggers on a huge downswing.  Or inversely, setup a limit sell @ 187 so if it hits that, you sell and break even.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You have done an excellent job at wasting my time.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
