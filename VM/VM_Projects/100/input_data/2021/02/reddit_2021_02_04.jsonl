Bought only one share of GME for 90. Sold quickly as it tanked today with only a loss of like 15 due to my 2 stocks giving to me. 😅🤣😂. I've been a flipper for 2 years now. Buying low selling high. Things from garage sales,  thrift stores, anywhere that I can make a offer if I know I can profit. I do it for a side hustle making a extra 2k or more a year specially now as I haven't been to a thrift or garage sale in a year. Selling old stock currently and helping my mom sell her brothers old vintage KISS stuff on the side.  My point is most people that jumped on the stock train from GME have probably never used there own money to make money. There's a risk to it. You go to your job and your paid for your time no matter what.  Luckily I did research when I started flipping,  so I knew things to buy and at what price points. I've made terrible buys.  I've bought things that only returned a 13 dollar profit when I wanted 50 etc. I've bought stuff and made damn good money based on the cost/sell/ profit ratio. Through out the 2 years I have only been in the positive. Even with bad buys and sells I've never hit negative in my profits of it all.  Point is... your either gonna do your research, find people who know a little about what there talking about or don't. I'm glad I've had the experience of reselling before getting into this. But I'm glad I did as I love to buy and sell with my own money. It takes getting used to. It takes failures and there's times where it sucks because you either hold onto a item to long and that item might be less desired on ebay or etc in just days or weeks. You may have to hold it and let your money sit in that item like a retard or just cut your losses. I hope this makes sense and it's no wonder people got burned on this. Right now I already researched and just curious about etfs right now. Probably won't swim to heavily in the stocks for awhile. Got some msos cause I genuinely like weed and fuck big pharma. Hope this did something for someone.  I probably am kind of retarded though. If your new to this, go resell and sell on eBay or fb market place for a bit so you can get used to this or I guess you can get used to it just doing the stocks. I'm gonna have both going 😉. \n\nSincerely a fuck tard named Kyle", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Every crash has been blamed on retail.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Let it crash.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}

But something about holding only 4 shares got to me, and i got greedy and held\n\n**Lesson #2:** As it dropped i started reading more wallstreetbets and due to confirmation bias, i believe much of it that the 2nd squeeze is coming and just wanted it to go up. I didnt set a stop loss.\n\n**Lesson #3:** Taking the L (not). As the stock began its gradual decline, I kept hoping it would go up a little so i could sell with less losses. I averaged down 3 more at $110 telling myself to sell if it goes up. It did go up. But I didnt sell because i got greedy.\n\nAlthough i was playing with my own profits, i felt like absolute shit for losing it, and it affected my mental state over the past week.\n\nSo at the end of today, I looked at the total of my trading account and realised im still profiting overall. I thought about my mental health over the past week and decided, fuckit. I'll sell at $50 and will earn it back somehow.\n\n**Lesson #4:** Gains is Gains, loss is loss. It was a huge chunk of my profits that i lost. GME could damn well shoot up again. But it could also go down. It was my greed that stopped me from selling around the peak to cover my bases.

I would, by all means, be what you’d consider a freshly new investor.\n\n\nSo where did I go wrong and what takeaways do I have? And most importantly, why do I still have the attitude that I walked away from this a better investor?\n\n\nFor one, the last week or so was also my first time ever being on WSB. People. Echo chambers are real. Cult mentality is REAL. Can you circumnavigate all that and still take away what you need to? Sure. I'd wager even people that were responsible and realistic with their GME shares first heard of the stock on WSB. If not, the momentum from the sub def helped propel the stock to the levels it reached.\n\n\nBut lesson learned: do my own research and have my own exit strategies. Looking back, the price I bought in at wasn’t too bad. Very late but all things considered, it wasn’t a totally bad investment. But I was never investing in the company - I was investing in the stock. I have mathematical exit strategies for each and every single one of my other stocks. Things put in place so I don’t get greedy. But I stopped comparing my gains to my own lifestyle and portfolio. I started comparing my gains to potentially even higher gains. Instead of making a couple hundred dollars my first ever time investing and using that to diversity, I lost big.\n\n\nI also starting believing in things that were beyond my levels of understanding. Short squeezes, over 100% short, floats, volume, etc. It was beyond my basic understanding of “buy low sell high do DD invest in what I believe in”. So I  had to rely on numbers from sources without credentials i.e. Reddit posts. Which is fine sometimes, because if they were right and I had MADE money, I wouldn’t be criticizing. But this was an exercise in being my OWN person.\n\n\nSo where does that leave me? Why am I not planning to off myself because I lost so much? Well for one, the amount I invested was never a life changing amount for me. I can just plan to splurge less and I’ll make it up in a couple months. Sooner if the stimulus comes soon or if I get this new job or if my insurance company successfully settles my claim. It’s to say that I would be comfortable spending what I invested on a couple of fun weekends for me and my GF. \n\n\nI also spoke to my family about my losses. None of them ever said “oh you’re so stupid you gambling idiot”. They’re all experienced in the market and my brother makes my yearly salary on his stock earnings alone. They instead told me that if I could harness my lessons and internalize them that this is the biggest wealth of knowledge I could have gained. You need skin in the game to really understand and want to learn. If I never put money into GME I would have never spent all those long hours of research of which equated damn near to a crash course in stock investing. When I think about the loss as payment for a class in investing, I feel a lot better about it.\n\n\nSo what now? What will I do differently from here on out? Well, for one, I will diversity my portfolio. GME was 90% of my portfolio and the other 10% other meme stocks. What I plan to do now is have 60% of my portfolio in an index fund like SPY. Another 30% in individual company stocks (that I research very very well). And honestly the last 10% or so will still be in meme stocks and pattern day trading type stocks. I don’t think it’s a good idea to be scared off completely from short term gains and tbh it’s just fun to have 1-2 stocks to check in throughout the day and try to sell at higher points. But it’s all about PROPER. DUE. DILLIGENCE. That either I myself did or that I painstakingly verified and vetted out.\n\n\nGood luck to everyone moving forward. A new generation of smartphone retail investors was born out of this fiasco. Do not let your losses scare you. Just like how a stock can lose value in a day but be back in the green in a couple days, you can also bounce back. If this GME thing is my most expensive stock market loss, I will consider myself very fucking lucky. Information, investing, and passive income is amongst the most powerful things you can do to achieve financial independence. So if you’re reading this and you want to quit the market because you got burned badly on your first experience, I feel for you. I am you. But we must persevere we must be smarter rather than defeated.\n\n\nsidenote: Do I believe Wall St. intentionally manipulated the stock and crashed it by limiting buys and spreading false information? Yes. That may or may not factor into how you feel about the situation. It definitely factors into how I feel about it. I feel I picked a winner and got shafted. But that doesn’t take away from me knowing I was greedy, misinformed, and was just following trends. \n\nThanks for reading hope this helps.

So he did what anyone would do and put a large chunk of it in tons of different stocks. Of course he did pretty well, as I imagine anyone would have done in his position, but the thing is, he is now trying to show me how to trade stocks to make money and has loaned me some money to get started and I'm not so sure he is as good at this as he thinks he is.\n\nI could be wrong, he might be good at it, but from my understanding, if you got in at the right time last year, you could make good money really easily. So he is showing me his resources and the two main ones he uses are Vector Vest and Brownstone research, both of which seem a bit expensive, but he insists he's made money off there recommendations. I've looked at both of them and vectorvest seems to have some useful stuff, but Brownstone seems kind of questionable. I've read about 15 different articles from Brownstone and not once do they mention a risk or a downside in any stock suggestion. Is that normal? It makes me seriously question the recommendations.\n\nMy dad has recommended two SPACs based off Brownstone and pushed me to put half my money in those and now he's pushing me to put more into a third which I really don't want to do. He recommended SPY and that made sense so I got some of that and he suggested picking a cannabis ETF which made sense to me because of everything going on with that, so I bought some MSOS, but SPACs seem pretty risky right now and I have a big chunk of money in them. I just don't know about these SPAC recommendations and his resources though. I don't know how much these resources cost, but I feel like they are expensive and maybe not worth the price.\n\nHe's in his 70's so he's not super tech savvy, though he did just retire and has been using computers for years, so he can use vector vest and fidelity and everything. I asked about options and he said he doesn't mess with them because it gets way more complicated, but I'm not sure he knows how they work at all. Anyway, I just wanted some advice on where I can educate myself and maybe how to approach him if his resources aren't as reliable as he says they are. He seems to have gotten it in his head that he is great at picking stock and timing everything, but I'm just not so sure. Don't get me wrong, he might be good at it and his resources might be reliable, but I'm starting to see clues that if things turned down he might not be able to react quick enough. He has some automatic stop loss stuff setup through vectorvest, does anyone know if that is reliable enough to keep him safe if things go for a turn soon?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": ">I really don't want to do\n\nThis was all I needed to read. \"A good investment is one that fits your risk tolerance and your timeline.\" -- Me.\n\nInvesting isn't about \"picking the winning stocks.\" It's deeply personal to your own specific risk tolerance and timeline.

I want to preface this with I got in pretty early on GME and sold some on the way up and got out about a week ago. THIS IS NOT A \"YOU GUYS NEED TO SELL POST\"\n\nIt's time to accept that the fight here might be over. There's a slew of people posting \"WE HAVE TO HOLD\" \"DON'T SELL\" \"BUY THE DIP\" with little or no supporting reasoning so I started looking at those people that have been posted and upvoted the most. Most have never posted about the market until about a week ago, which makes sense because of the influx of retail interest since GME took off. The real concerning part is most of these people started posting about GME a week ago, meaning that they probably bought in at the top. My concern is that most of the posts pushing GME at this point are less based in reality and more based on the fact that people can't accept that they bought the top, but the new people wanting to get into the market and are using WSB as an introduction into how to trade do not know the difference between them and a real DD.\n\nThe VW graph keeps getting brought up, but it only jumped around 500% and GME jumped over 1000% already. The lack of volume keeps getting brought up, but there was enough volume for shorts to cover since the last official report from January 15 and they also could have also abandoned old positions and initiated new, more comfortable short positions. Maybe the regulation did change on the collateral required on the volatile tickers, so brokerages had to shut down buying to keep their business running because they couldn't afford the cost to settle the trades.\n\nAs much as people on here, myself included, have a distain for the way hedge funds operate, it doesn't change the fact that they are great at what they do. They have more information than us, they operate in grey areas and sometimes blatantly illegal areas in order to get the result they want from their positions, they know the way the market works publicly and how it works behind the scenes. They wouldn't be multi-billion dollar companies if they weren't excellent at making the market work the way they need it and know how and when to exit positions.\n\nAll I am trying to say in this ramble is that you need to look for reasons to believe the other side. The market is not a place to get entrenched in your views and be bull headed. If you look for supporting evidence for the other side and you still believe the evidence supporting you is stronger, stick to your guns. Also know who you are getting your information from. If you are following the advice of someone on WSB who is in the hole because they bought the top, you are probably not getting all of the information to make an informed decision. If you want to make an extremely high risk, high reward play go for it, but be informed before you jump in.\n\nI am by no means a financial expert, or even an experienced trader, so take this all with a grain of salt.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "fight is definitely over", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Agreed", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "That’s exactly how it should be done!

Then everyone is paid $100 per share and you have $10,000 and no shares.\n\nIt can get way more complicated than that—Company A could offer to pay in part or in full with its own shares.   So say the deal is entirely in shares and values Company A’s shares at $45.  Then you’d wind up with 200 shares of company A instead of the 100 shares of company B.\n\nThen it can get even more complicated where Company A is buying a controlling stake in Company B or recapitalizing the company in return for new shares, etc.  In those cases, you might not see any change in how many shares you hold but the result should be reflected in the price and value of those shares.\n\nAnd volume is simply how many shares were traded in a given time period, usually a day.  Say Company X only has 1 share—if you and I sell the entire company back and forth to each other 5 times, the volume is 5.

I looked at the graph, compared it to the Volkswagen graph, and thought to myself “oh shit”. I was wondering if anyone on \\/r/WallStreetBets brought this up, but I don’t think I found anything.\n\nIt looked just like the squeeze, and it already happened. Starting from January 26 to the start of February, that’s the five days. What did we do during this squeeze? We held. We gave the big guys a way out, and a whole weekend to plan.\n\nSo how did this happen? Well, misinformation. The subreddit knew it was being infiltrated by bots, but what we didn’t account for was that this behavior could easily be observed by newcomers. Eventually, it assimilated, and it worked.\n\n**Where was the turning point?**\n\nEasy, it was January 27, the day Robinhood stopped shares from being purchased. It was evil. It was genius. There’s nothing like getting your shorts covered more than artificially limiting the price. \n\nThis did three things:\n\n1) It gave two (and only two) choices to stockholders: sell or hold. If the halt didn’t happen, we’d have been seeing posts like “The squeeze is being squoze,” “Diamond hands, it’s time.” But wait! Only the sell button works! It inadvertedly creates the idea of doing what they *want* you to do, instead of doing the actual smart thing: reap your profits. It discouraged selling when it was the perfect time.\n\n2) It allowed the market holders to excercise their short buy-backs without being the center of attention. \n\n3) It was the perfect avenue to introduce misinformation. “We set our prices,” “$69,420 is not a meme,” “isthesqueezesquoze.com”.\n\n**What’s going on now?**\n\nWell, now the subreddit’s main moderators have been kicked out. With a bunch of new people in the financial sector, it’ll be invaluable to have a group of people be on the lookout for the next $VW. \n\nUnfortunately, I think it’s too late. People like me got in when the price was high and fell. People with college grants. People with life savings. People that made loans.\n\nIt’ll be easier for them to hold onto the share than to sell it, because that’s their cash, and most of us can’t accept that some thousand dollars are now gone. The money could’ve gone to a computer, or a car, a new phone, but instead it disappeared into stocks, into the pockets of a billionaire.\n\nIf there’s another short squeeze, it won’t be coming anytime soon. This was a psychological battle, and they won.\n\n**So, what’s next?**\n\nWell, I’m gonna accept my losses. I gambled in the casino called Wall Street, and lost. That’s okay though, and if you gambled, hope you’re cool too.\n\nTechnology’s incredible. Who knew we could make bets and lose them all in the comfort of our own homes?\n\nI’m going to put the money I do have left into some non-meme stocks. Some prime candidates for me that I saw recommended on this subreddit are GOEV (electric vehicle company) and MRVL (transistors, plus 5G). I was also thinking big companies like AAPL, but that’s definitely for security and safety.\n\nI’m also gonna go back to DoorDashing sometime soon.

I've tried getting into stocks before, but I just don't understand how one earns actual money from it. From what I understand, stocks make you money by you buying a stock, let's say $5, waiting for the price to rise to say $15, and then you sell, so now you have $15 instead of $5. But looking at Gamestop, I believe it rose to $400~, so shouldn't that mean people who invested only made like $400? But in a lot of news, on tv and online, they say people made millions. Do they just mean, collectively, millions of dollars were made? Or that individuals actually made millions?\n\nWhich brings me to another question I have about stocks. It is taught that, generally, you should invest for the long term, and put retirement savings, etc, on the stock market so it will grow over time. Again, I don't understand how money is made. So far, the biggest stock price I've seen is Amazon's, at around $3000. Most others just hover from like $3 up until ~$400. What I'm saying is, even if you bought a stock early at a low price and waited years for it to go up, from what I've seen the price jumps aren't huge, so how do people apparently get rich from stocks? I'm obviously missing something.

The car needed to stop much sooner before passing the delivery truck especially since the delivery guy was right night to the truck. \n\nI'm watching FSD Beta videos almost daily, and here's a couple of useful rules to watching & evaluating FSD Beta onboard videos:\n\n- this is a **backseat camera position**, which doesn't have the full view of the safety driver in the front seat,\n- not having depth vision (3D vision) makes humans more uncertain about how safe a particular driving scenario is,\n- lack of control and poorer vision creates anxiety in the viewer,\n- the backseat camera definitely doesn't have the superhuman, stereoscopic surround vision of 8-camera, radar and 12-sonar high FPS neural networks,\n- GoPro et al camera perspectivic distortion is deceptive a bit, it suggests higher speeds than reality,\n- and the FSD software has superhuman reaction speeds as a final fail-safe.\n\nEarly in the process of watching FSD Beta videos it was a very common experience of mine to perceive a particular driving scenario as \"unsafe\", when in reality it wasn't. (I know because I interacted with the author and asked them about events at particular timestamps.)\n\nThe scenario at 3:22, when the Amazon van was blocking the road and the Amazon driver was \"hiding\":\n\n- Car was at lower speeds than it appears on the YT video, and there was no emergency stop & disengagement.\n- The NN noticed the van driver later than the safety driver - you can see this from the symbols on the dashboard monitor. (and from the reaction of the authors)\n- in post-commentary the safety driver was comfortable with the situation. The other person on the backseat overreacted a bit - it's a poor vision position.\n\nWhile I agree that the car did worse in this scenario than an experienced driver, it did notice the van driver hiding at the side of the van in time & had enough clearance and reaction time left to solve the situation correctly.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Impressive that the Tesla saved the situation.\n\nAs a human driver, I would have waited and let the vehicle going the other way proceed first, out of courtesy and an abundance of caution. I believe at this point the team at the company is still hand coding responses to various situations, and this is a scenario they could consider adding to its behavior.\n\nIf there had been no vehicle coming the other way, as a human driver I would have gone around, and perhaps slowed down and swung wide in the anticipation that somebody might be there or the door might open. We can't tell whether the Tesla in the video would have swung wide, because obviously it couldn't do that with the vehicle coming the other way. But that might be another behavior for the company to consider adding if it's not already implemented.\n\nI think there's a natural tendency to watch these videos to see if FSD beta is now ready for everyone to use, which it obviously isn't yet. I find it more useful to look for edge cases that have already been implemented, and ones that can be fixed now that they have been detected. It's interesting that the driver had enough confidence in the system that he was able to resist the urge to override, and now the team at Tesla knows how the current version will behave in that scenario.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> As a human driver, I would have waited and let the vehicle going the other way proceed first, out of courtesy and an abundance of caution. \n\nYes. The Amazon van driver was hidden by the large blind spot of the van, and the right- curvature of the road. The approach should have been more cautious - both the van and ongoing traffic was detected early on. The double solid yellow line should also have made the car cautious be default - in pretty much any accident with ongoing traffic it would almost certainly be at fault for crossing that line.\n\nThe driver hiding in the blind spot was detected almost immediately as he became visible - but the whole scnenario should have been approached more cautiously - not because the FSD car couldn't have reacted to unforeseen circumstances instantly (as it did), but to allow the safety driver more time to intervene.\n\nBut, and I think this is important, the speed of the approach & the hazards of the situation were exaggerated by the backseat camera: the car was driving ~25 mph at its peak velocity, with a braking distance of less than 3 meters.\n\nThe car did appear to have auto-logged some sort of event close to a disengagement, as can be seen from warning message on the console and the blue dot appearing on the map.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Good point.

{"title": "A rational (and bullish) take on the current state of GME gang", "selftext": "I see a lot of FUD and bad DD going around r/wallstreetbets, and its time for more rational discussions about the state of GME and the potential for another bull run. It is possible, but people need to stop being next level retard. It is going to kill any opportunity to recover the stock unless we stop right now and get our heads straight on what's actually going on. So while I don't know shit and this isn't real financial advice, here's a more rational take on what we need to do to get GME moving again.\n\nFull disclosure: I was in GME in early December at around $15, I was a pussy ass paper hands and folded a winning play of $35 call for Jan 15th when it looked more and more unlikely. I got back in immediately for Feb 19th calls and turned 4k into 70k. I took some profits on the way up (I felt bad for doing so but I knew it was the big brain move, and in the end I pocketed 40k on 4k investment so 0 complaints from me). I'm still holding $115 calls made when the stock was $70 for Feb 19th, and made more 250 calls recently for Feb 26th and Feb 12th at $130 and $100 yesterday. I'm holding all of these till bust, so I'm in it to the moon. I have some shares too but those are a long play, I don't look at them.\n\nFirst, we need to accept or at least be open to the idea that the original short squeeze is done. The factors that led to it have changed, either the hedge funds reshorted at higher prices (around 200 most likely), or they can out last us because they know they have bail outs and the media has put the momentum against us. WE CANNOT COUNT ON THE ORIGINAL SHORT SQUEEZE TO REVIVE THIS STOCK. WHAT WE NEED IS AUTHENTIC BUYING AND NEW MOMENTUM.\n\nOn that note, stocks can move ridiculous prices on low volume. What we need is real, authentic retail buying at prices up to at least $200. But right now GME looks like a sinking ship and no one wants to touch it with a 100 foot pole. So how do we fix that? We still have momentum on our side from a large number of believers from around the GLOBE that want a part in this once in a lifetime story. This is powerful but has to be used right, and that's hard when the brokers are shutting us out. But hope is not lost, and restrictions should lift over time. We need patience and resilience.\n\nWe also need to stop telling people who aren't in this for the moment to hold till they die. Some people are losing REAL money over this and we're being complete assholes telling them to hold till they lose their life fortunes so we can make some tendies. Weak hands are going to sell and pressuring them to hold will make the FUD worse. If we want a come back we need the selling to stop, and that means we need to let the weak hands fold WHILE keeping the floor price above a certain level. Let's talk about volume. The recent 'low volume' isn't low compared to the past months, its just lower than the day when GME was THE MOST TRADED STOCK IN THE WHOLE FUCKING WORLD. Stop talking about volume. REAL selling has happened, which is probably the institutions and the paper hands folding. We need to let this energy run its course. Don't act like it's going to the moon and to buy at any price, save our bullets for the hard line in the sand.\n\nOnce the selling has stopped (and it will), we just need to regain momentum with organic buying.  People all over the world are waiting on the sidelines for GME to look like its picking up steam again and they will PILE THE FUCK ON just like last time. If we push the price high enough, we can trigger another short squeeze but it is NOT the same conditions as the first one. Stop with the bullshit about ladder attacks (which I've only heard of on this reddit) and us being cheated by the big man, that only scares people away because they think the game is unwinnable. It is STILL a giant fuck you to wall street just by making this stock rocket again, the game does not have to be rigged to make this a david vs goliath story. Whether it is or isn't, that only creates more FUD.\n\nThis sub needs to get its shit together. We need real authentic I LIKE THIS FUCKING STOCK for reasons OTHER than the short squeeze. Like GME just adding a fucking Amazon employee to the board and plans for it expanding online. There is REAL REASON to believe in GME, and that needs to turn into authentic buying, which will then create the momentum we need to get everyone else to pile on the stock again. But this shit about short squeezes and ladder attacks and $10,000 or bust needs to stop. It's just making this look like a sinking ship where everyone on it is stuck in the denial stage of grief. This stock has real potential to hit $300+ again, we just have to change our mind set and the game plan. And I'm too stupid to tell you how, but I know this isn't the way. So buy the fuck out of GME at current levels, but change the narrative to something that has actual basis in reality. And tell people to let the sellers sell so they stop keeping us down and we can get a real rally going. We have enough people on our side to move the needle and get the engine started again, its not over. But its gonna require patience and time and if you aren't in it for the long haul or are gonna pussy out on the way up then just sell now so we can start buying again. At this point, if you're not buying, either get off the ship or hold till death do us part.\n\nBest of luck retards, I know we can do this", "id": "lc5ciu", "created_utc": 1612406147.0, "score": 8709, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 678, "comments": [{"body": "Smooth brain retard here, I bought way too many shares at way too high of a price (most were north of 300)", "score": 921, "replies": [{"body": "In at 350 😭 taking the long route back", "score": 581, "replies": [{"body": "You aren’t alone.

{"title": "$SLV is not going to get squeezed...$SLV is the Trojan Horse for the squeeze THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING", "selftext": "I have no horse in the GME \"fight\" right now.  I wish you all the best, and it is the biggest trading mistake of my life so far.  I was talking about GME with my friends in March 2020, and even did trade some options then for a loss.  I must have read DFV at some point, as we were discussing Burry and a \"technical short squeeze\" happening.  But I missed the real boat, so good on DFV and all of the rest of you degenerates.  \n\nInstead, I focused my market attention during quarantine on precious metals.  My opinion is that in the long term (10+ years) they will provide the only real hedge against inflation in the world as every CB on the planet is exploding the supply of fiat to deal with COVID economic disruption.  \n\nIn the short term, I believe that the \"powers that be\" are engineering the largest short squeeze in the history of markets.  We do not have the power to effect whether this happens, it is simply an inevitability.  HFs, banks, and other large institutions are going to extract an enormous amount of wealth from the world during this squeeze.  This money will be taken from the future pocket of every consumer of industrial goods for the next several decades in the form of inflated prices on everything: batteries, electronics, solar panels, EVs...even jewelry and silverware.  \n\nWe cannot stop them, but I have decided to try to hop on for the ride.  The last few months aside, I never saw WSB as a force for societal change, because the people who control the money are always going to win the most in the end.  WSB is a place where we can learn the tricks of a market that is structurally rigged against us, and use those tricks to our advantage.  To use an analogy that I think we all know: I am not, and will never be, Ender.  But I can learn that the Enemy's Gate is Down, and play The Game that way.\n\n\n**The tl;dr is this: the market for silver is the most manipulated physical market in the history of the world.  $SLV is the vehicle that is currently being used behind the scenes to vaccum up ownership of every available physical bar of silver in major bullion vaults in the world.  When it has completed doing that, the \"paper\" markets that have held down the price of silver for decades will become disconnected from the physical markets.  The energy that has been artificially held back for decades by this paper will explode the price of physical silver, and I have no idea how high it will go.  $SLV will stand (mostly) alone as the world's exchange traded product for electronic trading of physical silver.**\n\n\n\n# LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING: WHY IS SILVER IMPORTANT?\n\nSilver has been used as real currency for thousands of years, and there is an argument to be made for returning to \"sound\" money through the use of silver and gold.  However, that is not the argument that I am making.\n\nSilver is a highly industrial metal, and it's usage for industry will only continue to expand as we electrify the future.  Silver is important for electrical applications b/c it is the most-conductive / least-resistive metal in the universe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity#Resistivity_and_conductivity_of_various_materials).  It is used heavily in all electronic applications (even more since RoHS has pushed us away from Tin/Lead and towards Tin/Silver solder blends, with silver being added to mitigate the longevity problems of 100% Tin solder growing Tin whiskers and shorting out components).  But the largest new demands on silver are going to come from solar panels and EVs.  Utility-scale solar is now virtually tied with wind as the cheapest new sources of energy in the world and is only getting cheaper every year.  As fossil fuel plants continue to reach the end of their service life, they are going to be replaced with solar and wind technologies.  As EVs become more prevalent, their components (ESPECIALLY their batteries) will produce additional demand for Silver.\n\nAs smart investors are wont to do, this coming demand for industrial silver has been front-run and large quantites of silver have been sucked into investment products so that they can produce financial returns when demand begins to increase.  2020 showed remarkable investor interest in silver, to the tune of an estimated 350Mtoz moving into exchange traded products like $SLV.  $SLV alone added ~200Mtoz of silver to it's holdings in 2020.\n\nUnfortunately for the market, supply cannot meet demand: Of the 930.9Mtoz estimated for 2020 demand, only 236Mtoz was available for physical investment, because the rest was consumed by industrial uses.  This means that $SLV alone absorbed almost the entire world's capacity for silver investment in 2020, and as you'll see soon, this is only accelerating in 2021.\n\nSource for demand/supply/investment numbers: https://www.silverinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/SilverInstitute2020InterimPR.pdf\n\n\n# LETS GET PHYSICAL, PHYSICAL\n\nNow it's important to understand that huge amounts of \"silver\" is traded on \"paper\" markets, and these markets have historically decided the approximate cost of physical silver in the world, in the form of the \"spot price\".  I'm not going to give anyone a primer on how this works, go read about the London Fix and COMEX paper on your own time.  But the important thing to know is that there are a bunch of silver bars in vaults in London and in the U.S., and electronic claims on them are traded on the LBMA and COMEX continuously, without the silver ever leaving the vaults.  \n\nHowever, these vaults have concrete numbers of physical bars in them, and trading contracts against them technically means that you can show up at a window somewhere and demand your 5x 1000oz bars that a COMEX warrant entitle you to.  This redemption happens all the time, and it can be used to extract physical silver from the unallocated storage at bullion vaults and release it to industrial or consumer bullion uses.  However, these bars can also be moved into \"registered\" or \"allocated\" accounts without them leaving the overall vault storage.  This means that a quantity of individual silver bars that an owner holds title to can be physically moved inside the vault onto a different rack, and the owner has individual serial numbers of bars that they own.  These bars can be withdrawn on demand only by their owner and are not available for general redemption of a COMEX warrant.\n\nSo how many bars are there? Well between LBMA and COMEX, there are 1480.3Mtoz sitting in vaults (sources below when I start doing math).  This includes all allocated AND unallocated bars.  Now, obviously London and NY are separated by an ocean, but people always like to bring up that bars could be moved b/w London <-> American COMEX vaults.  This is an enormous undertaking, but let's make a \"spherical chicken in a vaccuum\" level assumption and say that LBMA + COMEX vaults are a singular source of inventory for both $SLV and other market participants.\n\nIf you read the $SLV S-1 (which I did: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1330568/000119312505127244/ds1.htm) you would learn that the custodian of the $SLV trust is required to hold all silver weight (with an exception for 1100toz of unallocated, lol) that is owned by the trust in allocated accounts, where the individual bars are physically segregated inside the vaults, and the serial numbers of the owned bars are explicitly recorded.  The idea that there is \"no physical silver\" backing the SLV trust and \"you could get settled with cash\" is _ridiculous_.  iShares publishes a report listing every serial number of every bar that is owned by the trust, along with the total weight contained in the bars.  It is 10847 pages long (you can read it here if you have trouble sleeping at night: https://emea-markets.jpmorgan.com/metalicsWebAppJanus/publicUnauthenticated/BONY_SLV.pdf) and is updated frequently.\n\nThe underlying silver is _owned_ by the trust.  It cannot be removed from the trust unless \"baskets\" of 50000 shares are redeemed by an \"Authorized Participant\" which is only a few large brokers.  It cannot be removed by the bullion vaults and given to other customers because it is physically segregated inside the vaults.\n\nPeople who have recently beaten down the idea of a silver squeeze love to talk about how JP Morgan is the custodian for the SLV trust.  And because JPM just paid a $1B fine for historical manipulation of the paper silver market, they aren't going to be honest about this.  This is crazy talk.\n\nWhen it comes to the dishonesty of a big bank, there is \"fraud\" and there is FRAUD.  \"Fraud\" would be them saying \"Oh sorry, we didn't realize that a laundromat bringing in $300k/week of dirty dollar bills was out of the ordinary\". \"Fraud\" happens all the time, and the banks get away with it regularly.  FRAUD would be them saying \"Oh yes, 3rd party customer (iShares) who services dozens of other large banking institutions in the world, here is objective evidence, with serial numbers, that we have these silver bars in the vault\" and then just making up the data.  It is QANON-level crazy, IMHO, to think that JPM is going to commit FRAUD by publishing a list of serial numbers that is completely fake.  \n\nI believe the exact opposite: since they _have_ just gotten caught, they are playing it straight this time and have just switched sides in order to go long.  On the COMEX alone, JP Morgan Chase is long 193.9Mtoz, or just north of $5B.\n\n(COMEX depository data by weight: https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls)\n\nThe problem for the futures and options markets is that their continual trading of paper contracts is chasing a smaller and smaller amount of physical silver that is not owned by $SLV.  And the market participants (minus, now, JPM) who have gotten away with naked selling of paper contracts and mostly settling them for cash are going to soon find the underlying vaults empty and no metal to give to warrant holders who come looking for it.\n\n\n\n# HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS $SLV FOR THE NAKED SHORTS IN THE PAPER MARKET? LET'S DO SOME MATH.\n\n$SLV inventory math:\n\n$SLV is holding 669,357,789.40 troy ounces in trust, and has 720,500,000 shares outstanding.  \n\n(If you are curious why $SLV/share trades below the spot price, it's because: 669.4Mtoz / 720.5M shares = .929 toz / share)\n\n($SLV data from here: https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239855/ishares-silver-trust-fund?qt=SLV#/ )\n\n(screenshot from tonight for posterity: https://imgur.com/a/0sqcMFr)\n\n\nBullion vault inventory math:\n\nLondon (LBMA) silver stocks are 1080.5Mtoz (http://www.lbma.org.uk/london-precious-metals-physical-holdings-statistics)\n\nUS COMEX silver stocks are 399.8Mtoz (https://www.cmegroup.com/delivery_reports/Silver_stocks.xls)\n\n669.4/(1080.5 + 399.8) = 45.2% of the vaulted silver in the world is already owned by SLV\n\nSubtracting what SLV already owns, leaves us with: (1080.5 + 399.8) - 669.4 = 810.9Mtoz\n\n(This is _completely_ ignoring the fact that a lot of that remaining silver is owned in registered or allocated accounts by individual owners.  E.g. there is 150.2Mtoz in \"registered\" on the COMEX which means those bars are already specifically deeded to an individual owner. But they could theoretically sell it to SLV so I included it as available.)\n\n810.9Mtoz is the ABSOLUTE THEORETICAL MAXIMUM available in LBMA + COMEX silver that is not _already_ owned by SLV.\n\n\nNow how short are the shorts?  Some more math:\n\nOI on COMEX futures: https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/silver-futures-and-options.html\n\n    + 179786*5000toz\n    + 130402*5000toz \n    +   8245*1000toz\n    +   1903*2500toz\n    ----------------\n    1,563,942,500 = 1563.9Mtoz \nin currently open interest that could be demanded for delivery.  Just on the COMEX, there could be demand for twice as much silver as there is in the combined LBMA + COMEX vaults that is not explicitly owned by $SLV right now.  \n\nCaveats: \n\n- I have not included any London futures contracts that may have claims on metal here.  I am not versed in their contracts at all and don't have a good data source right now.  If anyone knows how to calculate the short obligation for London I would be glad to add it.\n\n- I have not analyzed any of the strike prices on COMEX options or dates on COMEX futures...some of them could be way out of the money or way in the future.  Many silver producers sell futures years in advance to lock in prices, and then deliver the physical to satisfy the contracts.\n\nUsing the same basic methodology–total shorts divided by shares [toz in this case] outstanding–as is used on a stock to calculate short interest (and gave us the infamous 140% short interest on GME) we get......drumroll please:\n\n1563.9 short / 810.9 physical = 192.9% short interest.\n\n**OPEN INTEREST ON COMEX SILVER FUTURES AND OPTIONS IS EQUIVALENT TO A 192.9% SHORT INTEREST AGAINST ALL LONDON AND U.S. AVAILABLE INVENTORY.**  \n\nBut it gets even worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n# WANNA ADD A GAMMA SQUEEZE??\n\nI pulled the data for all current OI in SLV options.  There is a large number (5.7 million) of call contracts open (here are the totals: https://imgur.com/tiqPA34)\n\nUsing the .929toz/share number, we can calculate that there are up to 527.2Mtoz that would have to be bought during an absolute runaway Gamma Squeeze.  Call options on $SLV max out right now at $55, so the spot price would only have to increase by around 122% to reach the point that all of that weight would need to have been purchased.  But at some point, it could become self-reinforcing, and the gamma squeeze continues to cause more gamma squeezing.  \n\nI believe that this almost happened Sunday evening (2021-01-31) as evidenced by the huge premium that $SLV was trading to the futures price for a few minutes when trading opened.  (My comparison chart: https://i.imgur.com/UPjL3zm.png) \n\nThe Silver ETF that trades on Sunday in Tel Aviv (https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TCHF82:IT) closed up >6% (and was consistenly rising for the entire session) before any american spot markets opened.  I believe that hedging algorithms at MM firms that write options saw this spike as a need to buy shares in $SLV to cover their deltas, and so they bought the opening of $SLV like crazy.  $SLV opened up 17.6%, while paper only opened up about 6%.  Paper market players had to sell 23.8Mtoz of paper in the first minute of trading to keep the price under control.  I have never seen an imbalance like this before, and it was covered up quickly (within 2 hours of trading).  But to me, it sounds like Vincent's heartbeat monitor in GATTACA when he runs out of fake signal: there was a cover up required to hide this explosion.\n\nWhen the day comes that this cover up is not executed properly, stuff is going to get ugly, b/c $SLV won't just gamma squeeze like a normal stock...\n\n\n\n# BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! A TRADITIONAL GAMMA/SHORT SQUEEZE WILL SEEM LIKE NOTHING IN SILVER\n\nThe squeeze in silver will be FAR WORSE than the combination of a gamma and short squeeze in a stock, because shares of stock cannot be removed from the market.  Eventually somebody holding $VW or $GME is going to say \"sure, I'll sell at $42,000.69 per share\" and that share can go back to cover a short.  But if instead of doing that, the holder of that share withdrew it from the market by converting it to a physical token b/c they thought that the physical token would be more valuable than the share (the retail premium on physical silver vs. paper silver), the short interest would INCREASE as shares were converted into tokens.  And since there are currently more \"shares\" of silver than there are bars of silver in the vault, the shorts can be caught with a literally illiquid market that has nothing to buy.\n\nZero.  Zilch.  No silver available.\n\nThe doomsday scenario (for paper silver holders and writers) is the following combination:\n\n- holders of COMEX warrants will see the rising premium of physical bullion to the spot price and decide to redeem their warrants for physical \n\n- a rising spot price will Gamma Squeeze the writers of $SLV options into buying more shares in a runaway fashion and the trust will absorb all available vault inventory as it issues new shares\n\nCOMEX warrant holders who try to demand metal that doesn't exist will literally break the market.  \n\nThe CBOE will probably step in and decide to force settle the contracts for cash at the last known good price, and **COMEX paper warrants will cease trading forever.**\n\nThe physical market price will then be disconnected from the paper market, and $SLV as an exchange traded product will stand (mostly) alone as the new \"paper\" market for silver.\n\n\n\n\n# SO WTF DO I DO? [NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE]\n\nWell I could always buy physical silver, if I can stomach the premium and wait 8 weeks for it to show up.  Or, I could just get long on $SLV.  Since I believe that $SLV will stand alone after the dust settles as the one true claim on bars in the vaults, I could be long the actual $SLV ticker in several ways:\n\n- Buying shares (duh, but it worked for $GME)\n\n- Buying long dated calls (Gamma Squeeze go BRRRRR, but who knows when)\n\n- Buying option spreads (my personal favorite)\n\nIf I wanted to maximize my contribution to the Gamma Squeeze, I'd probably buy as much Delta/$ as I could get using weeklies, which would be 2/5 $26.5C or 2/12 $28C \n\n(Max delta/$ calculations: https://i.imgur.com/Az3o85v.png and https://i.imgur.com/eRPQo6k.png)\n\nCurrent open positions for me are: (https://imgur.com/vWZrziG)\n\n- Jan'22 50/55 call spread (costs .17, moonshot pays $5, 29x)\n\n- 4/16 40/55 call spread (costs .18, moonshot pays $15, 83x)\n\n- 2/5 $26.5 call (to maximize delta/$)\n\n- jan'22 $40 call (to minimize risk of missing the big one)\n\n- $AG shares and jan'23 10/35 call spread (added, sorry i forgot this one: https://imgur.com/fz80V6J)\n\n\nFootnote, all the pictures I think I used, in case i missed something: https://imgur.com/a/0sqcMFr", "id": "lc8vgo", "created_utc": 1612417671.0, "score": 757, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 181, "comments": [{"body": "How is the silver price crashing on the spot price and the price of premiums is rising massively? 10+ days for shipping on physical silver, what is going on??", "score": 90, "replies": [{"body": "you are literally asking the $60B question.\n\nwhen the spot price causes all physical products to be out of stock even with increasing physical premiums...is the spot price truly reflective of the real metal?\n\nthis happened back in march as well...spot crashed to like $12 but physical price was $20+ and stuff was out of stock everywhere.  \n\nif the spot price doesn't match the real world, THEN IT'S A FAKE PRICE", "score": 93, "replies": [{"body": "OP, you need to comment on the $SLV prospectus.

That's not what we need at all. Is there an us vs them aspect? 100%. Are we trying to change the way the system works and pull back the curtain for the public? Without a doubt.\n\nBut the most powerful thing we can do, what will ensure success not only for those currently invested, but for those who join us in helping to bring GME back from the dead is:\n\nWE NEED TO SHARE OUR REASONS FOR LOVING THE COMPANY - OVER AND OVER, CONSTANTLY!!!\n\nI didn't get into this play because of a short squeeze. That's icing on the cake. I got into this play because a savant CEO just took his world class e-commerce infrastructure and turned a 100k company into a $40B company in a few years. And he's coming to GME to do it again.\n\nI got into this play because GME now has Ryan Cohen and his crew, along with Amazon's tech engineer as well as Josh Krueger, who handled fulfillment for Amazon, Walmart, and QVC. Those companies have performed okay, right?\n\nIt isn't very often that you have a company with this kind of brand recognition and nostalgia for us 18-50 year olds being reinvented by a team of proven leaders who have shown that they can get the job done better than most. [Chewy.com](https://Chewy.com) destroyed Amazon in their niche, and that's saying something.\n\nWhat happens to the stock price when RC comes out and starts to share his vision? What happens when they name him CEO? What happens when the direction of the company starts to become clearer and the numbers begin to back up the potential?\n\n**🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**  **🚀🚀🚀**\n\nThis is an AMAZING value stock. I LOVE IT!!!\n\nIf it's worth $800+ in a few years, it wouldn't surprise me in the least.\n\nThat all being said, if we constantly post reasons for loving the company, **others will see the value of the company itself and will want to support it's growth**. That's the heart of investing - putting your money behind a company you believe in and want to support because you want to see it grow.\n\nThis short squeeze, fast cash, fuck the shorts and stick it to the man narrative **HAS TO CHANGE**. It's not helping anymore and in fact, it's hurting the company severely.\n\nYes, we want to expose lying, cheating and manipulation. And it wouldn't hurt to see rich, greedy, assholes devoid of empathy get smacked around a bit at the hand of the little guy. Who wouldn't want to see that?\n\nBut that's not why I'm supporting GME and I know it's not why most are either. We need to remember that. And if we want to see this company grow and the price of stock rise, we should let the world know why we believe so strongly in it. That's not collusion. It's not organized trading. It's coming together to support a company you love and letting the world know why.\n\nYou know what will stop that kind of momentum - **ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING.**\n\nAnd once the rest of the world sees what we see -\n\n# CHECKMATE\n\nDisclaimer: This is not investment advice.

This analysis is not based on any financial wisdom and you should always do your own diligence and research for any personal financial decisions.\n\nI am basing my analysis on a theory based on the quote above by one of my favorite guys Elon Musk. So what long term outcome is the most entertaining in this case? How about TSLA decides to buy a heavy portion of GameStop? Sounds crazy? Good, let's see where this goes. This is what I'm dubbing the \"Planet of the Apes\" theory.\n\nThe case for why TSLA can and should acquire GameStop to make a lot of money.\n\nLong Rant:\nSo there are two conflicting realities right now, retarded geniuses have crippled big hedge funds while not really doing any damage, they got really rich while losing it all. Gamestop is a worthless company that is actually fundamentally able to pay their bills, has locations all over the country and unlimited loyalty and PR from a massive online fanbase through a once in a lifetime event like this. The price shouldn't be so high but we need to restrict buying volume to deflate the momentum. The shorts have already covered their positions while also doubling down and digging themselves deeper.\n\nOne of these realities will become true at some point soon. You may have already made up your mind but I'm still holding and waiting. I'm not a fanboy, I've made risky moves before. Actually read headlines about companies that I had thousands in announce bankruptcy and get delisted. With diversification your gains are still more likely to outweigh your losses in the LONG RUN. Meaning investment doesn't happen over the course of days but rather weeks, months, or even years.💎💎✊✊ \n\nWe all know Musk is a visionary who is unafraid to enter a new, risky venture. He's done it all, payment platforms, electric cars, outer space, even UNDERGROUND! The man is the the king of chasing big ideas in unlikely markets and that's why he's so cool. He makes EV-ATVs and flamethrowers for fun. And he hasn't been shy about supporting us during this time. I think it's fair to say he likes the stock.\n\nNow let's compare TSLA and GME. TSLA has a $800 BILLION market cap. GME has a $4.7 BILLION market cap, currently down from over $20 Billion a few days ago. So they could be bought right now at a 20% discount from their all time high. Now, I'm more retarded than most apes, but to me, that sounds like a pretty good deal for an opportunity to turn around GME by logically pivoting to e-commerce, e-sports, cloud gaming and start to compete with Microsoft and Sony and every other big name in this massive market space, while gaining a massive amount of customer loyalty and support for their other products. This would further diversify TSLAs revenue sources and allow for a lot of really fun marketing opportunities like Tesla racing video game, or console for example.\n\nNow of course, this is fiction. I made it up. But let me tell you a retarded reason why that doesn't matter. This is a real thing that happened to me a while ago and no amount of doubting from anyone will change this totally real experience I had. Here goes, I was sitting in a taco bell and I ordered a $2 meal deal for my broke ass which was an awesome deal because you got a 5 layer burrito, a drink, and a bag of Doritos. And as I was sitting there in my favorite restaurant, admiring the genius that came up with Baja blast mountain dew, and how genius ideas like that are worth millions. And as I was eating a Dorito I realized, this is just a taco shell, broken into a small triangle, with Dorito powder. They should just partner and make a Dorito taco, people will go crazy for it. And then I immediately went about my life as normal. Over a year later Taco Bell announced the Dorito loco taco and completely saved the company with that one idea that I had and never shared with anybody.\n\nWhat does any of this mean? I have the power to make up crazy things and they actually come true on at least one or two occasions in the past. \n\nTLDR: I like the stock. I like Elon and I think he likes the stock too. TSLA buying GME potentially means big gains for everyone and is the most entertaining possibility which makes it the most likely. I'm actually a savaant as proven by my totally real taco bell story.

{"title": "rWSB is losing direction and becoming fractured. Remember Apes: alone weak, together strong (AMC proposal)", "selftext": "First, what do I mean by losing direction and becoming fractured. Before the whole GME explosion and influx of subscribers, there was pretty much one theme on the subreddit: make huge gains or go down trying. **When the GME proposal came up, everyone was pretty much in sync to make huge gains or go down trying.** Now the subreddit has been split by a variety of different camps:\n\n\\- The OG WSB crew\n\n\\- The fresh first time investors looking to start big\n\n\\- New lurkers/spectators checking out the show\n\n\\- Seasoned investors looking to pick up the next big stock\n\n\\- Corporate accounts/bots looking to astro turf\n\n**You'd think that with more people, WSB would grow as a force, but the problem is so many people are split:**\n\n\\- Some people are holding/buying GME for another explosion\n\n\\- Some people are holding/buying AMC, BB, NOK, etc.\n\n\\- Some people are selling because they CAN'T or SHOULDN'T be making any more losses (totally fine)\n\n\\- Some people are selling because they just want to go back to other stocks (totally fine)\n\n\\- Some assholes are selling/buying puts and then laughing at anyone buying/holding GME, BB, etc.\n\n**Whatever the \"right\" move is, I think it's important to remember and to let new people know that the core of the WSB has been and should continue to be: make huge gains or go down trying\\***\n\nIf you made money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then congrats! But if you made money and then came here to call others idiots, then get lost\n\nIf you lost money off of the recent decline of GME, AMC, etc. then I'm sorry. But if you lost money and then came here to insult people who didn't/couldn't want to buy/hold, then get lost\n\n**Regardless of the Gamestop event, this sub has and will continue to make huge gains and huge losses. It happened last year during the pandemic. It happened two years ago with tech (AMD anyone). It WILL continue to happen. Embrace the swings and don't put others down**\n\nAs for the proposal:\n\nBefore people, I'm not calling for people to sell GME. While I'm skeptical GME can rise to $300 again or sustain mid $60s, I'm more than happy to be proven wrong and screw the cheating hedge funds. So if you're holding/buying for those diamond hands, more power to you\n\n**What I am suggesting is that new/returning people on the subreddit look at investing in AMC.** I think focusing on AMC is the right call because:\n\n\\- The stock is pretty cheap in comparison to GME. It's simply easier to have everyone join in a mid $7 amc stock versus a mid $60 Gamestop stock. NO APE LEFT BEHIND\n\n\\- The stock does still have significant volatility to make huge swings. Compared to Nokia for example, AMC has the potential to rise significantly in a short amount of time\n\n\\- The company itself is on the upside and people are getting optimistic that the stock could naturally reach $20 long term without the help of this subreddit (theaters opening up, vaccine rollouts, etc.). Meanwhile, rallying people to Gamestop is a tough sell when Gamestop probably won't maintain $60+ value in the long term (again, happy to be wrong here)\n\n\\- It's received a bunch of coverage. It's simply easier to get people informed compared to some random stock\n\n\\- The argument could be made that there's still value to be made off of a short squeeze\n\nIn short, **I'm proposing AMC as a stock with potential to get everyone on the same page, but any low priced stock with potential would work (as long as the subreddit is united). We have a bunch of new people and attention now. Let's not waste it by tearing each other down or splitting into various factions**\n\n**TLDR: in bold**\n\n\\* It's important to note that you should always make huge gains or go down trying within reason. NEVER invest money that you are not prepared to lose. NEVER put yourself at risk of bankruptcy or depression\n\nEdit:\n\nJust wanted to clarify a few things:\n\n\\- The divide in the community I'm talking about is with users of this sub insulting one another based on their stock positions. There are examples of people insulting me in this thread itself that prove my point. **Don't let money turn you into an asshole**\n\n\\- **The AMC recommendation is just that. A recommendation**. The same way people hyped up Tesla on this sub, I see potential in that stock and it's cheap so that's why I'm recommending it to new people over GME, but I'm just an ape so what do I know ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\n\\- **To people thinking that I'm desperately trying to bump up the value of my positions: no**. If I really wanted to make money, I'd be on r/stocks not here playing it risky. As someone that works in software, the couple hundred that I invested is not gonna make or break me, so losing it is fine with me.

No, read/watch everything you can to learn. \n- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. \n- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don’t give financial advice.
