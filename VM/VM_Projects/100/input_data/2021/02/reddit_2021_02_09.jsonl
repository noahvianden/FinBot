There is a lot of speculation in terms of price, however I will be watching this one closely because if a merger gets confirmed, it still has a lot of room to go up. However, I will not be partaking in the FOMO (fear of missing out), so if $PSTH keeps running up without pull back first, I can skip this one all together. If it does consolidate into my buy zone, I'll be getting some commons most likely. \n\n* Target Price: $40\n* Entry: <$28\n* Risk: 5\n* Timeframe: 2-4 months\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wf1yuumsxcg61.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=b41bff1bc0af9b6f85ca0a18ba920e3eab91e099\n\n \n\nThat is all of the new ones I'll be adding to the watchlist today.

My $17.5 Feb 19th call is down 30%. However, when I rated the risk as a 5, I only went in very small. Still, I'll be looking at this one closely tomorrow. As you can see below, it is riding on the support. I am looking for it to bounce tomorrow; I might dollar cost average this position or roll it. Long term outlook is still positive. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3l206h9yxcg61.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd5a38619e2eb45c3414ea8bb0c8ec027be052b5\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNote: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDisclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.", "id": "lfrp5t", "created_utc": 1612835402.0, "score": 882, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "Any entry price that you’re looking at for AAPL / DKNG?

{"title": "Advice for NEW SERIOUS TRADERS", "selftext": "Hey ya'll. First and foremost I'm hoping everyone is safe and sound during this time. \n\nWelcome to the world of trading. I will make this post very simple and straight to the point because newcomers that I am aware of are making me CRINGE by the way they speak and are investing into stocks, not only in this sub, but including people I personally know. \n\n1. DO NOT spill your life savings into trading.\n     You have worked very hard to make that money. The last thing you need is all that money disapearing in a blink of an eye. Start off with an amount you can truly play around with - and do not jump into the get rich quick scheme by dumping everything. Even if it's just $100.00, it's a great amount to get a feel for the market. \n  \n\n\n2. DD - Due Dilligence \n      This means to investigate on a particular stock you are interested in investing. How so? View their accessible financial records, see how they have performed in the previous years, what situation they are in, etc; That doesn't mean, \"Oh, someone told me Daddy Tesla tweeted about a Woof Woof currency so I'm going to dump my money there.\"\nOr another example is with people claiming that a certain stock will jump extremely high so \"get in right now!!! 🚀.\"\nNO. Just no.\nI am not saying ALL those individuals are ill-minded or trying to get you, but if you come across something like this, then research \"Pumping and Dumping\". (Quick Answer.\nPlease, do your own research. I understand everyone wants to make money, especially during this horrific time, but you must do your own part as a trader and not rely or leech of others. Be Smart.  \n\n\n\n3. Set a target price and limit for a stock and don't be GREEDY.\n     As you see the stock you have invested in is slowly increasing in value, your mouth will get watery. Pretty soon it will get to the point where it gets so high that in an instant it can DROP, causing water to now come out of your eyes. \nI know we want more and more, but especially if you're trading for short term, set a price you would want to sell at. Example:\n\nBAD:\nLet us purchase this stock at $0.25, we shall sell at $0.30. Oh wow it's at $0.30, okay let's sell at $0.32, it will surely hit. Ah shit, it hit $0.23 , we have to sell this just so it doesn't go lower.\n\nSet a limit order ! This will automatically sell at the target price you want it to. Once you get your profits, take off and don't look back saying you wish you invested much more and longer if the stock value decides to increase. Be happy! A profit is better than no profit and/or losses!  \n\n\n\n4. Educate yourself\n     Read up on stocks ! How they work, the meaning of stocks, puts, NASDAQ, ETF's, etc; Familiarize yourself with trading terms. Watch YouTube videos on how to get comfortable with the market, beginner videos on trading, live trading with professionals, etc; Feed yourself knowledge. The more educated you get, the more serene your experience will be within the market.\n\"Any fool can know. The point is to understand.\" ~ Albert Einstein.\n\n5. Handling losses. \n     If you are losing a substantial amount of money from what you have deposited and it is affecting you mentally, physically or is causing you to be in a depressive state you can't escape, then you shouldn't be trading anymore. You have to learn to handle losses. Every trader goes through a loss or failure as so does every human being excluding trading.  It was your idea to get into trading, so you should be aware of risk consequences.\nLearn to enjoy the whole journey man regardless of what happens. Have fun every step of the way and don't let certain things get to you. I've had my losses in the market and I am glad to say it hasn't bothered me one bit. Life is meant to be enjoyed, not to be lived with sadness. \n\nBest of luck to all of us traders and I wish you nothing but success for this brand new year and the years to come. Please feel free to post other pieces of advice as I am fairly new to the stock market as well (been roughly a year).

I’m pulling all my money out of the market at 40% losses). \n\nThere are great online resources that say this much better than I can, but I do think risk and position management is important even for buy and hold investing.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "TLDR: set some rules and let the market decide. \n\nI usually set stop losses at 10-15% (depending on volatility, sometimes even more) below the current trend line.

I then update these periodically to make sure I’m within that 10-15% window. Doesn’t really tell you when to sell, but at least takes the emotional weight out of it if the price starts tanking. The risk here is automatically selling at the bottom, but if you’re careful about your cutoffs that rarely happens, and if that bottom is in the green, who cares, you’re still cashing out with a profit. \n\nAnother approach is to trim a bit off the top whenever your gains exceed a certain percentage. For example, every 20% gain you sell enough to convert 10% of those gains into cash. This approach only works well if you have a lot of shares, unfortunately. If you only have two shares you can’t sell 10% unless you’re dealing with fractional shares.\n\nOne final method, similar to the last but slightly different, is to recoup your principle investment once you’ve made a certain amount of gains. If you have two shares and you make 100% gains, just sell one of them. Then you’re back at your original buy in, but basically playing with free money, so you can’t lose anything. I did this with TSLA and literally don’t care where the price goes from here. Tie in the stop loss approach I mentioned at the top and I basically exit whenever the price tanks, securing those profits.\n\nYou should be able to set up all of these to trigger automatically once those percentages have been crossed. \n\n*Not financial advice, just some shit strategy I was told by some rando on Reddit who’s been in the game a while and likes expensive watches.

Implanting ports or other types of central lines both have very high costs and depend on specialists. A port (the preferred version) requires a type of kind-of surgeon to place (actually, sometimes it’s done by actual surgeons but that’s less ideal from a business standpoint). Usually procedures like that cost a few grand (sterile OR, specially trained operator, etc). Procedures are where doctors make the even-bigger $$$.\n\nCompared to a pill you can take at home on your own schedule without specialist attention, it’s theoretically many thousands of dollars per pill difference. If admission to a hospital is required, tens of thousands.\n\nPharmaceutical companies carefully and selectively use these figures to justify costs for new meds when they can. The hepatitis C cure that came out a few years ago was priced in a similar way (“think of all the saved costs of not treating a chronic infection”) justifying its (iirc) ~50,000 price tag.\n\nThat said, there were some... similar-ISH advantages to inhaled insulin over injected insulin, and that failed so hard it’s off the market. Also, if you’re getting paclitaxel there’s a chance you’re getting other IV treatments so the total cost/price basis may be skewed, and those patients will still need close monitoring including regular labs work\n\nAll that said, it’s a huge advance and I suspect it’ll be a popular med. Being able to reduce the need for ports and infusions is big time.\n\nHope that helped!

Most patients are virus free after 5 days of Aplidin.

There's certainly been funds that have done research, made a big short bet against a specific company and then published the research to try and sway people to move in the same direction. But that's typically one specific fund doing it, and it usually isn't a long term thing either.\n\nThe kind of short interest we saw on Tesla for year, and years, leading up to 2019 was crazy. I've never seen such a high percentage of shares shorted on such a large company, especially when there's no M&A news or anything speculation on something like that.\n\nBig  companies like Apple or Amazon will have, maybe, a couple percent short. And because they're huge that adds up to a lot, sometimes being the largest short bet in aggregate, but it's not really a significant impact on the market because it's such a small percentage. There were times when Tesla was the most shorted stock, by dollars bet against it, even when it was a 1/10th the size of Apple. And it wasn't one big fund shorting, it was an array of funds and retail investors big and small. There were tons and tons of people, with billions and billions bet against Tesla, and they were short for a *long* time, some of them since maybe 2013. They needed Tesla to go down, and you could track the amount of misinformation and distractions and lies that would be posted and spread based on how well Tesla was doing and how bad their losses were.\n\nIt also seems like a reasonable assumption that there's at least some people out there that really want Tesla to fail because they're heavily invested in fossil fuels or legacy auto, and Tesla is looking more and more likely to completely disrupt those businesses. I'd be willing to bet that some of the people who seems to have \"hating Tesla\" as their full time job are either directly or indirectly being financed by people who don't care about investing and just want Tesla to go away.

Are we like headed for some kind of major short term correction down to low 800s again (possibly even much Lower like 600s)?\nI'm also concerned that the next earnings report coming to us in a couple months (for Q1) will also be a disappointing miss, further slamming down the price of the stock?\n\nHelp is greatly appreciated.\n\nThx guys", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well, we already made 500 million+ more than we thought we would in Q1, Q1 is going to be awesome.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So are you saying from here until Q1 2021, the stock is going to be going up?

{"title": "The Problem With the USD", "selftext": "I've recently noticed many people confused and frustrated by Tesla's recent decision to purchase $1.5B  Bitcoin.  I understand that cryptocurrencies are polarizing and confusing.  What are they?  Why are they so volatile?  Are they just a fad or will they gain traction into the future?\n\nI believe these are all good questions, but perhaps not the first questions we should be asking.  I'd like to use this post to give background on existing 'paper' currencies, and what concerns many people have over them.  By understanding the very real and existing problems with paper currencies, we can start to see how cryptocurrencies may offer solutions.\n\nFirst a bit of background on me - I've been around this sub for a little while now..  Long enough to see many of the bulls frustrated to no end by the relentless FUD from bad short-sellers and media men looking for clicks.  When TSLA started posting profits Q3 2019, I watched the stock skyrocket, and I remember the euphoria when it hit $420 the first time!  I was around when COVID started hitting.  I tried to bring attention to it back when people thought it was just in China, and that it was 'no worse than the flu'.  (Like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/f6y91l/everyone_has_been_turning_a_blind_eye_to_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/f8o7ky/tsla_daily_investor_discussion_february_24_2020/fimxmnq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), where I guess I was a little more direct than I needed to be.  The fallout from that second link actually ended up in one of the mods quitting I believe.  I'll try to learn from my mistakes and get frustrated less easily in the future.)  I was also around when Tesla hit rock bottom during the fallout from COVID, and hopped back into TSLA when it looked like governments were reacting and preparing 'bailout' packages.  I now have a new concern - the condition of the USD, and by extension, all paper currencies on the planet.  I've been concerned about this for [quite a while now](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/gze2gi/how_is_money_created_everything_you_need_to_know/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  I share all this, not to inflate my own opinion, but to promote the idea that just because something isn't popular doesn't mean it's not right.  Usually most people are confused and skeptical about something until it actually happens.  We should all take what we hear for what it's worth.  The following isn't advice, do your own research, blah blah blah, haha.\n\n*Without further ado, here's the history of the USD:*\n\nIn the United States constitution, the founding fathers wrote that [nothing but Gold and Silver should be used as legal tender](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI_S10_C1_2_2_1/).  They said this because they knew of the danger of FIAT currency.  (FIAT currency is any legal tender not backed by a real asset that has real value).  When a FIAT currency exists, it is very easy for politicians to get their fingers into it and just make more.  They do this to fulfill campaign promises, civil works, or to fund war.  The end result is inflation.  A century later, it was 'determined' that this part of the constitution applied only to states, and not to the Federal government.  At the time of this decision, the Dollar was 100% backed by gold.  The dollar was an asset.  It was a claim check on gold.  You could take it to the bank, slap it on the counter, and say 'I want my money, Mitch'.\n\nIn 1913, that all changed.  In 1913 the first seeds of a broken financial system were sown.  In 1913, The Federal Reserve was legalized and allowed to operate.  One VERY important thing to understand about 'The Fed', is that it is NOT part of the government!  It is a private corporation, and it has shareholders.  Have a hard time believing this?  [Check out this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Federal_Reserve_System), or [The Fed's own website](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/about_14986.htm), where they say at the very end that reserve banks pay dividends.  In 1913, The Fed began operation and offered to legally print more dollars.  The politicians were attracted to this idea because it meant they could deficit spend, and just tax the people.  Coincidentally, 1914 was the first year of income tax in the USA.  They band-aided things by enacting a requirement that enough gold should always exist to back 40% of the dollars in circulation.  [Here's an article on it from the Fed](https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/roosevelts-gold-program).  Sure it might create problems later, but not on the politician's watch who legalized it.  Meanwhile the Fed and its shareholders get rich off guaranteed interest payments from the US Government, which in used the IRS to collect tax payments from citizens.  This went as poorly as you could imagine.  The 20's were roaring, in large part to the deficit spending that was happening.  Then in the early 30's - the 'Great Depression'.  The first sign that something wasn't right in the financial world.  Strangely, more millionaires were created during the Great Depression than from any other previous time in history.  The working class were being 'taxed', to pay interest to the rich.  It was legalized theft and this Ponzi scheme STILL EXISTS today!  People keep looking to The Fed for answers to the problem.  The Fed IS the problem!\n\nAs time progressed after 1913, two very fortunate things happened to the US economy:  WWI and WWII.  Both wars started in other countries, and the US entered the wars comparatively late.  At the beginning of both wars, other countries had to send a lot of their food and goods production to soldiers, or convert some of that production to making war machines.  This meant they had to buy foods and goods from other countries, and the US had plenty of supply.  So the US sent a lot of production to these other countries, in exchange for real metallic gold.  The gold reserves increased by a lot, and held the US economy relatively stable all the way until the 1970s.  (This is where the concept that war is good for an economy comes from.  War is actually very BAD for an economy, it just worked out well a couple times for the United States.)\nAs WWII was coming to and end, it started to become very apparent how the war had impacted the economies of many countries.  Many countries no longer had the gold to back their own currencies, and were at risk of a new problem - a bank run which would lead to hyperinflation of their respective currencies.  The US offered a solution - [The Bretton Woods System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system).  Under this system, every FIAT currency would be backed by the USD, which was backed by gold.  The various countries liked this because it allowed them to avoid immediate economic collapse, and the US wasn't opposed because it gave them nearly a monopolistic control over the world's currencies.\n\nThis worked for a while but by the 60s and 70s, countries started to to wise up to the idea that the US simply didn't have the gold in their vaults to back all the dollars in circulation.  There was about to be a bank run on the United States.  The tables had turned, and now the US was the one at risk of an economic crisis.  President Nixon had no choice - in 1971 he ended the Gold Standard.  The USD was no longer required to be backed by Gold, and the USD could no longer be exchanged for Gold.  This solved the immediate problem, but again was only kicking the can down the road.  Now the entire world was running on FIAT currencies, all depending on the US to not inflate their own dollar too much.  Did the US stop deficit spending at this point, now that they were carrying the weight of the world's economy on their shoulders?  LOL.  Check out https://wtfhappenedin1971.com.  The economy being on fire actually resulted in the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  1971 threw gasoline on that fire and the wealth gap accelerated.\n\nNow let's fast forward to 2007/2008.  We all remember what happened then.  What many might not realize is exactly how close the entire world's economy was to collapse.  There were too many bad loans out there, made by very big banks.  These loans began defaulting, as was inevitable.  The biggest banks were all at risk of collapse, which would have had a cascading effect to nearly every bank in existence.  It would have taken decades for things to reset and start from scratch again.  Remember - banks are shareholders of the Fed.  What ended up happening?  That's right - with the blessing of politicians, the Fed BOUGHT mortgage-backed securities from the banks.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but if this doesn't reek of a scam, I don't know what does.  In reality - what option did the politicians really have at this point?  As a way to patch the 'economy', and get dollars flowing again, The Fed was also authorized by the govt to print about 15% additional currency.  [Here's the chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Money_Supply_-_M1_-_Nov_08.png).\n\nIn addition to that - a brand new financial model, never before used except in Japan, was legalized and instituted - Quantitative Easing.  Quantitative Easing allows the banks to take your dollars in your account, and lend them out to someone else.  This is very similar to short selling, where a share is borrowed from an owner, a fake share is created and sold to someone else, and then is covered at a later date.  QE has a 'Reserve Requirement', which means that not every dollar in your bank account can be lent back out.  If the RR is 50% - only half can be lent out.  If the RR is 5% - 95% of your bank account can be lent out.  The RR was set at 10% in 2008, where it remained for 12 years.  A flood of extra currency was sent into the economy, but the RR kind of kept a cap on things, because the artificial dollars had to be paid back and were destroyed at that point.  In addition, the extra currency directly printed by the Fed ended up mostly in bank vaults, as the currency was given directly to the banks and at the same time the banks had restrictions put on them, requiring them to keep a larger vault to avoid this sort of thing happening again.\n\nFast forward to 2020.  We all remember how quickly things changed in March and April.  The world quickly had to react to a problem it didn't understand yet, and much of the world was even still in denial.  COVID restrictions had to be enacted to save lives, but how would people pay their bills?  How would business survive?  Would the banks go under again?  The Fed and the government had to quickly and drastically react to 'save' the economy.  30% more dollars were printed in 2020, and this time they were sent directly to the consumers, not to the banks!  This means there's now 30% more currency out there in consumer's hands, ready to be used.  Whether people are spending that on rent or on cocaine and booze - it doesn't matter as far as the economy is concerned.  The currency is just trading hands, and the next person in line now owns it and can buy whatever they want.  The currency exists and now there's more of it in circulation.  When 100 people show up willing to buy a $10 item because now they can afford it - guess what happens to that item?  It goes to $12.  Basic supply and demand.  Now, in 2021, it's looking like they'll be printing an additional 10% of currency.  We'll have to wait and see what the new 'bailout' package contains.  But wait, there's more - remember the QE RR?  Guess what happened to it?  [They set it at 0%](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200315b.htm).  Can't make this up.  The banks are now allowed to just create money out of thin air.  I deposit $100, the bank can lend $100 of that out to someone else.  Then that someone else deposits $100, and their bank can take all of it and lend it to someone else.  And on and on and on.  But wait, there's more.  You'll see in that same link that The Fed is encouraging banks to use their vault dollars from 2008 to lend to consumers as well.  So that additional 15% from 2008 is now likely leaking into the economy as well.  Someone PLEASE explain to me how this will end well.\n\nRight now, 'Money Velocity' is still low, which is why we aren't seeing prices rise yet.  Doesn't matter how much people have in their accounts, if they're not showing up to spend it, there isn't a lot of demand, and the prices don't rise.  However as the vaccination programs progress and the virus comes under control, restrictions will be lifted and people will feel more comfortable going out to restaurants or booking hotels or buying plane flights, getting that new car now that they're driving again, etc.  'Money Velocity' will pick up quickly in 2021, and with who knows how much more dry powder out there, this can only end in one way - LARGE amounts of inflation.  Eventually, people will lose trust in the USD, and in all the FIAT currencies that are STILL tied to it, and start trading with things that have real value again - like gold and silver.  (I've heard a lot of people say that inflation isn't a risk, that actually the biggest risk is deflation right now.  Hopefully this helps you understand those concerns and put them in context.)\n\nEnter Bitcoin.  There's a finite supply.  Politicians can't control it.  It's secure.  Companies are starting to accept and purchase it.  (Tesla is only the most recent to do so).  There's smart people out there who already know everything you just learned, and they're trying to get ahead of the pack.  This leads to a common misconception about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, one that even many around this subreddit have - that Bitcoin is a speculative asset, that it's too volatile to be considered a good investment.  Bitcoin isn't an 'asset', it is a CURRENCY.  It's a digital coin that both buyers and sellers have agreed to exchange in return for real goods and services.  It's new, so of course there can be a good bit of volatility.  But volatility doesn't mean it's a bad investment.  Case in point - TSLA.  In addition to a newcomer's natural volatility - there's another thing to consider: the dangers of inflation of the USD.  If you look at BTC/USD, the volatility is high.  If you look at BTC/Gold, the volatility is less.  BTC/Silver, the volatility is even lower.  We have to stop using the USD to determine something's value.  Really, we should use other things to determine the USD's value.  When you do that, the USD is looking pretty horrible right now.\n\nTell this to your grandma or your co-worker at work, and they'll look at you like you're crazy.  But now you understand what they don't.  EVERY FIAT currency eventually collapses at the hands of politicians.  Happened to Rome, to Greece, Germany, Venezuela, etc etc etc.\n\nJust so you know, I didn't figure all this out on my own.  I learned from the best - Mike Maloney.  He has a series on YouTube called 'The Hidden Secrets of Money'.  I -highly- recommend investing a few hours and watching every episode!  [Here's a link to the playlist.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE88E9ICdipidHkTehs1VbFzgwrq1jkUJ)\n\nTLDR:  USD is FIAT and FIATs BAD.  Lots of history leading to BAD stuff.  BTC good.  TSLA now bulletproof.  Elon smart.\n\n(PS: I don't think cryptocurrencies are perfect.  While each crypto does have a limited supply, there's nothing preventing people from just making new types of cryptos, which will inflate the existing crypto pool.  Also, regarding BTC in particular - it has scalability issues.  If the whole world switched to BTC, it could take days to confirm a transaction, and would require more electricity that the planet produces.  A more efficient crypto is desirable.  Mike Malony likes Hadera Hashgraph's HBAR.  I'm still investigating and thinking on this.)\n\nEDIT - Words", "id": "lg5ka8", "created_utc": 1612884115.0, "score": 114, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 107, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely.

The primary purpose is to enable economic transactions. To make an analogy, the currency is like the blood in the body -- it helps with moving things around so that the body can operate.\n\nAs the body grows, however, it needs more blood. It cannot grow if the blood is insufficient. An adult has much more blood than a child for that reason.\n\nThe same applies to the economy as well in a sense -- it cannot grow if there is not enough currency around. Having a fixed currency supply (e.g. backed by a fixed amount of gold) limits the growth of the economy. For example, many economies managed to escape the Great Depression effects only after leaving the Gold Standard and adopting FIAT.\n\nBut what about inflation, you say? Wouldn't printing so much money lead to hyper-inflation? A few points about that:\n\n* We have a pretty good experience with managing and controlling inflation. There are many tools for that. The same argument you made was made a decade ago after the Great Recession when the FED increased the money supply **four times**. Lots of people were warning about the upcoming hyper-inflation. Yet, the inflation did not go above 3%. Why? Because as mentioned the FED has many tools to manage the money supply and the inflation.\n\n* **Deflation is far more dangerous than inflation**. Unlike with inflation, we do not have good effective tools to manage deflation (often referred to as \"corrosive deflation\"). Once the economy enters deflation, it is very, very difficult to escape it and get the economy to grow normally again -- see Japan's Lost Decade. This is why the FED flooded the economy with cash last year -- the US economy was on the verge of another financial crisis and entering deflation as a result. Only the FED's intervention saved it. Had the US economy been on a fixed currency like Bitcoin or the Gold Standard, it would have been in a deflation territory right now and the US would have had a lost decade (at least).\n\nThe above two points are why the FED much prefers some manageable inflation, rather than even a bit of a deflation.

The people and businesses using the dollar depend on it containing a certain value to operate, the same as the organs and tissues depend on the blood they receive containing a certain amount of red blood cells.  As the value of the blood becomes less and less, eventually organs stop working and tissues die.  The financial system would be able to transfer dollars just as well, whether the M1 supply was $1B or $100T.  Prices would just be lower because the dollar would be more valuable.\n\nI agree that inflation does give the government some control over the way their economies look during times of crisis.  However, those crises usually only exist because of inflation in the first place.  (1931, 1987, 2000, 2008).  And the economy would be be able to weather the other causes, like a pandemic, if it weren’t so delicate because of inflation.\n\nI don’t believe inflation is a good thing.

For me I picture value as the value of goods and services.  For example, having a good wife has certain value of X attributed to it.  Having 2 wives then = 2X of value, and so on.  Having a good car has certain value to it.  Having 10 of those cars has 10 times that value.\n\nFor something like a car, the value is much higher than the value of its raw materials sitting in the Earth.  Similarly, for a human, the value of a well-formed, highly educated individual is much higher than the value of a low-class uneducated drunk.\n\nTherefore, in my mind, the net value of goods and services on the Earth keeps increasing.  And in that case, it is fitting to have a matching increase in money supply.  If you don't increase the money supply to at least match the increase in value of goods and services, then each coin becomes more and more valuable.  When the coins get more and more valuable, then people will hoard them instead of trading them for the things that are actually useful and worthwhile.

Having a fixed currency, however, would not have prevented economic crises -- the business cycle (the ups and downs) was there during the Gold Standard as well.

This is the definition of deflation.\n\nThe effect of the currency increasing in value like that is that consumers would hold onto it and use it only for the critical things and little else, as they would be able to buy more stuff in the future. Producers on the other hand would not invest in anything that has not already been ordered, as their production would lose value with time quickly. In short, the economy would slow down tremendously.

However, debt used for investment is the mechanism that makes capitalism work and grow so well. When the ROI is greater than the interest, then everybody wins. So debt is actually desirable if used properly.\n\nIn other words, it is okay for the governments to issue debt to pay for various productive activities (e.g. education and infrastructure), as long as the economy grows faster than the debt on average.

Similarly, every time you double the value of the economy (i.e. net collection of all goods and services produced by humans), you again double the value of each coin.  Having a constant source of new coins actually helps the keep the value of each coin in check.  If you don't solve this second problem, and the value of the coins keeps increasing, then people will stop using them to purchase goods and services and will instead hoard them.

Suddenly you had more transactions than could be cleared every 10 minutes because you had 1.5mb of data every 10 minutes.\n\nThis caused fees to go up, and like today, they can be over $10 and $50 is common for complex transactions.  It is increasingly hard to know how much you have to pay to be in the next block because it's very unpredictable.  You pay $10 but moments later everyone jumps ahead and pays $12.  Now you sit unconfirmed for hours, days or weeks until you expire out of the mempool\n\nNow imagine instead of 1.5mb or 2mb of data building up behind the 1mb limit, it was 100mb or 200mb or 1gb because millions of people were trying to use it.\n\nThere was a civil war within the community about simply raising the limit.  The person Satoshi handed the reigns over to (Gavin Andressen) wanted to raise the limit, along with many others, but other developers disagreed and mods at /r/bitcoin started censoring discussion and banning people talking about it. There was lies, character assassinations, corporate support assassinations, sock puppets to sow dissent, all sorts of terrible things happened.  It was incredibly tragic to watch happen in real time.\n\nIn 2017, after an agreement to raise the block size to 2mb if we also implemented Bitcoin Cores (in my opinion) poorly thought out upgrade SegWit alongside it, fell apart after they reneged on the agreement and only implemented SegWit and refused the 2mb upgrade.\n\nBitcoin Cash was born.\n \nBitcoin cash forked from that point in time, and it carries the same genesis block and history of Bitcoin up to that point in time.  They removed the 1mb limit, and also removed some other code that had crippled certain functionality on Bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin Cash is trying to follow Satoshi's original vision, and today, could handle visa level payments, and they are working on upgrading to support 1gb blocks every 10 minutes so it will be ready if we ever needed it in the future.  This is a problem you can literally throw hardware at which keeps getting cheaper and cheaper, and Satoshi envisioned that as the network grew it would eventually be specialized data centers that held the blockchain as it would be too big for regular users to do.\n\nBitcoin Core declared that this route would destroy bitcoin and refused to raise the limit.\n\nBitcoin will crumble under a massive influx of users because of this limit, without building a l2 system.  They use the \"Lightning Network\" as a carrot on a stick to say they are working on it, and they are working on it, but it has so many flaws it may never work, only time will tell.  And if it does work, it will probably be a centralized service that requires some level of trust, and is censorable by governments due to that centralization.\n\nEdit: You can see the transaction backlogs here: https://txstreet.com/v/bch-btc\n\nEdit: If you want to read more about Bitcoin Cash you can go to /r/btc where discussion is uncensored, or /r/Bitcoincash\n\nEdit: SegWit does allow for more transactions through some accounting tricks, but it requires everyone to use this new transaction type which is not well adopted for various reasons.

{"title": "First Year Wheeling: $390k in premiums collected, $187k in missed profits. $750k starting account.", "selftext": "**Please read major edit. Drastic turn from when I originally posted.**\n\n**TLDR in this bull run of a year, capped my gains by selling calls on my stocks and didn't make enough in premiums selling cash secured puts compared to just being long the underlying. The wheel cost me $575,947 in missed profits.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I'm fairly new to this, but I figure I'd try to come up with as good an account of my first yearish of wheeling.\n\n**Background:** I've generally been buy and hold with 80% of my portfolio for a few years, but last year I decided to try and sell covered calls as well as Cash-secured puts on cash that resulted in any of those covered calls being assigned.\n\nThe very first trade was selling a covered call on my existing shares of AMZN on March 17, 2020. I was still a little panicked by Covid, but didn't want to exit AMZN, my biggest gainer at the time. So to express my fear, I thought I'd sell a call. At the time, AMZN was 1807. The strike was 2120. I collected $3500 in premium for this. 45 days later at expiry, AMZN was at 2287. I lost about $13,000 on this very first CC.\n\nKeep in mind, this started at around the peak of Covid panic last year and in hindsight, just going long some of these equities would have been better and many CCs were assigned at the beginning.\n\nNot everything was high IV. I was coming from a place of buy and hold ETF investing, so many of the initial stocks I sold covered calls on were ETFs like SPY, QQQ, IJS... etc.\n\nAppreciate any comments or advice / if I'm looking at things the right way. I had to tease out some other trades that were messing with my data, but in general, I filtered for opening trades (Interactive brokers denotes which trades are opening and closing) and when they were a \"sell\" that opened the position, I just classified it as a thetagang trade. Anyway, here are the results:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||Covered Calls|Cash-Secured Puts|Total|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Total Opened Trades|74|46|120|\n|Average Days to Expiry|31.6|27.4|30|\n|Average Annualized Yield on Underlying / Cash\\*|38.41%|39.55%||\n|Closed Via Expiry|44 (72.1%)|33 (84.8%)|94|\n|Closed Via Assignment|12 (19.7%)|2 (6.1%)|14|\n|Closed Manually|5 (8.2%)|3 (9.1%)|8|\n|Total Closed|61|33|94|\n|Total Premiums collected|147,441|242,454|389,895|\n|Missed Profit\\*\\*|\\-163,239|\\-808,765\\^|\\-971,271\\^|\n|Saved from Losses\\*\\*\\*||$5,429||\n|**Gain / -Loss relative to buy and hold underlying**|**-15,798**|**-560,882**|**-575,947**|\n|||||\n\n**\\*Average Annualized Yield on Underlying / Cash:** Here I took the premium received, divided it by the underlying commitment (market value of underlying stock for CC at trade, cash for CSP) and multiplied it by 365/DTE to annualize.\n\n**\\*\\*Missed Profit:** For covered calls, this is simply the amount above strike at expiry x contracts \\*100. This was particularly hurt by AMZN (-90,970), SHOP (-22,096), and SPOT (-13,220). For Cash-secured Puts, I looked at the price at selling the put vs the price at expiry. The assumption was, anything I sold a CSP on, I was willing to hold - so this was the opportunity cost of me selling a put instead of just buying the stock. Notable opportunity costs here were ZM (-7,235), and SQ (-4,770)\n\n**\\*\\*\\*Saved from losses:** On the other side of the coin, selling a put instead of buying the underlying also saved me from some losses when the underlying went down. This funnily enough, also ZM (4,399)\n\nNow, while AMZN was the most missed profit, wheeling it was a net profit of $8,691 due to collected premiums. The biggest loss due to wheeling was  SHOP where net of premiums, the effect of wheeling was -$7,281.\n\n**ALSO.** Big note, I just realised  I hadn't adjusted these for the relative size of these positions. Maybe I'll do so in an edit.\n\nI sadly couldn't easily extract out the volatility / deltas at the time of the trade via the Interactive Brokers trade report, but I generally targeted 0.30 Deltas for both CCs and CSPs. I went by gut for higher deltas for CC when I felt like I didn't want to hold the underlying anymore. This may have been my undoing. For the longest time I couldn't reconcile the bull market with the things going on and expressed this bearishness with higher delta CCs which probably resulted in my getting assigned.\n\n**First Conclusions:**\n\nGiven the staggering recovery since march, it's unsurprising that many of the CCs I sold became ITM. While I did take some comfort riding the OTM to ITM range, tabbing things up today and seeing that I was net negative on CCs is a bit of a blow.\n\nOverall, it was an interesting learning experience. I might continue to do so. I currently have a disproportionate amount of cash as a result of being sold out of some shares, and I'm continuing to sell CSPs on that as well as CCs on the remaining stocks. Overall it feels like running the wheel was still a net positive.\n\nFor me, selling CSPs has also been a mental help. While I do believe I need to keep as much capital in the market for long run growth, it was hard to do last year with all the negative news. Selling CSPs tied my hands to \"buy dips\" while compensating me for not necessarily investing all my cash immediately well above any savings account rate.\n\n**Edit 1:** Note on Missed Profits.I feel like I should once again stress that \"Missed Profits\" is relative to Buying-and-Holding the underlying which I'd like to establish as my default position. It's not missed profits relative to holding just cash. The question I had on my mind was is wheeling (or its components of CCs / CSPs) better than the alternative of just buying the underlying, which I was doing before this.\n\nIntuitively, for a bull market we can see it like this. I was pretty fully invested in equities. so let's just say I had a delta of 1. Selling the CCs reduced my delta by about 0.30. So as the market rose, I only rose 70% as much. I'm comparing my default Delta of 1 to a CC delta of 0.7, which in a bull market is worse than my default.\n\nIf you're comparing a CC to a CSP in a bull market, the CC should do better since it's a total delta (1-0.3) of 0.7 vs the CSP of 0.3.\n\nAgain this is my rough understanding, but there seems to be some confusion of why I don't count the gains of the underlying stock. It's because **I would have had those gains in the base case anyway so they cancel out. I wouldn't have been in cash.**\n\nEven more simply put, on the CC side, if I hadn't sold calls, I would have been 15,798 richer. BUT as another user has mentioned, if I hadn't, I wouldn't have sold the CSPs which would have made me 223,750 poorer. So despite that CC column, I will continue \"wheeling\" (some have suggested this isn't wheeling but hedging a long underlying) as the net effect from my point of view is doing $207,952 **better** than what I was doing before which was just buying and holding.\n\n**\\^MAJOR EDIT:** I kept being bothered by how low my missed profits were from CSPs relative to CCs in this bull market. (Reminder, I said my alternative to CSPs was buying the underlying).\n\nI went to my spreadsheet again and realised I had made a huge mistake. I had this formula item where I said max(f(x),0) instead of min(f(x),0). I've fixed it, and I'm sure there are may be more errors but this makes sense tome.\n\nIt's a huge change. I almost want to delete this post because of how misleading it was when I initially put it up. Wheeling instead of just buying and holding for the specific stocks I picked was incredibly costly to me. I capped my gains initially selling those early CCs on my stocks resulting in missed profits of 163,239. Once those assigned calls were in cash, I sold puts on stocks which if held, would have gained  560,882 more than the premium I received.\n\nThere are a lot more open questions like if I would have in fact had all those positions if I were just sticking to my buy and hold portfolio, but I think I'm going to review my sheet some more before I spread too much misinformation. I actually was less than fully secured by cash for puts I sold. Looking at my portfolio now, I'm actually short about 70,000 cash to cover the puts I've sold if they are all fully assigned. Though if I account for the low deltas, I have enough for any likely assignments. To calculate that missed profits though, I still use:\n\n(Stock Price^(At Put Sale))-(Stock Price^(At Put Expiry)) \\* Contracts \\* 100\n\nOnly when Stock Price at put expiry > stock price at put sale.\n\nI'm definitely re-thinking wheeling in the future. This kind of jives with intuitively what I thought would be the case - wheeling would be worse than buy-and-hold in a bull market, but I thought it might have some portfolio volatility dampening effects which I have to later investigate. Many of the articles I've read on backtests also show wheeling underperforming long term buy and hold.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/spintwig.com\\/spy-wheel-45-dte-cash-secured-options-backtest\\/](https://preview.redd.it/jximnrlk7ig61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8883e0d5713a83e8c61f4ebedf74df2a5815e990)\n\nAnyway, this is pretty chastening for me. It initially felt good to look at premiums and relatively few assignments and think that I had done well. In actual fact, my choice to deviate from buy-and-hold had cost me an enormous amount of money. I'll look into my actual stocks, deltas, vols, DTE etc to see if anything could have been done better in my selection or if the solution is simply to buy and hold instead of wheel in a bull market. \n\nI will state though it definitely didn't feel like it should have been a bull market the whole way through, had I known I would have just gotten LEAPs.

First, last year was one of the most incredible bull runs of all time, especially if you start at the end of March instead of January.  No surprise that selling puts wouldn't come close to owning the underlying when just about every stock doubled last year, and some many more times over than that.  Now that things have stopped freaking out so much and we've hit a more level ground, the benefits of selling puts vs owning the underlying should be more achievable. \n\nSecond, you are running your wheel a very specific way.  Running 30-45 DTE and it looks like you are letting almost all of your positions expire.  I don't see that advocated around here as the most efficient way, typically it is 30+ DTE and close at 60-70% profit, rinse and repeat.  That could certainly have an impact on your returns if you are leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars tied up in a CSP that has less than 10% left to squeeze out of it and a week or more to do so.  \n\nThird, what about weeklies?  I know they don't get too much love around here, but they are my bread and butter now.  I'm picking high IV stocks and running weekly CSP's on them at relatively safe prices for 1-3% returns in a week.  I know relatively safe is not really a thing, especially with high IV stuff, but so far so good, and if I get assigned I can usually run the call out for next week at the same strike as the put, and get the high IV premiums on both ends of the deal without too much drama.\n\nFourth thing is leverage.  I don't know about you, but I use Fidelity and they count CSP as less impactful on my buying power than they do for owning the underlying.  If I'm properly diversified, they count 25% of the cash total for a put against my buying power.  I can't hold a stock for that low amount.  Lowest I've seen for a stock has been 35%.  Plus, when you are holding the stock, you are paying margin interest.  When you are using your margin as buying power, you aren't paying the interest, but still getting to use the buying power of your full margin balance.  So I can pull down 1-3% for a week, but that is actually 1-3% of 4x my cash balance, so 4-12% actual return on my money in a week.  Granted, I usually stick to the lower end of that spectrum when dealing with margin as it can get out of hand easily.  But that is mitigated by a couple things, either buying an insurance put at a lower strike to make a spread and limit my max loss and max gain, or closing out my position for a loss early and still remaining liquid to buy once the floor has been found.  \n\nI know nothing is foolproof, and anybody who says otherwise will choke on that hubris eventually.  But right now in a relatively stable bull market, I'm going to cash in as much as I can.  And so far doing margined CSPs weekly has given me an incredible rate of return on my money.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "This!

If you are not doing that, you are intentionally handicapping yourself. \n\nAs for a fixed exit strategy, I see CCs on most trades I do as exactly that. I want to set myself a profit % for the week or whatever timeframe I am selling for, and then exit that trade and move on. If I know I can make 3% premium on a trade + whatever upside I get, this is exactly what I want. The goal is to make a specific ROI, and if you make that ROI you made the best possible return on that trade. \n\nWe are not clairvoyant and this is all in the end a gamble, and the goal is to maximize your profits from a specific trade/scenario.

Thanks for sharing.\n\nSome thoughts:\n\n- Comparing buy & hold vs selling puts purely on a profit basis is hugely misleading. Not only do they entail different risks but, if you’re selling naked puts, also require diff amounts of capital. \n\nHindsight is 20/20 so it’s easy to see the “missed profits” from selling puts instead of b&h, but this was during an unprecedented bull run when everyone was expecting a very jagged recovery. The peace of mind csps offer has a price. Lower risk, lower return. \n\nInstead of tracking based on profit, consider calculating ROI, ROR, and Annualized ROR. Those might give you a better idea on the most efficient use of your capital (and I’d honestly love to know what those numbers look like). \n\n- Covered calls. Not even once. I understand the allure of putting your holdings to work but, personally, I tend to hold high growth stocks so putting a cap on the gains just isn’t worth it. Instead, sometimes I’ll both, wheel and hold shares, so even if it consolidates for a while, I’m still making money (albeit tying up more capital). \n\nPlus, if your covered calls get deep ITM, you now have to hold to expiry tying up your buying power (opportunity cost) or close the position early and take less profit. \n\nI rarely sell any cc unless I’m bearish short-term or have calculated the full RoR for getting the shares called at expiry and I’m good with it.\n\n- Others are right when they say selling ccs isn’t really the wheel. With the wheel, you only sell calls if you’ve been assigned shares with the intent of having them called away as quickly as possible at a profit or break even to free up the bp.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Quick comment on CCs, if your platform allows you to roll as one transaction, selling CCs can effectively be relatively free money on stock to plan to hold anyways.

{"title": "Why Altria ($MO) LEAPs may have HUGE asymmetric upside 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "**TL;DR: vaping, marijuana, Michael Burry, low as fuck IV, hugely under-valued company 🚀🚀🚀**\n\n  \n\n\n*\\*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. All information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\\**\n\n  \n\n\n Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.\n\n By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\\[2\\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.\n\nWe are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\\[3\\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)\n\nFast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.\n\nNo company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\\[4\\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.\n\nThese investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\\[5\\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \\~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.\n\nDespite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.\n\n**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**\n\nMy thesis relies on four key beliefs:\n\n&amp;amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The company's core business is under-valued\n2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes\n3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized\n4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO\n\n**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**\n\nAltria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\\[6\\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\\[7\\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\\[8\\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.\n\nThere are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing \"on!\" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.\n\nWe'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.\n\n**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**\n\n*\\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\\**\n\nNicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping “there’s almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.” [\\[9\\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)\n\nAltria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\\[10\\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.\n\nThe FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\\[11\\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:\n\n1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL\n\nThis is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.\n\n2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL\n\nIn this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.\n\nSetting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\\[12\\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a \"heat not burn\" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.\n\n**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**\n\nAltria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\\[13\\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said \"I don’t want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out\" [\\[14\\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).\n\n**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**\n\nWould this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \\[\\[15\\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.\n\nIf nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIn summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.\n\nIV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \\~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.\n\nFor this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside.

RKT will achieve this the same way Amazon became the powerhouse of e-commerce and that is through their unique culture.\n\nBoth AMZN and RKT have powerful cultures that are built around  “shocking rules\" — rituals and practices that are memorable, and so bizarre, that people inside the organization encounter almost daily, and that people who hear about them wonder why they are necessary.\n\nMy second DD will be devoted to RKT's shocking rules and their one-of-a-kind culture. RKT DD Part III will focus on Rocket's vision to make Detroit the fintech capital of the world by doing much more than just writing loans.\n\nBut for my first DD I want to address the elephant in the room: RkT StOcK HaSn'T DoNe ShIt.\n\nYes you drooling shit-for-brain autists are correct, RKT has performed very poorly in a market where nearly every company is hitting all time highs.... But what you pea-brained dip shits don't understand is that you are believing exactly what the institutions want you to believe: which is that RKT isn't a buy. When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.\n\nRKT DD Part 1 will explain the market manipulation RKT is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. I will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how I believe RKT will have a similar outcome as the company I mention.\n\nI wanted to include as many pictures in my DDs as you guys have chromosomes so please...\n\n *CLICK THE GOOGLE DOC LINK BELOW to read RKT DD Part 1 of 3:*\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/15AoOqzILhtosUPnJTFRvfwu900hTswP9MfOnuFV6Jz8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15AoOqzILhtosUPnJTFRvfwu900hTswP9MfOnuFV6Jz8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAlso please view the link below to see my positions in RKT.

That said, we don’t know how long the tutes will control RKT. It may be safer to buy RKT shares and RKT calls that expire in June or later. You guys will make money on this trade trust me - just don’t be greedy and go for weeklies; making money off those is far from guaranteed.\n\nDouble edit: with over 40 percent short interest, a $1B buyback (that cuts RKT’s float in half) zero insider selling and potential catalysts - RKT could easily squeeze into the $50s in the near term if the stars align.

I went with my broker's contact who got me a 30yr fixed @ 2.75% with no points and a $1,400 credit at close. Quicken's final offer was 3.0% with 1.125 points.

So if you don’t want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. \n\nI’m a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. \n\nON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi’s it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. \n\nMost importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I’d call a great options deal. \n\nNote: I don’t provide sell points, so don’t ask.

A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it’s sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.\n\nIt’s become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn’t been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.\n\nI feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, “this is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.” So with that said I’m making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.\n\nPeople claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‘how to use options’ section. \n\nPeople claiming “sHoRtS hAvEn’T cOvErEd YeT” despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.\n\nOn a final note, I’m going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.\n\n**1. Displacement**\n\nA displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.\n\n**2. Boom**\n\nPrices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.\n\n**3. Euphoria**\n\nDuring this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [\"greater fool\" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)—the idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more—plays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.﻿ Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.\n\n**4. Profit-Taking**\n\nIn this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)—heeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point—starts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, \"the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\n\n**5. Panic**\n\nIt only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.\n\nGME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security.

Brace yourself for more info than you asked for\n\nFor SaaS businesses that have recurring revenue models, GAAP accounting standards dictate that revenues must be recognized ratably, over the life of the contract. So if TDC books a 2-year contract worth 2million, it reports these revenues on the income statement as follows: Year 0 ($0), Year 1 ($1M), Year 2 ($1M). So in this scenario, new sales are reported on a lag; however, operating expenses are recognized immediately.\n\nAs businesses transition from perpetual software licenses to recurring subscription models, the accounting optics look like shit (temporarily). Expenses are recognized real time, but revenues are pushed out (even if the company gets paid up front, or even if the contract is non-cancellable). Cash from these new sales goes onto the balance sheet under \"restricted cash.\"\n\nThis accounting change has played out before in the past (Adobe, AutoDesk, others) and is currently playing out with Splunk and Pegasystems. Profits look shitty until the business fully transitions to the subscription model. GAAP accounting standards weren't made with SaaS in mind. \n\nLast, the author lazers in on NOPAT as his earnings metric, but fails to recognize that TDC generated $223 million of free cash flow in 2020. Meaning it brought in $223 million in cash from operations, minus capex. $223 million (FCF) / $1400 million (revenue) is a 16% FCF margin, whereas that guy kept citing a 6% NOPAT margin in his bear thesis. So TDC is much more profitable at second glance.\n\nWhen this guy wrote the article, TDC was trading at 13x FCF, which makes it a value stock. If you believe in the discounted cash flow, this suggests that at a 10% discount rate, investors expected TDC FCF to grow at less than inflation. Here's the math (Gordon Growth Model):\n\n$1 earnings / \\[10%(discount rate) - 3% (terminal growth rate)\\] = 14.2x\n\nBecause 13x is less than 14x, that implies that under the assumptions above, investors expected TDC earnings to decline 7% (13/14 = 7%) before settling to an equilibrium where it would grow at 3% per year thereafter.\n\nI know this is a shit load to digest, but let me know if you have questions", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Good stuff.

DO your own DD. \n\nLook before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there… eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.\n\nThe Stock I am talking about is CVS… \n\nWell, I couldn’t believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS. \n\nA lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven’t done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.\n\n\\#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven’t. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn’t need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like “Oh wow, my wife’s boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring”.  So, increase in sales \n\n\\#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don’t believe in the F word. \n\n· According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it’s fair value\n\n· PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x\n\n· Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions \n\n· Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities\n\n· \\*Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B\n\n· Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) \n\n· Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) \n\n· Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings \n\n\\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‘in house’ offerings. \n\n\\#4  Institutional  Ownership \n\n· Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)\n\n· BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)\n\n· State Street $3.4B (4%)\n\n· Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)\n\n· Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)\n\n\\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side\n\nAmazon’s disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.\n\n\\#6 More than a Pharmacy \n\n· Aetna – Health Insurance plans \n\n· Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores \n\n· CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub \n\n· Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. \n\nEarnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It’s not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. \n\nTLDR\n\n· High Ownership from mutual Funds\n\n· 10% of Michael Burry’s portfolio\n\n· Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. \n\n· In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor) \n\n\\- A company that is resilient and continues to find a way to keep moving forward\n\nMy Position - 140 shares held \n\nEdit - mandatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nAlso, concern over my account age-  I have been a lurker for 2 years.

{"title": "Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion)", "selftext": "I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.\n\nI mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss\n\nGenerally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.\n\nPaper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.\n\nHere's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. \"Diamond Hands\" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.\n\nThe market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as \"weak hands\" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.\n\nSometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.\n\nOption Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.\n\nAlong the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.\n\n[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \\- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need\n\nLeaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.\n\nImplied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.\n\nBuy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.\n\nFinally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into \"Sectors\" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you.

Gravity = acceleration\n\n**Theta (T for time)** - amount of value the option loses each day. The closer to expiration the higher this value gets.\n\n**IV** - implied volatility explained above. Avoid high IV when possible. A very general of thumb I use is try to avoid 120%+ IV. Some stocks are always volatile that’s an exception\n\n**IV crush** - this is very painful lesson most new traders will make and it will suck when it happens. Don’t commit too much of your portfolio until you see it happen. \n\n*Ex: If you buy a contract at 300% IV and it drops to 100% overnight it will often cause a massive loss to the contract.. even if the stock moves your way*\n\n\n**Spread options** - are a little advanced but lower risk significantly. You buy an option and sell a cheaper one. It limits your potential gains but reduces IV crush and Theta decay\n\nEx: \nYou simultaneously \n- buy SOLO 3/19 10c for $150\n- sell SOLO 3/19 12.5c for $100. \nNet cost = $50\n\n- The 12.5c will never be worth more then the 10c\n- 5:1 Risk reward \n- The most you can gain is $250 — if your contracts expire, you make $1 for every cent SOLO is over $10.00.. up to $12.50\n- You can sell your 10c and buy your 12.5c to close the contract early like a normal option, so don’t feel like you have to hold it to expiry\n\n**Pure stocks** - everyone says trade paper but it’s platitudes - almost no one does.

If you don't have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares, your broker should automatically sell your call before market close.

Now you can't sell until the next morning. Have fun watching after hours charts as your new shares drill down to hell.\n\nSame thing with puts.

Much appreciated OP!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "So what the difference between calls, options, and just putting money into the stock? Cuz so far ive just been putting raw money in.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "An option is a contract allowing you to buy (call) or sell (put) 100 shares of a specific stock at set price (the strike) on or before a set date (the expiration). So a call option allows me the right to buy 100 shares for the strike price and a put option allows me the right to sell 100 shares for the strike price. With me so far?\n\nThe expiration is the easy part, it's a specific date. So an option expiring on 2/12/2021 I have to resell or exercise by market close on Friday.\n\nLet's use an example, say I own 1 AMC $15c 2/12. That's a call option for the ticker AMC expiring this Friday. It lets me buy 100 shares for $15 per share. The current price is $5.50 per share so it would be cheaper to buy the shares on the open market and this contract is basically worthless. An AMC $15p 2/12 though, that's a whole different story. That lets me short sell 100 shares of AMC at $15 each. I could then buy to close at $5.50 a share for an immediate gain of $9.50 per share. A contract is 100 shares, so my contract is worth $950. In reality a bit more because there's still time left on it. Still with me?\n\nThe only missing part is premium. The premium is the up front cost you pay to the seller of the contract. It varies based on a lot of factors but implied volatility and time are the two biggest, so the longer the length of time on the contract and the more volatile the underlying stock is expected to be over the contract time frame the higher the premium will be. This is why weeklies are cheap, generally, because there's not much time on them. But during a week where a stock is reporting earnings for example, the implied volatility (IV) is very high so the premium is very high as well.\n\nThe difference between options and purchasing the stock directly is leverage. Say we have an imaginary company ABC. The shares are currently $100 each. To buy 100 shares would cost me $10,000. To buy a $100c expiring 3/6 would cost me $500. To buy a $100c expiring 1/6/22 would cost me $2,000. In all three cases I get all the gains, if there are any, of 100 shares of ABC stock. My entry price is radically different though.\n\nLet's say on March 6th ABC is trading at $110 a share. The guy who bought 100 shares can sell them for $11,000. He made a grand on a ten grand investment, or 10%. The guy who bought the monthly  call can sell his call for $1,000. He made $500 on a $500 investment, or 100%. He only made $500 because he paid $500 in premium up front. The guy that bought the leap for $2,000 still hasn't covered his premium, but there's still a ton of time left on his option contract so in reality he would still be profitable here too. Just to throw a number out there he's got $1,000 of intrinsic value and he's burned off around a tenth of the extrinsic value, so his contract is probably worth around $2800 right now, so he's up 40%, give or take with lots of time remaining to make more.\n\nThis brings us to the yolo. If you're sure of your play and have $10k to invest instead of buying 100 shares, you can buy 5 leaps or 20 monthlies. You're controlling far more shares for the same initial cost. If the stock moves in your direction you can make a much higher percentage return. If it moves against you the options expire worthless though.

The future is in subscriptions. If Microsoft can prove that this model works for games, that's it. That's where everyone is going to be. You don't buy games, you subscribe to catalogs.\n\nWhat does GME have to offer here? What possible value could they provide? Amazon has been selling video games online only slightly less long than they've been selling books. Even if I'm one of the few people who wants to buy a game on a plastic frisbee, it's likely that I have Amazon prime.

Chewy entered a market that was suffering under the stigma of pets.com and their main differentiator was selling pet meds, something Amazon still doesn't really do, because it's not as simple as selling regular goods. They can coexist with Amazon for the same reason physical pet shops could exist close to a Walmart.

Yes, they have a multi year deal with them to get a percentage of all digital sales on every console sold through GameStop. Do you know who doesn't have that deal? Online retailers. Because Microsoft is perfectly capable of selling you their console through their own website. They're buying a presence in physical retail but they're also killing the idea of buying a console altogether with their \"you get a console with this subscription\" model. Both of these things aren't exactly something that gives me hope for their future. \n\nAs for them letting you pick and buy parts all from the same place being an option that already exists, that's an understatement. \n\nI bought my last PC from a small local store, literally one single location and they had this option on their website. The reason sites like Newegg and PC Parts picker exist is because the selection available from a single vendor is necessarily limited and your locking yourself in to a single set of prices when you could be getting deals and discounts if you shopped around.    \n\nBut sure, if you want to avoid potentially getting third party sellers, and you want a single reliable vendor that's not a mom and pop... you have your pick of Microcenter and other pc component retailers with stellar reputations and track records, multiple boutique builders that, while pricy will offer to fully build any rig you can dream of and even the big players like HP and Dell have build my PC options, that lack flexibility but are generally better bang for your buck simply do to scale.\n\nSo GameStop is for the people who don't want a Mom and Pop, don't want a boutique, don't want the big players, don't want to shop around everywhere for the best price and don't want any of the other pc parts chains. \n\nI'm not saying they're won't get any business. They might become reasonably successful but how does any of this, assuming it actually gets implemented, assuming they lose the dead weight, assuming they actually become a relevant player in those markets justify even the current, quickly falling share price?

{"title": "Aphria/Tilray Merger", "selftext": "Second time posting this. Made it last night but other than a collab between CGC and APHA, news about the merger seems to be the same this morning.\n\nThis is my first DD so please bare with me in case I set something up wrong; I'm happy to edit if so but this took me a while to gather.\n\nI just joined this sub about two weeks ago amidst the GME hype. I've been investing for a few years now ever since the Tilray IPO at $17. Bought, sold, and reinvested consistently (pulling out my principal each time) right up through the almost $300 peak and backed out. I left Tilray alone for a while until recently when the news regarding the merger with Aphria started popping up because I actually love Aphria and I've owned it for a while now, so I wanted to post some DD regarding the merger. Hope this helps some of you.\n\n**For the business:** Reverse merger is taking place where Aphria is absorbing Tilray and will own 63% of the company, continuing to use the name Tilray due to better brand recognition and its nearly eponymous representation of the cannabis market. Aphria has a strong presence in Germany which is the only European country with medical marijuana, so Aphria has an advantage in that sector for if/when other European nations start following suit. With both Aphria's and Tilray's international relations along with slowly migrating into the US they may grow into the largest cannabis company worldwide just in terms of revenue.\n\nOver the previous 12 months, Aphria put up $443 million USD in revenue compared to Canopy Growth's $377m USD. Tilray has put up $201m USD in the last 12 months, and which combined with Aphria is $644m USD, or markedly higher than the $377m USD posted by the \"industry standard,\" Canopy Growth. (I don't hate on Canopy as a company whatsoever I just think they're overvalued and their stock should not be in the $40s).\n\nStats from the merger indicated a $685 million annual revenue, adjusted for combined sales, and the company itself, named Tilray, will have a roughly $3.5 billion valuation.\n\nAlso, many forget that Tilray has a business partnership with Anheuser-Busch and Aphria owns the craft beer company SweetWater. (Which, personally, is fucking delicious.)\n\n**For the shareholder:** Each Aphria share will convert to 0.8381 shares of Tilray. As of today (Monday, 02/08/21) the closing price of Tilray was $30.09 and the price of Aphria was $18.98. In accordance to the **1 : .8381** conversion rate, the implied price of Aphria is $25.22, which has a 33% upside compared to the current share price.\n\nI don't know the current borrowing rates (if anyone does please feel free to comment), but in January of 2019 the shorting cost for Tilray was above 900% and has been known to remain very high on this stock, as after it's $300 rally a couple years ago it became a favorite among the shorts. There is a way in which to capitalize on the merger by being long on Aphria and short Tilray, but the 30% profit may be outweighed by the crazy high costs of borrowing.\n\nThe two biggest risks appear to be the possibility that Aphria shares will crash days before the merger, or that that Tilray has simply been overvalued this entire time and its share price will fall. (*The strategy is listed in the sources here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play) *& here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses) *but you can only open the articles once without a subscription*\n\n**For everyone:** The general consensus on both stocks is bullish, however, more focus is placed on buying into Tilray than Aphria, seemingly just due to the belief that people may jump ship days before Aphria shares are converted into Tilray (even though Aphria still owns the operation). The company will also have easy access into the United States as our president restructures drug scheduling, so moving forward, I feel that Tilray is going to be a strong global competitor in the cannabis industry for some time\n\nI try not to go balls deep on anything that has a lot of hype on it, but Tilray made me BANK right when I first started investing a few months before Canada legalized so I may be biased. However, as objectively as I can be, I do think this merger is both a very strong short and long option.\n\nI don't really know if it's a necessary disclaimer or a joke but I'm gonna go ahead and say no, none of this is financial advice.\n\n**My positions:** 100 APHA @ $11.13,  2 TSLA @ $408.66,  3 GME @ $165,  10 AMC @ $17.04,  100 SNDL @ $1.13,  100 22 RIGL @ $4.40\n\nCalls: APHA $20 2/19,  TLRY $37 2/19,  SENS $4 2/19,  CRBP $3 2/19,  RIGL $5 2/19\n\nI'm transferring both my RH and TDA accounts over to Fidelity so all my stocks are in different places atm, otherwise I'd post a picture.\n\n**Sources:** [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/02/duplicatedoes-the-united-nations-decision-on-canna/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/02/duplicatedoes-the-united-nations-decision-on-canna/)(Jan 7, 2021)\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play)(Feb 8, 2021)\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilra](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses)\n\n[y-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses)(Jan 26, 2021)\n\n[https://aphriainc.com/aphria-and-tilray-combine-to-create-largest-global-cannabis-company/?source=content\\_type%3Areact%7Cfirst\\_level\\_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain\\_content%7Cbutton%3Abody\\_link](https://aphriainc.com/aphria-and-tilray-combine-to-create-largest-global-cannabis-company/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)(Dec 16, 2020)\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-aphria-tilray-merger-shows-just-how-overpriced-canopy-growth-is-2021-01-07](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-aphria-tilray-merger-shows-just-how-overpriced-canopy-growth-is-2021-01-07)(Jan 7, 2021)\n\n[https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/03/could-tilray-be-a-millionaire-maker-stock/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/03/could-tilray-be-a-millionaire-maker-stock/)(Feb 3, 2021)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Fixed conversion rate typo from incorrect: 1: **.08381** to 1 : **.8381** (Thank you u/Stunna2018)\n\nEdit 2:  Added the following list below of supporting info for legalizing marijuana nationwide.\n\nA trio of U.S. senators has given investors the green light to invest in  marijuana stocks, an endorsement that suggests the volatile sector might finally  blossom into something as acceptable and regulated as alcohol.\n\nMore details will emerge when Sens. Cory Booker (D., N.J.),  Ron Wyden, (D., Ore.), and Chuck Schumer (D.,  N.Y.) introduce legislation to legalize and tax marijuana.\n\n\"In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft  on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and  implement responsible taxes and regulations,\" they announced Feb.  1 in a joint statement.\n\nThe marijuana sector has, naturally, advanced higher. The sector proxy, the  ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange- traded fund , has seemingly entered a new,  higher trading range. The ETF holds 35 stocks, including Aphria(APHA) , Canopy Growth(CGC) , and GW Pharmaceuticals(GWPH) . The fund has about  $1.4 billion under management, which makes it the largest ETF  that targets the global cannabis industry.\n\nIn anticipation of the pending legislation, and in an attempt to harness the  momentum of other investors, aggressive investors can consider buying ETFMG  Alternative Harvest. The ETF is trading near a record high, but an options  strategy can potentially reshape the price.\n\nWith the ETF at $27.82, investors can sell the March  $25 put option for $1.90 and buy the March  $29 call option for about $2.80. The \"risk  reversal\" -- selling a put and buying a call with a higher strike price but  similar expiration -- positions investors for agreeing to buy the ETF at  $25 and for participating in gains above $29.\n\nIf the ETF is at $35 at March expiration, the call is worth $6.\n\nThe trade's risk is predicated on the pending legislation. The trade obligates investors to buy the stock at $23, or to cover the put  or roll the position, if the stock price is below the strike price at  expiration. For that reason, only do this trade if you have the resources and  willingness to buy the ETF at a lower price and a belief in marijuana's pending  legalization. If something happens in Washington that derails marijuana legalization  efforts, the trade falls apart.\n\nStill, the trade is a good way for investors to gain exposure to the  legalization of marijuana, which seems like a good bet as federal government  contends with massive deficits caused by the 2007-09 financial crisis and the  Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe ETF was chosen over component stocks to potentially reduce the investment  risk that is inherent in picking stocks in an unusual sector with companies that  have a history of extraordinary price volatility.\n\nDuring the past 52 weeks, the ETF has ranged from $8.81 to  $27.90. The fund gained about 45% over the past year and is up  some 67% this year. The percentage returns seem stellar, but it is important to  remember that the fund has advanced off a low price, and that many of the  components weren't much better situated. The sector could be facing a critical  moment, and this trade puts investors into the center of the industry with a  strategy that can be reset as each month passes.

DoorDash is about to collapse, and this is your opportunity to bank.", "selftext": "*Disclaimer: It is moronic to buy FDs. That is not the way to consistently build wealth. The very reason FDs pay off such huge returns is because on average their probability of expiring worthless is 99%. If you’re moronic enough to buy FDs with me, only do it with money that you are willing to literally set on fire. Actual fire. There are plenty of safer puts on DASH that will pay obscene returns this year.*.   \n    \n**TLDR: I believe DoorDash (DASH) is the greatest short opportunity of the year, and what’s more, rather than just having a general feeling, there are specific timetables enabling us to profit bigly. The company even admits themselves that they have peaked as a company.**    \n    \n# Analysis:\n    \n>“Food delivery with third-party apps like Grubhub and Uber Eats is booming, but no one's making money.” – Business Insider.    \n    \nDoorDash is wildly overvalued. This is true by any metric, were it in essentially any industry. Add to that its in food delivery, which is a horrific, no margin industry in what has become a commoditized business and offers essentially no differentiation with its competitors.  There is near zero differentiation between Uber Eats, Postmates, Caviar, Grubhub, DASH, or any local provider. In Austin we have Favor, for example. And nobody cares which company delivers their food, they only care which one does it cheapest.     \n    \nIf you view stock (as you should) as buying the entire business as an owner, how much would you be willing to pay for an undifferentiated company in a no margin commoditized business that has peaked (see below for more on that)? Because it’s currently selling for an insane $56 billion. Outrageous.    \n    \nSo how can we get a banana for scale to understand what that $56 billion means in terms of valuation?    \n    \nWell, all of DoorDash’s competitors have either sold at or are trading at, or raised money at, a capitalization of 3x to 6x sales. **DASH is trading at an absolutely insane 20+ x sales.**    \n    \nJust six months ago [Postmates was acquired for $2.65 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates) which put it at 4x sales. **At 4x sales, DASH would trade at $32.**    \n    \nDASH used to be the business leader in this industry, but over the past 2-3 years Grubhub has exploded in size to take on nearly the same 33% of market share, and after Uber Eats bought Postmates, it too now has about a third of market share. So you now have three giants of roughly equal size battling it out in a business in which customers don’t give a motherloving frick about branding.    \n    \n### But don’t take my word for it on valuation, take smart money’s word    \n    \n[DoorDash raised money just a couple months ago at a $16 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/#:%7E:text=DoorDash%20has%20confirmed%20that%20it,money%20valuation%20of%20%2416%20billion). That is truly a stunning fact. In just a few months the WSB type day trading call buyers have bid this company all the way up to $56 billion from $16 billion without any material change to the business and completely ignoring the coming vaccine-induced reopening of restaurants. Again, the stock trades for a 300% markup to its recent smart money capital raise based on nothing but unfounded hopium.     \n    \nYou don’t have to take my word for it, your beloved Jim Cramer has even said the same thing, in his own idiotic, covering my ass, round about say nothing way. “It’s true that people using market orders took DoorDash to levels that maybe ... were far higher than they thought they’d have paid.” - Jim Cramer    \n    \nI don’t care about his commentary, but you people seem to love him, so there you go. 😘      \n    \n## The Company, according to The Company, has peaked. It’s over.     \n    \nThere are two extremely interesting things buried in the S-1 we’re going to get into in a moment. One of them is that you don’t have to take my word for it that this company’s business has peaked. **The company says so itself in its own S-1.**   \n      \n>The circumstances that have accelerated the increase in Total Orders stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future, and we expect the growth rate in Total Orders to decline in future periods.    \n    \nTo put it simply, COVID numbers are falling, vaccines are rolling out at an impressive 1-2 million per day which puts our stated goal of 100 million vaccinated in 100 days within attainable reach. The economy will be opening up, people will want to be getting out of the house, restaurants will be reopening, and there will be huge pent up demand by people who have had extraordinarily high savings rates over the last year. Big chains will no longer have the need to get help from third party delivery apps at a 15% markup. We all know this is the case, and DoorDash even stated as much in its own filing. This stock is toast.    \n    \n >”Delivery via smartphone is one of those venture-funded sectors where business executives appear to have taken seriously the old joke about “losing money on every transaction but making it up on volume.” – New York Magazine    \n    \n[“DoorDash and Grubhub and Uber Eats... it’s a tough business for them. It’s very competitive. I think the business model is hard.” - Panera Bread CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzQJdBHo3tw).    \n    \n## And Now the Fun Part     \n    \nThere are some wild share lockup expirations coming up. For those that don’t know, when you get these massive IPOs, insiders aren’t actually able to sell their shares on IPO day. They are locked up and the insiders just have to hope for the best that the stock will not lose value over the coming months. If the stock skyrockets in value, but the insiders know the business is trash or has peaked, you get the perfect recipe for a rush for the exits.     \n    \nI love playing share lockups. I make a lot of money on them by selling spreads. A common question I get when I post them here is “if you know a drop is coming, why doesn’t the market just price it in?” The answer is because it can’t. No matter what the share price does, the lockup expiration date is the lockup expiration date. Insiders have to wait until that date, and it doesn’t matter whether the stock falls 0%, 5%, or 50%, they will all have to wait until that day to sell.     \n    \nDoorDash has two share lockup expirations coming.     \n    \nThe first lockup expiration is an early release (heh) and hits 90 days after the Dec. 9 IPO, or around March 9, as long as the stock trades 25% higher than the IPO price for five out of 10 consecutive days of trading.  That is to say, so long as DASH trades above $127.50 right before March 9, the lockup is triggered. The good news for you with this insane run up in price is that if the lockup isn’t triggered, it means the stock has already fallen from $190 to $127. It’s important to know March 9 is not a hard date exactly...some insiders can be allowed to go a few days prior. Also if they release earnings early the lockup could potentially occur at the end of this month.    \n    \nI was talking to some folks on WSB about the lockup last week, and someone mentioned they thought only 20% of insider shares will be eligible. DoorDash's management and board members can sell up to 20% of their shares in that first wave, but other insiders can sell up to 40%. This means 113 million shares are eligible for sale in early lockup expiration. DoorDash’s daily volume is only 3-4 million shares. The current public float is roughly 123 million shares. This means you’re about to suddenly double the number of shares on the market.     \n    \nDoor Dash’s second lock-up expiration hits either 180 days after its IPO, which means around June 9 (more or less), or after the release of its first-quarter earnings report (whichever is earlier), and will free up “all remaining shares” according to the S-1, which if my math is correct is roughly 50 million shares.     \n    \nThese two expirations could spark violent sell-offs throughout the year.    \n    \n## Positions     \n    \n### FDs\n        \nI never buy FDs. I’ve never once bought them in my entire life. But I’m putting 1% of my portfolio into them on DASH because I’m confident big drops are coming. Unfortunately for you guys, the stock has already started falling this past month from its 🤡-level highs in the $200s, and worse yet the pricing/IV of all options has gotten more expensive. This means, I’m sorry to say, that you’re not going to find any options trading for pennies, or even anything less than $2. For your FDs, I recommend you buy puts at whatever the lowest strikes are that actually have any volume. The strikes go as low as $75, but most days show 0 volume and of course the bid/ask spread is enormous. There has been some volume at $95 recently, and you can get the $75s if you’re patient enough and willing to pay up for them. Expiration dates would be any time in mid to late March (again, looking for whatever has volume) so that it occurs after lockup 1, and the August 20s, which unfortunately are the closest expiration to the lockup occurring around June 9. I wish there was a closer expiration, but hey, more time for the stock to collapse. Plus you could always sell your puts after the June 9 drop with lots of theta meat still left on the bone.     \n    \n### Puts\nI own March 12 $160 puts. I think the stock will drop healthily below this, but IV is high. I’m normally taking big swings with spreads, so when I buy puts outright, which is rare, I want to play it a little safer.    \n    \nI also own the August 20 $145 puts.     \n    \nAnd finally, I have six figure credit call spreads open at the $175 level. For newbies, this simply means I:    \nBought (yes bought) the March 12 $175 calls, and     \nSold the $172.50 calls.    \n    \nI went huge on these because all I need is for DoorDash to trade below $172.50 after the lockup expiration and I’ll be having a Merry Christmas. That’s as close to risk free gains as you’re ever going to see in your life.    \n    \n### Bull case    \nThe only bull case is that we’re in a raging, record-setting bull market and all stonks go up. The economy is opening back up, vaccines are rolling out, and stonks go up. But I think if you look at the DASH chart you can see that that is already starting to not be the case.    \n    \n### What are the negatives?    \nI plagiarized liberally [from an old Citron Research report](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DoorDash-The-Most-Ridiculous-IPO.pdf), although it doesn’t even mention share lockups. Yes, that Citron. For those of you who are newer members, I will tell you this; the little smart money social circles in and around WSB do not hate CItron, Hindenburg, or any other short selling firms. We respect them and welcome bearish cases on high flying stocks. Any intelligent trader does. It’s only the pump and dumpers who have a hatred for short reports. You should welcome contrarian views.    \n    \n### Parting Words.   \nI would welcome anyone pointing out where they think I may be wrong. I don’t care about saving face, I care about not losing money. If I’m wrong, I want to know it. I welcome constructive criticism.    \n\n## Give Me One More TLDR At The End    \nThis stock is going to collapse because it’s wildly overvalued, employees got in super cheap with shares they are waiting to sell, know the business has peaked, and they want to cash the fahk out. So swallow the high IV and buy puts today as fast as you can.     \n    \nLove you guys.", "id": "lg8hl5", "created_utc": 1612891873.0, "score": 455, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 268, "comments": [{"body": "I don't know about this play.

Let's say he goes in for 30 contracts. The difference between the two options is $2 which is $200 per contract so $200\\*30 contracts = $6000 in net premium. Now the worst case scenario is if the price stays above $175, in this case, both traders will exercise their options and he will have to buy at 175 and then sell at 172.5 to the other person.

(1) will be satisfied on Mar 9, 2021, 90 days after the date of the IPO prospectus (Dec 9, 2021). So to assess whether condition (3) will be met we need to look 10 trading days back from Mar 9, 2021. 10 trading days back from Mar 9 is today, Feb 25, so check for one of the 10 days. If DASH trades for $127.50 or above for 4 more days before Mar 9, condition (3) will be satisfied. Condition (4) will also be satisfied on Mar 9 because the trading window for insiders opens usually 2 days after a quarterly earnings statement and is open for 30 days after the earnings statement. Mar 9 falls within this window so condition (4) will be satisfied.\n\nAll of this means that the trigger will occur on March 9, 2021 so long as DASH continues to trade above $127.50. Once the lock-up trigger happens, the lock-up expires on prior to trading on the third trading day following the trigger date.

{"title": "Tonight’s SI report", "selftext": "Tonight’s report has been built up to be a make or break point for GME. I want to caution my fellow autists from reading too much into this single piece of data. Let’s start with what we know about tonight’s report:\n\n1) This report is based on self reported data. \n\n2) The fine for misreporting, if caught, is pennies on the dollar compared to the costs to cover.\n\n3) The data report covers up until the 29th.\n\nSo what are the possible outcomes:\n\n1) Data is accurate, HF covered: I believe at this point GME becomes a long play. There is the potential for an acquisition or a turn around/pivot in the business model. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.\n\n2) Data is accurate, HF did not cover: I believe the play here would be to buy as much as you can. This would push up the price pushing more expiring calls ITM and put further pressure on the HF. We would likely get a significant influx of new investment interest from retail and the squeeze is on. The play is buy and hold.\n\n3) Data is inaccurate: This is the most likely outcome given the money at stake. If it shows they haven’t covered then there would be no real sense in putting out false data. If it shows they have covered then it becomes a gut call. Personally, the continued bots and media coverage seem to still indicate that something is amiss otherwise why go through all that effort, expense, etc. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.\n\nIn all three scenarios buy and hold seems to be the most prudent course of action. The only reason to sell IMHO is if you believe GME will go bankrupt. \n\nOk so I’m going to buy if I can or continue to hold ... what could happen that would turn this around?\n\n1) If not covered, a whale investor or fund deciding to purchase this serving as a catalyst for a true squeeze. Elon, Cuban, another HF, etc. Personally,I have my Tesla in my shopping cart already.\n\n2) If not covered, GME reverse stock split. This could force a true squeeze though likely would not happen until the stock gets back into single digits.\n\n3) If not covered, emergency shareholder meeting. My understanding this would cause a recalling of shares to allow the shareholders to vote, this initiating the squeeze.\n\n4) If covered or uncovered, significant renewed public interest in GME. A lot more likely if uncovered, but it’s a strange world we live in so I wouldn’t completely rule it out if they covered.\n\n5) If covered or uncovered, GME public offering of 10 million shares at $x price (we will say $200). This sets a bottom for the stock in the short term, I believe most who are already in the stock would see value in putting billions into the company coffers either for stock support on a cash balance basis or to be a war chest to facilitate the turn around. I am actually a bit puzzled why this hasn’t already been done.\n\n6) If covered, GME being acquired by a major player at a reasonable price. This would ensure continuing good will from the existing shareholders and would ensure the GameStop name lives on.\n\n7) If covered, GME makes a strategic purchase or alliance that then starts to justify a higher evaluation.\n\nObviously these are the thoughts of some retarded ape. Full disclosure, I am currently down around 100k in my positions on GME. In my mind, the invested funds were completely lost at the moment of purchase so it doesn’t bother me to hold forever or until I win, whichever comes first. 🦍🙌💎🚀🌕\n\nEdit: The report is supposed to reflect until the 29th.\n\nUpdate: It appears the FINRA report officially states 78.46%.", "id": "lgb0h7", "created_utc": 1612898283.0, "score": 7312, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 2348, "comments": [{"body": "You want my shares?

If Blackrock holds GME in one of their ETF's (for example, in their [iShares Russell 2000](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239710/ishares-russell-2000-etf), go to Portfolio and search GME) selling off large portions of that stock within the ETF would effect the chart of the ETF itself. It would derail the price of the ETF from the underlying it tracks, thereby failing at its goal. From iShares, the goal of the iShares Russel 2000 is \"to track the investment results of an index composed of small-capitalization U.S. equities. \" They are a long term buy-and-hold ETF that people leverage in order to diversify their portfolio and expose themselves to the underlying in a safer way - you could personally just mirror your portfolio on exactly what is inside the iShares Russell 2000, and your portfolio would perform the same. But then you would be responsible for rebalancing it when market conditions change, and people who don't want to deal with that, simply invest in the ETF and let Blackrock take on that responsibility. You look at the return the ETF is pulling, decide if you could do better or not with the money you have to invest, and make a choice from there.\n\niShares Russell 2000 has 1,356,119 shares of GME in it. Sounds like a lot, but in reality it is only 0.12 of that ETF. Blackrock doesn't care GME has moved. GME can't touch them, even while they hold 1,356,119 shares in that single ETF composed of 2043 other positions. It's naïve to come to the conclusion that since they hold a massive amount of shares within a goal oriented, managed ETF, that they \"know something\" about the stock and that's why they're not selling.\n\nTL;DR They aren't selling because in the grand scheme of things, selling doesn't fit the balance of their ETF. If they held massive amounts of shares OUTSIDE of an ETF and were moving them, that might be more of a signal.

When the price is that high a sit was on Jan 29, SI report does not change the narrative because you already know there was a short squeeze driving the momentum.\n\nIn fact, it is much better tactics for HF to cover and exit their positions end of Jan (resulting in lower SI report), then mount new positions first days of Feb and push the price down. Then take profit from the rollercoaster ride down before the mid-Feb report is due. This way you can obliterate the price on a short play and stay \"below the radar\" in terms of mandatory reporting. \n\nIf there’s ever a time to try out resistance levels in new trading run, it is probably best done from current levels as there’s higher likelihood of unbalanced non-reported SI now compared to what it may be weeks later after most short positions are covered with profits and minor losses “below the radar” at 20-40.\n\nTrading aside, the company is priced at 3,5B now ( 0.76 P/S). The risk of high debt and declining growth is (hi)story. If one is to believe in digital transformation the new team is set out to do, it isn’t that expensive of a bag to hold.\n\nPity GME didn’t raise capital from the market at the high Jan prices. It would affect momentum but less so than RH action. Besides it would actually increase fundamental* value of the company by quite a bit as it essentially did with AMC (*excuse the f-word).\n\nThis is not a financial advise, obviously, and I am long on GME (aren’t we all now 😂?) though with minor losses and downsized position that I am planning to rebuild now.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "When all three possible scenarios result in a W for WSB traders, I know there must be something missing... that’s not to say I don’t *want* a dub for WSB, but we have to be realistic and assume that there’s always a possibility that the rich are going to screw you guys over just like they always do.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Idk how they have 78% when Bloomberg and S&P Capital IQ show 21.4M shares short (like 46%)", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "That math actually works out perfectly ??", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Their number was always higher. \nIt was 177% for other places Jan 15 but 227% for finra.

Personally, the continued bots and media coverage seem to still indicate that something is amiss otherwise why go through all that effort, expense, etc. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.\n\nYes, FINRA data, which has been used and trusted for ages, and never had any issues before, will be inaccurate for the first time ever, because the data (which is and has always been 2 weeks late) will certainly matter in this \"battle\".\n\n> 1) If not covered, a whale investor or fund deciding to purchase this serving as a catalyst for a true squeeze. Elon, Cuban, another HF, etc. Personally,I have my Tesla in my shopping cart already.\n\nNo billionaire or fund would ever buy GME \"To fuck over the shorts\" and nothing else, because they'd be left holding the bag of a failing business they overpaid for.

This could force a true squeeze though likely would not happen until the stock gets back into single digits.\n\nLMFAO. That is not how that works *at all*. You don't need to cover or do anything if they were to do a reverse split, which they won't because their share price is not under a dollar.\n\n> 3) If not covered, emergency shareholder meeting. My understanding this would cause a recalling of shares to allow the shareholders to vote, this initiating the squeeze.\n\nWhy would they need to recall shares for a shareholder meeting (which also isn't happening)...? You don't need to show the shares to get into the meeting like a ticket, lmfao.\n\n> 5) If covered or uncovered, GME public offering of 10 million shares at $x price (we will say $200). This sets a bottom for the stock in the short term, I believe most who are already in the stock would see value in putting billions into the company coffers either for stock support on a cash balance basis or to be a war chest to facilitate the turn around. I am actually a bit puzzled why this hasn’t already been done.\n\nWhy would GME offer 10 million shares above market price. That makes no sense. Why would anyone buy shares at $200 when you could just buy them on the open market tomorrow for $50. Even if they did offer more shares at the market price, that bails out the shorts by giving them more shares in the float.\n\nPlease stop posting misinformation.\n\nEDIT: Downvoting me without replying means you have no argument and you're just buttmad.", "score": -42, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

This is rising and becoming more common which is why you see tons of \"20% off\" deals from apps if you sign up with them directly. This number can fluctuate in negotiations, but the normal base is 20%.\n* They reserve roughly \\~30% of the ad inventory on all apps that use ads. So if the user base and consumption in an app grows so does the physical number of ads Roku controls since its a reserved percentage. This number can fluctuate in negotiations, but the normal base is 30%.\n* They get a commission on every micro-transaction on the platform. So think of when a user goes inside VUDU, Prime Video, or any app and rents a movie this utilizes their embedded payment technology which gives Roku a kick back on every transaction.\n* Roku also has a large advertising business called Roku OneView, which allows companies and apps to utilize Roku datasets for precision targeting. This allows Roku to make money on ad inventory they do not control, along with marketers being able to build campaigns directly with Roku.\n\nRoku is also growing faster than any other Smart TV OS in North America and has just started pushing into international expansion. The wars between Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock only benefit Roku as more users consume more content and keep them using their Roku devices longer. People like to say Google, Amazon or Apple will just come and make them irrelevant but a lot of those people fail to realize that's been their competition since Day 1. Roku OS as of current state is the most lightweight Smart TV OS which gives TV manufacturers great cost advantages in using them and the performance on cheap chips.

You can buy a call with a $30 strike price 3 months out, and you could buy a put with a $20 strike price on the same date. \n\nIf that shizzle hits $30 or higher, your put expires worthless, but the call makes some money (or not, depending on IV, theta, delta, etc).\n\nIf that shizzle hits $20 or lower, your call goes kaput, but the put prints!\n\nThat was just a super-duper simple way of looking at it, but keep in mind that it gets a lot more complicated. I recommend looking up The Greeks on Investopedia, and looking specifically at Delta, Gamma, Vega, and Theta. Rho won't matter unless you dabble in years-long contracts. \n\nMost important thing to keep in mind is that the example I used was ultra-rudimentary; there are times when your call is at the strike price or higher, and you still lose money cuz the math is all sorts of crazy on derivatives and your call being ITM may not offset the premium you paid.\n\nHope this helps fam.

{"title": "The 5-2-3 Strategy: A New Way To Invest", "selftext": "For the last few months I’ve been tinkering with and studying a bevy of different TA Indicators for finding stocks to invest in just before the price takes off and selling just before it falls. Well no shit, it’s something we all try to do. I tried to keep it simple and experimented with EMA and Bollinger Bands.\n\n One trend that I found over and over again was when I used 5 Day EMA while following the prices day by day.  There were essentially 3 spikes that would happen in the lifespan of a price taking off. First, the 5 EMA would [start by “hugging” the top Bollinger Band](https://imgur.com/axWwcy0) this would be the indicator of one of the three hikes. To confirm this was a real hike and not a dummy, I employed the 2 Day EMA to confirm. In order for it to be confirmed, the 2 Day EMA would need to [break out of the Bollinger Band for roughly 3 trading days](https://imgur.com/bCuJpoh). This was by no means an overall confirmation to invest. The confirmation usually comes 1.5 to 2 months following the first spike when the exact same process happens again. Following the second confirmation we follow the price and make a decision when to jump in just as a dip occurs. We have 100% confidence that a third spike is coming and can ride that into a profit.\n\n\nObviously we should not employ this strategy into incredibly volatile stocks but it has been very successful for me thus far. Let’s take a look at some examples of the 5-2-3 Strategy at work:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is [Netflix in 2015](https://imgur.com/GPPOToX)\n\n\nHere is [Amazon in 2015](https://imgur.com/zhonAVu)\n\n\nHere is [NVIDIA in 2017](https://imgur.com/gxdeP9V)\n\n\nAlso some other big investment things that I can't say on this sub have fallen into the 5-2-3 strategy, like bits and dogs and such.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd finally to another recent stock: GME. In late August 2020 [the first spike occurred and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/W3tjDL6), 2.5 months later [the second happened and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/gMyNebx), then the price [took off and probably could’ve topped out at $50-60](https://imgur.com/s4ZY2Lw) but the insanity took hold and the rest is history.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHope you’ve found this interesting, I’d love some feedback and opinions on where I could do better!", "id": "lgdlw1", "created_utc": 1612905131.0, "score": 513, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 119, "comments": [{"body": "You gotta tell us what's next because we won't understand.

RR's main customer.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "So?\n\nRolls has no current engines suitable for a narrowbody airliner.  None.  Guess where most of Airbus' growth is?  If you said narrowbodies (A220/C-Series, A320) you'd be right.  There are two narrowbodies that use Rolls engines, the Boeing/MD 717 and the Boeing 757.  They both fit very unique niches but production of both has long since stopped and both models are being phased out by airlines.  Meanwhile GE (via CFM) has engines on every single 737 flying and a big chunk of the A320s. Pratt has all of Airbus' A220s.\n\nOkay let's talk widebodies then.  They don't sell as well as narrowbodies by virtue of their size and cost.  The 767 is living on with the KC-46 (which has its own issues), but those are all powered by Pratt.  GE is the single source for current 777/777x engines.  Rolls offers engines for the 787 and they managed to snag exclusive rights to the A330neo and A350.  Great. The neo is limping along sales-wise while the A350 and 787 are doing great.  But there's a catch.  Rolls' Trent engines are unreliable and Rolls has been battling persistent problems with them.  Look at how many 787s were grounded last year waiting for engine replacements (this and the 787 teething problems really hurt Norwegian long haul).  Rolls has gone through a few revisions but the problems remain.  ETOPS certification got clawed back on the Rolls powered 787s.\n\nAnd then there's the whole shift towards using narrowbodies on longer flights.  When air travel recovers you're likely to find that flying a larger chunk of the flights are on narrowbodies.  US flights to Hawaii and transatlantic flights are definitely shifting towards narrowbodies.  The days of being able to hop on a domestic DC-10 or Tristar are long gone.\n\nEven when air travel starts to recover Rolls is not well positioned to profit.  They have a troublesome engine family to deal with (Trent) and no products to compete in the fastest growing market segment.  Yeah, sure, they're too big to fail.  But too big to fail doesn't mean too big to screw over the shareholders.  Rolls will be around in a few decades, your investment in them probably won't.

Yes he could and the company could go bankrupt.\n\nAgreed, there was some risk of bankruptcy but as you said, with the worldwide attention it has right now, the risk has subsided significantly.\n\nIn another post comment, i said:\n\n>... Seems like you would really like to see a real squeeze happen. Problem  is, you might hit it big, or might get sorely disappointed. The way I  see it is that this is still a deepfuckingvalue play for a turnaround  story, with (still) a small chance that it will totally go tits up.  People are welcomed to debate on the probability of each scenario  happening, of course.\n\nI also said this before to someone trying to be 'proactive' to initiate a shareholders meeting:\n\n>If you are holding for the turnaround of the company, the proactive thing to do is to buy stuff from them and support them.  \n>  \n>I  suspect that your proactive-ness is to attempt to force a squeeze, or  resqueeze, and I dont think thats necessarily healthy for the company.\n\nSometimes, it's quite obvious from people's posts what they initially bought GME for. Perhaps a high percentage of people who bought it at >100, were only here for the squeeze or whatever the shit it was. Arguably, buying for the squeeze was an even higher risk for higher reward play. Expectedly, some have profited handsomely, and some have been burnt hard. Those of us who did or followed the initial DDs before all of this happened, likely entered GME in the sub $30 levels, and are not sweating any of it because it's still almost a 100% profit at this point, with a good upside potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Gave you an award, hope you feel better too.
