They occur every couple of years, sometimes with clear catalysts, sometimes with very little warning. A quick google search will be able to show you how frequent they are. I believe that the current market is long overdue for a bit of a correction, and I hope that one comes in a close enough time frame in order to alleviate the air that has inflated the current bubble that the stock market is in.

{"title": "GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3", "selftext": "GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next Part 3\n\nHello all,\n\nBefore I begin I would like to address something I have been encountering on my posts in the comments section. I keep receiving some hate concerning my opinions and I want to be crystal clear that they are just that; opinions. I also want everyone to know that is is meant to be a dialog. I am not trying to pump this stock because truthfully, this goes far beyond us retail investors at this point. What I want is a dialog between all sides to examine this truly fascinating phenomenon that is occurring.\n\nI would also like to clarify something, I am not a bagholder. I do currently hold bags because I own 336 shares at a $194.34 cost basis, however, that total amount is house money that was used from my profits on the first go around.\n\nI also understand some people are tired of hearing about this because it's the same regurgitated form of someone else's post as it keeps circulating in an attempt to retain hype and drive future buying; this is not what this post is about. As investors and individuals involved in the world of finance, this situation should absolutely intrigue us whether or not we are involved. I am here to present my logic on the situation but encourage healthy discussion and debate.\n\nThis brings me to my first claim. This is **not** over. Now, I am not claiming that a squeeze will still occur, I am simply claiming it is not over, for better or for worse. Several things need to take place for this to be completely over, at which point I will either post my gains or my losses from the adventure.\n\nWhen I say \"it\" I am referring to this entire phenomenon, not one short squeeze. I do not think these events, \"it\", is over. This is largely due to retail and institutional purchasing not really changing all that much since we found the bottom and established support at a staggering $60. This support was lost today and found new support at $50. There was very interesting ATH action and I'm not sure what to make of it.\n\nMillions of bag holders (not just WSB) are still holding and in fact, averaging down, thereby purchasing more. These same bag holders are absolutely refusing to sell for such massive losses and in turn are becoming long term investors on the stock if another squeeze isn't to occur. People are picking up speculative positions in the off-chance of another squeeze. Others are determining this as a fair value for the company, not fundamentally, but based on the future prospects of Ryan Cohen and team. Finally, it is nowhere near leaving the global stage with important upcoming dates that we will discuss later.\n\nTo examine why it isn't over let's look at both sides of the argument:\n\n1. Bulls claim it's not over for many reasons that you can find in the hundreds of other bullish posts, so I won't bore you with those details. My argument on the bull side is more along the lines of what I listed above.\n2. Bears claim it *is* over because there was a 2250% price increase over the course of two weeks, therefore this must be a short squeeze.\n\nI think we can all agree, bear or bull, that *something* happened. A 2250% increase certainly isn't nothing. The question is...what? I see several possibilities and would like to discuss them in the comments.\n\n1. The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze.\n2. The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze, but the price increase was mainly hype and gamma squeezes.\n3. The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.\n4. Some combination of the above 3.\n\n**First, the data:**\n\nBased on [morningstar](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/MarketData/EquityOptions/detail.jsp?query=126:0P000002CH) the short interest is showing 78.46%. Now, I think the website is having some issues storing cookies because it will show the outdated 226% unless you open it up in incognito.\n\n[Market watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gme) is showing 41.95%\n\nThis spread is interesting for sure, my thoughts are some of these calculations are including \"synthetic longs\" introduced by S3.\n\nIt is extremely possible to manipulate these numbers via illegal methods and even legal methods using options. [Please see this SEC document to explain how this would work.](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-318.pdf) I am not trying to convince anyone to fit my narrative, but these things occur far more commonly than one would expect. The reasoning is because the fines for committing the crime are far less costly than letting the event take place. Please see [FINRA's website](https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases) for the long, and frequent list of fines being dealt out due to manipulation. A common culprit? Lying about short volume.\n\nLet's use the absolute worst case scenario being reported of 41.95%, which mind you is still extremely high for one stock:\n\n**The shorts in fact covered and this was a short squeeze**\n\nWhat's interesting here is even if the shorts 100% covered all of their positions, they very well could have shorted on the way back down. Why wouldn't you? It would be insane to not open a short position when this hit nearly $500 especially if you lost half of your companies money; what better way to get it back? For the remainder of this thesis, I will be assuming that some of the short positions that exist are newly opened positions at a higher price unless someone has a counter-claim as to why that wouldn't be possible/probable.\n\nThat would mean 226% was covered on the way up and another 41.95% was reopened on the way back down. Based on the volume and price changes throughout the past two weeks this simply doesn't pass the math check. \n\n**The shorts partially covered and this was a partial short squeeze.**\n\nAgain, using 41.95% this is highly likely and the most reasonable case. Some, probably the worst positions, were covered on the way up. \n\nI think this is precisely what happened, we had some partial shorts covering but for the most part it was gamma squeezes, hype, and FOMO whereby the price started climbing so rapidly it became smarter for the shorts to just wait out the bubble than to actually cover all of their positions. \n\nAgain, we fall into a \"what-if\" scenario regarding shorting on the way back down.\n\n**The shorts didn't cover anything and this was a globally hyped price increase in conjunction with several gamma squeezes.**\n\nThis scenario does not pass the math check using the 41.95% figure.\n\nIf the data is being manipulated then this becomes very interesting because if some of the worst positions are still open then that means all of these HF's losses that were reported were strictly interest and they are simply waiting this out for as long as it takes making back their losses on their newly opened short positions in t $300-$400 range. \n\nSadly, this puts us in the guessing range yet again. We can do the math and see it's possible this scenario exists, however, we would be comparing it against losses reported by the entities that were being squeezed. \n\nThere are way to many what-if's for me to me consider this a possibility, but I can't write it off completely.\n\n**Some combination of the above 3.**\n\nTruthfully, this isn't worth examining just yet. There would be far to many \"what-if's\" to address, this is something that could be address at the later dates that we will get to shortly.\n\nNow, I've heard it a lot regarding the 02/09 data. \"It's two weeks old\". Well, that is always the case. The FINRA short data is always two weeks old and suggesting that we can't pull any information from it at all is asinine. Where it gets quite murky, is the data includes 01/27 information. This was a day unlike any other in this saga.\n\nI will take this moment to address the following upcoming catalysts and when I truly think this will be done; one way or the other.\n\nToday's data 02/09, was very important because if it showed an extremely low percentage then we know shorts have exited and did not re-enter and this is completely done. Given the data does not reflect that, we now must turn to several events that could act as catalysts for either a further squeeze or a complete shutdown.\n\n**02/19 -** In [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbuhp0/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next_part_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I discussed the Failure To Deliver (FTD) conundrum. I do need some help figuring out the exact expiration date. From [here](https://financialreview.poole.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Fails-to-deliver_before_and_after_the_implementation_of_Rule_203_and_Rule_204.pdf) \"The close-out requirement states that a participant of a clearing agency needs to take immediate action to close  4 out a fail to deliver position in a threshold security that has persisted for 13 consecutive settlement days by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.\"\n\nThe exact date is slightly irrelevant because I highly doubt all of these FTD's are going to deliver on the same exact day. [This site](https://wherearetheshares.com/), while it isn't an official channel seems to be doing a good job of tracking data. If you want to learn more about FTD's and the implications there please visit that site or review my last post which has links to follow for further reading.\n\n**02/18 -** Keith Gill aka u/DeepFuckingValue will testify before congress and RH CEO Vladimir will be attending. This can go several ways which can lead to an SEC trading halt on GameStop or with evidence that proves foul play occurred. Who knows? It will certainly be interesting and I don't even to speculate on the market reaction to this even because it could go a ton of different ways; it will be an important date nonetheless\n\n**02/24 -** The next FINRA short interest information will be made readily available to the public. This will be far more interesting and helpful information because it won't include the insane volatility of January, but it will also highlight the newest short positions. This data will help further drive where I think this is all going to end. It's possible that shorts opened new positions at $50 thinking it was going back to $12. Let's not speculate too much here either, it's just another dataset that will bring light to the direction this is headed.\n\n**03/25 -** GameStop ER. This is big too for several reasons. First, this will include the console sales cycle which historically has done well for GameStop. A typical buy the hype, sell the news event. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts leading up to this ER, maybe people won't even touch GME leading up to then due to the recent volatility, but if they do, and if there is still a lot of short interest, this too could force shorts to begin covering. Another critical part of this ER is Ryan Cohen. This will be the first time this new board addresses the public with their plans for the future and for the first time since this entire adventure began, the \"dying brick and mortar\" narrative will finally begin to change in the public eye. That is still the common misconception regarding GameStop, that it is a dying brick and mortar retailer where nothing has changed. This hasn't been the case for around 6 months now, but this will be the first time it is publicly address. The headlines surrounding GameStop's future plans will be very interesting to read and the markets reaction will be far more interesting.\n\nI have been asked a lot what my PT is and when I expect the squeeze to happen, but let me be clear. Very seldom do squeezes \"just happen\". In fact, short squeezes are far more common than one would think, they just typically happen over months, if not years and the shorts cover on dips so you don't even notice it's happening. In order to force a squeeze, you need to hold a decent amount of shorts underwater. Soon one will crack and start closing their position, this leads to a series of shorts closing their positions skyrocketing the price until more and more shorts need to cover. This is **rare.**\n\nI hope this narrative of purchasing heavily shorted companies comes to a close soon because a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money simply buying up companies because they are heavily bet against. Catalysts and massive changes need to occur like overhauling your entire business as is the case with GameStop.\n\nNormally, shorts will close their positions one at a time, covering on dips and you don't even notice it's happening. In times where you see a price rise of seemingly no news could very well be shorts closing their positions because their research led them to realize this company is on the road to recovery.\n\nI digress. Given the most recent data and the multiple upcoming catalysts I am still very bullish on a GME short squeeze. My [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from quite some time ago illustrated the importance of catalysts regarding a short squeeze, this is still very much the case. The first run was interrupted and the second run won't happen with magic, it requires a catalyst. Another post was titled [For those who do not understand the inevitable GME short squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), was at the time \"inevitable\" because math. That is no longer the case. It is no longer inevitable but it is still possible.\n\nI want to be clear: This is not nearly as close to a sure thing as it once was and it depends on a lot of different factors. One of the largest is the people. Granted, a lot of what's happening now is in the hands of institutions but millions of retailers holding their positions to the grave certainly helps the institutional buyers have more faith in their play to continue a squeeze.\n\n**SO WHAT DO I THINK**\n\nI think shorts certainly covered some of their positions, but not all. I also firmly believe a significant amount of short positions were opened on the way back down by both HF's and individuals. Some certainly positioned high, but based on sentiment, it appears a lot of people think GME is fairly valued around $20 (which I disagree with but let's use that for the time being). That would mean shorts would have no problem opening positions at 100,70,60, even $50. \n\n42% is *still* very high which means a squeeze is inevitable so long as the company continues in a positive path. However, squeezes typically aren't as abrupt as people think. They are actually quite common, in fact another position I'm heavily invested in is SPCE and they have been going through a squeeze for several weeks and will continue to squeeze so long as news continues to be positive. \n\nHow would we get an abrupt short squeeze? A massive bull run. The new shorts that entered at lower levels wouldn't be too hard to catch, however, they are probably low volume, so when they buy to close, it won't be large enough volumes for massive peaks, but a bull run very well could lead to these lower tiered shorts closing, triggering a gamma squeeze. If gamma squeezes are made week over week then shorts at the higher end would have two options:\n\n1. Close early and take profits\n2. Wait it out because they are positioned so well that interest means nothing and they don't think there is any hope of us rising to those levels.\n\nIn the first case, them closing early would be a nice short squeeze to probably several hundred dollars, but it wouldn't break $1000.\n\nTo break $1000 we would need a big bull run to catch the shorts, trigger gamma squeezes, and keep momentum until they are caught and underwater. This is highly unlikely unless there is another global sentiment. \n\n**NOTE:**  ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS I AM MAKING ARE BASED ON THE 42% REPORTING. IF IT IS IN FACT 78% THEN THE POSSIBILITY IS TREMENDOUSLY INCREASED FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.\n\n**SO WHEN DOES IT ALL END**\n\nMy though is if by the end of March these catalysts were not enough to reignite the hype and squeeze, then it will essentially be over except in the case of a few circumstances:\n\n1. A VW/Porche moment occurs where a large buyer picks up a large portion of the company.\n2. Some other currently unknown catalyst appears seemingly out of thin air\n3. The data was in fact manipulated. Regardless of what the data says, if the shorts did in fact lie about their short int to take the fine over being squeezed, then they will be squeezed regardless. \n\nIt is quite possible, that these catalysts and moments aren't enough to force a squeeze anymore especially if the shorts have repositioned really well. I will retain the mindset that this fateful January 2021 was **not a short squeeze.** However, that does not mean it will ever actually happen.\n\n**SO WHAT IS YOUR PLAY HOOMAN?**\n\nWell, I am long on GME which is why I didn't mind hopping back in even at outrageous prices. I will continue averaging down and don't plan on selling for quite some time, probably several years. The reason for this is I believe in Cohen and his team to turn this into something unexpected and I imagine an eventual ROI. Once this is all said and done and I think either the shorts truly have covered or they simply got away with it (Beginning of April), I will be posting my DD for GME as a long play regardless of the squeeze mechanics.\n\nThank you all for joining me on this wild journey. I hope we can discuss some of these points in the comments like adults and truly try to grasp this wild situation we are all in. There are extremes on both sides from \"get over it, the squeeze happened\" to a cult like mentality on the other extreme. I hope through discussion we can find the moderate approach and further understand the market mechanics at play.\n\nThanks for your time\n\n**WARNING: Until the squeeze business is over for good, this is a very volatile and risky play. Joining now for the hope of a potential round 2 squeeze should only be done in a speculative manner with money you are willing to lose. This is more akin to a gamble than it is investing. I think the current market price is fair given the future prospects of the company but do your own DD, I will not be releasing any until this squeeze is put to rest.**\n\n**TL;DR**: I am still bullish on this scenario even at 42%, if it really is 78% then I am extremely bullish. There are a plethora of upcoming catalysts that could reignite the squeeze but even if none are powerful enough, with Cohen's new direction we could expect good news for quite some time forcing shorts to exit on a more spread out timeline. \n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor.

Great overview and very logical train of thought on the possibilities without needing to overly rely on the potential shady dealings from the HFs, clearing houses , RH etc.\n\nAs I've read up on past short squeezes that were acute in nature, the common theme is like you said, a particular event. Typically it's the largest ownership recalling lended shares and until that happens, shorts can continue on without covering as long as their risk exposure is not an issue and they can continue to pay the fees. For Gamestop, it's really a complete unknown what the company plan is as a reaction to all news. The outrageous amount of shorts is a bane. But will any reaction raise the ire of a fickle SEC like it was with Overstock? \n\nPerhaps the console sales, the general hype have led to a great quarter such that Gamestop can simply trigger a squeeze with earnings in an organic way? I was deep in the console hunt back in the fall and noted how much of a cash cow it was for GME. After their pre-orders, just about every new shipment was sold as a giant bundle ranging from an additional $150-500 by including multiple games and accessories. They ALL sold out in less than five minutes. Every single time. Customers were so eager they spent twice the cost of the console without flinching. Astute decision for a retailer needing to maximize this console launch.\n\nDecent earnings, I was also wondering what the least destructive end to this short sellers wars might be...for all involved. And for that I look at Tesla. Sure, we may see another mini squeeze or two before the summer that balances out the shorts a bit  ...but I wouldn't be surprised to see this back and forth for the next five years. Until Gamestop begins to live up to the promise as a renewed e-commerce gaming powerhouse.

What that is describing is an ATM call and an ATM put at the same strike with the same expiration. \n\nThis is why there are two sets of data. 42% and 78%. One is accounting for synthetic longs, the other is not. \n\nThis is why synthetic positions have been accounted for with GME. \n\nI know what the float is, are you sure you’re not confusing it with shares outstanding? \n\nWhen you borrow a share, you borrow it from the float. \n\nIf there are 10 shares in the float and I short 1 share then the short int is 1/10*100 = 10% short int.\n\nIf I then buy a share and return it then there would be 10 shares with 0 short. IE 0% short int.\n\nSo if both of us short the same stock with 10 one share each. There is now 10 shares on the float with 2 short. If I close my position, there is 10 share float with 1 short, so even if you use the same share as me it doesn’t change the short float percentage aka the short interest.\n\nSo if the float is 10 with 10 short, that’s 100% SI.\n\nThere are two ways to surpass 100% one is by naked short selling (which is illegal) and the other is by brokers lending out shares that are then shorted again. (which is normal)\n\nIt works in the OPPOSITE direction of what you’re saying. The same share can be shorted more than once and when this happens it creates synthetic longs. When you account for synthetic positions in the SI calculation it is impossible to exceed 100%. So the 42% is factoring in synthetic positions and the 78% is not. \n\nSo yes, the same share can be shorted more than once which could result in a > 100% SI.\n\nYou can double up when you sell to open, but you can’t double up when you buy to close.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I was just looking to ask this myself.

The bottom line is that if 100% of the company is shorted, 100% has to be bought back, and must have interest paid on it in the meantime. A share sold short is downward pressure on the stock price, and upward pressure is owed back to the system.

But overall, these past few years, many many companies see enormous gains, like 100% in a day, or even 600% in a month. But anyways, Let’s say a share of Amazon is $3,000. Then in a typical day, you would likely fluctuate somewhere in between $2,850 - $3,300. Today is +2.3%, tomorrow is -4%, the day after another -1.8% and so on...we’re in a huge bull market, meaning over the long run, most companies are seeing a lot of growth over the year. So In reality, Amazon has actually done PHENOMENAL and has gone from $500 to over $3200 a share! That’s a 650% gain! Pretty mind-blowing actually. Had you invested $100 then, it wound be worth $650...not a lot but not bad. Now, it definitely pays to be rich, because if you invested $250k, you’d be a millionaire. In fact, you’d have $1,625,000. So yes, more money risked, WAY more money earned. You can definitely make low risk investments, medium risk investments, and high risk investments. If your trying to live off day trading, you would most likely need lots of money to pull it off without having to do risky trades. I personally have very little money to invest in serious stocks like Amazon, but I do like to trade penny stocks. For example, I bought $.OM many months ago at 28c a share for 500$. That means I bought roughly 2000 shares (a little less but just using even numbers for simplicity. Then, I got super lucky and $.OM shot up well above $2 and I sold for $2.40 if I remember correctly.

People are investing purely in the future without any consideration of fundamentals. And I think a lot of this is driven by newly actualized markets becoming a mainstay globally.

I think Musk/Tesla did this vagueness on purpose. Remember, he wanted to take Tesla private to get rid of the quarterly pressure that distracts from long term success and development. Also, he doesnt love analysts that just look at the numbers. Basically, tesla couldnt care less about Wall Street.\n\nChime in Gary. His arguments that the guidance was bullshit and that the information at the conference call was shallow.. thats all right arguments. But his conclusion that the company has something to hide and therefore doesnt lick the feet of Analysts and optimize their statements to maximize share price.. its just completely garbage.\n\nThen the BitCoin stuff. Tesla did it for some reason but it fucks over Analysts. Does Tesla care? No. They bought BC for probably some very good argument but Wall Street is too much up its own arse to look for it.\n\nI bet we will see some long drawn out FUD compain again. In the meantime, Tesla just executes as it always have. So maybe the share price will drop as a result, but the value of the company is decoupled from the share price and will increase. This is a great opportunity for retail to get on before FSD goes ballistic. And its a middle finger to all the analysts that cant see behind the balance sheet or cant do fundamental analysis and resort to argueing by analogy. For example, look at Gary, One of the first things he does after Tesla takes the BC share, is he looks at MicroStrategy. Because they also have BC. Or when he said that TSLA share price would rise about 15% after S&P inclusion because thats what happened in the past? He is not going deep into the analysis bucket and simply looks at other companies \"that did the same\". Lots of Wall Street is like that. Thats why they constantly miss the mark on Tesla.\n\nRetail is different. Retail looks deep into the company. I know, I am part of it. I couldnt care less if guidance of Tesla is wague or not. It doesnt tell me anything what they say. I look at the progress of factories, on expansion projects, on capacity and draw my own conclusions. 50% compound growth my ass! Tesla is guiding for 100% this year and based on cybertruck demand and Berlin + Texas ramp, well over 50% next year. I dont know beyond but Model 2 (or whatever) will PROBABLY come 2023, which will spawn another 100% increase. They will not say it publicly because any number of things out of their control can go wrong, but thats what the data indicates. NO COMPANY OF THIS SCALE EVER GREW THAT FAST. Too bad I have no intention of looking at it this way Wall Street.\n\nLook at Autobidder and energy business in general. A completely unchartet territory. Never been done before. Guess who completely misses its impact? Wall Street. Because they cant find an analogy for it, so they chose to ignore it. Guess we will see in a few years time. But you know whats stupid? To optimize the energy business ramp to maximize quarterly results. Its a long term play to drive most of the energy business of today out of the market with retail solar and battery storage. Guess why Wall Street is completely ignoring it? Right, they dont understand it because its not in the balance sheet. They are asleep on the wheel until its too late and then they scratch their heads why Tesla is so damn overvalued.\n\nTesla is still massively undervalued. Some analyst said that they would have to value Tesla at $3000 today if they would believe they can reach their goal of 20M cars by 2030. THATS the true value of Tesla. Its just too ridiculous for them to believe it, so they rather close their eyes and plug their ears and sing \"LALALALALA\".  I know I sound like SMR, but he HAS a point there.\n\nAs a result of all this disbelieve and Teslas intentional vagueness, is a FUD campaign that drives the share price down short and maybe mid term.

Selling Covered Call is a great Theta Strategy for that).\n* Fixed timing. This is more on the disciplined side of business, having a set time is so much easier to get disciplined about trading.\n\nLike I said, imo the limited upside when the stock goes balistic is a problem so here is what I use to get around that, here is my actual technique with Theta.\n\n1. CSPs on supports on very few stocks I wouldn’t mind owning even though I always sell before getting assigned.\n2. Loto tickets with short dated calls or ATM CSPs (example PLTR earnings coming in)\n3. LEAPs on the stocks I sell CSPs on to get the upside as well\n\nBasically this technique gives me 2x the upside, let me make 1x in sideways trading and break even on downsides when it doesn’t go down more than 30%, even then, I can roll out options and my LEAPs are long dated anyway.\n\nMy main stocks are Palantir, Nio, MARA and occasionnally TSLA / NVDA credit spreads.\n\nGood fundamental stocks with a hype factor and quite high IV to make the theta dream work.\n\n**My strategy on : NIO**\n\nNio is a great company to start trading CSPs on, it’s event driven with delivery numbers coming in every 2nd of the month, it has NIO day, and a TSLA like hype factor to grow, it’s one of the best company to sell CSPs on because it respects supports in a great way.\n\n[NIO is a really good stock to sell CSPs on](https://preview.redd.it/szy7rzdzcng61.png?width=1442&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dabbeb00e2d1d6cb121a92c00b4e53dea9bc751)\n\nThis is my trading view chart of NIO, really easy to see how supports and trendline get tested with the stock.\n\nHere what I usually do is sell the **45**, **48** and **50** CSP in 20 to 30 days, I do that at the beginning of each week or later if I think I can get a better premium and buy to close at around 80% profits.\n\n**The Loto tickets on : NIO**\n\nAt the start of December NIO was expected to deliver a record number of cars which was expected to boost the stock price, so I sold some ATM puts and some loto calls for after the NIO day scheduled the same week, as you can see, it was a good call.\n\n**LEAPs on : NIO**\n\nAt the end of October I bought 2 LEAPs 35c for Jan15 ‘22 for 8.81, it’s now 32.00 and not planning to sell them until January.\n\nSo here is my technique to profit from upsides, sideways and downsides with a gambling aspect that everyone love. \n\nI post this to share my technique with this subreddit as It has been very profitable for me and would love it to be for someone else, not looking to brag or anything, you can critique as you want I’m open to criticism.\n\n**“But what if there’s a crash ?”** I just close my positions and reverse to selling calls, crash of more than 40% are black swan events tbh.\n\nI basically do the same thing on PLTR, my positions right now are :\n\n* 3x Jan21 ‘22 35c\n* 4x Feb19 ’21 34c\n* \\-5x Feb19 ‘21 35p\n* \\-7x Feb19 ‘21 32.5p\n* 12x Feb19 ‘21 60c\n\nI will sell some of these before earnings on monday and let the rest run because I do believe there will be a big surprise on earnings (Possible FB partnership).", "id": "lgt314", "created_utc": 1612961874.0, "score": 397, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 180, "comments": [{"body": "So you sel CSPs and buy calls on companies you think will run up?

I think it is important to recognize that Leaps are more aggressive than stocks. You can get a greater return but you are at a greater risk. There are a couple points to this. Let's look at a couple things with leaps vs stocks. \n\n1. You do choose the wrong stock and it goes down by 30%. Your leap is 100% loss while yoir stocj is 30% loss.\n\n2. The entire stock market is depressed.  Over the long term stocks go up. We are on an amazing bull run right now where year after year you are seeing returns. It is not like that all the time. Historically there are years where the entire market is down. Not like March where a \"flash crash\" happened but entire years where stocks are now worth less than they were before and don't recover in 3 months. If this happens leaps will lose 100% of value while stocks will come back and lose 0%. \n\nThere are ways to mitigate this with leaps. Don't buy with your entire portfolio so you can buy back in while stocks are down. Buy leaps on companies that may not dip in a recession. But those strategies all take away from profits. \n\nI'm not saying don't buy leaps but I think it is important to know what the risk is and not be blinded by recent above average returns. Leaps can definitely return you above average returns but they can also take a huge chunk out of your portfolio faster than stocks if you don't manage the risks. Managing the risks lowers the returns. It is a catch 22.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Your first point is not entirely true, for exactly this case. If the underlying goes far underwater, you have less per share risk with options than stocks. The 2 year DTE ATM LEAP on Microsoft costs $4063 per contract. If you bought 100 shares of msft ($24161) instead and it loses more than 17% of its value, you lose more money in absolute terms than if you bought one contract at at a 240 strike. Yes, the option expires with 100% loss, but it cost you a lot less to purchase it. There are shrewd ways to use options that aren't just putting all your cash into them.", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "You are correct. In my example, I intended for the person to be all in on stocks or all in on leaps. If you have 24k you either buy all leaps or all stocks. In your example you would have 100 shares of msft or 6 options contracts. \n\nIf the stick loses 17% of its value then you either have 0 dollars if you are all in on leaps or you have 18.5k if you were all in on stocks. If MSFT goes up 17% then stocks gets you to 28080 and leaps gets you to about break even. If it goes up 34% then stocks gets you to 32k and leaps gets you to 24k. If it goes up 51% then stock gets you to 36k and leaps get you to 48k. \n\nGreater risk, greater reward. If the stock goes \"sideways\" and doesn't gain by more than 34% in 2 years then you lose. It is definitely more intricate than that on some level but that is the simplified version. If you look at it from making the market you would say the market maker expects the stock to rise by 34% over the next 2 years because that is what they set breakeven at for the leap. If you are very bullish on Microsoft you buy the leap. If you are less bullish then you buy the stock. \n\nIn your example of 100 shares vs 1 contract you actually will never have greater gains with the contract than the shares as you have to cover your premium before you start to bring in profit. So you limit upside but you also limit downside because if the stock goes down 50% you lose 4k instead of 12k.

If you were only able to do it 3 times while owning the stock you end up with just over 10% return on capital including the dividends.

{"title": "Aphria Inc (APHA): my final post before merger 😮‍💨🥦🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Hello, some of you might know me from [my initial post before new year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn4wck/aphria_inc_apha_yes_its_cannabis_yes_its_about_to/) and [my follow-up post two weeks later](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwiuyl/aphria_inc_apha_blue_america_and_free_tendies/).  I suggest you guys read those first, because I won't repeat earlier points I've made in other posts. I'm here to give you guys a final Aphria headsup before merger. I won't post again before merger, because I think this is the final moment to buy into APHA before merger at a reasonable price. Next post will be about gains after merger.\n\n# Introduction (another look back)\n\nWell, well, well. I have to take you guys back to the beginning. After a long time lurking, the Aphria posts were my first DD posts on this subreddit. What a journey that has been. I have to remind you guys that before [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k450e6/why_apha_is_set_for_a_50_gain/) by [u/WatAb0utB0b](https://www.reddit.com/user/WatAb0utB0b/) after they acquired Sweetwater, basically nobody on this sub was talking about Aphria. Then I made my post after the merger announcement, still almost nobody else was talking about it and I was laughed at (again a shout-out to the guy that advised me to buy an Xbox instead of APHA). When people saw the gains come in after the senate turned blue and I made my follow-up post, some people finally took notice (although still not a lot). And here we are right at this very moment, the entire subreddit is currently talking about it. \n\nI know my DD probably wasn't the most best/detailled you guys will ever read. But I'd still like to think that my initial post inspired some others to buy APHA or do their own DD. I'd like to imagine some dude YOLO'd his life savings into it when he read my post and that person is sitting in Hawaii right now sipping on some coconut milk, getting his cock sucked by a hooker named Stacy and enjoying his life. That feeling is exactly why I am writing this last DD post for you retards right now. Hopefully everyone reading this post will listen to me now and I can make some more of you autists rich.\n\n# There's no denying it: Cannabis market heading back to 2018 levels\n\nI told you guys before, once the good news rally begins then we were going to head for the moon because of the volatility of cannabis stocks. This is exactly what happened. Cannabis will undoubtedly be federally legalized in the USA now. There might be minor political obstructions, but there's no stopping the general movement. Once the American legalization movement is done, it will probably also influence European regulators. Cannabis stock should be a part of your portfolio at this point. If it isn't already, let me give you another couple of reasons why.\n\n**It's not about the joints, it's about the CBD oil.** Let's be honest: to most people cannabis will still be seen as an addicting drug you should avoid because of the years that regulators spent demonizing it. You know which product doesn't suffer from a bad image? CBD motherfucking oil, I would even say it has a very positive image. Most people probably think about it like this: joints = junkees in the park getting high, CBD oil = people suffering from cancer relieving their pain. Its healing effects might be scientifically doubted, that doesn't change the general consensus about the product.  \nYou should even think past the direct 'healing' effects, CBD oil is becoming a popular supplement for regular people. People will be buying drinks, food, even fucking shampoo with CBD oil in it. The market for it is the most promising across all cannabis products, because it is the most likely to become popularised throughout North America and also be partially legalized in countries that still ban marihuana (EU mostly). Growth estimates currently are that the total CBD oil market should roughly quintuple by 2025.\n\n**Markets are fucking insane right now, cannabis mania 2.0 is inevitable.** I don't have to tell you guys about it. This is the ideal investing climate for the cannabis market to go bonkers again, except this time there is actually nothing holding it back. The naysayers have no valid arguments against cannabis anymore like they had in 2018. There is absolutely a bubble blowing up right at this moment, so I quote old pal George Soros: \"The first thing I do when I notice a bubble is invest more\". The bubble isn't popping anytime soon people. Green energy, EV, cannabis: all these markets have very positive futures ahead of them. Cannabis might even be a long term hold this time around, can you guys believe it? The stock that has been memed so hard and struggled their way through the last couple of years is finally a worthy boomer investment. Praise the lord, Amen.\n\n# Aphria/Tilray merger arbitrage: TLRYtards are missing out\n\n**There is no reason to pick Tilray over Aphria. There, I said it.** I talked all about the possible arbitrage in my previous post, but here is a small summary. Aphria and old Tilray are merging to new Tilray. Aphria will get a 62% stake in new Tilray, old Tilray will get a 38% stake. To account for this split, Aphria owners will receive 0.8381 shares for each APHA share they own. Tilray stock holders will not see any changes to their holdings. There is arbitrage/free tendies because the APHA to TLRY ratio is lower than 0.8381. The only risks are (1) the merger doesn't go through or (2) the split/ratio is adapted to Aphria's detriment, both seem highly unlikely because the merger was already publicly announced. \n\nBack then APHA to TLRY ratio was 0.67 and it has even worsened to roughly 0.57 at this moment. I've seen other people post about this, but they are missing something. As we move closer and the specific merger date is announced, the APHA to TLRY ratio will undoubtedly move to 0.8381 so TLRY must fall or APHA must skyrocket by that date. The thing others are missing in their DD's is from the point you buy APHA, the matter if the APHA to TLRY split corrects itself doesn't matter to you personally anymore. All you have to do is compare YOUR buy-in price with the Tilray price. As long as that ratio is below the merger ratio of 0.8381, you will profit from the merger. It's as simple as that.\n\n**TLDR:** Cannabis = arguably best growth market for the near future or long term. Aphria = best candidate in the market because of APHA/TLRY merger. APHA to TLRY price ratio doesn't match with merger agreement = free tendies, no reason to pick Tilray. This is IMO the last time to buy in for a reasonable price.\n\n**Positions:** I still have my measily 30 shares @ $8.74 that I've been holding since the start of December.

{"title": "Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together", "selftext": "TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)\n\nI was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:\n\nOne of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\\_institutions\\_hold\\_177\\_of\\_float\\_why\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\\_points\\_to\\_gme\\_shorts\\_not\\_having\\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.\n\nI’m an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). “Failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from “naked” short selling**.”\n\nInteresting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.\n\nAccording to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, “Abusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago… Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**… We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))\n\nIn a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent \"irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it.”** Mr Cox also “referred to \"the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**\" and that the SEC is \"concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**\" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\\_points\\_to\\_gme\\_shorts\\_not\\_having\\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman’s words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))\n\nAs another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))\n\nI also read ‘**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create \"**phantom\" or \"counterfeit\" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price’**”. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a \"push\" into extinction from \"a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling\". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\\_streets\\_naked\\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))\n\nAll these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.\n\nOn 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.\n\nApparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.\n\nThen I read something that caught my eye… DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, “Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These \"failures to deliver\" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))\n\nApparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal “**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.” (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).\n\n\"It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))\n\nAs a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn’t it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn’t get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would’ve happened that day.\n\nFrom the Wall Street Journal: “The Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**… Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This \"phantom stock\" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply… Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.”** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))\n\nFrom everything I’ve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:\n\n* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)\n* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\\_points\\_to\\_gme\\_shorts\\_not\\_having\\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close\n* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float\n* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)\n* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may’ve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME\n* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.\n\nWith the hearing coming up on February 18th, I highly recommend you email and tweet the representatives involved in the hearing, as well as your own district representatives, and urge them to read into the factors presented in this post and **call the DTCC and Prime Brokers to the hearing**l. **They need to be questioned on why GME has so many counterfeit shares, failed to deliver, their complicity in naked shorting, and investigated for their role in the retail shut down of 1/28.** Below are 4 members of congress I recommend both tweeting and emailing\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez [https://twitter.com/AOC](https://twitter.com/AOC), email: [us@ocasiocortez.com](mailto:us@ocasiocortez.com)\n\nAl Green [https://twitter.com/repalgreen](https://twitter.com/repalgreen), email: [al.green@mail.house.gov](mailto:al.green@mail.house.gov)\n\nMaxine Waters [https://twitter.com/maxinewaters](https://twitter.com/maxinewaters), email: [maxine.waters@mail.house.gov](mailto:maxine.waters@mail.house.gov)\n\nNancy Pelosi Email: [https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi](https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi) email: [sf.nancy@mail.house.gov](mailto:sf.nancy@mail.house.gov).\n\nAnd you can find other members of Financial Services Committee here to reach out to: [https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm](https://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm)\n\n**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**\n\n**This brings up another interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**\n\nEdit 2: A [compelling theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/lglkwv/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/gmsll2k/) put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read\n\nEdit 3: If you want to read more in depth about counterfeiting stock this is a good place to start  [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](https://href.li/?http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)", "id": "lglrg5", "created_utc": 1612930857.0, "score": 12123, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 1263, "comments": [{"body": "Actually read it, good DD my guy.

Not only did the GameStop coalition make some of you brilliant people pay off their student loans, put down payments on houses, and make multiple charitable donations to great causes, but it caused the world to see the flaws in the 'system' and 'the free market'. I'm in my late twenties and I've seen the best this country can't be.\n\nMy dad is a salesman. Growing up as a kid in the 90s, he supported me and my three siblings our whole lives. Before the the 2000s, bonuses were spread throughout the company he worked for at the time. If the company did well, if the sales people did a good job for the company they work for, everyone was given a fair bonus in accordance with the profits brought in. This way of comradery (fairness) doesn't seem to exist anymore. We see it as a fantasy that both the CEO and subordinates, that earn the company the real profits, can both profit together.\n\nEveryone involved in the day-to-day labor worked their tails off for the betterment of the company they put the hours in for. All for the wellbeing for them and their families. Both the higher ups and 'underlings' worked in sync with one another for the most part, that being the chairmen of the company and the salespeople/installers that are involved in selling/implementing the product and all prospered from the work being done. \n\nI am affected by that dream. I am censored by the billionaires/trillionaires that exist today. This trickle down effect where someone can be a literal trillionaire and the people under them are making fractions of those fractions of a salary for them and their families makes me nauseous. I'm tired of witnessing the general public just accepting it for the sign of the times. To be honest, it goes way past accepting it when it comes to the big wigs literally shutting trading down for people like us. People that see the shift in where it should be to where it is now. \n\nI am fully in support of $GME and I hope the stock goes stratospheric like we all hope it will. But if you cant afford it, stocks like $BB, $PLTR, or $AMC should not be given up on. I guess I would just like to say I care for you and your future gains deeply and lets never give up trying to get back the American Dream that was promised to us after those crazy student loans or incredible debt.

I get the current euphoria surrounding Ford and GM (and others) going electric now, but if the 4680 cells work out for Tesla, Telsa will see its profits and stock skyrocket, whereas everyone else will likely take a dive.\n\nIf you don't understand the big deal about the 4680 cells just respond to this comment and I will try to type up some of my thoughts on it. Feel free to disagree with what I say, it is just my opinion.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Can you explain the thing about the 4680 cells?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I ended up buying 50 of those calls, and up 28% now on them. Still holding as I think there is some way to go.\n\nAs to your question about the 4680 cells.\n\n1. The production process will allow for faster production of cells and cheaper production of cells then anything currently out there. This helps solves two constraints, one, there simply is a shortage of batteries, and two, reducing cost means for any vehicle where price competition is relevant, Telsa will have an advantage. - The tabless design is the key element here as it allows for high speed winding of the jelly rolls that go in the cells and gets rid of the need to start and stop equipment and deal with the difficult step of adding in the tab afterwards.\n2. The 4680 cells can be made structural elements in cars and small trucks. This means less weight overall in building the vehicles. It means a stiffer vehicle (better handling). Per Elon it also means they can center the weight better which helps with handling as well. The handling stuff is nice, but the reduced weight is a lot more critical as it means less wear and tear on the vehicle as a whole and it means more range.\n3. The 4680 cells should lend themselves towards a simpler integration with the wiring and cooling/heating system. Basically, you should have a machine that holds the battery in a fixed pattern, inserts them to the container where they are then epoxied in place. That simple fixed grid should allow a a robot to simply place a fixed grid of wires/connections on the pack. This means faster assembly and lower cost.\n4. The 4680 cells with the tabless design, means they can be cooled or heated via the tabs (ok, I know this sounds contradictory... tabless just means a constant tab, rather then a single tab at the end). Imagine a metal cylinder sitting on a cooling or heating plate and how quick that can be heated or cooled, this is essentially what a 4680 cells allows. Other battery cells, even pouch cells, have tabs at the ends. There is no way heat can be transferred as quick via a single tab versus a continuous tab. This means that thermally, the 4680 cells are far ahead of anything out there. Further, the tabless cell allows for the continuous tab to directly connect to the wiring/cooling/heating. Pouch cells which reside in a pack, need much more work to make these connections. Best thing would be to waste hours trying to find videos and pictures of how these things are assembled to begin to understand what is going on here.\n5. The 4680 cells via the continuous tab, also give it the benefit of pouch cells, in that electrical resistance is lowered due to the electrons needing to travel a shorter distance. This means less heat generated and more power you can get from the cell (i.e. if you have less ohmic resistance then you need less voltage for energy to flow... or at least my limited of understanding of electricity tells me that sentence makes sense!). More power is more range. Combine this with the lower weight due to it being structural, then you can reduce the kWh's needed for any given range. This is better then pouch cells, as the thermal management of the 4680's should be better.\n\nI think that overall covers the benefits and improvements of the 4680 cells and why they are such a game changer. I think in every aspect they are better and cheaper then anything out there. I would even wonder if given the choice between building an EV with a LI-Ion 4680 cell versus a solid-state pouch cell, that when you get down to it, the 4680 cells beats the solid-state (compare kWh's to weight of the vehicle as a whole, not just cell density and also consider cost... solid-state might be better in terms of charging and performance, but might not be enough). If you can make the 4680 format solid-state then there is simply no question that the 4680 will be better. Given solid-state batteries are not even being claimed to be be available before  the end of 2022, there will simply be nothing out there for at least a year that comes close to the 4680 cells.\n\nThis is why I think the second half of this year,  when Tesla opens Texas and Berlin and should start producing cars with these cells is so crucial. If the 4680 cells live up to their promise and Tesla can produce them in sufficient quantities, Tesla can simply dedicate production to the vehicle segments that are more profitable and simply dominate there. The thing Ford and others have going for it, is Tesla will have trouble making enough vehicles for everyone, so there may be room for others to make some profitable vehicles in the short-term. But again, you can be sure that if one type of vehicle is more profitable then others, Tesla will likely focus on that and within a year or two or three force competitors to cut prices to sell their cars. Profits will be hard as a result.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I saw someone make a comment that F moved like a mutual fund lol.\n\nI agree.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "you cannot really compare tsla and ford. it just doesnt have the same appeal. also a lot of people invested in tesla did because of musk. i do not think ford tripples it market cap. not in the next years anyways.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Mach E has been out on the streets since late last year.

I think there's probably very good reason why there has never been a big, mainstream shop like that. \n\nThere's a pretty hard limit to how much cheaper these things get in bulk. Wholesalers also have slim margins. Board games are expensive to make. I'm sure that currently Gamestop is one the biggest bulk buyers of new video games and yet it's common knowledge that they make very little off of new games. Used games and consoles were where they made money. The increase of digital game sales has kneecapped their ability to stay profitable off of used software, hence their foray into other sources of revenue (Funko Pops, etc). Could they do used board games? I guess. There would be a lot more overhead involved than video games and with a much smaller market. \n\nCurrently, Gamestop is the most expensive place to buy traditional gaming stuff like trading cards. A pack of Pokemon will run you $5 CAD with the possibility of bulk discounts in any local store but is $6 at Gamestop. Maybe there is something to this approach of creating larger profits margins directed at more mainstream crowds. Trying to take the market share from local stores seems difficult and not worthwhile, but it could be possible to bring the hobby to the masses.

So, I may be mistaken on points, or just wrong. I am just here to present the information I have found and the thoughts I have in hopes that others on here will be able to contribute there ideas/research.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) database of Form 13F for Melvin Capital:\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?owner=exclude&action=getcompany&type=13F-HR&CIK=1628110\n\nIf you look at the most recent file, it says it was filed on 2020-11-16. So, November 16 2020 is the most recent file that's available. Yet, the OMB (Office of Management and Budget) approval stamp says it expires on October 31st, 2018. (There’s probably a reasonable explanation for this, but I thought it was worth mentioning.) 🚀🚀🚀\n\nAnyway, in the most recent file, it states that Melvin Capital is shorting 5,400,000 shares of GME for a value of $55,080,000. If we do some basic math, that means they shorted GME for $10.20 a share.  (I think that's what that means so please let me know)\n\nMost Recent File: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml\n\nThen if we look at the second most recent 13F Form, which came out on June 30th, 2020 we can see they claim to be shorting 3,400,000 shares of Gamestop at $14,756,000 of Value, which means they shorted GME for $4.34 a share.\n\nSecond Most Recent File: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820000859/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml\n\nThen if we look at the third most recent 13F Form, which came out on March 31st, 2020 we can see they claim to be shorting 2,800,000 shares of Gamestop at $9,800,000 of Value, which means they shorted GME for $3.50 a share.\n\nThird Most Recent File: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820000457/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml\n\nThen if we look at the fourth most recent 13F Form, which came out December 31st 2019, we can see they claim to be shorting 4,000,000 shares of GME at $24,320,000.00, which means they shorted GME for $6.08 a share.\n\nFourth Most Recent File: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820000211/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml\n\nNow, I could go through all of them, but I am way too lazy for that, but if these forms mean what I potentially believe (and who knows I may be wrong) that as long as the GME share price stays above $10 (or so) a share, then wouldn’t Melvin Capital have to buy back there shares at that price?\n\nSo in this retards opinion, I don’t believe Melvin Capital genuinely has any sort of possibility of getting the share price to less than $10 a share (when writing this, GME is currently at around $50 a share) These Short Ladder Attacks and other tactics to lower the price are (in my opinion) not to try and return the price to sub $10, but instead to lower it as low as possible so its the least damaging to there wallets when they have to cover the shorts.\n\nI’m really wondering whether or not I’m right on this, so please let me know if I’m mistaken on anything or if there’s any information I should look at, I would really appreciate it. 🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎🙌🏻💎", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "So you're saying the squeeze has been squoze", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "So the squeeze is over.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Fucking scammers can never give a straight answer .", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "It’s done.

Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).\n\nTHE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).\n\nThis industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto\n\nu/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: \"Zombie cars and QNX\n\nQNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.\n\nBlackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.\n\nFast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?\n\nSONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.\n\nYou might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\"\n\n3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing.

(Which blackberry has loads of perks if you work for them which tells me a very bullish sentiment about the company.

{"title": "A thread on pfizer", "selftext": " \n\nThe consensus here and in the market is that all the money to be made on Pfizer has been made. I disagree for a few reasons and am currently pumping money into this stock as much as I can. Before reading this, I want to state as clearly as possible I am not in any way a professional/financial advisor I am a 20-year-old mechanical engineering student the only proper education in this area is from yale open-source courses and from books like stocks for the long runs. I believe Pfizer will bottom out at a worst-case scenario of 32$ if I see 32$ I will yolo my portfolio into 3-month 40$ calls, but what I am hoping for is it does not recover until the next quarterly report in which case I will yolo my portfolio into five day or single day calls. Again, I cannot stress enough I am not a professional please do you own research before following me and also if u see a flaw in my theory please tell me. I also want to state that Pfizer has a market cap of 200 billion we do not have the buying power to in any way pump that I am not trying to generate hype around this, but it is 50% of my portfolio.\n\n1 investing fundamentals. \n\nOne of the most important ratios in investing is the price to earnings ratio. This fundamentally indicates if a stock is over or undervalued. In the book stocks for the long run which is high on yales economics reading list the author states that a p/e ratio of 16 or higher is overvalued currently the market average is 27 indicating a stock market crash is coming however Pfizer’s is currently twelve. As a dividend stock which it historically has been it would be undervalued based on pure economic theory. To give some examples of competitors p/e ratio Johnson Johnson=26 AstraZeneca= 26 moderna is not profitable. My point here is that Pfizer has one of the best prices to earnings ratio of any company on the market right now indicating it is undervalued. This also indicates in the event of a market crash Pfizer will be one of the best stocks to be holding.\n\n2 currently in a large dip that Pfizer always recover well from\n\nThe Pfizer share price has tanked in the last few weeks as wall street decided that spending 2-3 billion developing  the COVID-19 vaccine to save the world was too much money to spend (typical fucking scum of wall street). As a historically consistent  dividend paying stock Pfizer is a well-liked stock by hedge funds and pensions these funds do not reward bad quarters and pulled out this has caused the price to dip over 10%. In the last few years this happened before in July Pfizer announced that it was planning on changing its business model all these funds pulled out and the share price dropped 8 dollars, from this and the fact that it is fundamentally undervalued I believe it wont drop more than 8 dollars. \n\n3 the vaccine revenue will actually take Pfizer to the moon. \n\nFor all these hedge funds focusing on dividend stocks quarterly profit is all they care about Pfizer spent large and didn’t earn extra last quarter Pfizer is expecting at least 15 billion dollars in profit from the vaccine alone, when you add this to their typical earnings that is 65 billion expected earnings a 30% increase on their usual earnings , they will absolutely smash their last quarter performance, all the investing into the vaccine has been done now it is time for them to cash in. on top of this Pfizer has massively cut expenditure by splitting the company into two Pfizer and viatrus (I will address this at the end)\n\n4 AstraZeneca vaccine might not work.\n\nIt does not work on the Brazilian or south African strain. \n\n5 professional opinions \n\nEvery market pundit I can find is estimating that the share price hits 42 dollars this year, some estimating up to 69(nice) while I don’t always trust sources such as CNN money or market commentators in general what It is to me is a validation of my estimations and research. \n\n6 change in direction to become a growth company.\n\nLast year Pfizer announced they were changing their business model from a revenue to growth company meaning they offloaded essentially all non-patented drugs which provided consistent but low revenue this allows them to focus on developing new highly profitable drugs such as the COVID-19\\_\\_\\_0 vaccine while these have high start-up costs of 2-3 billion Pfizer is worth 200 billion and can easily ride out the volatility of 1/5 investments not working when for example the Pfizer vaccine will net them 15 billion minimum (could be more if AstraZeneca fail) that is not all the investment will makes the miRNA technology means they can make a new vaccine in 2 months if needed, this technology will be ridiculously profitable. Typically, investors buy into companies with a growth business plan at wildly overvalued prices e.g., tesla p/e is 1700 because the prospect of future growth outweighs the lack of current earnings Pfizer is a company aiming for huge growth who are also one of the most fundamentally undervalued stonks on the market. \n\nConclusion \n\nPfizer share price is wildly undervalued the market will not take long to correct this when it bounces back it might rocket to the moon and I am strapped in for that moment but even if it doesn’t it will get a 15% gain; I believe that the dip is turning now . my plan is to do this. \n\nA hold the shares I have buy 3 month calls with 40% of my remaining portfolio.\n\nB if I see 34 dollars put 10% of my remaining portfolio 3-month calls. \n\nC if I see 33 dollars put 30% of my remaining portfolio in 3-month calls. \n\nD if I then see 32 dollars yolo my life’s savings (10 times my portfolio) In 3-month calls. \n\nE if the share price is still below 40 dollars coming up to the next quarterly report, I will yolo in 5-day calls aiming for a 2 dollar gain per share (Pfizer has a huge market cap it will move slowly)\n\nThis is my opinion on Pfizer I am not in any way qualified to give financial advice  for honesty I am saying I have a position I Pfizer, but I do not believe it is conceivably possible for us to adjust the share price of a 200b dollar company .

SK        Innovation has denied the allegations.     \n\nThe commission's ruling threatens two new battery plants SKI is building        in Georgia to        supply Ford and VW        with batteries for models set to go into production in the next two        years. The Korean company has said it is investing $2.6 billion        on the project.     \n\nThe ruling also complicates efforts by the Biden administration to        supercharge domestic battery and electric vehicle construction.        Wednesday's ruling starts the clock on a 60-day review period for the White        House. Changes to the commission's rulings are rare but not        without precedent.     \n\nIf the White House declines to intervene, then SKI can appeal        the matter in federal court. Construction on the site will proceed, a        company spokesman said.     \n\nIn the ruling, the commission prohibited SKI from importing its        batteries for 10 years. However, the ruling allowed the company to        import equipment necessary to make batteries for Ford        and VW for four and        two years, respectively, to allow the auto makers time to find another        domestic battery supplier.     \n\nSKI said it has serious concerns about the commercial and operational        implications of the decision for the future of its facility and will        begin discussions with Ford        and VW. The company        also looks forward to engaging the Biden administration on the issue, it        said.     \n\nLG Chem said it was grateful to the International Trade        Commission for its decision.     \n\nBoth Ford and VW        told the commission last year that without the new factories, they'll        have to delay their electric-vehicle plans because the batteries are        uniquely built for the new models and there isn't enough U.S.        capacity otherwise to fulfill the companies' needs.     \n\nThe SKI complex is expected to supply batteries for a new plug-in        version of Ford's        bestselling F-150 pickup truck. Volkswagen planned to use the        SKI-built batteries for a new crossover, called the ID.4, which will go        on sale in the U.S.        and be among the first to use VW's        latest battery-electric technology.     \n\nA Ford spokeswoman said the        decision supports the company's plans to bring the F-150 to market in        2022, but she declined to comment further. VW        said it was analyzing the ruling and remained committed to starting U.S.        electric vehicle production in 2022.     \n\nThe legal clash between two of the world's largest battery makers        highlights the difficulties auto makers face in securing a steady supply        of batteries necessary to meet their growth targets in electric        vehicles. With tightening auto- emissions regulations and some parts of        the world moving to phase out gasoline-powered cars altogether, the        global auto industry is under pressure to sell more battery-powered        vehicles in the coming years or risk having to pay steep fines.     \n\nAuto makers are pouring billions into electrifying their lineups.        However, their plans depend in part on expanding battery production,        which executives and analysts say may fall short of the numbers needed        to power the growing numbers of electric vehicles they expect to be sold.     \n\nSome car companies are getting increasingly involved with making the        batteries themselves to lock in supplies, while others are leaning more        on traditional battery makers like SKI and LG        Chem to supply their models.     \n\nChina dominates the current battery-supply chain, and        building a domestic capacity has become a core policy goal for U.S.        and European governments and investors.     \n\nJennifer Granholm, President Biden's nominee        to run the Energy Department, highlighted during a        Congressional hearing on her nomination last month her intention to        build a domestic-battery industry. \"We can buy electric car batteries        from Asia, or we        can make them in America,\" Ms. Granholm said.     \n\nThe commission was required by statute to consider how its decision        would affect U.S.        consumers.     \n\nAfter the earlier judge's ruling in 2019, lawyers for Ford,        Volkswagen and some of their suppliers filed briefs appealing        for the commission to avoid sanctions that would prevent SKI from        fulfilling its agreements to supply the auto makers with batteries.     \n\nVW described the potential for a \"catastrophic supply disruption\"        that would harm its employees, suppliers and dealers, slow consumer        uptake of electric cars and hinder the growing U.S.        battery industry.     \n\nFord said an adverse ruling would \"drastically reduce already        limited \\[electric vehicle\\] battery supply\" while disadvantaging U.S.        auto makers in competing with more mature battery manufacturing regions        in Europe and Asia.     \n\nBoth models are expected to go into production in 2022: Ford        in Michigan,        and Volkswagen in Tennessee.     \n\nIn 2019 SK Innovation        broke ground in Georgia        on its new battery-making complex that includes two plants and would        employ around 2,600 workers by 2024 at full capacity. If it comes        online, the facility is expected to produce enough batteries for more        than 300,000 electric vehicles annually, the company has said.     \n\nBut shortly after construction began, LG        Chem filed a complaint with the commission, alleging SKI had        misappropriated trade secrets through a campaign of poaching LG        employees. The complaint asked the commission to block the import of        batteries that use technology at the heart of the trade-secret dispute        and the materials or equipment necessary to manufacture them. Such a        move would effectively prevent production at the Georgia        plants from coming online.     \n\nA year ago, the judge overseeing the case issued a default judgment in        LG's favor after finding SKI in contempt and saying it destroyed        documents that may have been relevant to the case. SKI admitted in        filings that some documents had been destroyed but said that South        Korean law doesn't require the same efforts to preserve evidence that U.S.        courts do.     \n\nPresidents have chosen to override the trade commission on occasion.     \n\nIn 2013, the Obama administration overruled an ITC decision that would        have banned Apple Inc. from importing certain iPhones and iPads after        finding they infringed on a patent held by Samsung Electronics Co.

{"title": "Why APHA is an Alpha Trade in the Short and Long-run (Actual DD)", "selftext": "Tl;dr: I'm willing to bet all of you degenerates smoke weed and drive to your wife's boyfriend's house every Saturday night. Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy's parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it's a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Reason 1:** Everyone's a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there's more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.\n\nRemember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we've ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed's finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I've seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.\n\nThis is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.\n\nThere will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.\n\n**Reason 2:** APHA's balance sheet is robust. Doesn't show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials)\n\nInstead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone's spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I've been to my local weed shop in CA and it's fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.\n\nEven though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA's largest expenses are \"unusual expenses,\" implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. \n\n**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.\n\nYup. Nixon's law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people's apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn't happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a \"tough on crime\" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it's not truly legal.\n\nPosition: 40 shares of APHA high as a motherfucking kite.", "id": "lgz3x2", "created_utc": 1612979060.0, "score": 688, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 259, "comments": [{"body": "1 APHA share = 0.83 TLRY once the merger closes.

Contrary to popular belief, not really.\n\nWhen there's a gap as such, there's always a good reason (else funds/other ppl would've closed it already).\n\nIn TLRY's case, it's peaking so high because it's apparently going through a short squeeze of sorts (or maybe it's not an actual squeeze but just pure hype of a squeeze, but nonetheless). Said \"squeeze\" will most likely end long before the merger, meaning TLRY prices will come crashing down to meet APHA's prices. So APHA prices won't go up proportionally since TLRY is not going to keep its current value. I genuinely have no clue if Weed stocks are in a bubble so I cannot say if APHA will be negatively affected when TLRY comes crashing down, but if you're in for the long term play (post merger) APHA will likely be more stable and safer to invest in for now.\n\nAs for selling TLRY, I don't know if TLRY is near its peak or if it still has room for a bigger squeeze, so IMO you decide what your risk tolerance is and sell when you feel the time is right. If you do decide to sell, either buy APHA if it's at a reasonable price, or wait to buy back in when TLRY comes crashing down, since TLRY crashing will likely affect APHA too.

As of Jan 29, that number is 87. They unloaded their stake in January, stop downvoting everything that doesn’t conform to your hivemind.\n\nEdit 2: Fidelity Investments = \\ = Fidelity Mutual Funds, and as such they have different investment strategies. But I see that has escaped the galaxy brains on this post.  \n\nEdit 3: People really coming thru and downvoting comments unrelated to gme because I posted a negative article about their messiah \n\nEdit 4: posting a link to an SEC file WHICH YOU CLEARLY DID NOT READ does not prove Fidelity did not sell. If you did a little actual thinking, you could go to the sec website and see that they in fact sell. Also the file you posted was not related to an internal transfer like you think. \n\nORIGINAL POST: \nDuring January, Fidelity Investments sold its entire stake in GameStop, amounting to 9.3 million shares or 13% of the company, for massive gains. As of January 29, they now own 87 shares. Last I checked, Fidelity is no more a friend to you or me than Melvin Capital. \n\nIt’s time to realize that this wasn’t wsb vs Wall st and move on with your lives. There was a massive short squeeze, with big money on either raise, and smart money cashed out at the top. Anyone who still has the stock isn’t ‘holding the line’, just the bag. \n\nThis sub turned into a cult. I want to see big plays and big ‘Guhs’, not a million posts about holding the line on a company that hasn’t turned a profit since 2018. This GME shit has ruined this sub, and I honestly think all these new users are going to be prime for pump and dump scams on random shit stocks, which really worries me in terms of this sub actually surviving. \n\nIf you invested at the top in GME, I am sorry foe you and sorry that you got caught up in the mania. But some free advice: the second you get emotional about investing, you’ve lost. If you invest more money than you can afford to lose, you’re not going to be able to think rationally or objectively about your investment, and will\nInevitably get plowed.

{"title": "The Real Deep Fucking Value – KT Corporation", "selftext": "Apparently we’re all saying this now, but I am not a financial advisor and you should do your own DD.  With that being said, I present you with the following:\n\n\nI’m a fan of DFV the man, but I’m more interested in really **really** deep fucking value.  This will likely be a long post, but I think you’ll find value in it if you can follow along (see what I did there?).  \n\n\nFor those of you kids who can’t read good, I’ll put the **TLDR** right here at the top:  KT Corp ($KT) is so undervalued it’s almost fucking embarrassing.   When I say undervalued, I don’t mean by a little bit… I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value.  At the time of my writing this, KT is trading at $10.62.  **A realistic price target, if the market were to properly value this company, is ~$30.00**  I’ll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story, but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $19.66/share.  What does that mean?  It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow, was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt, the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19.66/share.  This does not take into consideration intangible assets – which have real value (in the $BILLIONS), but are harder to assess.  Again, it’s trading at $10.62 as of this writing (a price/tangible book value of only 0.54).  Value investors typically look for stocks trading at <3.0 price/TBV.  Deep value would be <1.0.  KT is trading at 0.54, and a price/book ratio of 0.42!  \n\n\nShares are cheap, options are cheap.  Do what you will – hell, sell it short if you want – but I like shares and calls.\n\n\n**KT CORPORATE PROFILE**\n\nKT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom) is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 – but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form – with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia, Africa, USA & Poland.  KT is South Korea’s first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete:\n\n\n**Line of Business** | **% of Korean Market Share**\n:--|--:\nMobile Services | 31.4%\nFixed-line local telephone & VoIP | 64.9%\nBroadband Internet Access | 40.9%\nPay TV Services | 31.6%\n\n\nAs a conglomerate, KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots.\n\n**Products & Services** | **% of Total Revenue**\n:--|--:\nMobile Services (incl. 5G) | 27.3%\nFixed-line (incl. VoIP, broadband, data comm.) | 19.5%\nMedia & Content | 10.1%\nFinancial Services (incl. credit card solutions) | 14.6%\nOther (incl. IT, network services, real estate development) | 11.6%\nSale of goods (primarily mobile handsets) | 16.8%\n\n\nCorporate Location Map:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/syXIRxy.jpeg\n\n\nKT has ~30% institutional ownership, with BlackRock being a large buyer in Q4 2020.  KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program.  For what it’s worth in this day and age, the short % of shares outstanding is a measly 0.09%.  No one is going short on this thing at its current price.  You’d literally have to be insane to short it – it’d be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.  \n\n\n**FINANCIAL METRICS & PEER COMPARISONS**\n\nKT’s balance sheet is rock solid.  While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis, it is still growing and maybe more importantly, doing so profitably.  I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above, but this cannot be understated.  If you were to liquidate the company entirely, shareholders would receive $20-30 per share after the debt had been repaid.  I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT.  \n\n\nCompared to US-based telecom services index peers:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg\n\n\nUsing a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26.33 - $109.88 (unrealistic top end):\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0hYg7Zy.jpeg\n\n\nCompared to industry peers/comps:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg\n\n\nThe following comparison is really the tale of the tape.  When we look at tangible book value, we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value.  This is obvious, given the share price should exceed the liquidation value.  But we see the opposite being true for KT.  Again, **it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value.**  You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares, liquidate the company, and double your money.  This is what I mean by real **deep fucking value.**\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/vGaVp9b.jpeg\n\n\nNot that we put much weight in them around here, but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well, with median upside of 33%. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Buhxpqq.jpeg\n\n\nThey just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well:\n\nhttps://corp.kt.com/eng/attach/record/2020/KT%20ER%20PT%204Q20%20ENG_FIN.pdf\n\n\nI am long shares and 07/16/21 $15 calls.\n\nEveryone looks for the **TLDR** at the bottom (I put it at the top of the post), but here it is:\n\nMassively undervalued, $30/share realistic price target, it's trading at half of its tangible book value - meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares, liquidate the company's tangible assets, pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets.

They do seem to be largely done with their 5g transition as well with a few million subscribers. So a decent amount of that equipment must be at least relatively new and have some value. Also they apparently didnt use Huawei equipment on their 5G networks which would have dropped the value significantly. Their bonds listed by finra look good and are all trading at/slightly above par with investment grade rating and low rates. All their filings are in krw instead of usd and news on them is scarce, likely due to the language barrier. It seems like the main reason they might be trading at a discount is due to their location in a somewhat small and generally overlooked international market.

They also seem to be spending significant capital, about 3B USD, on new land, buildings, machinery and equipment. Based on their total capx over the last few years, they seem to be keeping up on maintenance, adding new equipment and accumulating depreciation at a reasonable rate. Considering the significantly smaller size of South Korea to the US, South Korea’s reputation for high speed internet, and the consistent capx on their equipment, I would not be at all surprised if their network had better maintenance and overall quality than any American carrier.

They want to shift away from being just a telecom.  The company is extremely diversified with holdings in real estate and finance for example.  They are unloading some of their holdings that are bringing down the balance sheet.  I believe KT Powertel was a recent sell.\n\nThe company is in an ongoing contract to buy back 300,000,000,000 won of its stock and to date they have fulfilled 69.1% of that obligation.  KT has even stated the possibility of disposing of some of those shares to reduce the number of outstanding shares.  \n\nThey are fully committed to dividend payments and the last time they did not pay a dividend was 2014.  At last years investor meeting there was talk about going to a bi annual dividend.  \n\nThe fact is the company is worth far more than it is trading at based on assets alone.  Their long term debt is conservative compared to most other corporations.  There aren't many companies I would want to be invested in if an economic collapse happens but this is one of them.

Other considerations:  telecoms' prices don't move very quickly.  Anyone who's held some money in T or VZ or even utility stocks can tell you as much.

Leading to paper hands screwing over everyone else. There are some big institutions who sold their GME positions at the peak, allowing shorts to close out positions at a major discount. These people are so retarded we should probably make them honorary mods. They made pennies compared to what they could have, but likely had no idea why $GME spiked so much and took the obvious route.

Best guess is around 1-2 years away. But that's basing on the rate of change of the dotcom bubble. It might be faster this time around because of how easy it is for anyone to trade.\n* The third catalyst that I think would make this tumble is covid restrictions being completely lifted, QE ends, money printers stop, and people stop pouring money into the market.

But the smart ape realizes when something has gone too mainstream and gets out of the way before the bulldozers wipe out his trees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey, I love shoving a share price around a bit as much as the next guy, I ain't gonna talk shit about that.  But it seems like nobody has an exit strategy for this, and I'm starting to see a lot of really stupid shit about Holding to 42.69 and all the other ridiculous bullshit from people who clearly don't even know what they fuck they've invested in that the GME Gibbons fell for.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Here's the reality of SNDL:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company was on the verge of bankruptcy around Thanksgiving, they have no other markets other than Canada, which is ridiculously oversaturated with weed to the point that wholesale prices are less than a dollar a gram.  And they recently got forced to admit that their product fails to meet THC content requirements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn case you're wondering what that means, it means they sell skunkweed that they cut with paper and sawdust to make it cheaper.  They sell garbage.  And everyone knows it - their brand is associated with low quality crap.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus, they actively solicited us to buy their stock to drive up the price, then diluted it to fuck with a billion share offering.  Now, to their credit, this not only enabled them to become debt free, but also up their marketing budget and spend some time trying to create a brand.  Don't get too excited, fucking Sam's Choice at Wal-Mart is a brand, too, doesn't mean you should stick a chub of their ground beef up your rectum.  By reason of them selling skunkweed, their margins lag well behind that of their competitors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLooking at their financials, they've got 615 million in cash laying around.  That's pretty good - except  they're a company that burns 250 million a quarter.  Which means they're going to dilute the fuck out of everyone again next month.  They've got no exposure to the US market, but had no problem dropping \"rumors\" that they were going to break in to the US market through licensing deals - which turned out to be 1 pot shop in Bellingham, Washington.  They have no real expansion plan anywhere in the world, for that matter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# B...bu.....bu.bu....BUT NRDRAGE!  Stonk go up !  Look at it!  SNDL to the moon!  🚀  🚀  🚀 ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, I know.  It's fucking crazy to talk shit about a stock when it's seemingly mid flight.  But here I am anyways.  Not to talk you out of the weed party - you should totally keep playing that for all it's worth - but rather to get people to see that they've probably outgrown skunkweed now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, the reason this thing mooned is because it was like a dollar.  Hell, it was 13 cents not too far back.  With a stock worth a dollar, it's easy to get a lot of other apes to throw a couple of bananas at it for the lulz.  It's easy to shove around a penny stock with an extra 10 bucks you have laying around from another trade somewhere.  But as the price goes up, so too goes up the perceived cost of entering.  I can make a strong (unassailable, in fact), argument that $APHA at $25 is cheaper than SNDL at 3.25.  But people are conditioned to like smaller numbers.  Unfortunately, as the GME Gibbons learned, eventually you run out of buyers, and then things go tits up real fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs the Prophet Biggie Smalls once said, Mo' Money Equals Mo' Problems.  We all know this equation to be true.  And here you are, sitting on bags of bananas you didn't know you were gonna have a week ago thanks to some stonk you hadn't heard of before yesterday.  You don't think you've got a problem, but you do.  Because those bags of bananas aren't edible until you turn them in to the bank for real cash.  If you're sitting on  bananas from the gold standard of the weed world (that would be, $TLRY), you're resting pretty easy that no other ape is gonna come by and steal your bananas.  There are gonna be lots of bananas to go around, and mostly we're just taking bananas from fools who think their bananas will be less later.  But you don't have that with SNDL.  All the bananas are currently sitting with people who think the bananas will go higher.  You can't all be right, especially when there are billions of bananas, and now your grandparents are starting to buy bananas because some Boomer on CNBC told them it would make their dick bigger and their friends think they were cooler.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Again, I'm not telling you to leave the party\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, if you recall your dorm room years, the best pizza you could afford was the Tony's school lunchroom style shit for a dollar.  Then you managed to  hide a few bucks from the people who collect your student loans, and you upgraded to Domino's.  Maybe by now you're ordering from a local joint that makes it's own dough in house and the sauce is made with the love of an old Italian grandma who accidentally dips her sagging tiddies into the pot 3 times while making it.  That just makes it taste better.  That's science.  But I digress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point is, you can get better weed now.  You don't have to smoke the skunk.  So before you get the rug pulled out from beneath you and are stuck investing in shitty penny stocks again, maybe you should elevate your enterprise.  Let's take a look at your options:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Canopy Growth\n\nYou could go with $CGC.  They not only sell higher quality weed, but are an established brand and also sell oils and shit to those hippie fucks who still think Burning Man isn't just a brogrammer beatfest and go to an acupuncturist to enhance their \"luck\".  They've captured that all important 65+ stoner demographic by marketing their shit as a cure for seizures, cataracts, and dry vag, so they've got a lot of revenue.  They've also had a much more muted rise this week because they just haven't been on everybody's lips, which means they've got a lot of room to run.  The downside here is they burn almost as much cash as SNDL, but they've also got more bullets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Aurora\n\nIf you go with $ACB, you're going with a company that's already gone through its \"shady as fuck\" stage and has re-emerged healthy from it.  You're also not only getting on weed, but the DIY urban chicken farmer types who want to grow their own weed.  They, too, have had a strong run, but have a lot more runway than most because they've actually got a really strong path to dominance in the US market once it opens up to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Organigram:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, if your dick is still getting hard at the thought of playing a low dollar stonk or you've only got 28 dollars to invest, you could do a lot worse.  They've got strong branding, large growth potential, a management structure that doesn't seem to act shady, and they've run almost as well as the other new generation of meme stonks, but lagged back enough because nobody can fucking rmeember their name to where they can rubber band a bit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Tilray and Aphria:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm combining these because they're inexorably joined at the hip (or should be, more on that later) because the two of them are merging.  For those who don't know, sometime in Q2, every share of $APHA you own will turn into .833 shares of $TLRY.  Even though APHA is the one buying out TLRY.    This is basically the gold standard of weed stonkery.  When you start investing in these, you know you're a real investor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's the interesting thing with these guys, though.  Even though APHIA should be just slightly trailing behind TLRY in terms of stock price, it's currently trading at less than half.  With TLRY sitting at 73 a share as I write this, APHA should be at just over $60.  But it's at 29.  Now, obviously, this means that TLRY has a lot more momentum, and some of that is due to the fact that there's a mini (don't flog me for using the word, but it's true) short squeeze going on with that one, which has turned it into such a strong momentum play.  But APHA, by virtue of actual math, needs to be within about 17% of TLRY's price.  Which means APHA either needs to moon dramatically, or TLRY needs to fall precipitously.  Now either of those things could happen, but the momentum of TLRY is hard to stop, which means it's more likely that APHA rubber bands to catch up to it in the coming months.  Even if TLRY does falter, that means APHA still has to come up a bit to meet it.  Making APHA kind of a \"can't go tits up\" situation.  TLRY also has the benefit of having enough market cap to where fund bois will buy into it, whereas SNDL is too small to meet most of their requirements.    Which can further propel TLRY (and thus, drag APHA with it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of the interesting things that's been happening with this pair is that the order books, even though they should mirror one another, have completely inverted from one another numerous times in the last couple of days.  This, of course, was a bull flag for TLRY every time it happened, leaving APHA to compensate to try and catch back up shortly thereafter.  It's really easy money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFundamentally, these guys have one HUUUUUUUGE advantage over the others:  They secured the UK distribution, and now have the inside track to be the supplier for the rest of the Europoors across the pond who need to smoke a bond to help forget all the things wrong with them.  And if you don't think they won't be able to leverage that to be the front runners out of the gate when the US opens for business, then you definitely ain't black.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Or, you can just stay where you are and do the  💎👐 thing\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsk the $GME Gibbons how well that worked out for them.  The ones still holding that stonk are like that one dude sitting at the edge of the bar of the Viper Room, still rocking his mullet and chain wallet, just convinced that Warrant and Slaughter are going to ring in the glory days of hair metal once more and that Queensryche is going to start selling out stadiums again.  It's just sad.  You're flying right now, but a rug is gonna get pulled out from under you and then you're gonna have your own daily thread where you reassure yourselves that it's gonna be OK and that you're gonna ride it to a thousand one day.  Lots of us (myself included) made a fuck ton of money on GME.  And we've made a fuck ton on SNDL and the rest of the Weedies this week.  But there are always people who Melvin it and hang on to their position too long and get stuck.  That's gonna be a lot of you, but you shouldn't let it be you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL:DR:  Smart apes should look at their much bigger pile of bananas from SNDL while you're way ahead and upgrade them to plantains before the other apes.  Plaintains equals breeding with better apes, not low quality apes that cannibalize fellow apes and give ape diseases.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll my love\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Chad Dickens\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 1:  I forgot to list my positions\n\nCGC - None\n\nACB - None\n\nOGI - 10,000 shares @ $4.23, 1000 1/22 5c, 500 2/19 7.5c\n\nTLRY:  20,000 shares @ 18.74, \n\nAPHA:  500 2/19 26c, 500 2/19 25c, 5000 7/16 30c\n\nSNDL:  Opted out today", "id": "lh6ttf", "created_utc": 1612998989.0, "score": 426, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 219, "comments": [{"body": "Poop", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "When is that supposed to happen?
