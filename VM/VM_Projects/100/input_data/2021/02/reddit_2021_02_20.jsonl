Keeping it short and simple (numbers based on current prices). \n\n[1\\) FSLY - Daily candles](https://preview.redd.it/8z7t8rceuoi61.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe254a26e4dc2ada21b9a095b097a621cef6f0a9)\n\n1) **FSLY** \\- Fell from 10 day high of about $120 to the $81 current price sitting very nicely on the 200 SMA and beyond below the 2SD Bollinger point. I believe that the counter is quite oversold and will be adopting a bullish strategy for this. \n\n* Trade: When market opens on Monday (taking into account how pre-market fares), would enter a Bull Put Spread at 70/65, 19 Mar DTE.\n* **Max Profit/Loss = $100/$400, ROI 25%.** \n* Probability of winning (generated by TOS, based on current prices) = 75%.\n\nWhy not do a Bull Call since I'm bullish? Well if I were to be wrong, I have some room for error (up to an $11 slide, 81-70).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2\\) AAPL - Daily candles](https://preview.redd.it/7r5nt3tnuoi61.png?width=835&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9651526c4a2e32ae75adc899b6dfb54eb6d4bb3)\n\n2) **AAPL** \\- Retraced from recent highs of $145 and now at the $129.7 level touching the lower 2 SD bollinger. \n\n* Trade: When market opens on Monday (taking into account how pre-market fares), would enter a Bull Call Spread at 135/130, 16 Apr DTE.\n* **Max Profit/Loss = $287/$213, ROI 135%.** \n* Probability of winning (generated by TOS, based on current prices) = 33%.\n\nWhy not do a bull put? Longer duration gives me better chances and well, I like the stock. Let me know what you think!\n\nDisclaimer:  this is **not** an **investment advice** and does **not** constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or **recommendation** of any **investment** product.", "id": "lofg7u", "created_utc": 1613851586.0, "score": 326, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 271, "comments": [{"body": "Like the AAPL play.

To be respectful, SPY is a ETF, and ETF’s are somewhat new to the markets in the since that many of them are just now enjoying stock splits to make their prices attractive to investors and institutional investors alike. You are right about SPY never having a stock split before but not for the reasons you stated. Yes, its an ETF for the S& P 500 but thats as far as it goes. Physical, still works and operates like a stock in every other way. An ETF reminds me in the way mutual funds operate, taking 10 of the best stocks in that sector to make one ETF. If you look this up, five ETF’s are having stock splits between Feb.1st through March 31st of this year as follows: HIBL 7 for 1, SOXL 15 for 1, TECL 10 for 1, FNGU 10 for 1, FNGS 4 for 1. Now if you noticed, none of them were below a 4 for 1 stock split and the highest was a 15 for 1 stock split. So SPY could be between a 4 for 1 and a 15 for 1. \n    I am betting that an announcement will happen some time this summer and that’s why all the contracts that I’ve been buying start in January 2022 and January 2023, bought none for this year at all and besides, options rise with the price of the stock either way, so I can’t go wrong with the way that I’m buying my contracts. \n   As to your second question, Ted. Since I’ve been doing this since my Wade Cook days in the early 1990’s, stock splits is the most predictable way to play the stock options for me instead of closing my eyes and picking a stock. Stock splits are indeed predictable and a great play for both short and long term investments. If you have enough faith to buy a stock, you should have the same faith for the options of that same stock too. After the stock split, I sell the options but keep the stock for a long term hold or use some later on to buy stocks and options for a new stock splits that maybe announced next week or next month. I hope this makes sense for you Ted. As I get older, I trade with a lot less risks.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’m being asked two different questions the best I can. Stocks and options split exactly the same. If a stock will enjoy a 5 for 1 stock split, so will the options.

The same week of the announcement of a stock split by a company, I buy “out of the money” options beyond the stock split ex-date. I don’t pay attention to “record dates”. By the time the ex-date rolls around, I’m already “at the money” and “in the money before or just after the stock split.

Thanks in advance.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "@Teddy. You asked why my strategy surrounds stock splits and let me see if you can understand this. A stock has its best growth leading up and just after a stock split. Only companies that are doing really well enjoy stock splits to begin with. Example, EXPI just had a 2 for 1 stock split last week and now its cheap enough to buy the stock and options for the next year when the stock will have its best long term growth. So stock splits have great benefits leading up to and just after a split. EXPI around $70 a share and will take off this week into the $80’s and low $90’s this week. I believe the resistance will be the $100 level but will shoot like a rocket beyond that, lol. So stock splits for me is a win-win at my age, I need all the short cuts and breaks I can get.

{"title": "This is why you pay attention to Red Days (because it's healthy to notice when market rotations occur) (Heat map of Friday, 02/19)", "selftext": "[Finviz heat map of market 02/19](https://imgur.com/VZAXcd7)\n\nStock indexes go red for a reason, and you should always be alert when it does. The market sell-off on Tuesday to Thursday was concentrated in recent high-growth stocks, across all market capitalizations. What I started to see on Thursday was a flight to value. What happened on Friday was a rotation of capital from pandemic stocks to small cap and mid cap stocks. \n\nOn Friday, as the Finviz heat map shows, we saw a sell-off in 2020's growth stocks (i.e. mega cap tech, health care and consumer defensive stocks).\n\nThe other thing the Finviz heat map shows is another move of capital into small caps and mid caps as investors take profits from large and mega caps that were pumped up by the pandemic and build more distributed portfolios. I.e. people are building new portfolios for 2021's that move away from pandemic stocks.\n\nThis is important information to pay attention to. Which is why, in my opinion, you don't ignore Red days, or complain about people you think are naive or inexperienced investors when they sit up and start asking questions or selling stocks they think have topped out to buy new stocks that they think are better going forward. \n\nIf you're not ready to take information that the Red days offer us, and update/rebalance your portfolio going forward based on that information, you're going to miss out on signals that the environment may be changing. And then you might get stuck in diminishing returns as the market moves in a different direction than the portfolio you're sitting in serves best. \n\nIMO, the action last week suggests people who are going to sit in a 2020-inspired pandemic portfolio for all of 2021 will probably see diminishing returns. \n\nThe rotations into small and mid caps, and also from mega cap growth to value, have been taking place from time to time since the November election, and it seems to be an accelerating trend. Last week also saw a big drop in gold prices at the same time as a stiff uptick in consumer interest rates, which indicates a move away from pandemic safe havens, into higher interest and higher yield investments. The selling of gold into a consumer interest rate hike also suggests the move to value investing in the latter half of last week isn't just noise, because gold is also a hedge against inflation and has tended to go up during times of climbing interest rates. \n\nSo everyone who is bashing Red day alarmists in threads where you talk about how you got big gains in 2020 for doing nothing but investing in Apple type stocks, buying in at the March bottom or riding SPY for 100% gains, if you're not updating your portfolio for 2021 right now, you're probably underperforming the market as these sector and market cap rotations occur. \n\nFor me, last week was the week where I disengaged from a lot of EV sector investments, leaving only a few percent of my portfolio in them. And I was ready to catch the small and mid cap industrial bounce on Friday, which was a big green day for me even tho the indices were flat. \n\nPersonally, I expect these trends to small cap, mid cap and value stocks to continue throughout the Spring and I expect the money for those gains will continue to come from the mega cap tech stocks and pandemic portfolio positions that people/institutional investors are are taking profits from. \n\nThe Red days raise alarms that something is happening and that something is sometimes a change in direction. So I see the rotation out of mega cap and large cap pandemic plays and into small cap, mid cap and value + growth stocks is a trend that is firming up. \n\nThat trend is probably going to become very significant by the end of the quarter, in March, when institutional and professional investors have to rebalance their portfolios across asset classes, take profits and cut bloated positions. The shift in interest rates and asset class rotations is a significant change in investing environment. If you're still sitting in passive index ETFs or pandemic stocks, you may want to start preparing for a rebalance, too. \n\nThere will probably be more Red days like this one, particularly toward the end of March. So for many who are still sitting in pandemic portfolios, you might have a Red March if you don't start revisiting your holdings in February.", "id": "lobfjy", "created_utc": 1613840688.0, "score": 647, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "You said the same thing 100x in a different way.", "score": 575, "replies": [{"body": "I thought I was having a stroke.", "score": 121, "replies": []}, {"body": "Now I don't feel guilty about skimming after reading the first few paragraphs", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "I know.

The drops I referred to occurred prior to Friday and Friday saw a rotation to small caps, with a rotation to value earlier in the week.\n\nI can put it in simpler terms: non-pandemic stocks have outperformed pandemic stocks since vaccinations began snd small caps have had twice the returns of large caps in the last 3 months.

Those stocks are usually too small for posting in this subreddit because they discourage stocks that are under $10-$20, and that makes sense because just a few hundred buyers piling in can create a pump and dump situation. So I can't really discuss my super small micro tech stocks here.\n\nI have put in a lot of work finding small caps and mid caps for my relative's dividend portfolio, and of those probably Flushing Financial (FFIC), which pays a 4.2% dividend is probably a safe but good recommendation. It's been solidly growing for months now, about 50% in the last 3 months, 20% since the start of the year. It's well rated on Wall Street, too. There are a lot of small cap financial stocks that are making good gains lately, tho, not just this one stock. So that's a sector/market cap combo that is worth a look, IMO. \n\nSmall caps take a lot of time and effort, because there are so many and their growth arcs can be uneven. In the past couple of weeks I've put in time looking for small cap & mid cap thematic ETFs that have strong growth, because there wasn't enough time in my day to research all the small caps even just in the tech sector. \n\nI like Jacobs Internet mutual fund, JAMFX (which has some large caps but a lot of small caps and mid caps), and is actually beating the ARK funds lately.  JAMFX pays a massive dividend with a year-end conversion of gains to dividend, so you see a big drop in the NAV at the end of December when this dividend pays out. A non-fixed income person might just reinvest the year-end dividend. JMCGX is Jacob's microcap tech mutual fund, but I haven't been able to buy it through Fidelity, for some reason. A thematic tech small-cap ETF I like is BFTR, the Blackrock Future Innovators ETF, kind of like Blackrock's version of an ARK fund but for small caps. \n\nBuffalo Small Cap Fund, BUSFX, is a general (i.e. not specialized in tech or something) small and mid cap mutual fund that also pays a high dividend and is beating the small cap indexes. It was up 2.3% on Friday, beating the Russell 2000 composite and Russell 1000 value indices. Like JAMFX, it will dump a big percentage of its NAV into a dividend payout in December, so the NAV always looks like it takes an 8% dive at the end of the year, but it's just issuing a dividend that can be reinvested. \n\nPSCE & PSCM are small cap energy & mining ETFs and they have been outperforming the large-cap versions of energy & mining ETFs lately. PSCE has had twice the gains that XLE has had in the past 3 months: PSCE has had 61% gains in 3 months and XLE has had 29% gains. For a while I was killing myself researching small cap energy and mining companies and finally just gave up and bought into PSCE & PSCM, although I do have a couple of individual energy and mining stocks in my growth portfolio. KBWR is a regional banking ETF full of mostly small caps that has done very well recently.\n\nEdit: Note that some of these small cap ETFs have low trading volumes and it takes a lot of patience to buy and sell.

It will also take a while to reach herd immunity so I can see further concentrated lockdowns going on for awhile as numbers ebb and flow. \n\nSo my question is that is it worth chasing these other sectors or is it better to buy stocks, calls, set up spreads on these tech companies which investors are currently fleeing since they will bounce back.

Sectors like energy and banking have already been run up if you check the charts. JPM and the other diversified banks are trading near all time highs as well. There are some pockets of value (XOM, wfc, ba) but from a sector perspective I’m not sure.\n\nI think that this is one reason why investors have turned to small cap stocks lately as there are still a lot of value plays there and more growth (because some small companies are poised to grow more than big companies). But these have also seen some runs up in value in the past few weeks and seem to be approaching a point where some investors are taking profits. I'm thinking that there might be a few weeks of rotation still left to the trend, but overall, the growth in small/mid caps should certainly slow down, IMO. Will it slow down as much as the large cap growth stocks tho?\n\nBut the fact that small/mid caps have seen a good run for the past 3 months and we're approaching the end of the quarter suggests the small caps will slow down going forward. Also, rising interest rates take a bite out of small caps more than large caps because small caps tend to need and have more borrowed money. So there are definitely rising risks associated with entering small/mid caps. So this is why, in my approach that I use for my own investing, going forward I plan to combine any further rotation into small/mid caps with sector rotation into those sectors that are seeing new investment right now and demand growth, instead of simply going for small/mid caps in general. So the hunt for value has more than one factor, beaten-down sectors due for investor inflows, and fundamental value as well as market cap.\n\nBecause of the risks of rising interest rates and inflation, I should also add low debt as a key thing to look for in my future stock picks going forward, especially small caps.\n\nThis is all my personal opinion as I am not a financial advisor or investment professional. I only invest for myself and immediate family. \n\n> 2. There have been no negative catalysts for amzn other than bezos stepping down. Even aapl and fb, besides the usual slew of bs lawsuits that won’t amount to anything. They surely benefited from the pandemic but recently have been unfairly hammered on their price for no real good reason. They’ve turned into solid values at these prices (esp amzn)\n\nI'm not going to invest in any of the pandemic stocks until we're out of the woods. Collectively they have still beaten the indexes in the past 3 months and some have done better than others. But they still can't beat what's been going on in small caps and some of these value stocks and beaten down sectors due for rebound in the last 3 months, in my opinion. \n\nI think they are great stocks for people who have to hold for a year or more due to capital gains taxes. I forgot to mention that my personal investing outlook is affected by the fact that I can do very short term investing in a tax advantaged account. There are a lot of reasons why my own personal investing ideas might not apply to a lot of other people, as your post illustrates. \n\n> 3. Assumption pandemic will be over with vaccine. I’m not so sure about this. There are good drops in the amount of people getting but we’re not sure how the other strains will respond to the vaccine. I think those drops are due to restrictions and people staying home due to weather.\n\nI think it's anyone's guess whether there will be more infectious disease problems with new SARS Cov-2 strains or even new viruses (like H5N8). I do think that the problem of lockdowns and coronavirus restrictions is alleviated because people who are most at risk and most concerned can get vaccinated. And with the mask mandates, people who are dangerously irresponsible in public are restrained. I feel that the rest of us can manage our risk as we see appropriate, so long as the issues of those two groups of people who were the greatest sources of risk (people who are most fearful of severe illness and people who are anti-maskers) are managed now. I don't see lockdowns and stiff coronavirus restrictions persisting past March or April. \n\n> So my question is that is it worth chasing these other sectors or is it better to buy stocks, calls, set up spreads on these tech companies which investors are currently fleeing since they will bounce back. I definitely agree with a lot of what you’re saying though I have xom, wfc leaps\n\nI'm not really chasing anything, in my own mind. I do think I'm learning a lot about the economy, these different sectors of the economy, how different industries work and connect together. So this is all a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity, in my mind, where investors can be rewarded for paying attention to these sectors as they come to life in a dramatic way, one after the other. \n\nI do think that if you're specialized in large tech stocks, and you have a finely tuned sense of how to write your options for a family of stocks, that it's an area of specialization skill that's valuable.

At first, it made no sense to me, because it seems so clearly irrational to assume you can perfectly time the market despite every piece of evidence - and just logic - telling you that you almost certainly cannot do so over any significant time interval. \n\nHowever, I will say that it's exciting to buy and sell often, especially in this bull market. It feels like you're ***making*** money in a way that unrealized gains sometimes can't/don't, just because the latter is simply a number on your screen with uncertainty, while the former involves taking a real profit. It also feels like you're doing something smart when you profit off of things in the short-term. So - it is obviously irrational, and I'm still surprised most retail investors on here don't care to acknowledge these facts, but the psychological explanation for why this happens is at least rather clear.\n\nBut as someone who also enjoys that level of engagement and excitement, here's what I would do to keep things fun and interesting without fooling myself into thinking I can time the market: keep at least 80% of my money in long-term holdings (not necessarily safe ones - I admittedly take an aggressive approach with growth stocks after careful DD involving lots of sell-side research reports and my own analysis), while using the other 20% for options. Now, on its face, this seems absurd - why would the person advocating for long-term, safe investing advocate for 20% in options? Because LEAPs, 6+ month ITM or ATM calls, and even selling OTM puts allows you to increase your possible returns using less capital up-front. Obviously, the trade-off is more risk, but I personally love this strategy.\n\nSay I have $10,000 to invest. If I put all of that money into 10 different stocks, then besides perhaps my paychecks, I'm not going to have any fun, nor will I be able to chase any new ideas, unless I want to be the (wrong) retail trader who just buys and sells every time a new idea comes around, losing out on the power of the market by trying to time it over and over. If you keep $2,000 for options, while keeping the $8,000 invested, you can buy ITM calls that, roughly, allow you to achieve 80-90% of the same gains as the underlying equity with only 40-50% of the capital invested. LEAPs are even better for this, because with OTM LEAPs, although your risk is far higher, the amount of capital you need to put in is extremely low compared to the reward. Basically, instead of essentially playing with large portions of your account by convincing yourself it's a good idea to trade often, just acknowledge that as a casual retail investor, you likely will lose more money the more often you trade, and keep the vast majority of your money invested for the long-term, barring any changes in the company or ETF that you are uncomfortable with. But with the 10-20%, knock yourself out with options, but not options that'll \"get you rich quick\" like on /r/wallstreetbets \\- instead, with options like LEAPs, especially deep ITM calls, where your time horizon is still long-term enough that you're not just gambling (multiple months out, ideally 6+ months from expiration) but the inherent risk allows you to control more of the underlying equity than you would be able to otherwise, allowing you to invest in comparably more companies or ideas because you need less capital in order to do so.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just because it’s difficult to do doesn’t mean it’s not a viable solution.

Which is a great deal. Today $STPK trades at $47.30 which carries a $2.54 billion valuation. Here’s my issue, to date they report they’ve only sold 900 software integrated energy storage solution systems. That is.... not a lot to say the least.

The McRib’s unique aspects and impermanence, many of us believe, make it seem a likely candidate for being a sort of arbitrage strategy on McDonald’s part. Calling a fast food sandwich an arbitrage strategy is perhaps a bit of a reach — but consider how massive the chain’s market influence is, and it becomes a bit more reasonable.\n\nArbitrage is a risk-free way of making money by exploiting the difference between the price of a given good on two different markets — it’s the proverbial free lunch you were told doesn’t exist. In this equation, the undervalued good in question is hog meat, and McDonald’s exploits the value differential between pork’s cash price on the commodities market and in the Quick-Service Restaurant market. If you ignore the fact that this is, by definition, not arbitrage because the McRib is a value-added product, and that there is risk all over the place, this can lead to some interesting conclusions. (If you don’t want to do something so reckless, then stop here.)\n\nThe theory that the McRib’s elusiveness is a direct result of the vagaries of the cash price for hog meat in the States is simple: in this thinking, the product is only introduced when pork prices are low enough to ensure McDonald’s can turn a profit on the product. The theory is especially convincing given the McRib’s status as the only non-breakfast fast food pork item: why wouldn’t there be a pork sandwich in every chain, if it were profitable?\n\nFast food involves both hideously violent economies of scale and sad, sad end users who volunteer to be taken advantage of. What makes the McRib different from this everyday horror is that a) McDonald’s is huge to the point that it’s more useful to think of it as a company trading in commodities than it is to think of it as a chain of restaurants b) it is made of pork, which makes it a unique product in the QSR world and c) it is only available sometimes, but refuses to go away entirely.\n\nIf you can demonstrate that McDonald’s only introduces the sandwich when pork prices are lower than usual, then you’re but a couple logical steps from concluding that McDonald’s is essentially exploiting a market imbalance between what normal food producers are willing to pay for hog meat at certain times of the year, and what Americans are willing to pay for it once it is processed, molded into illogically anatomical shapes, and slathered in HFCS-rich BBQ sauce.\n\nThe McRib was, at least in part, born out of the brute force that McDonald’s is capable of exerting on commodities markets. According to this history of the sandwich, Chef Arend created the McRib because McDonald’s simply could not find enough chickens to turn into the McNuggets for which their franchises were clamoring. Chef Arend invented something so popular that his employer could not even find the raw materials to produce it, because it was so popular. “There wasn’t a system to supply enough chicken,” he told Maxim. Well, Chef Arend had recently been to the Carolinas, and was so inspired by the pulled pork barbecue in the Low Country that he decided to create a pork sandwich for McDonald’s to placate the frustrated franchisees.\n\nBut the McRib might not have existed were it not for McDonald’s stunning efficiency at turning animals into products you want to buy”\n\nhttps://www.theawl.com/2011/11/a-conspiracy-of-hogs-the-mcrib-as-arbitrage/", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "it's been pointed out that when a tesla needs to heat itself up for weather reasons, it could do so by mining coins. something like autobidder could be keeping track of which coins are the most profitable at any given time. similarly we have assumed that the tesla hvac system will be a heat pump like the octovalve, but it would be possible to integrate home heating and mining. a million teslas are a pool large enough to take the chance element out of mining; it would pay a predictable, if low, amount. there are other projects for unused cycles besides mining; there's SETI or protein folding or running apps for the cloud like amazon does.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If they could just set up a system that does this and splits the coins with owners that would be rad.

I aim for about half muni bonds and half treasury bonds but I'm a bit light on my treasury allocation at the moment due to the low rates.  It's low stress, almost zero mental effort.  I know I will take an occasional large loss.  The gamma risk when the market is volatile can take a while to get used to, but I've found I like it more than the vega risk of longer duration options.  I would have had 2 losses last year (I tweaked my strategy at the start of last year and had more losses in reality).  My loss in the March drop would have been about $40k, so a few months of returns gone in 1 or 2 days.  I think I had 1 loss in 2019 and 3 or 4 in 2018 due to the drops in Feb, Oct and Dec.  You lose when iv is low and then there's a sudden large drop because the 5 delta strike isn't far enough out of the money.  The only management technique is to never roll a losing trade due to the leverage.  If you roll with leverage that's when a sustained market drop can destroy you.  I've looked at rolling losing trades to an itm strike that would let me break even without leverage (or just buy /ES futures at 1x leverage until I make back the loss).  That does work, but it vastly increases portfolio volatility, only makes sense when selling higher delta puts which also increases volatility, and comes out to about the same overall return.  It also only works when the market bounces back.  My goal is to make around 10%+ a year with low volatility of returns.  I've made more than that rate at the start of this year because IV has been pretty high.  I plan to reduce my leverage once I retire to cut back on tail risk a bit, but currently I could just work an extra year and make back any unusually large losses, so my W2 income potential is kind of back stopping this strategy to some extent letting me take a bit more tail risk than I might otherwise be comfortable with.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Wow.

I hope that some of this information is new and that it can help to educate, de-stigmatize, and send a bunch of autists to the moon, mars, and beyond. I am by no means a financial advisor and am a novice investor that made some very impulsive choices around the end of January… Ive been learning a tonne about this world and am very excited to participate!\n\nI’ll begin by talking about what’s happening where I am, Victoria BC. I associated with a number of friends that are licensed therapists who have taken risks that are easy to quantify when they consider the efficacy of treatments with MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin, 5-MeO-DMT, kambo, bufo, ayahuasca, and a number of other lesser know research chemicals. From what I hear this is happening throughout out North America and Europe. These professionals are very busy with this new treatment model. With stigma dissolving along side a massive mental health and opioid epidemics, change is coming. Last year a non-profit in Victoria was granted permission to treat 5 patients suffering from end of life anxiety. This happened with a welcome shock and the accounts of those 5 peoples experiences have made some big news. It came without extensive testing in Canada and relied on research from elsewhere. This year regular treatments for depression are happening and the conversation will be in both the Canadian and America governments. Already in the us Oregon has taken big steps and there are a string on states and cities following suit. California, Florida, Virginia, Colorado, and others are taking steps.

This is a survey study. A questionaire online of people of what they think microdosing does.\n\nThat's also why it says \n\n> Our results suggest the **perceived** benefits associated with microdosing greatly outweigh the challenges. Microdosing may have utility for a variety of uses while having minimal side effects. **Double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments are required to substantiate these reports.**\n\n.\n\n> https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095539591930307X\n\n\n\nThat is a survey study again.

Ironically of reddit users.\n\n\nAll three studies you linked are not about the effects of microdosing. They are about what people who take them think the effects are/their motivation.\n\nYou could just aswell have survey studies with people who take homeopathic stuff. Results would be, that they take it because they think it improves their health. That however says nothing about the question if it actually helps or not.\n\nThats also why the article you linked says\n\n> The big problem with people using microdoses in a natural situation is that they go in with very strong expectations… [Placebo-controlled trials] are the only way you can really see whether any of these claims are true,\n\nIt also is ironic: The article mentions one of the few double blind placebo controlled trials. But for some reason doesn't talk about the results. Why?\n\nSource: bershad et al. 2019: Acute Subjective and Behavioral Effects of Microdoses of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide in Healthy Human Volunteers\n\n\n> The drug did not significantly affect Elation, Depression, Anger,\nFatigue, and Confusion subscales. [...] Although we found that LSD marginally increased the number of attempted trials on a measure of creativity, overall we detected minimal effects on cognitive function.\n\n\nThe psychedelic mental health revolution started years ago. Yet, last year february we only had 4 scientific articles on microdosing according to this literature review\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364961/\n\nThis is also why it doesn't matter that MMED is researching in that direction. It is like saying the research on psilocybin for Fibromyalgia is one of the tenets of the revolution because TRYP is researching in that direction. MMED is researching  in all kinds of directions, including basically candyflipping for mental health.\n\nOr to make it even more clear: There is not a single experimental study currently finished which explored microdosing for mental health issues. Afaik, we only have one double blind placebo controlled study which I quoted above, one robust study on time perception while micro dosing and one open label study.\n\nThe research on microdosing just started and is currently going on. But we do not even have phase 1a studies on it. That is also why it is wrong to call it a huge part of the mental health revolution. We have no idea if it actually helps.\n\nWhat kickstarted the revolution are partly the studies after 2008-2011, especially the studies of psilocybin for end of life anxiety and depression with cancer patients.\n\nHere is a short overview at the bottom for studies on psilocybin.\n\nhttps://compasspathways.com/our-research/psilocybin-therapy/about-psilocybin-therapy/#from-subnav\n\n\nAround 2010 also the studies on MDMA for PTSD started. https://maps.org/research-archive/mdma/ptsdpaper.pdf\n\n2013-2015 various ones begun. Around 2015 the studies on ketamine also started IIRC, could be earlier. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25271445/\n\n\n\nSince 2011 we had atleast 8 studies on psilocybin/LSD for various conditions. And of that several were double blind placebo/wait list controlled studies. We have several on MDMA, and several on Ketamine. And zero for microdosing for mental health. Or 1 general on microdosing that found no improvements\n\nSumming up: What lead to and is leading the psychedelic mental health revolution were the studies on MDMA, Ketamine and LSD/Psilocybin macrodosing that started around 2010 (not exactly). All of this was of course supported by the cannabis changes.\n\nThats also why ketamine is already legally used, MDMA already [finished](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03537014) their phase 3 trials afaik and psilocybin is supposed to finish it's phase 2b studies this year.\n\nMicrodosing is a huge trend in the laypeople population, but on the scientific side of this it is not. This may change if placebo controlled double blind studies actually find effects. But currently, for microdosing the groundwork is still being laid, while for macrodoses this happened more than 5 years ago and we are currently having atleast 2 big studies I know of going on for psilocybin with 90-130 participants each, MDMA being nearly finished and ketamine already being legal.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "So much is wrong with your post I honestly don’t even know where to start. 🤦‍♂️", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Lol nope", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not convinced", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Most people who are convinced have taken a couple grams of shroom at some point.

{"title": "Interplay of Relationships between Goldman Sachs, Robinhood, Melvin, Gee Em Ee and DTCC", "selftext": "**TLDR: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are Melvin's main Prime Brokers. All three firms privately own and sit on the board of the DTCC. If naked shorting occurred in GME, there's good reason to believe the three named prime brokers and the DTCC may have shut down 1/28 for nefarious reasons beyond the sudden and potentially arbitrary \"collateral requirements\" stated**\n\nIf you’ve read my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lma1ev/illegal_tactics_and_dtccprime_broker_complicity/), I hypothesize that if naked shorting is present in GME, prime brokers and the DTCC (which is privately owned by the prime brokers) would need to be complicit in it, which adds another dimension to whether the retail shutdown 1/28 to stop the squeeze was done for nefarious reasons.\n\nOn the question of whether DTCC was right to shut down trading on 1/28 based on collateral requirements, I'm not an expert on this subject but I've seen many compelling arguments against it, including how did they arrive at the 3 billion number for Robinhood and why were they able to get negotiated from 3 billion to 700 million (per following DTCC's special requirements) and why was cash customers restricted vs just margin? And why was selling allowed but not buying, why not shut off both? Another interest point is that the DTCC has often been implicated and accused of enabling naked short selling over the years and that the DTCC is privately owned by Prime Brokers/Banks.\n\nOne question posed to me by a reporter was “who are the prime brokers involved”? So I decided to do some digging and found this disclosure form [https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf) which shows that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are Melvin Capital’s three largest prime brokers (based on assets held under custodianship). All three firms own and sit on the board of DTCC [https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board). (Note that National Financial Services (Fidelity) is also a prime broker they use but only 6 million in assets under custodianship as compared to a 1.16 billion each for Goldman Sach and Morgan Stanley, and 265 million for JP Morgan at the time of the disclosure snapshot (03/2020).) I found this to be an interesting data point and wanted to share with the board.\n\nNote, the same Goldman Sachs that has been repeatedly implicated in naked shorting cases (Source: [https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html)) and given nothing but slap on the wrists for enforcement.\n\nAnother interesting datapoint is that Goldman was chosen as the firm to take Robinhood public [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSKBN28I328](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSKBN28I328), so alongside with the Robinhood Citadel relationship (As it relates to selling order flow and RH making making 40%+ of their total revenue from it) there’s also a relationship between Robinhood and Goldman Sachs, who they would do well to have on their good side ahead of the IPO.\n\nThe thesis of whether there were more nefarious reasons to the 1/28 shut down (which short squeeze was set to occur, and when Interactive Brokers CEO projected price would’ve been in the thousands [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today\\_interactive\\_brokers\\_ceo\\_admits\\_that\\_without/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today_interactive_brokers_ceo_admits_that_without/)) is tied to whether or not naked shorting occurred in GME, because if it did then the Prime Brokers involved and DTCC would likely have been complicit, they would likely be holding the bag if a short squeeze did occur as well as blow back for allowing naked shorting.\n\nAs long documented by counterfeitingstock.com, “the short hedge funds, **the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)**—make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated… The counterfeiting of shares is **done by participating prime brokers or the DTC, which is owned by the prime brokers**. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including **Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting**… Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is **carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC** and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail. The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. (Source: [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html))\n\nAn economist who worked in operations at the DTC, Susanne Trimbath, even came out in this [explosive article](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/) and directly blew the whistle on naked shorting being allowed to happen within the DTCC, I highly recommend you read the full article. Just to highlight one part of it, Timbath says “The Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 specifically gave the clearing house the right to require that shares and securities be delivered for settlement. It allows them to punish those who don‘t deliver by refusing to have them in the system… The DTCC has for years ignored that… The 2007 Reg SHO amendment says you cannot short again without borrowing: but only DTCC and SEC know who failed to deliver, so how is that functional?” (Source: [https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/)),\n\nIn laying out the case of whether naked shorting exists in GameStop, the nature of naked shorting means it's not easy to prove. There have been hundreds of lawsuits for naked shorting that are often settled out of court because it's difficult to prove. If you’re an investor in the trade you’ve probably noticed that in the past three weeks GME has had a lot of strange things happen to the stock, including seeing a precipitous drop in price starting 2/1 and onwards while short interest supposedly dropped. These things all make sense if you consider naked shorting occurred. In the case of GameStop there are several very strong signs/indicators that naked shorting has occurred.\n\n**I will list some of the indicators that Naked Shorting occurred in GameStop below:**\n\n1. One indicator is GME's extremely high number of Fail to Delivers ([www.wherearetheshares.com](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)), which are one of the top in the stock market over a sustained period of time. The website [www.wherearetheshares.com](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/) shows extraordinarily high FTIDs extending from 2020 to years back. Michael Burry tweeted that in May 2020 when he lent out his GME, it took weeks for his brokers to locate the shares [https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en). FTIDs can happen for a number of reasons, but to have this high number of FTIDs over a sustained period of time is highly unusual, and a stock with a high number of FTIDs is one potential indicator that counterfeit shares are in circulation and naked shorting occured.\n2. Short Interest in GME has been extremely high at numbers significantly over 100% of float. As of January 15th short interest was 226% ([https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl](https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl)) of the entire float. While it is theoretically possible for short interest to be over 100% with brokers repeatedly leading to each other, short interest this high at 226% of the total float is highly unusual and an indicator of naked shorting occured, which is a far more feasible scenario because naked shorting enables short interest to rise quickly as you do not need to determine the shares exist before you short.\n3. Institutions alone have held a staggering 177% of float as of 1/31 according to Bloomberg Terminal [https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png) which is highly unusual and could be a strong sign that GME is rampant with counterfeit shares. Another interesting datapoint is Fidelity's calculation of retail ownership is only 0.1% float ([https://imgur.com/a/FtSOiCW](https://imgur.com/a/FtSOiCW)) which is highly unusual and unlikely to be true -- any potential indications that counterfeit shares are in play because number of shares to ownership potentially cannot be conclusively determined\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that there seemed to be surprisingly strong price resistance throughout the week of January 25th despite strong buy pressure that saw 100% increases from 26th to 28th, with 28th being the day the short squeeze was likely going to happen (given the price momentum on that day). The squeeze was prevented on Thursday 28th due to market shutdown. On Friday 29th the price was surprisingly resistant and there was a price battle that ended at 320, which supposedly would force options to expire and purchase within the next two business days (with the anticipation of buy pressure from these options expiring)\n\nThen on Monday 2/1 there was a momentous price drop, and that drop continued through the week. Given the continued high short interest and retail interest to force shorts into a short squeeze, the price drop made little sense, especially because short interest remained high and even if shorts had covered there should've been an upward price pressure. What makes the most sense to me is that the price drop was facilitated by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares in a short down ladder, described below:\n\n*\"Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit... By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of “strategic fails-to-deliver” and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand\" (Source:* [*http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html*](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)*)*\n\nIn an ordinary scenario with short interest dropping and shorts needing to buy back to cover the price is anticipated to go up. As of 2/1 with GME's reported short interest declining with price also dropping, there are signs pointing to shorts artificially covering or lowering their short interest via the generation of synthetic longs using options to cover, which is in regulation of Reg-SHO -- this assertion is supported by the high numbers of FTIDs GME has consistently reported.\n\nAnd on a wider, the indicators that naked shorting occur lay in the clues of consistently high FTIDs (one of highest in the stock market over period of years), indications that far more GME stock exist then should exist (Bloomberg terminal showing 177% institutional ownership of float), the excessively high (over 200%I) short interest numbers and odd and continued price drops from 2/1 onwards particularly (which were in my opinion a result of short down ladder attacks done with the aid of counterfeit/synthetic shares, amplified with panic selling once price fell past a certain threshold)\n\n**Many are aware of the recent findings of shorts using ETFs holding GME to hide FTIDs, which also adds to the argument of naked shorting, I will recap it here to be complete:**\n\nAnother interesting trend noticed with GME is that there have been efforts to try and hide/temporarily cover the FTIDs in GameStop. It was identified that certain ETFs that hold GME like XRT went down as GME price spiked. XRT went on the FTID threshold list on 1/29 and has remained there until this day, while this is also the same day that shorts supposedly covered most of their short positions and GME's price spike started to drop, which lends credence to the theory that shorts used the GME shares from XRT to artificially cover their failed short positions so GME would come off the threshold list and to give the impression the short squeeze case was over. If you look at XRT it is now 180% shorted. As explained by [/u/meta-cognizant](https://www.reddit.com/u/meta-cognizant/), “This is a form of naked shorting GME through XRT. Naked shorting ETFs is generally acceptable due to arbitrage, but if one goes long on the remainder of the holdings (not many in XRT), one can naked short GME without doing any arbitrage on the ETF. This, when coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be, and provides the ability to naked short GME again.” (source: [*https://i.imgur.com/9roWGHT.png*](https://i.imgur.com/9roWGHT.png)*,* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lknjkc/xrt\\_is\\_being\\_used\\_to\\_hide\\_gme\\_shorts\\_xrt/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lknjkc/xrt_is_being_used_to_hide_gme_shorts_xrt/)*)*", "id": "lohyug", "created_utc": 1613858890.0, "score": 1121, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "TL;DR - buy puts on Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan.

{"title": "ARKK gamma squeeze, low IV and premium. Cathie has potentially set herself up for a major correction after the last massive years run.", "selftext": "Alright BEAR with me kids as this is a lot to read(TLDR: buy ARKK puts) but as Jay Z told Rick Rubin, ‘You crazy for this one!’. I think I found a bubble within a bubble thats easier to gain on with the right catalyst.\n\nGamma squeezing ARKK is no simple task but the IV and premiums on the ETF are prime for some major tendies. I'm still building up the idea but I don't know if it's possible just due to the 'aunt Cathie' crowd. However, I decided to start a position on Friday and take one for the team.\n\nLooking through ARKK weight on their top holds for the ETF, especially CRSP, PSTG, and NVTA could setup for major drop on certain tickers. \n\nCRSP they own 8.58% of open float and its 3.17% of their ETF\nShort float is 4.60%\n\nPSTG they own 7.86% of open float and its 2.04% of their ETF\nShort float is 6.3%\n\nNVTA they own 9.08% of open float and its 3.09% of their ETF\nShort float is  16.26%\n\nOther tickers that they own way to much of the float are PRLB(11.53%),IOVA(7.67%), TWST(6.80%), NTLA(10.90%), TWOU(11.65%), PD(9.37%), MTLS(10.75%), EDIT(10.62%), VCYT(7.23%), IRDM(5.49%), SSYS(12.05%), MCRB(9.54%), CERS(11.35%), CGEN(11.96%), SYRS(10.95%)\n\nLarge cap equities that stick out to me as a potential issue to front load their ETF on a pullback are TSLA, ROKU, SQ, TDOC, BIDU, SPOT, and Z where the current percentage of these equities in their ETF makes up 36.75% of their weight. I know they maintain the average weight of TSLA from 8-12% depending on the price action in order to maintain an average of 10% of the total ETF.\n\nThough I'm not overly concerned with the weight of any major equity within their ETF, I am a bit concerned with the weight of the overall open float for many of their holdings. With a small correction in the tech and bio bubble they will definitely be the front runner in dumping.\n\nThe reason I am looking at ARKK in anticipation of a correction is that the IV and premium of puts is insanely low in comparison to the individual equities. It's hard to bet against ARKK since its cult like, but this is staying on my radar\n\nI put together a table of the current shares on Friday close for ARKK that includes ARKK % of the float that they currently hold for the individual equity in their ETF and I highlight a few other key components such as Previous day average range, short float %, and ARKK current weight for each equity within their ETF.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/vuqB1gN\nhttps://imgur.com/vuqB1gN\n\nHere are some pretty options strategies that show how Green this correction can be with a huge IV spike\n\nCurrent IV\nhttps://optionstrat.com/9Ok2M2FpsL\n\nIV with a gamma squeeze to 110%\nhttps://optionstrat.com/LDOIMJKUOw", "id": "lojy2s", "created_utc": 1613864804.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 167, "comments": [{"body": "You understand that arkk is actively managed?
