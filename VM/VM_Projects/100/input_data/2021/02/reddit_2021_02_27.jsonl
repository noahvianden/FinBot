But millennials don’t have large amounts of capital, and cost of living and/or housing has skyrocketed while wages have remained relatively stagnant.  Therefore millennials are willing to be far riskier with less capital on the chance they can get enough wealth to perhaps invest like Buffet.

{"title": "I am bullish about the future", "selftext": "People seem to think because we had 2 big crash close together in 2000 and 2008, we are bound to have one soon.\n\n\nI want to remind people before the year 2000, we had a 20 years bullish run. Its totally not impossible we get to 2030 with no crash, especially now that the feds baby sit the market.\n\n\nSecondly, we have extremely nice upcoming market conditions. Stimulus checks will either get people to spend money to stimulate the economy, or get them to invest, both will help the stock market. The media is somehow trying to make us believe this is bad, but i think its just bullshit. Inflation has been ultra low for way too long, and feds actually want it to increase. They said many times they won't increase rates before 2023.\n\n\nThirdly, i also think we have more upcomming money sources coming into the market than ever. People from other countries invest in US stock market. With all the GME hype, more people than ever are joining in. Again media trying to twist this to say its \"bad\", but obviously it isn't bad.\n\n\nAnother point is, crashes usually happen for a reason, its not random. You can google any of past market crash and find the exact reason it happened. None of these factors are happening right now.\n\n\nAnother point is, there is a key difference between today and 2000. In 2000, the overvalued .com companies which had PE ratios of 200.... were literally worth nothing! These companies had never made a single profit! Once people realized they invested massively in a .com web site worth jackshit... they sold it obviously. They had no reason to hold their shares.\n\n\nNow check this image about Nasdaq's PE Ratios: https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150305131443-nasdaq-pe-780x439.jpg\n\n\nObviously, you can see the 2000's pe ratios were stupid. This graph is from 2015 when it was at 31.7. What is it today? Nasdaq PE ratio as of February 25, 2021 is 38.5!!!!  5x lower than the 2000s. https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NDAQ/nasdaq/pe-ratio\n\n\nIts irrelevant if the big hedge funds remove their money from apple and want to scare you into selling your shares. Apple is a massive amazing company that is really worth a lot, and they do make tons of profits. Its not comparable in any ways to the dot com bubble. If other people are stupid and sell their shares, SO WHAT? You will just be able to buy into this amazing company for cheaper.\n\n\n\nSo hold your shares and stop worrying about a 2000 level crash, its not happening.\n\n\nA correction? Maybe. But who cares, this just slows us down a little. Corrections are healthy and help us avoid a real crash.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you for the award! :D\n\n\nEDIT2: Corrected the PE ratio for nasdaq", "id": "ltf3iq", "created_utc": 1614396223.0, "score": 2761, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 832, "comments": [{"body": "I think what the OP intent to say is that a prolonged bear market isn’t likely to happen soon - as for market crash, by definition we’ve already had one last feb-march where S&P dropped about ~30%. \n\nAre corrections/pull backs/retrace or whatever you wana call them going to happen? Absolutely yes & likely on a monthly basis (to various degrees). Are we going to suddenly experience another ~25-30% crash in S&P? For that to happen it needs some sort of catastrophic event (which let’s all pray won’t happen), rather than just fear of overvaluation. \n\nAre we going to suddenly enter a bear market of prolonged declining asset prices across the board? My guess would be is even less likely due \n\na) unprecedented fiscal support and QE programs that most central banks across developed economies have committed\n\nb) record high level of average household savings and pent up demand for consumption due to COVID\n\nc) many business sectors (whether is tech, airlines or energy) have learned to become more efficient and leaner during the pandemic, which will likely result in an increased productivity rate and more effective use of their capital - two factors critical for future growth. \n\nd) lastly, crashes and bear markets are likely to happen when everyone is LEAST expecting them. With the Covid crash and even 08 crisis still fresh in the minds of many investors, you can see that we’ve already experienced multiple sell offs due to valuation concerns, I think this is a sign that many participants are fearful of an overheated market, which ironically isn’t a typical sign of an imminent crash. \n\nThere are many more reasons I can think of that will support the thesis for a prolonged bull market rather than a bear one.

Macy's, for example, was facing serious solvency issues before covid, and was on track to declare bankruptcy in a few years. Covid obviously fast tracked that, but most of these weren't healthy before. Exxon Mobil is a company I'm actually bullish on, but was loaded to the gills with debt before all of this, and warranted concern from shareholders. And even if covid caused a lot of this, some of these companies are honestly just going to be hit too hard to ever recover. I would have to go digging for the source, but I believe health care is heavily represented on this list as well.\n\nSome of these companies will recover. I'm not here to say that 700+ companies, some of them the most recognizable names in America, are all going to go under within the year. But this just highlights an issue that's really been going on since the last major Fed intervention in 2011. Bad companies allowed cheap credit are able to crawl along like a patient on life support. In addition to this list you have your near zombies, the companies that teeter on that fine line of profit. Even those that manage to resurrect themselves don't usually go on to be major economy drivers.\n\nThe issue I think is that these companies are already struggling, here today, with near zero interest.

Hundreds of billions, if not trillions of dollars tied up in assets like real estate, production, IP, etc, that could otherwise be used by profitable companies. Not to mention the talented professionals stuck working for these companies.\n\nAnd when even just a few of them fail, the ripples will be far bigger than just their immediate market cap. Tens of thousands of jobs lost as companies cut expenses where they can. Loan defaults, on top of capital stuck in these companies. Billions of dollars lost by ETFs, retail investors, and institutional investors alike. Panic reactions from all of that spreading to the market as a whole.\n\nThese companies need to be allowed to fail, but the Fed won't allow it. In the long run, the assets and market space will be taken up by successful companies, and jobs regained from the same. But by keeping rates low, the Fed allows these companies to struggle along, which ultimately does the economy more harm than good. I think some companies will be able to turn it around, but I worry that even a reasonable uptick in rates is going to have at least short term negative effects in enormous magnitudes across the entire market, stemming in part from the dead weight of these companies.\n\nBut don't take anything I say as gospel, I'm just a dude with internet and an opinion.", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/02/26/stimulus-checks-how-congress-plans-to-pay-for-bidens-relief-plan.html\n\nI would be extremely concerned especially considering this line. \n“Bloom said the government can create money without actually printing physical currency. \"We live in a digital age.

I entered incorrectly, but who could ever know there would be a sloughing off of the price with what little knowledge or experience that I had?\n\nAnyways, it doesn't matter because it was a company with a near monopoly on an exponentially growing market (limited only by the recent silicon shortage).\n\nAnyways, I held my position, and it's paid off beautifully.

When everybody feels they must invest in the next speculative Tesla, we are talking about pushing a $500 million company to $5 billion.

Hence, you argue: a new crash \"should not\" happen, because we had this massive pre-2000 (ca. 1980-2000) Bull Run that lead to exaggerated and inflated market valuations in a large time frame and we should just compare the past with the future. Nevermind the different valuation of \"tech stocks\" back then or the vastly different monetary conditions.

Ie. in your case the FED is creating new FIAT money aka \"virtual money printing\", creating an even larger inflated M1 and giving this to you, the average and new-fledged Investor Joe.

Because you, the average and newly minted Investor Joe, will use the stimulus check to YOLO it into the \"stock market\" instead of buying some new dentals for your gramps or a new doggie bath for your poodle etc. pp.\n\n\\- Further, since we saw what happened with \"GME\", notwithstanding facts like the initial overload in short interest that spiked stock prices initially to the crazy zone.

Here’s my thesis why we won’t see a crash. And frankly, ABH*. This saved me a lot of potential loss a year ago (late Feb 2020).\n\n-The current evaluations are sustainable and not built on hope as the 2000 .com crash did. The Dow, S&P 500 and Russell 2k are loaded with real companies with real businesses and real growth/dividend potential that have moats, high floors and are mostly centered in the best economy in the world (USA). PEP, WMT, FB, AAPL, CAT, AMZN, JNJ, etc. are not going out of business. The .com bubble was frenetic and the market was treated like a casino at the time. Those “investors” got what they deserved.\n\n-As eluded to earlier, the rest of the world will continue to invest in USA companies. Where else is money going to find “Safe Harbor”. Bonds are still too low, cash is about to be the worst investment as it will LOSE value against inflation.\n\n-Boomers are going to still move their income to safe assets. Real estate is a potential location, but not many boomers want to deal with the work of real estate investments.\n\n-ABH* = Always Be Hedging. Pigs get slaughtered as they say. Sell covered calls against your stocks and generate downside protection. If you’re really bearish, create collars. Regardless, my portfolio broke even this week because I am always in weekly covered calls.\n\n-Institutional money needs a place to go. Do your junk those managers are selling everything and then going into bonds? I think not.\n\n-USA economy is poised to enjoy a nice recovery when the pandemic is under control (Q32021 is my guess). The pandemic put out of business some companies that were going to fail anyway. Others companies found ways to become more efficient and bridge the pandemic gap. While others used the efficiency to make more revenue and profits and will prosper after this Covid thing is behind us.\n\n-There is a massive geographic population shift going on IN THE USA. No one is fleeing the country, but moving to places where freedom is not a bad word. Meaning our GDP by state will change, but not in the USA. Once the shift is complete, this will settle the new normal.\n\n-Growth companies (E.g. PLTR, CCL*, SQ, etc.) are viable and will continue to grow. Some will fail, but there are many that are based on sound ideas and are buttressed by really smart people, technology and market efficiency.\n\n*I think CCL will take off once we are past the C-19 thing.\n\n-The housing bubble in 2009 will not be recreated. Banks lended money to anyone with a pulse. That’s not happening anymore. I have an 820 credit score, more cash and securities x 5 than a refi I just completed in December. They underwriter put me through the ringer and I’m a “vanilla” loan risk. Through my personal experience, I know there is no way that the current national housing debt is in bubble territory.

Fundamentally the company is trash and I would never hold it. However, fundamentals are not the only thing that determines gains at the 5-year mark. In fact, fundamentals only start to determine more than 50% of market return after the 6-year mark as volatility based on speculation smooths and fundamentals determine what the firm is worth.\n\nAll that being said fundamentals do not determine how a firm is valued in the short term <5 years, that's mostly speculation. So let's assume Wallstreet treats e-commerce with the same pedigree in 5 years as it does today. Right now the trend is to value e-commerce based on P/S rather than P/E or PEGY in general. They do this because most firms in that market are pretty shit and need to be valued differently because they hemorrhage money in earnings. So, let's say GME transitions to e-commerce with Chewy Execs at the helm, it's a big if but that's the move, anyone, that bullish is playing on. Gamestop has a major debt hurdle that's costing them more than 300M just in interest, to me, this kills any pivot potential. They need to raise capital via shares now to pay down debt to finance a pivot with the flexibility they need. Otherwise, they run into the blockbuster problem of too much debt to pivot now.\n\nNow that I have trashed the company enough let me get on to my point, the big if. IF GameStop transitions to e-commerce let's say they convert 80% of retail sales into e-commerce.  if we look at GME's new potential peers we can see that e-commerce tends to be around a p/s of 7.  Gamestops transition would mean it stops being valued at retailer valuations like Costco and starts being valued at e-commerce valuations. That would translate to around $600 a share for Gamestop. There is a lot of ifs there including what Wallstreet happens to find hot in a given year. But, I can follow the logic of such a play. If I were to buy in it would be for the options squeeze not the short-term play of e-commerce.\n\nEdit: I''m comparing GME to other firms that have - earnings in the e-commerce space.

I find it very interesting to look at the news and opinions of that time - pre, during and post crash. I seek out opinions from the people who lived (and traded) through those times.\n\nIn answer to your question, during that time, many people said the market was valued properly because it priced in \"future profits\". \n\nBut, to your point, the quantity of profits that have to be made by some stocks to justify their prices are astronomically huge (when you do the math, it's quite shocking), and will take a long time to realize. They are also predicated on the company not failing or making big mistakes on the way to realizing their future profits (and also assumes things won't change for their market between then and now).\n\nA lot of it feels emotional. A lot of it feels based ont he cult of personality around people (like Elon Musk or Cathie Wood). A lot of it is enthusiasm for new ideas.

Green energy will be big - but not tomorrow). \n\nFor me, and this is just an opinion, it feels very much like buying something with a credit card, assuming your big promotion at work will come through in a few years to justify your purchase. \n\nEven if prices are justified at current levels, it means that you buy high now and wait years for the company to catch up to the price. That isn't growth. \n\nTo be clear, there are also big differences between those situations and this one.\n\nIn all of this, confirmation bias plays a huge role. When people seek something out, they find it. It's how our simplistic brains work. If I look for reasons why my life is good, I see them.

They are the Tesla of the food industry. \n-Pandemic is starting to run its course and they took a huge hit because of it. \n-Price really can’t go any lower with all the positive news for 2021. One quarter of exceeding analysts expectations will bring this to $200 plus. \n-Have tried some of this shit and they do make\nThe best quality of fake meat.", "id": "ltbz4f", "created_utc": 1614385871.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "Beyond Meat is made with beets.

No one goes there for that and non-meat eaters also what to have access to fast food when they need it.

And giving that the SAD (standard American diet) diet is also super processed it makes sense that the switch to a more ethical plate is still that way. Carb cutting diets keep recycling yes, is hugely popular in waves back and forth between other options from Atkins, to keto, to paleo. Fast food places have adapted to add those options too. those trends tend to burn hot for a few years then fade until the next iteration. The plant based food/ vegan foods industry is a steady growing force. Tyson is getting into it too with a bullshit half and half meat thing.

{"title": "GME may have the potential to dictate the course of the entire market. I did some research & analysis.", "selftext": "Before I start, I just want to say I am writing this because last time I put up speculative DD, and people were tearing it apart because it was very generalized. Being that I have a scientific background I decided to put the time in to gather all the information and analyze it with statistics before posting this one. I hope some of you find it meaningful and I would appreciate any genuine feedback or constructive criticism!\n\n**Hypothesis:** GME is responsible for the previous two market dips and has the ability to significantly move the direction of the entire market.\n\nNew York Stock Exchange (NYA), Market Cap ($22.9 trillion), 2400 stock listings\n\nNasdaq (IXIC), Market Cap (??), 3300+ listings + S&P 500(MC: $31.61 trillion).\n\nDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Market Cap ($8.33 trillion), 30 largest of (NYA and Nasdaq)\n\n**TLDR;/Abstract:** I compare the relationship between GME, and the world's largest market indices mentioned above using a bunch of historical YTD quotes. The data suggests that there is a statistically significant correlation between GME and both the NYA and DJIA. The data didn’t suggest that there is a significant relationship between IXIC and GME, but the data suggests you might be able to infer that there is actually a significant relationship. As GME rises the market responds by dropping. Based on this data, my prediction is that WSB and GME holders are currently controlling the overall health of the market. If this data is accurate, then GME can be used as a possible predictor of overall market trends and consequently, possibly help for not just GME indicators, but also prospective market strategies/positions.\n\n**In short**, when **GME goes up**, the **market goes down**.\n\n**TLDR; for data:** I found that the NYA, DJIA, and IXIC are negatively correlated to GME. NYA ( NYA,**p =.0027\\*\\***), (DJIA, **p =.0018\\*\\***), (Nasdaq, p= 0.88)\n\n**START**\n\nI noticed that anytime GME is rallying up, my entire portfolio goes red. My thought process was that the hedge funds control such a large portion of the market that when they liquidate in order to battle GME the whole entire market falls as a result. However, whenever I mentioned this idea, I’ve been met with opposition, so I decided to compare the GME to the market indices I mentioned above.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME, DJIA, IXIC, NYA, YTD DATA](https://preview.redd.it/ijpbroximxj61.png?width=1251&format=png&auto=webp&s=479499bdf91390cd98ed099bf963ab656421f695)\n\nIf you look at the chart, big drops in all three indices line up perfectly with any large rise in GME price. Meaning, while the whole market collapses GME rises. The opposite is also true, as GME drops, the rest of the market rises. The trends based on these comparisons suggest that GME is to some degree controlling the entire market. I decided to use some statistics so I can see the likelihood that these are “coincidences” as many have suggested.\n\n**PROCESS**\n\nI calculated covariance, correlation, and p test matrices based on YTD data from yahoo finance of GME, NYA, DJIA, IXIC.  All data can be found there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Covariance & Correlation Matrices.](https://preview.redd.it/msw9tittmxj61.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b76728b60bb58ae1b42c40ee3c0c6de3e80553)\n\n[P values. Statistically significant values highlighted.](https://preview.redd.it/gwdaxycymxj61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd89e780bd3a85713d72d6e7a94b249d166c3fd0)\n\nThe results show that there is clear covariance between GME and all of the markets I mentioned. The correlation suggests that there is a moderate negative correlation between GME and the markets, but that makes sense given the vast size of the indices. But what was most important was the p values between GME and the NYA/DJIA. For those that are not into statistics, the p-value is essentially the percentage that the relationships are based on “luck” or “chance”. It is accepted and utilized in the scientific community to establish statistical significance. Any p-value less than .05 is considered statistically significant. A p-value less than .05 basically says that there is less than a 5% chance that the relationships are due to “luck”. As you can see there is a .27% chance that the NYA dropping is random and a .18% chance for the DJIA. While the IXIC does not fit the bill, I believe significance can still be inferred based on the incredibly low p values when comparing NYA to IXIC, or when comparing DJIA to IXIC.\n\n**So, what does this mean?**\n\n**My opinions.**\n\nTo me, this means that GME does not just signify a battle between the poor and the uber-rich, but rather a battle for the entire market. On January 26, the DJIA dropped 600 points, the IXIC 300 points, and NYA 400 points with just a $266 dollar increase in GME. Imagine what would happen if GME hit a thousand dollars? At this point, you may be worried that GME may Impact the whole market, and while that should initially cause worry, when you remember the fact that the top 10% own 88% of the ENTIRE market, you should realize that it is not our market that would be impacted, it's *theirs*.\n\nMy opinion is that if the short squeeze happens, we will witness the largest liquidation event in the history of the market and alongside that, the largest redistribution of wealth that not just our society has seen, but larger than any society in history has ever seen. That liquidation would lower the barrier of entry to the market so significantly, that the people would have the opportunity to claim their spot in the market.\n\n**Final thoughts/ Disclaimers.**\n\nAnyway, this is just something I wanted to share, not trying to convince anyone to do anything, to buy anything, or not to buy anything. None of this is a fact, it is vulnerable to error, and can be completely wrong but just wanted to contribute my thought process and my research in a meaningful way to the handful of you that may appreciate it. I would love feedback, especially if there are any statisticians out there! I also want to clarify, that this was based on limited YTD data. I tried getting ahold of more meaningful data but apparently, websites charge crazy prices for that sort of stuff. If anyone has access to quality data, I would love to sink my teeth into it.\n\nI AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR\n\n**Edit:** Wow, I am beyond grateful at all of the support and encouragement I received from the community, Thank you all so much\n\nI also wanted to address a lot of the common criticisms about statistical analysis. Specifically about the one that goes along the lines of \"correlation does not imply causation\". **There is no such thing as a statistical test that can prove causality. Correlation** is a measure for the **\"strength\"** of a relationship, meaning, it measures the impact that movement in one variable makes on the other variable. In a statistical context, the term \"significant\" is not just a buzz word or a strong adjective, it carries mathematical weight which is established by the **P-test**. The P-test essentially measures the **likelihood** that the correlation between 2 variables is **unrelated**. meaning it measures the odds that a correlation is just based on chance or luck. If you look on the labels of nutrition items, if in the corner of a claim you see a little \"\\*\" it means that statement was deemed statistically significant. For instance, vitamin b 12 claims \" helps turn food into cellular energy\\*\" while other vitamins make claims with no \"\\*\".\n\nIn layman's terms the p-test with regards to GME and NYA basically says that according to the data provided, there is a **.27% chance** that the two are **UNRELATED or a 99.73%** chance they are related.  In the scientific community, anything below 5% or less than .05 is considered statistically significant.\n\nAlso, I didn't just test correlation, I also tested covariance. Covariance is not the same as correlation. **Covariance** measures the **direction** of the relationship. In this case, the very large negative values are indicative of an **inverse** relationship. Meaning when one goes up, the other one goes down.\n\nSo with that in mind, this analysis provides a measure for the **direction** of the relationship, the **strength** of the relationship, and the **statistical significance** of the relationship. Apart from that, it does not say why or how they related. That is purely speculation, and I clearly labeled my speculations as to my opinions and you are all free to make your own speculations off of the data, I am not convincing you to buy into mine.\n\nLastly, I've seen a few comments that were quickly deleted that questioned the quality of my data. All I have to say is that I spent hours looking for better data and was met with buy walls to the tune of [500 dollars](https://firstratedata.com/cb/1/complete-us-stocks-index-etf-futures) per data set. Not to mention a Bloomberg terminal that costs 24k a year.  If someone has access to better quality data please make it publicly accessible and I will be thrilled to redo the analysis with it.\n\nOther than that, Thank you all so much for the support and awards !!\n\n**Edit #2,** The first step to solidifying any scientific proposal is reproducibility. u/big_boolean took the initiative and reproduced the correlation between GME and DJIA. He got a correlation coefficient of -0.53 which is close to mine of -0.49.\n\n[u\\/big\\_boolean Graph](https://preview.redd.it/uu51ljdpsyj61.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23556405c1362f35eab8932dca9927ff9b075c69)\n\nFor those who would like to help reproduce or challenge the post, post your results, and I will add them on. For reference, I used 2 degrees of freedom for my calculations.\n\n**Edit#3** I've started to notice a lot of experts commenting that have a much better and in-depth understanding of applied statistics than I do. To all of you experts, I welcome your criticism. Being that experts in statistics are an incredibly rare breed, I would really appreciate it if you all propose actional propositions that I can take a swing at myself, or better yet I'm sure the community as a whole would appreciate it if you took action and provided your own DD considering you are experts in your fields.

When the market drops, it is a \"risk off environment\", hedge funds liquidate some of their positions BOTH long and short. The unwinding of the two sends the prices of each in opposite directions. They sell their long positions as the overall market goes down, and they buy to cover their short positions - sending GME up in this case. Other than perhaps on a few days when everyone was tuned into GME's price action when Melvin had to unwind, on most days GME does not move the market given it's tiny size relative to everything else.\n\n\\---  \nThere is a relationship between GME and the market, but not the way you hypothesized. The over-shorting of shares has produced a relationship that moves counter to the market when hedge funds reduce their bets during market uncertainties. When they want to cash-out during broader market sell-offs, they buy GME to close out their shorts. The best way to look at this inverse relationship between the broader market and GME is to look at the stock's BETA which is currently near -1.95 (Yahoo Finance shows this)\n\n(A BETA of -1.95 means for every percentage point the market goes up, GME goes down about -1.95 percent. This is based on historic relationships, and are not indicative of the future.)\n\n\\---\n\nFor anyone interested in learning more about BETA, search for it on Investopedia.\n\nIn short BETA is a measure of how a stock moves against the broader market. A BETA of 1 would indicate a given stock moves in lock-step with the stock market.\n\n\\---  \nTLDR - hedge funds reducing risk by closing out their bets sends GME prices in the opposite direction of the market.

The corelates you may be referencing indeed can be observed in the short term, 60/30/15/ etc. min charts over the past days. With overlays & offsets it is similar to the work done by stock market cycle analysts over the decades. My input is that a few days of overlays that one has to offset is interesting but just as I stopped wasting my time some 20 years ago w/the discipline, I suggest that people interested in investing and trading concentrate on studies that have to do w/the only thing that matters to investing - when to Buy and when to Sell. Bottom line: Interesting, however specific to trading and investing per se I find it best to keep it simple.

When many stocks go down GME should follow the herd, but it doesn't because it has an unusual and committed following that is willing to weather short ladder attacks and daily FUD. Diamond hands are inspired by recent moves to make this a successful business model and then there is the thought that, at some point, just maybe there might be a squeeze - if we can just hodl the line. If there are any market ripples it's because  hedgie brokers have been playing a game of hide the synthetic shares in ETFs - lots of them - buy options, drive the cost of those ETFs down, and recoup their costs thereby creating \"red days\". It's elaborate, but the only way right now for these very rich businesses to stash enough cash aside to deal with their GME shorts crisis, while also hoping that they can stay out of the crosshairs of anyone looking for direct evidence of  GME price manipulation. So there is some relationship, but it's complicated by market makers driving down the costs on multiple ETFs rather than going after that single GME stock. Too many eyes are watching, so they have to tread a bit more lightly. Time to time, ETF options dates draw near, and it's time to mess with all those ETFs and all the stocks in them, and resultant ripples cause a red day. I could be totally wrong, but the synthetic stocks and the ETF hides are for real, so it's not impossible that there are some implications on the wider market when market movers mess with options on the ETFs.

When the market drops, it is a \"risk off environment\", hedge funds liquidate some of their positions BOTH long and short. The unwinding of the two sends the prices of each in opposite directions. They sell their long positions as the overall market goes down, and they buy to cover their short positions - sending GME up in this case. Other than perhaps on a few days when everyone was tuned into GME's price action when Melvin had to unwind, on most days GME does not move the market given it's tiny size relative to everything else.\n\n\\---  \nThere is a relationship between GME and the market, but not the way you hypothesized. The over-shorting of shares has produced a relationship that moves counter to the market when hedge funds reduce their bets during market uncertainties. When they want to cash-out during broader market sell-offs, they buy GME to close out their shorts. The best way to look at this inverse relationship between the broader market and GME is to look at the stock's BETA which is currently near -1.95 which can be found here:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)\n\n(A BETA of -1.95 means for every percentage point the market goes up, GME goes down about -1.95 percent. This is based on historic relationships, and are not indicative of the future.)\n\n\\---\n\nThis page explains more about what BETA is for anyone interested:\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp)\n\nIn short BETA is a measure of how a stock moves against the broader market. A BETA of 1 would indicate a given stock moves in lock-step with the stock market.\n\n\\---  \nTLDR - hedge funds reducing risk by closing out their bets sends GME prices in the opposite direction of the market.

And the devils are in the details for this type of analysis....\n\n1) Highly suggest using robust data analysis (e.g. spearman correlation). \n\n2) This inverse correlation is highly possible when GME trading $ volume is large, i.e. GME price is high and the daily trading volume is also high. How high is high? Probably when GME price > 100 and daily volume > 100M, leading to daily trading $ volume over $10 Billion. When this happens during squeeze days, of course HFs need to sell hugely all their other liquid and less volatile holdings --- primarily DIJX type of stocks. If you use regular statistical analysis, all you need is a few \"squeeze\" days to show this correlation is significant.

As Gilbert bought more and more shares, Bruce’s stock price rose, and short sellers entered into the market believing that an underperforming company like Bruce wasn’t worth the price it was trading at. In the process, Gilbert was acquiring all the float in Bruce’s stock. As the price of Bruce stock rose further, the shorts were forced to cover their positions. On June 12, 1958, the American Stock Exchange suspended trading in E. L. Bruce Stock when the stock soared to $77 a share. Shares were in short supply because the management of E. L. Bruce owned 50% of the outstanding shares and Gilbert had taken control over the remaining 50% of Bruce stock. The shares that were sold short represented the balance between Bruce and Gilbert. Typically, in a situation like this, the exchange would step in, negotiate a fair price for the shorts to cover their position, and settle outstanding short contracts for cash, but Gilbert didn’t want to do this. Gilbert wanted the shares the shorts had borrowed because getting those few extra shares meant the difference between who owned E. L. Bruce Corp. Although the American Stock Exchange required that all shorts cover their positions, the stock no longer traded on the ASE, and the shorts had to find shares over-the-counter. This led to a mad scramble among the shorts, and the stock reportedly traded as high as $190 as shorts desperately tried to cover their positions. Short interest in the stock gradually declined from 16,134 shares on May 15 to 6,440 shares by August 15 and to 3,500 shares by September 4.\n\nThe remaining shorts simply could not find the shares to cover their position, so they filed suit to avoid having to cover their positions claiming there was no “fair market” in the stock and refused to have their shares bought in until a fair market was established; however, in Aronson v. McCormick, the court denied their preliminary injunction and the shorts were required to cover their shares.\n\nhttps://globalfinancialdata.com/the-piggly-crisis\n\nSaunders vs. the Shorts\nClarence Saunders also became part of the last stock corner on the New York Stock Exchange in 1923. The corner became so prominent, that the whole affair became known as the Piggly Crisis. Clarence Saunders was generous, determined, stubborn, and well-known in Memphis. Saunders became known as the home boy who faced off the financiers of Wall Street who were using a bear raid to try and profit from a decline in Piggly Wiggly stock. The goal of shorting a stock is to borrow shares from someone who owns them and sell them. When the stock declines in price, the shorts buy the shares back at a lower price, make a profit, and then return the stock to the person they borrowed it from. In a bear raid, several shorts make a concerted effort to drive the price of a stock down so they can profit from the decline. The bulls, on the other hand, can try and beat the shorts by forcing the price of the stock up, squeezing the shorts and forcing them to sell at a loss. If the bulls can buy up the existing float, the stock is cornered. The shorts have no choice but to buy the stock from the bulls at whatever price they demand. Of course, creating a corner is risky for the bulls as well because it takes a lot of resources to buy up the float in the stock. Once the corner is completed and the shorts have covered their positions at the inflated price, little demand is left for the stock. The price of the stock can collapse, leaving the bulls with a burdensome load of debt. The whole process can end up bankrupting both the shorts and the bulls. Piggly Wiggly shares started trading over-the-counter in July 1920 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in June 1922. In November, 1922, several of the independently-owned Piggly Wiggly stores in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut failed and went into receivership. Although Saunders’ corporation operated independently of these stores and was profitable, some Wall Street operators saw this as a reason to begin a bear raid on Piggly Wiggly stock. The bear raiders began selling PIggly Wiggly short and spread rumors that the company was in poor shape. Saunders took this challenge personally. He had created Piggly Wiggly stores, created the concept of self-shopping, was spreading his stores across the country, and some bears were trying to create profits by spreading lies about his stores. Saunders decided to “beat the Wall Street professionals at their own game.” Saunders not only used his own money to battle the shorts, but he borrowed ten million dollars from a group of bankers in Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans, Chattanooga and St. Louis to buy up the existing float. In the Wall Street of the 1920s, bear raids came and went. Companies didn’t go bankrupt because of bear raids, and if the fundamentals of the company were sound, the stock would bounce back after the bear raid was over. Nevertheless, Saunders refused to give in to the Wall Street city slickers. Saunders hired Jesse L. Livermore, the most famous bear on Wall Street, to help him break the back of the bear raiders. Within a week, Livermore had bought 105,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly, over half the float of 200,000 shares. The bears had shorted Piggly Wiggly stock in the 40 range, but by January, Saunders’ bull campaign had pushed the price of shares past 60. The shorts were losing money.  \nThe Shorts Are Cornered\nPiggly shares were traded on both the Chicago and New York Stock Exchanges. In January, the Chicago Exchange announced that the stock had been cornered, though the NYSE denied that a corner existed. So Saunders decided to try a new tack. He announced that he would issue 50,000 shares of Piggly Wiggly shares at $55 each. Saunders regularly advertised his stores in the newspapers, and he used some of these ads to offer shares to small investors. Saunders pointed out that Piggly Wiggly stock paid a $1 per quarter dividend, yielding 7% to investors. Since this occurred before the S.E.C. came into existence, Saunders could promise that this was a “once in a lifetime opportunity,” and get away with it. Since Piggly stock was then trading at $70, why would Saunders offer shares at $55, leaving $15 on the table for each of the 50,000 shares? The reason is that Saunders knew that once the shorts had been cornered, the demand for Piggly stock would dry up. Saunders’ stock distribution created a market where he could distribute his shares to new investors. Saunders even allowed investors to buy new shares on the payment plan, put $25 down and pay $10 a month for three months. Since the new shareholders couldn’t sell their shares until they were paid for, this would keep the shorts from obtaining these newly minted shares to cover their positions. On March 19, Saunders let it be known that he controlled all but 1,128 shares of Piggly Wiggly’s outstanding shares. He had cornered the shorts. On Tuesday, March 20, Saunders called on the shorts to deliver their shares to him. By the rules of the exchange, the shorts were required to produce the shares by 2:15 on March 21. The stock opened on the March 20 at 75½, moved up to 124 by noon, but then dropped to 82 on the rumor that the Exchange planned to suspend trading in Piggly and postpone the delivery deadline for the shorts. It was no rumor. The NYSE did suspend trading in the stock. Saunders responded by saying that he expected settlement on Thursday the 22nd by 3 p.m. at $150 per share. Thereafter, his price would be $250 per share. The exchange permanently halted trading in Piggly and gave the shorts until 5 p.m. on Monday the 26th to settle with Saunders. With this ruling, the NYSE saved the shorts. This postponement tipped the scales in favor of the shorts because it gave them several extra days to find some of the 1,128 outstanding shares to settle their accounts without having to come begging to Saunders. Was it right for the Exchange to change the rules in the middle of the game to prevent a corner similar to the one that had occurred in Northern Pacific in 1901? Or should the Exchange have left the shorts to their fate? The NYSE justified their actions on the grounds that the demoralizing effect of the corner could have spread to the rest of the market.  \nSaunders Wins a Pyrrhic Victory\nOn Friday, the 23rd, Saunders offered to settle at $100 per share. In the meantime, the shorts were able to find enough shares floating around in Iowa or New Mexico to cover their positions. Shareholders in Sioux City who knew nothing of the Piggly Crisis were happy to double their money by selling to the shorts while the shorts were happy to get the shares at a mere $100. Saunders now had complete control of Piggly stock, but he was also deeply in debt. It is estimated that Saunders made half-a-million dollars out of his corner, but that proved insufficient to cover his costs. After Saunders paid off the banks with his proceeds, he found that he was five million dollars short, half of which was due on September 1, 1923 and the balance on January 1, 1924. Since Piggly shares could no longer trade on the NYSE, Saunders was forced to sell shares directly to the public and advertised in the newspapers once again, offering Piggly Wiggly shares at $55. Although the public was sympathetic toward Saunders and his battle against the Wall Street bears, the public was unwilling to put their money where their sympathies lay. Saunders took out another newspaper advertisement saying that if Piggly Wiggly were ruined, it would “shame the whole South.” Memphis’s newspaper, The Commercial Appeal, lined themselves behind Saunders and helped lead a campaign to convince Memphians to buy Piggly Wiggly shares and save their local boy. The newspaper planned a three-day campaign to sell 50,000 shares to Memphians at $55 a share. This was to be an all or nothing proposition. If they were unable to sell all 50,000 shares, none would be sold. The campaign began on May 8, and soon 23,698 shares had been subscribed. Despite this, skeptics began to raise questions about who was the true beneficiary of this campaign, Saunders or the public. They asked for a spot audit of Piggly Wiggly to reassure potential investors that the company was a good investment. Saunders refused the audit, but offered to step down and let a committee run the company. Skeptics also asked why Saunders was still building his million-dollar Pink Palace when Piggly Wiggly was possibly in its last throes. The Pink Palace was a huge house built using pink Georgia marble. The Palace was to include a pipe organ, Roman atrium, indoor swimming pool, ballroom, bowling alley, its own golf course, and other luxuries. Saunders promised to board up the Pink Palace and stop construction. Unfortunately, the campaign was unable to sell even 25,000 shares, and the campaign soon fizzled. Saunders responded by selling Piggly Wiggly stores, rather than stock, to raise money. Despite selling stores in Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and elsewhere, Saunders failed to raise enough money to meet the September 1 payment of $2.5 million. Saunders turned over his Piggly Wiggly Stock, the Pink Palace (which was sold to the city of Memphis for $150,000 and opened as a museum in 1930. Today, it includes a replica of the first Piggly Wiggly store, a planetarium, a natural history museum and a museum of twentieth-century Memphis) and other property to his creditors and defaulted on the loan. By Spring, Saunders was in formal bankruptcy proceedings. If Saunders had never launched his campaign against the shorts, he would not have had to borrow the money that drove him into bankruptcy. Pride went before the fall. \n\nhttps://www.americanheritage.com/jacob-schiff-and-northern-pacific-corner#2\n\nIn 1901 James J. Hill, who controlled the Great Northern Railroad and was the largest stockholder in the Northern Pacific, used the latter to seize control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, a smaller road that threatened the Union Pacific’s territory. When Hill refused to address Harriman’s concerns, Harriman determined to get control of the Burlington by seizing control of the Northern Pacific. Morgan was Hill’s banker, so an attack on Hill was a direct attack on Morgan. Before long Schiff had quietly purchased a majority of the preferred stock (which had equal voting rights) in Northern Pacific and held enough common stock to have an overall majority. Morgan and Hill had been caught napping.\n\nMorgan was in Europe and received a frantic cable asking for authority to buy 150,000 common shares of Northern Pacific at the opening of the market on Monday morning, May 6, 1901. If Hill could get a majority of the common, he might be able to delay things until he could retire the preferred and retain control. The cost, at the very least, would be well in excess of fifteen million dollars. Morgan cabled his immediate approval, and the battle was joined between the titans. Those caught in the middle would have to look out for themselves.\n\nOn Monday morning Harriman and Morgan held between them 630,000 of the 800,000 shares of Northern Pacific common in existence. By the close of the market on Tuesday, the Morgan bank had purchased 124,000 shares more. That left only 46,000 shares un- accounted for. But the volume of Northern Pacific for those two days totaled 539,000 shares. The vast majority of these, of course, had been sold “short.” When, too late, the short sellers realized what was really happening, panic swept the Street.\n\nSuddenly the shorts were desperate to close out their positions and willing to pay whatever price was necessary. As they liquidated their other assets to buy Northern Pacific, stocks and bonds plunged. Morgan’s new U.S. Steel, which had been at 54¾ only a few days earlier, skidded from 40 to 26 on Thursday morning, while Northern Pacific ratcheted upward minute by minute. One broker hired a special train just to bring a single certificate for 500 shares down from Albany. Another, incautiously admitting he had 10,000 shares to sell, was stripped virtually naked on the floor of the Exchange itself as the shorts clawed at him in their desperation to buy at any price. That morning the firm of Street and Norton sold 300 shares to one of the shorts at one thousand dollars a share, ten times what the price had been a week earlier.\n\nBy noon the panic was threatening to engulf in ruin not just the shorts but the Street itself. The Morgan bank and Kuhn, Loeb called a hasty truce. They would buy no more Northern Pacific for their own accounts or for those of their customers and would allow the shorts to settle at $150 a share. Calm began to return to Wall Street.\n\nKuhhn, Loeb had fought the Morgan bank to a standstill. This allowed Harriman to get what he really wanted, which was not control of the Northern Pacific but attention to his interests from the Northern Pacific and its newly acquired subsidiary, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. Harriman was soon on the board.\n\nThe New York Times likened the affair to so many “cowboys on a spree, shooting wildly at each other in entire disregard of the safety of the bystanders.” It is ironic that Morgan and Schiff, so instrumental in reforming the bad old ways of American business, were among the principal antagonists in Wall Street’s last great railroad war, so reminiscent of the wild and woolly days of the Civil War era.\n\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/0a58b63a-4294-3e07-8390-c3aabef39a26\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-idUSTRE49R3I920081028\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen VOWG.DE briefly became the world's biggest company by market value on Tuesday, as short sellers caught betting on a price drop with borrowed stock scrambled to find shares after a buying spree by Porsche PSHG_p.DE.\n\nShort sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday’s news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.\n\nAt that price Volkswagen's voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil XOM.N.\n\nVW shares later closed trading on Tuesday up 82 percent at 945 euros.\n\nThe share price has rocketed since Porsche revealed in a surprise announcement on Sunday that it had effectively gained control of 74 percent of Volkswagen’s voting shares.\n\nIn March, when Porsche was still sitting on a long-held 31 percent direct stake, it said it was not seeking to increase its holding to 75 percent, bearing in mind that the state of Lower Saxony holds a 20 percent stake in VW.\n\n“The speculation of going to 75 percent overlooks the realities of the shareholder structure of VW, Porsche said at the time.\n\n“In view of the fact that Lower Saxony as second largest shareholder owns 20 percent of VW, the probability of acquiring the necessary shares in freefloat is extremely low.”\n\nMeanwhile on Tuesday a spokesman for German market regulator BaFin said it was looking into the VW share price movement for any sign of insider trading or market manipulation.\n\nPorsche denied it was manipulating the market and said that the market had mixed up cause with effect.\n\n“We vehemently reject the accusation of share price manipulation,” a spokesman for Porsche said. “The ones responsible are those that speculated with huge sums of money on a falling Volkswagen share price.”\n\nPorsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.\n\nIt said it was announcing its plans because the number of short positions in VW were considerably higher than it expected and it consequently wanted to give investors the chance to unwind their bets “without haste and without greater risk.”\n\nAround 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25, the most recent day for which data was available, according to financial market data consultant dataexplorers.com. This compared with an average 5 percent for all DAX stocks.\n\nThe “mother of all short squeezes,” as one analyst phrased it, led to an investor outcry alleging that they were duped by Porsche.\n\nDealers said those traders who had sold borrowed VW shares in the hope of buying them back at lower prices had been panicked by the announcement of Porsche’s holding.\n\n“Someone must have been very desperate to get a hold of the stock, so there will be a big surprise at some point who will have all these losses -- because someone must have lost a lot of money,” said Christian Schick, head of portfolio management in Germany for Fortis Investments.\n\nShares in Morgan Stanley MS.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA all tumbled on Tuesday with traders saying there was speculation that the banks might be caught on the wrong side of trades involving Volkswagen.\n\nGoldman declined to comment, but people inside the company said it had no Volkswagen losses, while a Morgan Stanley spokesman said that the company has no exposure to the automaker. SocGen could not immediately be reached for comment, but earlier on Tuesday said it was sticking with its third-quarter earnings forecast.\n\nVOLKSWAGEN DAX WEIGHTING?\nShares in VW were up 45 percent at 689.9 euros by 1604 GMT, after tripling at one point in the previous session.\n\nThis meant they were trading at around 63 times expected earnings for 2009, at a massive premium to rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T and Daimler DAIGn.DE.\n\nAnalysts and traders said the stampede was historic for German large caps, but they could foresee VW shares continuing to rise or stay at current levels.\n\n“The problem is, from a fundamental point of view, shares are really overvalued. But when the short squeeze comes to an end, there are not enough shares available to bring the share price back down,” said one Frankfurt-based analyst.\n\nDespite the massive rise in VW shares and talk of little free float remaining, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange said it did not plan any changes in the German blue-chip DAX index.\n\nBut Wolfgang Gerke, a member of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange’s Exchange Council, told manager magazin’s online portal that VW stock should be reweighted on the German DAX bluechip index as soon as possible.\n\nWhen asked about the current, nearly 17 percent weighting that Volkswagen’s stock has on the gauge, Gerke said: “Deutsche Boerse needs to act now and reduce VW’s weighting on the basis of its considerably lowered freefloat.”\n\nThe Finance Ministry declined to comment on the rise in the Volkswagen share price and the Economy Ministry did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment.\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/squeeze-on-goldman-put-falcone-in-penalty-box-2013-08-21\n\nPhilip Falcone, the billionaire hedge-fund manager who must actually admit wrongdoing in a regulatory settlement, did something many people on Wall Street wish they could do.\n\nHe put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid.\n\nIn 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -2.53%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same.\n\nPoor MAAX. The company was just trying to make shower doors, sinks and other products people need to wash themselves clean. Poor Falcone. His Harbinger Capital owned a ton of these MAAX bonds and Goldman was flushing them right down the drain.\n\nIt is an awful thing to learn Goldman is betting against a security when you are betting for it. People often respond to such news in crazy ways. You might remember a firm called Lehman Brothers, back in 2008, blaming the entire financial crisis on short-sellers — including a short-selling cabal led by Goldman. Lehman fired back by getting the Securities and Exchange Commission, to put a temporary ban on shorting certain stocks.\n\nAs for Falcone, well, he responded in his own way. He grew up playing hockey in a dying Minnesota mining town not far from the Canadian border. He made it to the pros in Sweden and now owns a piece of the NHL’s Minnesota Wild. In hockey, if another player smacks you against the wall, you find a way to rip off his helmet and pound his face.\n\nIn hockey, this is called sportsmanship.\n\nFalcone, according to his confessional settlement with the SEC, sought revenge against his opponent.\n\nFalcone bought up every piece of the MAAX bond offering there was. He even bought more than there was. According to the SEC, he purchased 22 million more bonds than had ever been issued (because on Wall Street, you can always buy stuff that doesn’t actually exist.)\n\nThis move to corner the market more than doubled the price of the bonds that Goldman was trying to short and it put Goldman right up against the wall. Goldman now had to buy these bonds to cover its short position.\n\nThat’s when Falcone said something like, “Hey, squid. You want some MAAX bonds? I got your MAAX bonds, right here,” and then demanded that Goldman pay significantly more than face value for the bonds.\n\nNow, I am certain that this play can righteously be labeled illegal market manipulation the same way punching someone in the head can be considered assault. This call doesn’t happen very often, though, in an arena where such violations occur all the time.\n\nThe SEC came down on Falcone a lot harder than it ever came down on the squid, forcing not just an $18 million settlement, and a five-year ban from the industry, but a rare admission that he actually did something wrong.\n\n“Today’s charges read like the final exam in a graduate-school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully,” said Robert Khuzami, in 2012, when he was then director of the SEC’s enforcement division and announced the charges against Falcone.\n\nI, very naively, had no idea business schools taught such courses. Perhaps now that Falcone has been banned from his industry, he can go back to his alma mater, Harvard University, and teach them.\n\n“Clients and market participants alike were victimized as Falcone … manipulated the market for certain bonds … and violated trading rules intended to prohibit manipulative short sales,” Khuzami added.\n\nhttps://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/\n\n[Removed to keep within character limit]\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2017/11/01/ackman-has-bailed-out-of-his-short-position-on-herbalife/\n\nAfter nearly five years of punishing paper losses and mockery on Wall Street, Bill Ackman has finally given up his $1 billion short bet against Herbalife.\n\nThe embattled hedge-fund tycoon still insists that the giant supplements distributor is a “pyramid scheme,” and has spent heavily on a new batch of put options that will pay off if Herbalife’s stock falls.\n\nBut Ackman also admitted Wednesday that the big, bold short bet his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital made against Herbalife in 2012 now looks too risky to stomach any longer.\n\nHerbalife shares are up more than 50 percent this year, due in part to a stock buyback completed last month by the company, which vehemently denies Ackman’s allegations that it practices a predatory business model.\n\nThe rally has likewise been driven by investors anticipating a “short-squeeze,” in which short sellers would have quickly buy back the stock they’ve sold to make their bearish bets — a move that also drives up the price.\n\nAmong those who have bet directly against Ackman on Herbalife is his nemesis, billionaire Carl Icahn, who now owns nearly a quarter of Herbalife shares.\n\n“There is no longer an opportunity to squeeze Pershing Square,” Ackman said in a Wednesday interview with CNBC.\n\nInstead of shorting Herbalife, Ackman is now shelling out cash for put options, which will pay off if Herbalife shares drop but which don’t pose the risk of a short squeeze.\n\nUnlike holding shares short, where Pershing Square’s losses could be unlimited, Ackman said losses would now be capped at 3 percent of capital — what he called “modest investment.”\n\nNevertheless, “They’re going to charge Ackman a premium … for the privilege of him owning a put,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of predictive analytics at financial analytics firm S3 Partners told The Post.\n\nAckman’s dealer — who sold the put option — now holds the short position, according to Dusaniwksy.\n\n“Ackman has increased his expenses but he has increased his safety,” Dusaniwsky said, estimating that this year alone Ackman has faced an estimated $455 million paper loss on Herbalife.\n\nPershing Square declined to comment on its Herbalife paper losses, or the premiums it has paid to drop its short bet, or the terms on the new put options it has purchased.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Ackman on Wednesday from continuing to defend his costly war against the company.\n\n“We’ve been entirely right on our Herbalife investment in terms of the fundamentals of the business. We’ve been wrong on the share price,” Ackman told CNBC.\n\nHerbalife’s stock has more than doubled since Ackman announced his short position. An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded last year tore into Herbalife’s business practices but stopped short of calling it a pyramid scheme and shutting it down.\n\nPershing Square is down 5.8 percent through the end of September.\n\nReps from Herbalife did not respond to requests to comment.\n\nHerbalife shares were down 2.4 percent at $70.85 Wednesday.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@KeithAkre/vanderbilt-and-the-greatest-corner-never-told-12f1bffe4d1d\n\nThe Harlem and the Hudson were both poorly run, lightly traveled rail lines that were not thought of as highly valuable. Vanderbilt saw that these lines were the only rails allowed to come directly onto Manhattan island. Sensing an opportunity, he started to accumulate shares in Harlem.\n\nAt the same time Vanderbilt was buying, there was a large contingent of players who were selling the shares short. That is, they were borrowing shares, and selling, with the hope to buy them back at a lower price, netting the difference. This group of sellers (bears, in Wall Street parlance) included members of the New York City council as well as members of the board of directors for Harlem rail! One of those board members was long-time Vanderbilt rival, Daniel Drew.\n\nWith all these inside interests betting on the price of Harlem to go down, there had to be something going on. Sure enough, a franchise bill that authorized Harlem to lay a double track was suddenly rescinded. The price dropped suddenly on the news and all the short sellers expected to clean up and declare victory — except that Mr. Vanderbilt was still on the other side, buying everything that was being sold. Not only did the stock stop going down, but it started to rise quickly.\n\nNow for those that do not know, shorting a stock can be a dangerous business. When you buy a stock (go long) you only have your investment to lose. If you pay $100 for a stock, it can only go to $0, thereby wiping out your investment. However, if you borrow a stock and sell it short, there is technically no limit to high it could go before you must buy it back to cover your borrowing. If you borrow shares and sell them at $100 and the price goes to $200, you have lost your entire investment. But if the price goes to $300 or $400, you would be on the hook for more multiple times your initial position.\n\nNow imagine one person owns the entire supply of stock. If you sold it short at $100, and now you have to buy it back to cover your position, what price does the owner set? This is the danger of being caught short when someone has ‘cornered’ the market. As John Brooks explains in his classic “Once in Golconda:\n“Since a successful cornerer may theoretically set an infinite price, any finite one is a theoretically a bargain.”\nThis is what happened to the short sellers of Harlem stock. Vanderbilt and his allies had purchased the entire supply and had them at their mercy. In order to escape complete ruin, the city council gave back Harlem’s franchise which now Vanderbilt owned outright.\n\nAlready, this was one of the most successful corners of a market in history and made the Commodore a ton of money in the process. However, this was just the beginning.\n\nWatching this epic battle unfold, some Wall Street speculators decided to attack the neighboring Hudson rail line. This group thought that Vanderbilt must be short of cash (after all that buying) and attention, and so went heavily short hoping to drive the price down and make themselves a tidy profit. What they did not know, was that Vanderbilt was already one step ahead and actually perpetuated the rumor that he was short on cash by weakly buying Hudson shares using futures. This was a common strategy for buyers short on cash because it was merely a promise to buy at a later date. The intermediaries Vanderbilt used were actually part of the short-selling group, who would gladly accept the options from the Commodore and then turned around and sold the stock into the market.\n\nLittle did the bears know, they were selling this stock to allies of Vanderbilt, who far from being short on cash, still had plenty of powder left. When, finally, he demanded delivery of the stock he purchased, the sellers had to go into the market to buy it back and found no sellers except Vanderbilt himself. Mercifully, instead of raising the price to infinity, Vanderbilt let the short-sellers off relatively easy. They weren’t ruined, merely badly burned.\nWithin the span of a couple months, Cornelius Vanderbilt acquired full control of the only two railways with access to Manhattan and made a substantial fortune in the process.\n\nDaniel Drew, still stung from his losses in the failed Harlem short, decided he wanted one more crack. He convinced a few law makers in the state capitol of Albany to revoke the franchise for Harlem, overriding the city council. If they revoked the license and shorted Harlem stock, they could make a bit of money as well. This turned out to be a fateful mistake.\n\nFrom The Great Game:\n\n“Drew’s scheme was, of course, a carbon copy of what cost the members of the city council so dearly the previous spring. One is at a loss to explain how they could have been tempted. ‘The statesmen at Albany,’ E.C. Stedman, a veteran of Wall Street in the 1860’s, wrote at the turn of the century, ‘in the spring of 1864, were well aware of the misfortune into which the statesmen at New York had plunged themselves, less than a year before, by their bear campaign against this stock. Yet they rushed fatuously into a similar attempt, as if Vanderbilt has proved an easy victim.’”\n\nInterestingly, the timing on this second attempt to ‘bear raid’ Harlem stock was in favor of the shorts. The price went from $140 down to $101. The greed of speculators who always hope to make more money was on full display here. Instead of covering at a net profit of almost $40 per share, the shorts tried to press their advantage. “They held on, hoping to see it drop to $50”\n\nDespite really not being very liquid this time around, the Commodore was still not easily defeated. He rallied his allies and raised cash to buy up the last remaining supply of the stock. The price rose to $109, then to $125, and by the end of April was all the way to $224. Feeling less charitable than the last time, Vanderbilt was asked by his brokers where to set the price. “Asked what to do, he bellowed, ‘Put it to a thousand!’”\n\nFortunately for the shorts, (and their brokerage houses, who also would have been decimated at that price), Vanderbilt relented and settled at $285.\n\n“The second Harlem corner was over and there would not be another.

This will bring down the yield, thus making growth and equities attractive again\n\nFriday we saw yields going down significantly. This only makes me convinced 1.5 on 10Y is the resistance. What made people buy bonds? I think the market correction made money flow into bonds again as it is a safe haven asset class, even on current levels. Paradoxically, we might see this movement between bonds and equities oscillate for a few more weeks violently, before it settles on a level\n\n$1.9T stimulus is already priced in and it won't be factor affecting the current market. However, any deviation from this figure might have an impact. If it is greater than $1.9T, bonds are sold on fears of inflation, thus driving up the yield. And vice versa. A greater stimulus can also makes TLT drop below support which would be scary and not what we want.\n\nLastly, Fed for sure is monitoring the movement in the long dated yield. They have consistently mentioned that inflation is not an issue long term and that they still have enough tools at their disposal to control the yield curve. In case yields break off and go above 1.5 parabolically, I think they will jump in and start participating in buying the long dated bonds, which they haven't done yet - they have only been buying the short dated bonds so far.\n\nWhy would Fed want to control the long dated yield? To save the stock market? Nope. That's not their primary goal, but equities do benefit from their measure. They will buy long dated bonds because they want more borrowers in the economy than lenders. Especially given the fact their target is to boost employment, which would happen if they keep companies afloat - yes, even the zombie ones, which should ideally go out of business anyway.

I am not saying they are equal to each other, I am saying they are equivalent in an investment decision. Since you appear to have engaged in good faith I will explain it for you.\n\nA call contract is buying exposure to 100 shares of a stock for less than the price of a stock. Another way to get exposure to 100 shares of a stock is to borrow money to buy them. So you can look at the cost of borrowing that money, and compare it to the premium you have to pay on the option to get that same exposure to 100 shares.\n\nAn example:\nStock X trades at $1/share. You have $50 to take a position in stock X, and you want to use leverage to get greater exposure than the 50 shares you could buy of stock X. \n\nYou look at the option chain, and the at the money $1 call option expiring in 3 months costs $0.50, or $50 for a 100 share contract. \n\nHowever, another option is for you to draw on margin (if you have it available), and simply buy the 100 shares with the $50 of your money and $50 of money borrowed on margin.\n\nThe decision of which to do will depend on the interest rate to borrow that money, and the risk profile of the position. In this example, the risk profile of the margin position is clearly better than the risk profile of the option. If the stock trades sideways for 3 months and closes at $1, your option position is worthless and your margin position is close to break even (you would lose the 3 month interest on $50, which at most brokers right now would be around $0.50). At the X price of $1.50, your option position breaks even and your margin position is nearly a 100% gain ($50 minus the interest on margin).\n\nBut what about the downside of margin? You have two options. You can either set a stop loss at around $0.51, which would be the point where you would lose 100% of your principal, or you could buy a $0.50 put if you are worried the stock might gap down below $0.50 at a time you can't trade it. You would then need to include the price of this put in your comparison. \n\nThis is an extreme example where borrowing and buying on margin is clearly the better position, assuming you have the margin available, but you can imagine with a lower option premium you would have to look really closely at the margin interest rate and the cost of the premium to determine which was the cheaper way to achieve the leverage you want to achieve.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I was asking in good faith and this is much clearer now, thanks!

But assuming interest rates did go up, how would that affect your example given? Would options become more attractive since the margin rates I assume would go up?

I think the correct advice with respect to using margin to buy options is \"never trade options on margin unless you REALLY know what you are doing\".\n\nTo answer your question yes, as interest rates increase options become more attractive because rho is generally less than 1 (ie the cost to borrow on margin will increase at a faster rate than the associated increase in option premiums).\n\nI don't have any particular insight with respect to the direction of bond yields, but my opinion is that the market needed an excuse to correct and rising bond yields gave it an excuse. Of course there are risk parity etfs, mutual funds etc that automatically readjust when yields rise, so some downward pressure was inevitable, but that wouldn't cause anything like the hit the NASDAQ took. I find it hard to believe that many actively-managed hedge funds are looking at a 1.6% yield and thinking \"man that's juicy, I want much more of that\".

{"title": "When GME, AMC go to the moon. DD on where to invest next.", "selftext": "I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.\n\nBy adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.\n\nKey reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/\n\nFirst off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!! \n\nUnfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink. \n\nNext marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the \"inserting things in places the sun does not shine\"... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here. \n\nBy **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become \"the fashion\" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.\n\nBeyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.\n\nWhen a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.\n\nUPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!\n\nNeedless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.\n\nSpace Ape out\n\nTLDR: \n\n* $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU\n* $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI\n* $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot\n* $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds\n* $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon\n\nEDIT: Fresh data in....
