From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:\n\n>‚ÄúImagine you‚Äôre the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  \n>  \n>Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...¬†¬†you‚Äôre going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter‚Äù\n\nSeriously, this is cool, and it‚Äôs only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what‚Äôs going to help them into a powerhouse is this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Over the coming months, we‚Äôll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It‚Äôll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we‚Äôll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won‚Äôt just be your frontend, it‚Äôll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.\n\nSoon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare‚Äôs network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they‚Äôll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not a developer, you probably didn‚Äôt understand most of that, but essentially, they‚Äôre making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.\n\nI can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it‚Äôs profitability... üöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n(And even if it doesn‚Äôt, and stays at 50%, it will still üöÄ but slower.

Plus it‚Äôs hardly a tank when it‚Äôs at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher\n\nIts earnings was good, and to those who haven‚Äôt read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock‚Äôs immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:\n\n>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRevenue right now is $125 million **per quarter**  or $431 million for 2020. Doesn‚Äôt sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that‚Äôs $1 billion a a quarter or 4 million a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion/quarter or 12 billion a year\n\nYes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm long Jan 21 115c.\n\nThe revenue and growth isn‚Äôt the impressive part. The margins are\n\n>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nHigh 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they‚Äôre going to be **raking** in dough\n\nThat being said, NET isn‚Äôt profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they‚Äôve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn‚Äôt stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here‚Äôs why:\n\n\\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‚Äò22\n\n\\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare‚Äôs network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.\n\n\\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n‚Äî-\n\n**CONS**\n\nThe only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I‚Äôm a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there‚Äôs no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don‚Äôt matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild a Better Internet‚Äù shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare‚Äôs already enormous Cloudflare network.\n\nThis stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren‚Äôt in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I‚Äôm trying to be conservative here).\n\nSeriously, give this a second look. I‚Äôve been playing NET since 37. It‚Äôs a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn‚Äôt done its 30% move. I‚Äôm completely assured that it will soon\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Made a huge mistake in the first iteration. I implied Cloudflare makes only 130 million a year. They made that last quarter.

By October 2007, you had reached almost a 20% return!!      Yay!! Celebration time! Then as you see, you went on to lose 40% of your      initial capital. Regardless, if you just hung on, you will have returned      to your $10K just as 2011 was coming around. That's a tough 3 years and your      confidence is shot - the news is fixated on Greece debt collapsing, then      Italy, then Spain, then the whole Eurozone! Oh no better sell, right?      Well, no. If you just hung on.. by end of 2013 when the S&P500 is back      to where it was when you started and your $10K is now nearly $15K. **And      you did absolutely nothing but hold on.**\n2. Now imagine you decided to      put $1,000 to start, and contribute the remaining $9000 in blocks - $1,500      at the start of every new year. Same allocation as above: [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2007&firstMonth=1&endYear=2013&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=1000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=1500&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1\\_1=50&symbol2=QQQ&allocation2\\_1=50](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2007&firstMonth=1&endYear=2013&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=1000&annualOperation=1&annualAdjustment=1500&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=SPY&allocation1_1=50&symbol2=QQQ&allocation2_1=50)  \nSo what happened? By October 2007, you were up a measly $1,192 which is      still almost 20% but only of $1K.. and you have $9K sitting around doing      nothing. But then you stay on schedule and deposit $1,500 every year.. even      when the news is telling you the world is collapsing and you end up with      $20K at the end of 2013 - a total 200% return on your $10K or an insane      50% cumulative annual growth rate.\n\nNow, you can either focus taking the lazy investing route and spend your energy on maximizing how much you put in (i.e. your day job/savings). Or you can take the more challenging/rewarding route of spending time fine tuning which stocks you put it into. If you replace the above SPY/QQQ with AAPL/GOOG you would have and even more impressive return..

Anytime a company beats even the most optimistic earnings for a quarter, you should be more confident than you were the day before, week before, etc. because that is a new, *highly* important piece of information. It validates your investment thesis, your expectations for their future growth, your confidence in the company, etc. just a little bit more every single time they post killer earnings. \n\nLast week, just like the week before basically every earnings report from NET, we weren't *certain* that they'd absolutely kill it. There's always uncertainty, and that uncertainty should be priced in. I'm not claiming that NET should've gone up from the earnings or that the market was wrong or anything like that - but I am arguing that *not only* is NET a great buy right now because, as you said, it's dipped slightly ($5-10), but that even if it had not dipped at all, anyone who was willing to buy at $95 last week should be willing to buy at $95-100 this week, because the only thing that's changed is *good news*/*results* coming out. \n\nSo to everyone who is attacking you for calling this a dip: understand that this is all within the context of the killer earnings report coming out.

Every company that has been around long enough has eventually experienced a mean reversion to the multiples in its sector (PEG, price to earnings adjusted for growth, is what I tend to look at for in growth stocks, however this company has never been profitable so I will use P/S, price to sales, instead). NET‚Äôs largest competitors are AMZN and MSFT, with P/S ratios of 4.33 and 12.23, respectively. Net currently has a P/S ratio of 59.86. MSFT is more focused on software and cloud computing, so they are likely a better comparison in the case. NET still trades 5x higher than MSFT by this metric, and MSFT is currently trading significantly above their average P/S ratio of about 6 over the last 10 years. You are paying a big premium for NET compared to its biggest competitors.\n\n- I don‚Äôt see how NET is innovating more than its competitors. MSFT and AMZN both have far more infrastructure for their CDNs, comparable DDoS protection services, network gateways, DNS, more authentication services, superior serverless computing, and fully functional/integrated webpage deployment (whereas Cloudflare barely launched its beta for Pages in Dec 2020, the beginning of their comparable service for this). It seems that Cloudflare is behind its top competitors in all of its primary products, and by quite a large margin. I have also worked with all three of these companies and their products in recent years, and can say that NET also felt like a distant third in this way.\n\n- Building off my two previous points, how can you be sure that NET will be one of the companies making money? They offer inferior products and services compared to their competitors, and are trading 5-10x more expensively (or perhaps more considering how you weigh profitability). \n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for exposure in this sector, NET seems like one of the worst investments in terms of risk-reward. All the reward seems to be priced in, while the risk of losing out on market share to its competitors does not seems to be. I don‚Äôt see how it overcomes its competition which have far more talent, infrastructure and resources to succeed in this sector, and even in its best case it will take over 10 years to catch up to its valuation if it maintains its current rate of growth.\n\nThis is not investment advice, invest if you want to.

{"title": "Thetagang Does NOT Mean You Aren't Taking a Massive Risk", "selftext": "I see a lot of new posters here talking about how they are a former WSB user, lost a lot of money, but now have outsized gains \"due to Thetagang.\" They then proceed to show CSP or even Credit Spread positions on tickers like AMC, TSLA, RIOT, PLTR, TLRY, etc. These users are still taking on massive risk. Let me explain.\n\nThe standard thetagang strategy is selling out-of-the-money puts on a ticker the user would not mind owning. By definition, these puts are less than 50 Delta meaning as the stock increases the strategy will profit at a rate of <50% of the underlying movement (this decreases as the stock goes up more). However, you still have all the downside of the stock. This means if we get an extended downturn or even a prolonged pullback, you are open to all the downside of these uber-growth stocks that **historically perform the worst in the bear market**. \n\nThetagang tends to reduce volatility on a given underlying at the expense of some returns. However, if you are targeting at +200% IV underlying, you should still expect a very high portfolio volatility. That works great when we have the longest raging bull market in history. However, if this thing turns down, you are going to be stuck holding WSB style loses with no ability to sell calls anywhere near your cost basis.\n\nAll I'm saying is you need to pay attention to the underlying and understand how you would feel if the stock shit the bed. If you don't have a plan for your meme stock dropping by +50% over the next year, you probably should reconsider your strategy.\n\nI personally have allocations to CSPs on GME. However, these are:\n\n1. Way OTM\n2. A small percentage of my portfolio\n3. A stock I would not mind owning if it cratered to $20, $10 or even $5 over the next 2-4 weeks.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying don't do these strategies.

The 28 strike is trading (as of this writing) at -0.2953 delta, with a premium of 3.05 (last traded), so we choose that as our target. We can sell four contracts at this strike, given our decision to commit to $11,200 (4 \\* 100 \\* 28  = 11,200). We collect a premium of $1,220. Our buying power is reduced to $8,800. We have a \\~10:1 risk/reward ratio (because we need to be prepared to lose 100% if PLTR drops to zero and we get assigned).\n\nNow lets try it with PCS. We look at the spreads and decide to backstop our 28 sale with a 26 buy. A single contract spread is selling for $0.93 (midpoint of 0.77 and 1.09 as of this writing). Since we have 11,200 to play with, we can sell 104x 26/28 Mar21 PCS for a net credit of $9,672 with a max exposure of 11,128. Our risk/reward ratio is 1.15:1. Our buying power is reduced to $8,872.\n\nBoth scenarios have about \\~62% chance of max profit, and both break even around the $27-ish mark. The PCS scenario obviously produces more potential profit.\n\nBut there are additional benefits to PCS. First, lets assume we want both PCS and CSP to provide the same amount of premium. We'll limit the PCS play to $1,220 premium collected. This means that we'll be able to sell 13 26/28 Mar21 PCS for $1,209, with a max exposure of $1,391 and the same 1.15:1 risk/reward ratio. Additionally, we incur a hit to BP of only that $1,391, which means we still have $18,609 in BP remaining after the trade.\n\nWhy is this important? It means we can put 7or 8 similarly-sized plays in action for the same $11,200 we intended to commit at the outset. The intelligent choice would be to put in motion plays across widely-diverse segments of the economy. While the benefits of diversity should be obvious, I'll explain it anyway -- it means that for the CSP, I have to be right 100% of the time to make money. Who is right 100% of the time? For the PCS, with 7 plays in motion at once, I only have to be right 57% of the time. Given that the probability of any profit with the PCS as described above are 67% (taking this from the Power eTrade screen, btw), the odds are in my favor that no matter what PLTR does, I am not likely to lose money over all of these plays.\n\nSo, you ask me, \"what would ScarletHark do?\" It should be obvious what I would do, and I turn the question around to you -- what would YOU do?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So you prefer PCSs to CSPs?

It's super profitable.**\n\n* This play creates about a 0.70% (+/- 0.30%) per week premium.  Currently about $100 per call.  \n   * I set aside about \\~30% of the premium in case I need to roll.\n   * I reinvest about 50% on more TQQQ.  In a taxable account, you should set aside \\~20% or so for taxes.   In a tax-protected account, you can increase the overall growth by reinvesting more.\n\n**FAQs about TQQQ:** \n\nI've heard that [TQQQ is widely held to be an unsuitable instrument for long term investment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thecorporation/comments/lg063f/some_tqqq_tips/)  (Credit to [u/madmax\\_br5](https://www.reddit.com/user/madmax_br5/) for this part)  \n\nVolatility drag does not decay leveraged instruments enough to bleed significant value.   \n\n* It is true that leverage will cause some drag in certain market conditions, but the examples often cited show unrealistic market behavior of daily 5% up/downswings in the underlying index for long periods of time. This does not match the trending realities of indexes, which tend to operate in periods of uptrend and periods of consolidation. Highly volatile sideways markets are not an example case that is replicated in real market data.\n\nTQQQ as a 3X fund could ***not*** be wiped out in a single day.\n\n* Daily leverage reset means that declines experience negative compounding and are thus asymptotic in nature.\n* The only way TQQQ could go completely bankrupt is if the market had a 33.3% or greater crash ***in a single day***.  Not only has this never happened in history (the worst single-day drop ever was a [22.6% drop in 1987)](https://money.cnn.com/2017/10/19/investing/romans-numeral-black-monday/index.html), but it is now impossible thanks to a 20% market-wide circuit breaker.\n\nHigh fees ***do not*** offset the advantage of leverage.\n\n* This is nonsense. The annual fee rate of 0.95% is actually incredibly reasonable considering you get 3X leverage for this price of entry. \n\nLet's do some backtesting courtesy of [portfoliovisualizer.com](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/). \n\n**Here is a \"BUY AND HOLD\" backtest on TQQQ**\n\n[$10,000 grows to $588,657 for a CAGR of 49.8&#37; over a decade](https://preview.redd.it/qbvz8oa6pbh61.png?width=2661&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfe58fc7181c1ff97ccc2e5832070c886f04c6a4)\n\n**Here is a backtest of buying $10,000 of TQQQ in 2011 and letting it ride.**  \n\n[$10,000 investment grew to $588,657 in a decade with a \\\\\"buy-and-hold\\\\\" strategy.](https://preview.redd.it/bmy9pnirmbh61.png?width=2649&format=png&auto=webp&s=42a123e076745d0ed667f0bb12b4bbef4aef6d90)\n\n**Here is a backtest of buying $10,000 of TQQQ in 2011 and selling 0.25 - 0.34 delta weekly covered calls at \\~7 DTE, reinvesting 50% of the premium, and rolling to avoid assignment.**\n\n[$10,000 grew to $1,033,016 by selling weekly 0.25 - 0.34 delta TQQQ covered calls at \\~7 DTE, reinvesting 50&#37; of the premium, and rolling to avoid assignment.

Moving ahead with investments would require approval by the firm and regulators.\n\nMorgan Stanley‚Äôs affirmation would put the heft of an almost-century-old marquee Wall Street name behind a volatile asset class that‚Äôs still struggling to win acceptance in much of the traditional financial industry. But a four-fold jump in four months has stoked customers‚Äô interest, making the digital asset even harder to ignore.\n\nAfter catching the attention of hedge fund moguls including Alan Howard and Paul Tudor Jones, cryptocurrencies have recently made headway with more mainstay firms such as Mastercard Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. Just this week, Tesla Inc, the leading maker of electric cars, also got behind Bitcoin with a $1.5 billion investment and plans to start accepting the cryptocurrency as payment.\n\nA spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The review could ultimately result in Morgan Stanley opting to stay away from Bitcoin. Previous rallies in the cryptocurrency have also attracted flurries of Wall Street interest only to fizzle.\n\nMuch of the industry‚Äôs skepticism centers on Bitcoin‚Äôs unpredictable price swings and the lack of things it can buy more than a decade since its creation. But faithful followers have felt vindicated this year. Billions of dollars have been pouring into the cryptocurrency through vehicles including the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\n\nEven institutional investors, barred by the rules of their funds from holding Bitcoin directly, have turned to such trusts. For Wall Street firms, an inability to offer Bitcoin to those clients raises the risk of losing them to other managers. That may spark fresh discussions in the industry about opening up to the asset.\n\nCounterpoint Global, led by Dennis Lynch, has expanded with a simple-sounding mantra of betting on unique companies whose market value can increase significantly. Enthusiasts would argue that approach fits well with Bitcoin.\n\nThe group oversees about 19 funds, of which five delivered gains in excess of 100% in 2020. Its mutual funds have consistently made the top tier of rankings in recent years. Last year‚Äôs unusually high returns were aided by bets on companies benefiting from the pandemic, such as e-commerce and streaming entertainment. Prominent investments included [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc., Shopify Inc., Slack Technologies Inc., Zoom Video Communications Inc. and Moderna Inc.\n\nDespite its size, the group relies on concentrated investments and has stakes in just about 200 companies.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "So the whole investing arm is 150B.

That‚Äôs insane. What does that mean? There is money that needs a return and it sure as hell isn‚Äôt getting it sitting in the bank. That money will go into the real estate market and the stock market. People will be worried about hyperinflation but it‚Äôs unlikely to happen when you print tons of money in a pretty stagnant economy. Without the velocity of money increasing along with the rate of brrrrrr we won‚Äôt have hyper inflation as you‚Äôve read about in Germany and other places. \n\nThere will probably be some assets that do inflate. They‚Äôll be the ones that rich people buy. All this printed money isn‚Äôt going to poor people. They will be most hurt by this because the rich will benefit by their rising asset prices and the poor will suffer because their wages won‚Äôt go up and housing will become increasingly unobtainable. If you are waiting for a housing market crash so you can buy... good luck. \n\nThe government has created the greatest stimulus for people who own assets probably in history. Own real estate? You‚Äôll be fine as long as you can cover your payments and your lender doesn‚Äôt foreclose on you because you can‚Äôt find a paying tenant. Cap rates are super low. For those unfamiliar, a cap rate is how you value a property based on cash flow. Making $100k in net income from rentals and the market puts a 6% cap rate (expected return on value) then the building will be worth $100k/0.06= $1.67m. If you have the same income and interest rates are down and so are cap rates and the new market cap rate is 4%, then congratulations, your building is now worth $100k/.04=$2.5M. Cant raise rates because of all the debt. \n\nIn other words, money was chasing yield (return) precovid. Now it is starved for yield, so people are forced to take a lower return and the value of assets goes up. So if you were happy making 6% owning some safe rental buildings but want to keep making that return you need to add risk to bring that 4% return up. Buy some equities. \n\nThat said, if you look at TLT you‚Äôll see that rates are actually rising (indicated by a falling tlt value) somewhat surprisingly because the market is seeing risk rising. This is an important thing to watch because if rates keep rising the free money party will start charging admission at the door. \n\n\nIf you are some rich guy flush with cash because your assets are inflating, what do you do? Buy physical goods like real estate but also classic cars, art, watches, etc. I have a collection of vintage watches that I bought as about a 5 year hold. The watch portfolio age is just about a year or so (as far as my ownership. They are all from the 1960s). I must be up 20% on them and I think there is more gain to come there. I see it as similar to owning metals but with actual utility because I can wear them too. \n\nWhere does this brrrrr money go? It‚Äôll keep pumping the market. Along the way there will be several shocks to it (look at the chart end of 2018 for example) where the market goes, oh shit things are not alright. This will crush leveraged investors who can‚Äôt delever quickly and the paper hands out there. We‚Äôll have shocks and then the market will shrug its shoulders and carry on until something truly causes an uncoupling. I don‚Äôt see what stops it until wealth inequality reaches truly dire proportions. \n\nThe scary thing is that Trump was a symptom of the anger people have of segments of society being left behind. Some large amount of the idiots arrested from the Jan 6 stupid-coup have a history of financial troubles. I don‚Äôt know how this ends but the have nots are not going to have a good time. \n\nWhat to do? Well, I‚Äôve gone from being very much in cash at the start of 2020 to being fully invested plus I‚Äôm currently running with my account leveraged by 20% but if you add the notional value of leaps Im also holding which are mostly ITM now my account‚Äôs exposure in double my cash value of it. I‚Äôm riding this train until it stops. I have 50-something positions and each week I move my stop orders up as the market rises. It‚Äôs much harder than people realize to trade out when stuff starts tanking but I‚Äôm hoping enough stops hit to protect my principal. Can it go down and wack my stops and the moon? Sure. But I‚Äôm running on leverage so it‚Äôll just deleverage me and having so many positions and so many different levels for stops should help me not be too paper hands. \n\nI don‚Äôt yolo but I do consider about 5% of my account to be for very risky option plays but it‚Äôs playing with gains. I try to stick with things I‚Äôll hold long terms but I‚Äôve also bought a lot of EV shit that has mooned and will likely go to zero someday because not all these EV companies are going to survive. Likely few will. But with goev for example, I‚Äôm in from $10. Im dumping of it goes down to $14 and will never look back. Still a nice return. If it keeps going up I‚Äôll just hold and hold. Margin is only like 2% so why dump anything that keeps going up until it goes parabolic like weed stocks did this week. You have to take profit on moves like that. \n\nAnyways, add slowly until you are in a position where you have gains. Then you have cushion to add more risk. Capital preservation first.

Not only that you have to take a tax hit when selling assuming you are booking a profit and then try to find something that can make up for that. If it‚Äôs 1-3 units buildings then I don‚Äôt think it can qualify for a 1031 exchange so you can sell and then buy different property and dodge the tax. You could probably find an Opportunity Zone deal if you had cap gains on them but again you‚Äôd just be moving from one real estate thing to another. \n\nAlso, it sounds like you probably control these properties so anything else you do with the money would involve giving control to someone else (CEO‚Äôs and the market in the case of stocks and property developers who can go bust on an Ozone).\n\nI think it depends on if you have danger due to leverage. If they are owned free and clear you can‚Äôt really get hurt and could presumably survive periods of some vacancy. You mentioned they are pretty much paid for. Are rents trending down on them for some reason? That might be the only reason to sell I can think of or if the return isn‚Äôt great and they are a lot of work to manage. \n\nI think the single best way to create generational wealth is to own residential rental buildings. It‚Äôs a future goal to get something like an 8+ unit building. If you can get the leverage down then in theory your basis shrinks every year and the rents slowly go up. Ten years later your return on principal should have grown because the property is generating more revenue and increasing in value because of that. \n\nI work in real estate so I‚Äôm biased toward real estate. I just have three rentals. The first two I own 50/50 with a friend (highly not recommended but it‚Äôs worked out for us). We got two foreclosures in 2012 and fixed them up. 2012 was the bottom in the market we bought in and it was pretty scary to buy at the time but we got these houses at literally 30 cents on the dollar in terms of replacement cost. They have gone up a little more than double in value since but since construction costs have soared they are still well under replacement cost. They are located in fairly small towns that are blue collar. There will never be the bidding wars that people are seeing elsewhere but we own them free in clear and get a nice return on capital. \n\nSpeaking of replacement costs. Go look at hart of lumber prices. Construction costs are up so much that in the short term there is little risk of supply of housing flooding the market.\n\nSometimes I worry about them being in small towns but we keep finding tenants any time someone leaves and we could never replace the return without more risk, which is why we‚Äôll never sell. The rent has already paid us back on our principal so why not just hold forever and have the income? I think a key thing with rentals is that they generate enough income to handle their own repairs. We‚Äôve had years of replacing roof, windows, floors, HVAC systems, basement floods, etc. We‚Äôve never had a year with a negative NOI because we aren‚Äôt paying a mortgage. This situation is the goal with rentals. \n\nTo your last question, refi if you haven‚Äôt already and try to lock in a fixed rate. Look at short term mortgages too because it can be a good deal. I went from a 30yr on my house to a 15. The rate drop meant my payment only went up like $6000/yr but I‚Äôm saving like $2000/yr in interest. Rough numbers from memory but you get the idea. That‚Äôs a great return on the extra capital so it‚Äôs a way to add a slow build to wealth. \n\nMy third rental is a little office condo. My lease was ending and I stumbled on this thing in the perfect location. It‚Äôs almost an exact tradeoff from rent to now paying a mortgage and the carry cost. I believe I got a great deal on it because i put it under contract before any vaccines were announced. I now own the thing and not even using it until we all get the vaccine but long term I think it‚Äôs good. My risk money is my down payment but me paying myself rent instead of a landlord means I‚Äôm paying down principal at a rate of 10% of my down payment a year. That‚Äôs worth it. Another slow build to wealth that wouldn‚Äôt happen if I rented instead. Also there is like $5k worth of work to do that I think adds $15-20k of value. \n\nWith your rentals is there opportunity to spruce them up over time and raise rental rates? \n\nDo the math on what it‚Äôs adding to you net worth through tax savings and expected appreciation not just income.", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Michael Burry seems to think it'll happen but he always thinks that", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fed, stimmy, money on the sidelines going back into the market, new people getting into the market (Schwab said they created 100% more new accounts in Jan 21‚Äô vs Jan 20‚Äô), all the extra saved money from Americans ready to go on a spending spree when everything is reopened.\n\nA broken clock is right twice a day, eventually these üåà üêªs will be right but it ain‚Äôt anytime soon.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Fucken‚Äô stimmy puts üôå", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I‚Äôve always followed a conservative strategy (value investor) but switched to an aggressive strategy in the past months, here are the main two reasons: \n\n1.

Yea for sure. But the entire market? Not really and definitely not currently. \n\nTo begin let's come up with a few big examples. 2008 wasnt a bubble it was more fraud on a massive scale closer to an Enron disaster than anything else. \n\n2000 dot com \"bubble\"  was a bunch of events that occurred perfectly at the same time to cause a panic. Fed raised rates bonds were at 6% and Microsoft lost antitrust. A few large moves caused by those things caused people with very little knowledge to all panic together.\n\n\nCrash of 1929 isnt comparable either. 10-1 leverage was the norm back then and the technology that existed for trading back caused downtrend to happen over a longer period of time and last a lot longer. You just cant compare the time to now although you can learn about it and try to come up with lessons.\n\nHonestly I think anyone who is super bearish right now for this year just never took macroeconomics or never paid attention. \n\nBonds are fucking trash right now. The dollar is fucking trash right now. Interest rates are literally non existent AND they're clearly keeping them at that level for at least half a year or more. Stimulus is on some level guaranteed. A large portion of the economy spent the entire last year SAVING far more than normal. The COVID recession wasnt a recession for most people. Frankly the only people who got hurt by it were those in tourism and service industries. The average middle- upper middle class American is actually better off in the last year and many of them either were forced to save more money. Many companies were able to reduce overhead by pivoting how they do business because of Corona and a lot of the is structural change that reduces costs that will stick around making companies more profitable, and wages for their employees higher. \n\nThen let's note the fact that ALL this is occurring right during a time when for the first time EVER its incredibly easy to become a \"trader\" there are half a dozen super accessible brokerages that you can monitor constantly on your PHONE, information about trading, finance, and economics is cheaper or free and insanely easy to access and learn in today's era. So you've got people literally accidentally being forced to save money coupled with no where else to put their money except the stock market during a time when everyone is bored and can literally make a new hobby out of brokerage apps. All of this combined causes more basically more inflow of money than we've ever had in history into markets from both retail and other sectors. Not to mention it's far easier for people to learn finance than it ever has been and far more people are seeing the benefits of at least being interested in the basics. We're literally witnessing a massive cultural movement where people are adding investing to their interests. It was actually really pathetically glossed over particularly in America compared to what it should be on a cultural level and so that's playing into this as well.\n\nWhat else do we have? \n\nWe are living through something that is equivalent to the industrial revolution. We are seeing the technology era START yes I said start manifest its potential. What do I mean? We are going through an exciting period of really high amounts of VALUE ADDING. We are adding value to almost everything that exists at a rate that is staggering. During the dot com crash one thing that gets thrown around a lot was that there was too much optimism around concepts that were premature. This is probably true. However it's far less true this time. Think of some great examples of old overvalued companies in the past pets.com ring a bell? It wasnt feasible when only half the country was even accessing the internet on fucking dial up and shipping hadn't been streamlined into the logistics algorithms and highly efficient low cost environment for sending items that we have today by comparison. Honestly there a million examples of this but we're at a really important intersection in history where 5G, smart phone capabilities, computing power, low computer hardware costs with increasingly higher capabilities compared to previous years are all creating an environment where we are able to do this MUCH cheaper than we used to. All this does is put more money in peoples pockets and that money really is only getting put back into markets.\n\n To put things into perspective I always hear overly generalized articles on how we're in a bubble or runaway valuations but go do some research and look at companies that dont have the same infinite scaling opportunities. Are they overvalued? Is boeing overvalued? Maybe if you're savagely bearish and know something noone else does but otherwise most traditional \"boomer\" companies really are pretty fairly valued. They exist in a box and their ability for growth is in that box and is fairly simplistic and easy to predict. Modern tech companies are not comparable at all in such a way. A company that can \"infinitely\" scale its customers while remaining fairly fixed in costs is quite a different set of rules. When you get into examples like TSLA the answer to its price is so insanely complex that you have to remember you're dealing with thousands and thousands of events that led to it being where it is. The simplest answer to TSLA is it's not a car company. It's really not. It owns all the dealerships it owns all the \"gas stations\" charging stations, it owns battery production as well as many other parts that it can even sell to competitors. It's also constantly innovating and creating other moonshot like products. Think the tesla solar roof. People are looking to the future and saying that based on the direction the world is heading in tesla is positioned to benefit from the global shift to EV in a way that makes it the biggest \"car\" company in the world. \n\nRemember all this value adding is happening while there is simultaneously more money to go into securities than ever AND more demand for those securities than ever. Shit even real estate is crazy expensive right now because of lack of supply for the most part except in areas of the country that people are fleeing. Stocks are just the only real place for anyone to put money and despite the \"simplistic\" version of COVID a very non insignificant number of people actually ended up making more money last year. The biggest question you should have is not \"is this a bubble?\" But when are these conditions that are creating heightened demand for securities likely to change? What kind of events could trigger a large scale exit? Pretty simple. Other alternatives, bonds, savings rates that are higher etc. \n\nBasically anytime you try and call a bubble you better be Michael burry and have some pretty serious damn evidence outside of just numbers are big. Again what happened in 2008 was banks were defrauding the entire country by labeling mortgage backed securities as much higher quality than they actually were. He actually noticed it and figured out a way to make money.  There will always be individual companies that are too high of a price because something hasn't come out yet about their realistic prospects. For instance I think doordash is shit even though I use it from time to time I think its retardedly expensive to use doordash and i cant imagine it working in a long term outlook when the country goes back to normal. However I do live somewhere where people eat at restaurants all the time still and I guess I still order sometimes but I think people will cut way back comparatively. \n\nBut seriously when it comes to traditional media articles about the stock market learn to let about 90% of what they try to stick as reasons for what happened in the stock market out of your ear. They claimed the market closed lower the other week because it was reacting to the \"gamestop speculation\"... what an unbelievably easily refuteable load of crap. They do that all the time. It's just the finance version of click bait. If the entire world was just quiet for a day and stocks also went down theyd just blame it on the weather. \n\nI think there are pretty exceptional reasons to be bullish this upcoming year. Even if people stop putting money into stocks as heavily you're going to have them going out and spending like crazy making the economy look like its bouncing back really hard which will happen. I actually believe this will be a pretty rare moment in our lifetimes and I think the opportunity cost of inaction right now in the markets is unbelievably high compared to even what a full scale correction in the market would cost.

I don‚Äôt want to seem argumentative, but I disagree on why 2008 was so bad.  The subprime credit bubble was connected to other parts of the economy and financial system in ways that were unexpected until they were a disaster. I agree the catalyst was essentially fraud, but the reason it had such an impact was the high flying nature of the industry in the 10 years leading up to it. \n\nHonestly after reading a lot of things similar to what you said over the last couple weeks, I agree the next year or couple years should be good. Mostly imo because governments have fully committed to prop up markets. I think it feels like a bubble because it is a bubble - if the economy recovers quickly and takes off we might grow into the bubble rather than have it pop? In terms of tech companies it‚Äôs interesting because what you are saying sounds true and I‚Äôve also thought the same thing. We have the technological infrastructure for some of these ideas to really turn into businesses now. It feels like we are in a revolutionary time for industry and tech.

Honestly the foreseeable events I could see destroying the status quo in markets or (bursting) the bubble would be dramatic changes from the government, a threat of a major war like China vs US, any kind of drastic change in foreign policy sector like china randomly goes back to isolation lol, another disease except one that like truly threatens all humanity not just like a portion that is vulnerable and we dont have options to treat it like we do Covid. Some kind of actually unprecedented weather event like solar flares that radically change the earth and cause crops to die? One last thing I can easily think of would be if the money printing from the government finally had the domino effect that gold enthusiasts are always looking out for and we had runaway inflation or a complete lack of faith in American monetary system occurred. China sold off all its bonds rapidly etc. Once an event like that was clearly occurring we would have some sort of bubble burst without a doubt\n\nI always assume there will be a few crazy days in the market in any given year like a 10% correction or more even if it seems totally random. Maybe the algorithms got into a new feedback loop that wasnt caught and it causes a crash on a level like December 2018. \n\nThe one thing I'll say about the COVID crash last year was there definitely were plenty of people on here who predicted it and I had a massive jealousy boner watching their put gains at the time. That was right before I really had started investing. But I think WSB is so big its definitely capable of all level of crazy ideas and frankly I'd be surprised if the idea of whatever would cause a crash wouldnt pop up here a month or two beforehand so we might get our warning! \n\nThe one positive thing as well is that in this insane technological era we have really low latency for trading and information being shared compared to all of the last 100 years so I think it's sort of shortened the business cycle in a sense and makes crashes shorter, recoveries quicker, bull markets quicker. All of that. Basically the reactivity of markets is also higher along with everything I mentioned in my other comment and its causing the movements to be a little more dramatic but they also are followed by the respective reversal trend quicker.

But yeah I think those prices in the real estate market itself COULD have been supported IF the buying pressure that existed in the decade leading up to the crashes hadn't been inauthenticity manufactured by banks. The banks didnt want to lose their cash cow of the MBS and so they stimulated demand by drastically loosening standards (the government also helped accidentally lower lending standards in the late 90s) everyone looked the other way because they were all getting filthy rich and the banks literally lied about the quality of the mortgages that they were selling. However if the buying in the real estate market had been legitimate then there wouldnt have actually been a bubble. \n\nIt's kinda like how California real estate is in a bubble in a certain sense because of the open spaces act that artificially limits supply. If they got rid of it prices would fall dramatically.

A side by side comparison with the model Y by a popular car reviewer revealed that the tech in the Tesla is better, the performance is better, but the Ford just seems better built.  Tesla also has serious scaling issues.  Other car companies have much larger production capabilities, however they are all going to struggle with battery suppliers being able to keep up with demand.

{"title": "AMD and Intel DD", "selftext": "With the pandemic still going on and everyone needing more computers than ever and the ongoing trade war with China, there is a severe Chip shortage.\n\nOn Thursday, the CEOs of the major Chip producers (Intel, AMD, QCOM) have sent a letter to Biden that he should sent out an executive order to adress this shortage. ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage))\n\nI see three different scenarios:\n\n1. Biden gives an executive order to build improve and increase the domestic chip foundries. This would be most bullish for Intel, since they are the only company with foundries in the USA. This would also help AMD and QCOM, since they would most likely that access to cheaper chips.\n2. Biden lifts the trade restrictions set on semiconductors. This would mean that AMD and QCOM would get access to cheaper chips, but it would not solve the shortage of silicon so it is unlikely to happen. This would be bullish for AMD and Qualcomm, but it would not change the situation for Intel.\n3. Biden does not do anything and the shortage will continue. If Biden does this nothing will be changed, it will be neither good or bad from Intel and AMD. AMD will still keep growing at a massive rate and Intel will still be a cash cow.\n\nSo regardless of what happens, I am very bullish on the semiconductor industry. I expect Biden to start ramping up semiconductor manufacturing the USA, because of his tough stance on China. At the moment almost all of the semiconductor industry is relying on Taiwan, and with the Chinese involvement in that country, it is very likely that their is bipartisan support for increasing semiconductor manufacturing domestically.\n\nAdvice: if you want to play this, buy calls that are at least 2 to 3 months out, or buy shares.\n\nMy positions:\n\nINTC shares @ 50.50\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, before buying anything, please do your own research.", "id": "liyay9", "created_utc": 1613212874.0, "score": 137, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 139, "comments": [{"body": "Been holding AMD since $40.

In 2017 AMD released their zen architecture, and soon after they released zen 2 architecture. They were a commercial success in a time where AMD had something like 10% of all sales or less. Intell fell behind and is not catching up.\nBefore that, AMD really invested in using PCIe lanes to connect two (or maybe more) processors in the future together. PCIe is an open standard that is used by tons of companies. Intel uses their weird proprietary standard, that has real issues in terms of performance. When AMD needs more performance between chips they just use more PCIe lanes.\nSpeaking of which, those PCIe lanes are also used to connect high-speed fibreoptic networking equipment. The latest version of PCIe is 4.0, only supported with AMD cpu's. Intel who also makes network cards, had to delay their newest generation network card because it had no intel processor with PCIe 4.0.\n\nRemember that AMD has experience with graphics cards? Yeah the sales for that sucked, but it gave them something else. They have some graphics cards which uses so called HBM memory. Memory that's faster than regular computer memory. This means they have some experience and  technology in house to mitigate an anticipated problem with next gen computers. They have experience with GDDR memory, with DDR, and with HBM. Intel has experience with DDR memory only. There are also rumors that some of that fancy memory will end up on the newer generation AMD chips, boosting their performance even more. I don't remember Intel being that innovative since the forced jump to 64 bit processors that AMD caused them to do about 20 years back.\n\nIntel seems to still be investing heavily in chips that have less cores but higher speed per core, and AMD seems to do thesame, plus they just double the amounth of cores Intel uses. This gives AMD an edge because they just have to double the core count to keep up with intel which is easy for them now, and then every other thing will put them further ahead.\n\nRight now, the fastest server chip is a ‚Ç¨7.000,- AMD chip costing 30% less than the best Intel chip. It also has twice the performance. \nSo to get similar performance you'd have to spend ‚Ç¨20.000,- on Intel chips. People who build datacenters know this, and they are switching over to AMD. Some are still grasping to intel out of historic bias, but that'll die off over the years.\nThe enteusiast consumer switched already, or plans to when their next pc dies. (These are the people you ask what your next pc should be for ‚Ç¨500,- , and they'll probably will recommend AMD from now on.) AMD seems to be also rising on the laptop market, although I don't really have any sales data on that. Only in a select few workloads is it still favourably on Intel, and I can only see that dwindling.\n\nThis all AMD in an immensely greater position than Intel. Please correct me if I said something wrong.\n\nOn a sidenote, I'd personally like to invest in a chip producer called SiFive if I could.\n\nSource: I had to find out what servers we had to buy for the next few years for my then employer.

{"title": "DD: Cloudflare (NET) is going to continue its strong outperformance. Buy the dip", "selftext": "Alright guys. This is going to be long, but if you want actual DD, sit back and enjoy. NET is doing excellent, and will only continue to excel as it continues to grab market share and boom in the background.\n\n**---**\n\n**What is Cloudflare?**\n\nCloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:\n\n>‚ÄúImagine you‚Äôre the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  \nPage speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...¬†¬†you‚Äôre going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter‚Äù\n\nSeriously, this is cool, and it‚Äôs only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what‚Äôs going to help them into a powerhouse is this:\n\n>Over the coming months, we‚Äôll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It‚Äôll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we‚Äôll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won‚Äôt just be your frontend, it‚Äôll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.\n\nSoon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare‚Äôs network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they‚Äôll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not a developer, you probably didn‚Äôt understand most of that, but essentially, they‚Äôre making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.\n\nI can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it‚Äôs profitability... üöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n(And even if it doesn‚Äôt, and stays at 50%, it will still üöÄ but slower. Regardless, it‚Äôs going up)\n\n\\---\n\n‚ÄúBuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs‚Äù\n\nThat drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren‚Äôt long. Plus it‚Äôs hardly a tank when it‚Äôs at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher\n\nIts earnings was good, and to those who haven‚Äôt read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock‚Äôs immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:\n\n>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings\n\nRevenue right now is $125 million. Doesn‚Äôt sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that‚Äôs $1 billion a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion\n\nYes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm long Jan 21 115c.\n\nThe revenue and growth isn‚Äôt the impressive part. The margins are\n\n>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nHigh 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they‚Äôre going to be **raking** in dough\n\nThat being said, NET isn‚Äôt profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they‚Äôve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn‚Äôt stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there‚Äôs nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here‚Äôs why:\n\n\\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‚Äò22\n\n\\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare‚Äôs network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.\n\n\\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.\n\n‚Äî-\n\n**CONS**\n\nThe only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I‚Äôm a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there‚Äôs no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don‚Äôt matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild a Better Internet‚Äù shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare‚Äôs already enormous Cloudflare network.\n\nThis stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren‚Äôt in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I‚Äôm trying to be conservative here).\n\nSeriously, give this a second look. I‚Äôve been playing NET since 37. It‚Äôs a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn‚Äôt done its 30% move.

The push for NoSQL based database is just not the only factor. They are forcing the industry to adapt their product. They are doing a pretty good job if you ask me. So, what can you do? If they do some solid acquisitions they are bound to be more successful.\n\n> Cloudflare is run by greedy bastards but it is wildly succesful. Even though I am against them for ethical and moral reasons I only foresee green dildoes on Cloudflare! What I hate about Cloudflare is that you have to proxy your traffic through them, essentially al your client data is now cloudflare-tunnel data. This is a big concern in privacy and having a single point of failure at the front. Big yes on Cloudflare (but fuck them too in the future, they do not deserve to be around in 2030).\n\nAnother valid point as well friend. But I hope you do remember when Cloudflare crushed last year that literally took the fucking internet with them. Talk about product adoption. Shit company with shit tech, but monopolies can be bad yet they are profitable. Cloudflare is bound to become a monopoly.\n\n> Fastly.... fuck if I know how they 're doing. They were willing to offer us far better prices than AWS back in 2016 which was very nice of them. I just told them we would pay them less, and they cut down the price even more (pays to act alpha)! The performance (network speeds) was far better than Cloudfront back then, and their caching policy was superior too (better than the default 2 weeks in hot cache cloudfront crap). But we dropped them due to the convenience AWS offered, and I would expect other companies to rely on whatever CDN their cloud provider is giving them, dropping or not even considering signing up with fastly. Actually, I had no idea they IPOed, I 'd expect them to be a much smaller company. Might be an interesting play but do not have enough data. Amazon will eventually kill them.\n\nFastly is a company I am not that familiar with much. But from my understanding of cloud platforms is that if one of the big three (AWS, GCP or Azure) where to separate itself from their parent company and issued their own IPO all these cloud or cloud associated companies will fall. We value FSLY or SNOW or any other cloud stock with proxy metric from AWS and Amazon's performance mainly. These companies are literally piggybacking big tech resources with some bells and whistles and nothing interesting to offer. Until Big tech's individual cloud platforms IPOs on itself (which is unlikely) these cloud tech stocks will thrive on the proxy success of them.\n\n\nIt was very nice to read your comment actually.

Yes, you can exercise **any** time until expiration because this is an American style option. European style options can only be exercised at expiration - I have almost no experience with how that works.\n\nYes, being the buyer of a put contract means you hold the actual right to sell 100 shares per contract at that strike. That fact doesn‚Äôt change. The only things that could change were if you didn‚Äôt own the shares prior to exercise, then the stock changing could affect how much you‚Äôd pay to get the shares to sell them.\n\nIf you are buying puts to hedge IE have the right to sell shares you already own then the math is very simple. You will be out the cost of the premium at the time of put buying - a constant. You don‚Äôt have to pay any more money to exercise, you now hold the rights to get 100*strike price for the cost of 100 shares at any time until expiration.\n\nFun fact, you can exercise contracts that are in the money up to a few hours after market close on that Friday of expiration. \n\nThat means if Tesla tanks at 4:30 becuase Elon tweets something you can call your broker and exercise those puts! The put-writer will be in for a nasty surprise if they saw it ‚Äúexpire worthless‚Äù at market close. This situation is called ‚Äúpin risk.‚Äù I‚Äôm just mentioning it becuase it‚Äôs an important market feature to undeftand for people who write options.\n\nRant aside, you are understanding correctly. When you‚Äôre buying a put to hedge actual shares your calculation is very simple. \n\nIs the premium per contract worth the security of mind of knowing you can sell your shares for that strike for the duration of contract?\n\nIf yes, hedge away. Of course if Tesla never goes down then your put will become worthless but of course you‚Äôre buying it in case it does go down so that is the expected situation.\n\nEdit: to answer your question more simply. Yes, you can exercise your contract at any time the share price is below strike. You also could exercise if the share price was above, but that wouldn‚Äôt make sense as you‚Äôd be selling shares below market. You still have the right to, though!

This is heavily broker dependent, but it is always better to act explicitly rather than depend on automatic behavior,\n\nSo, if you don‚Äôt want to exercise a contract - mark it lapse or sell it. There are hidden surprises such as pin risk. Options can be exercised after hours... \n\nimagine, you close your phone at 4pm Friday. Your calls you bought expired worthless so you sigh and log out. After 4PM the stock gaps up. Your broker auto exercises and you now own 100 shares at the strike price. Chances are you don‚Äôt have cash for it so you also have a margin call, an annoyed broker, and a requirement to sell the 100 shares on Monday morning.\n\nThis exact scenario happened with Amazon stock to my friend years ago. Luckily, Amazon continued to gap up so he actually profited off it lol, but it could have just as easily gone the other way like the guy on YouTube who had what he thought was max loss spread but lost around 10K iirc. \n\nIt‚Äôs always better to act intentionally and explicitly then react to chance.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Starting to get it, basically naked calls and puts you don‚Äôt own stock just want to bet.

So, if I sell a call - I‚Äôm selling someone the right to buy 100 shares at the strike. My sold call can be covered if I already own 100 shares since if I‚Äôm assigned then I‚Äôm just selling him my 100 shares.\n\nSimilarly, a put that I sell is basically me agreeing to buy 100 shares at the strike price. So, sold outs are covered by cash IE I sell you a put with a ten dollar strike: the stock goes below ten and you exercise, so I have to buy 100 shares from you for 1000 bucks leaving me less 1000 dollars but holding 100 shares.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "How do they work?

Taken the massive profit on QS and CCL. Putting much of them in longer dated calls on the ones of these I believe in including JD FUBO and PLTR, M NIO XPEV and WKHS. CCL needs to rest. \n\nIf FSLY goes down any further I won‚Äôt be able to discuss it because it‚Äôll be a penny stock üôÑ \n\nVXX highlights why I‚Äôm frustrated about this: theory was correct all the way around‚Äî treasury yield, sector rotation, etc. but the underlyings aren‚Äôt cooperating. Glad I picked further dates and recommended that as well. \n\nStill stand by the theory behind these just making them longer term if they‚Äôre shorter and averaging down. My leaps and shares are doing just fine in boomer oil. \n\nStay strong. Stay long. Soon the bears will be gone. \n\nPS- we need a better way for swing traders to update. I can‚Äôt track when I enter and exit here affective it. \n \n****\n\n**Update 2/18:** like the movement of the tech indices but sitting largely cash on my short swings now while those whole ‚Äòtaper tantrum‚Äô narrative figures itself out except for positions opened in $WKHS and JD near the bottom today. \n\nI don‚Äôt believe in buying puts and as such would rather wait it out than sell my soul\n\n**R-E-L-A-X: 2/18 MORNING UPDATE**\n**JD and WKHS getting high confidence flow. Agree or disagree, but reporting what I‚Äôm seeing. I am dip buying both \n\nWe were prepared for this:\n\n>\t**As money outflows from big tech this past week post-earnings, we are seeing an expansion of call flow into more speculative industries like again like weed, EV, and forgotten titans like industrials/cyclicals, so forth.**  AnAlYsTS will try to scare you in the coming weeks and say tech is overvalued and done‚Äîthis is untrue, but the outflow/inflow tides of the market will present plenty of transition pain dips that feel like corrections.\n\nThis is why we went longer dated than usual, per intro instructions. Keep your VXX, feel out price movement this morning and cut anything risky short-dated. The CCL and QS war chest was mighty. Don‚Äôt just jump on sales, let the flow tell you what‚Äôs being bought. I‚Äôll scan and drop some tickers in the morning. \n\nWealth has often been created on the back of 1DTE following a Thursday crash. \n\n*****\n\n**State of the DD: 2/17 update 12:22 PM**\n\n*please remember, these are WHALE plays. Follow the winners and cut the losers. High risk and high reward is what this is. If you are looking for the safe guaranteed growth stuff, grab some nice SPY leaps or something.*\n\nCongrats to those who stayed with CCL and played the QS ER callout. Those tendies have staved off starvation for a night.  These are the reason we play. \n\nThe PLTR rebound is indeed occurring with a boost from Cathie on CNBC as predicted. FUBO is also rebounding by strongly outperming the broader NASDAQ, and I expect continued performance with indices likely rebounding in the coming days. \n\n**FSLY calls are just absolutely fuk. Going to baghold some through ER as a Hail Mary.** Cant get much worse. Awful. I am ashamed. \n\nI am fine with the M price action for now. I am fine with VXX as it‚Äôs clearly needed rn. Trim a little each time it pops on VXX. \n\nI am holding off on that EV consideration for now except I opened a position in XPEV and NIO hoping post lunar new year buying will give us a little help in a beaten down industry. 2/26 ATM. TSLA has really turned it around today. \n\nStay strong. Prayers up for the little homie FSLY üò≠ \n\nPS bought the WKHS dip \n\n**2/17 PRE MARKET UPDATE**\n\nThe latest retail numbers were outstanding during the report this morning, which as an interesting side affect have caused a giant spike in the treasury yield. \n\nFor the uninitiated, higher treasury yields bring downward pressure on stocks. Will be watching closely to see if the yield flattens on the open. \n\nHope you grabbed the recommended VXX; as I mentioned the stubborn treasury yield could present some short term issues. \n\nFUBO flying premarket\n\nFSLY PLEASE FUCKING FLY\n\n****\n\n**The state of the DD: Update 1 2/16**\n\nWhen these positions open big, please wait for dips FYI. I believe in the plays, but you need to choose entry points with common sense discretion. \n\n**Correct** on the sector rotation into DOW/cyclicals. M hit decently, CCL smashed and saved my portfolio today with +9%\n\n**Incorrect**:IV wasn‚Äôt enough to save a very shit day from FSLY‚Äî the DAQ was a whipsaw today, though, so that didn‚Äôt help. \n\n**Incorrect but frustrating** FUBO got an announcement today that Comcast was buying a 9% investment stake, institutional money continued flowing in, yet it tanked. I guess the shorts are too strong. \nEDIT: monster AH movement from FUBO\n\n**How I moved** trimmed FSLY and FUBO but clutching still, and opened a big position in PSTH in the morning still holding. Holding CCL and M too. I update when I‚Äôm moving on twitter, but I can‚Äôt post that info here so maybe I‚Äôll just update here at the end of each day and maybe in the morning.  \n\nTo be seen: EV\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nHi.  Here's what I'm looking at headed into next week. **Shoutout to Unusual Whales who I‚Äôve spoken with and has given their blessing for me to provide these plays and screenshots. I recommend them bigly**\n\nI monitor flow on Barchart and Think or Swim\n\nI‚Äôve typically written about choosing close-dated plays, but I‚Äôm giving a little expiration room on these as I sense some sector rotation I want to feel out. \n\nBeen on a nice little streak with these of late, so I am overdue for an account correction lol.  This is not investment advice.\n\n*The whale plays I am interested in:*\n\n[FSLY 2/26 110c](https://i.imgur.com/U00vNOa.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ \n\nI like this for two reasons.  **The first is simple**: I've seen repeat call flow into FSLY building up over the past two weeks, and it just can't sustain the pops yet.  It's a similar pattern I saw to the DKNG and NIO calls before their pops.  *Continued betting OTM by whales gives me more confidence with each slip, and pressure for an upward pop is building.*. **The second reason** is the dump after the NET ER.  I love when sympathy plays get oversold, because it's easy entry into their earnings run.  \n\n**How I‚Äôm going to play it**: I'll follow the whale on a call spread up to 110 for 2/19, and ride it up until just before earnings Wednesday, then cut it.  Successful strategy I've been employing with tech earnings runs lately; last week I just closed my eyes and threw a dart at TWTR OTM calls and rode it up for about 100% the day of.  Sure, you miss out if earnings are a banger, but I have an increasingly strict no earnings rule.\n\n**Earnins run= yes.  Holding through earnings= no**\n\n[M 3/26 20c](https://i.imgur.com/ybj1GMB.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ \n\nEveryone always brushes aside my precious M plays but they are a quiet money-maker.  Once the dust has settled from the Great Memeing, M is back on watch again as a quiet beast finally waking up.  ER is on 2/23, and they have a couple things going for them, including:\n\n**1) The B of A BBBY upgrade**: [bulls are returning on BBBY now that the squeeze is over and their reasoning is strikingly similar to the M story](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyond-becomes-more-attractive-with-short-squeeze-over-b-of-a-says-11613076266).  Store closures?  Bullish.  Narrowly avoiding bankruptcy? Mega boolish.  But more importantly...\n**2) Digital integration**: the CEO of M is actually a solid leader, and has really pushed the transition to digital and online merchandising.  I think this pivot will gain more spotlight headed into ER.\n\n**How I‚Äôll play it**: M is a super streaky stock that can give you 8% return multiple days in a row, but can also frustratingly do the opposite.  It also tends to really crater in the mornings before stabilization and rising late in the day.  I will give this manic whale a chance on the 3/26c, while also clutching a more reasonable 16c 2/26 into the ER.  I will cut the 3/26 20c at the first sign of multi-day trouble\n\n[VXX 4/1 20c ](https://i.imgur.com/kmKd8NC.jpg) üöÄ üò≠ \n\nI have long been a consort of the mystical VXX, and [here is a previous DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jfhdta/volatility_for_dummies_vxx_uvxy_vxx_and_spy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I did on how it works.  It is approaching absurd lows, fear and greed is rising, and all that other doomed shit you hear.  What really signals to me this is the time to expand this hedge is the potential for sector rotation (and the currently happening rotation).  **As money outflows from big tech this past week post-earnings, we are seeing an expansion of call flow into more speculative industries like again like weed, EV, and forgotten titans like industrials/cyclicals, so forth.**  AnAlYsTS will try to scare you in the coming weeks and say tech is overvalued and done--this is untrue, but the outflow/inflow tides of the market will present plenty of transition pain dips that feel like corrections.\n\n**How I‚Äôll play it:** a VXX 16c 2/26 feels right to purchase on a Tuesday dip meant)\n\n\n[CCL 3/12 25.5](https://i.imgur.com/zfdoec7.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ \n\nAnother one that has seen a lot of call pressure building up.  This cruise line seems like it's just waiting for more favorable news to give it a huge push.  *I understand and agree with the problems with travel right now: this is not an endorsement of the end of COVID, but I like the stock*, and I like the potential for upward movement.  I'll likely play this one as the whale has and exercise patience.  Has potential for wild swings, though, so keeping a close eye on this one.\n\n**EV grab bag: TSLA 3/19 970c NIO 3/5 67.5c WKHS 2/19 46c (QS assorted strikes for ER run &?upgrades, and FSR off upgrades)**üöó üöÄ \n\nMajor call flow into both NIO and TSLA all week; my last DD I was able to successfully pinpoint this movement into NIO, and it feels similar.  **QS and FSR got lots of attention after upgrades and into QS earnings, but the titans are positioned to explode after some from frustrating coiling**. NIO in particular lately has been moving slower than a white man in slippers.  TSLA is a pricey ass premium, so maybe consider focusing on NIO or call spreads.\n\n**BONUS**: QS earnings could be when they finally reveal their revolutionary technology which prevents dendrites. This is the holy grail of EV battery production, and they boldly claim they have figured it out. The lawsuit is standard hot air from people upset their stock tanked in this weird ass meme of a market and I am unbothered. \n\n**WKHS dip feels like it was a blessing,** but I may wait for a little more dip on Tuesday because this thing is streaky as fuck.  People could be positioning into the Q2 (hopeful) EV deal announcement with the USPS.\n\n[FUBO 2/26 42c and 2/19 56c](https://i.imgur.com/blCr0q3.jpg)üöÄ üöÄ \n\n**EDIT: shoutout to /u/4p0rn0nly who pointed on that the 55c has a more favorable bid/ask spread and vol/OI. This is why I keep that inbox open!**\n\nAs I was on my ROKU with the gf looking for the latest episode of \"My 600 LB Life\", got confirmation bias through an ad for FUBO lol.  More importantly, Benzinga picked up that dude from Twitter Mr. Zack Morris as an excuse to put it on their watchlist.  We all know how pumps go at this point: \nRandom twitter ---> Benzinga (or other random watchlist) pickup ----> random analyst upgrades ---> CNBC pump ----> several crisis segments dedicated to WSB for MaNiPuLaTiOn\n\n**General theme I am seeing:**\n\n*Call flow into into big tech has really, really dried up*.  I'm hoping this continues into next week, because then we could be in a really nice position to pick up some March and April monthlies in struggling behemoths like FB.  TWTR is doing it's thing, but it seems like the looming AAPL privacy concerns have put a stranglehold on other big tech companies relying on advertising data.\n\n**Play I just like this week:**\n\n[PLTR reports Tuesday Premarket](https://i.imgur.com/MkoiiWz.jpg) and I think there is a chance to hop on no matter the outcome.  Sells off because earnings these days are stupid?  Buy the dip.  Starts to rocket off some news or a beat?  Hop on.  PLTR feels like a win-win rn at this price point no matter the earnings report brings.\n\n**Fellow Bulls beware:** üêª \n\nQuantitave Easing is taking a hit.  [Quietly last month, the FED announced they were discontinuing the repo program; nobody noticed this but we had a huge dip that day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Reserve‚Äôs%20decision%20to,term%20repos%20set%20for%20Feb.&text=Overnight%20repo%20operations%20will%20continue). Treasury yield also has been stubbornly climbing.  Long story short, these are caution flags for an outflow from stonks into stable long-term securities.  Not ringing the bear alarm, but just shit you should know.\n\nI change this a bit on Mondays based on what I'm seeing, as they re the most accurate days according to statistics.

It's one of the holdings that is part of the new SUBZ ETF that just hit the market this month.

He is not against it if you actually own it.\"\n\nApparently Cramer made a fairly \"neutral\" comment about FUBO to his boomer crowd, but it still implies the connotation to me that they (boomer crowd) shouldn't increase their position in it which can possibly be taken further to dumb people following his every word thinking they should reduce because they may miss opportunity elsewhere.\n\nBetween of the ETF interest and Cramer's \"neutral\" stance, I speculate there may be a chance for very short-term gains, then a self off cycle and a dip as previous longs want to realize some gains, and then opportunity to reposition for longer-term in the dip. If he said it was a good buy and I already had stake, I'd probably be priming myself to jump off it.\n\nLooks like it's sitting at about 21% Institutional Holdings with (dare I mention this) 36.5% SI.

{"title": "Notes about BB, Cylance, Amazon, Kuiper, antennas, and why I'm 1000% okay with buying BB at $20.", "selftext": "A note about Cylance before I jump into the rest.\n\nThe concept of the original Cylance product is absolutely excellent...behavioral (not AV definition) protection against viruses. Frankly, it's the way it should have always been done. You don't need to know the name of the guy punching you in the face, you just need to prevent getting punched. However, their implementation and service was garbage. I'm saying this as someone who implemented it extensively in a large enterprise environment. BB buying Cylance was a good move, IF they can build it and support it better. However, as potentially disruptive as it could be, a rebuild has to happen fast or there will be better competition with the same philosophy very soon and that opportunity will be lost.\n\nUnless...it's not a play for the PC and server protection market at all. If you think about it in terms of their other product offerings, it makes sense. Automotive operating systems are a massive and incredibly dangerous target, both in the frame of making sure a terrorist doesn't use your vehicle to kill you or others, and in the protection of mobile retail for the people sitting in their self-driving cars and shopping on the way to work.\n\nBehavioral protection makes absolute sense there, as there will definitely be ties between the car itself and what you do in it. The car's sanctity must be protected at all costs. So, look to BB be integrating this protection philosophy into it's automotive efforts.\n\nhttps://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-completes-acquisition-of-cylance\n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/29/blackberry-cylance-acquisition-cause-problems/ (this article fails to understand the significance)\n...\n\nNow, on a very related topic.  \n\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/investors-overreacting-blackberry-deal-with-amazon/\n\nBB has teamed up with Amazon...\n\n> The two tech companies will co-develop and market BlackBerry IVY, a new \"cloud-connected intelligent vehicle data platform\" that offers automakers a \"standardized secure way to read and analyze vehicle sensor data.\" IVY will merge BlackBerry's QNX embedded OS for vehicles with AWS' IoT (Internet of Things) and machine learning services.\n\nAnd Amazon is getting into the satellite-mesh internet business as a competitor to Musk's SpaceX Starlink.\n\nhttps://www.pcmag.com/news/amazons-satellite-internet-service-starts-to-take-shape-with-antenna-prototype\n\nAnd Amazon has bought Zoox to get into self-driving cars: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/26/amazon-buys-self-driving-technology-company-zoox.html\n\nAmazon is big into antenna development: https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/amazon-marks-breakthrough-in-project-kuiper-development\n\n> Rajeev Badyal, VP of Technology for Project Kuiper at Amazon. ‚ÄúThis simple fact inspired one of our key tenets for Kuiper: to invent a light, compact phased array antenna that would allow us to produce an affordable customer terminal. It‚Äôs incredible to see such a small form factor delivering this type of speed and performance.‚Äù\n\nLet's think about we've got existing or in development...\n\n* A secure operating system (QNX)\n* A system of sensors to read it (IVY)\n* Cars that use the OS and provide the sensors (175 million using QNX now, will only grow)\n* A system to protect the cars (Cylance or whatever is built from it)\n* A massive retail company (Amazon)\n* Mobile internet worldwide (Amazon's Project Kuiper)\n* Cars that will use that mobile internet (phased array antenna)\n* Self-driving cars (Zoox purchase)\n\nResulting in: A bored and captive audience of consumers, sitting in their self-driving cars, insulated from the world, protected from the bad folks, spending their cash and surfing behind tinted windows. Amazon making a ton of cash. Blackberry receiving some of that on multiple fronts.\n\nI'm not telling you what to do. I'm just satisfied that I bought BB at $20, and will be buying more over time, maybe at a lower price but definitely at a higher one.\n\nEdit: /u/TheLooza provides https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj544a/notes_about_bb_cylance_amazon_kuiper_antennas_and/gnaj296/ (https://patents.justia.com/assignee/blackberry) which has multiple patents supporting my thesis.\n\nEdit2: In December, Amazon-owned Zoox revealed its self-driving taxi: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/12/14/amazon-owned-self-driving-taxi-zoox-reveals-its-secret-vehicle/?sh=1e85ae51c916 (more encapsulated consumers shuttling around in urban settings)", "id": "lj544a", "created_utc": 1613238053.0, "score": 627, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 117, "comments": [{"body": "Sounds heavy.

Short term Tendies are possible", "selftext": "# Let's get some facts down\n\nIntel recently replaced its CEO with [Pat Gelsinger](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/intel-appoints-tech-industry-leader-pat-gelsinger-as-new-ceo/). He worked at VMWare as their CEO and has worked at Intel when he was 18. Right now [Rocket lake](https://www.pcgamer.com/new-benchmarks-show-intel-rocket-lake-chips-leading-comet-lake-and-amd-zen-3-in-single-core/) is set to release soon. Based on the success of [Tiger lake](https://www.theverge.com/21440302/intel-tiger-lake-hands-on-tests-core-i7-1185g7-processor-release) this might put intel back into the game. They are also releasing [a GPU](https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-xe-hpg-tease-3dmark-mesh-shader/) soon. For more news like this, I would watch GamerNexus( Bot won't let me link it) who does really great reviews from the technical standpoint. They are planned to release 3nm and 5nm chips later this year or in 2022( They are just getting the contracts right now. No date yet). Also, they had an outstanding year despite losing their crown to $AMD back in Q4.\n\nJust on their own their looking to bounce right back up from the pandemic. They still have some grow room from a lower revenue year. I bet this stock could go to $90 or even to $100 with rocket lake, and that's a short term gain meaning tendies in time for summer. But what about the long term or market correction.\n\n# Data Analysis\n\n|CompanyMarket|Market cap|Dividends /share price|Q4 '20 revenue|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|$INTC|250.07 billion|0.0213557676751335|20 billion|\n|$AMD|113.58 Billion|0.0154633678148662|3.24 billion|\n|$NVDA|370.44 Billion|0.0010694293591779|3.11 billion|\n\nAs someone who has been in the hardware space and is up to date on info Intel is underpriced compared to $AMD and $NVDA. What was holding intel back was the management and it changed. Intel is about to beat AMD and I would hop on the spaceship before it goes to the moon. so what is a reasonable price?\n\nif intel sock matches $AMD's Market Cap to revenue then its market cap would go to 700 billion. The positive press of the stock could bring it to 750 billion. But Intel's revenue is about to spike. President Joe Biden is planning to increase supply and if Intel can take advantage of that they can produce more chips where chips are out of stock. In 2020 GPU's sold out in a second leaving gamers without new gear. The 1050 ti, a failure when it came out, got rereleased and became one of the biggest successes this year. that's how desperate people are. [r/pcmasterrace](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/) was hit the hardest and many of them want the fastest gear. Intel could fill this void left by AMD and NVDA. if Intel can get enough stuff out then I could see a 500 billion market cap( with market correction, meaning that intel gets a fair price).\n\nI currently do not have a position in INTC right now, but I plan to do so as soon as my wife's boyfriend will let me.\n\n^(This is not LEGALLY financial advice. this was written by an ape with 6 brain cells.)", "id": "lj59h8", "created_utc": 1613238501.0, "score": 114, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "Intel failed on delivering with 10 nm for so many years in a row and they delayed 7 nm again in 2020 any hopes for any nodes more than that are just that, hopes, at this point.

{"title": "Why GameStop and Ryan Cohen will win. [DD] No Diamond Hands Required.", "selftext": "Alright apes and autists, let me explain why I believe GameStop has a strong fundamental case without mentioning diamond hands and short squeeze. If Ryan Cohen can successfully execute his vision, this leaky vessel will turn into a rocket ship blasting past the moon to the edge of the observable universe.\n\nOn November 16, 2020, Ryan Cohen sent a letter to the GameStop's Board of Directors titled \"Maximizing Stockholder Value by Becoming the Ultimate Destination for Gamers\". In it, Ryan Cohen outlined the roadmap for GameStop to pivot and become a technology first company. Let me boil this down for you in simple language for you smooth brain apes.\n\n**The Mission Statement**\n\n\"GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences \\[...\\] the successful and durable players of tomorrow will be technology-first companies that specialize in gaming products, experiences and services.\"\n\n**The Landscape**\n\n* Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry\n   * \"The size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle.\"\n   * \"The global gaming market expected to be $174.9 billion this year and reach $217.9 billion by 2023.\"\n* Valuable Assets\n   * Existing \"strong brand\" and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand, increases awareness, and strengthens its base.\n   * \"Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members.\"\n   * Large retail and physical footprint.\n\n**The Roadmap**\n\n* Evolve into a Technology-first company\n   * \"Technology is changing nearly every aspect of the gaming world, ranging from the way gamers shop to how they interact and compete with one another.\"\n   * GameStop will have to \"begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers.\" (Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming)\n   * GameStop will have to \"hire the right talent.\" (So far, Ryan has recruited 5 rock stars from Chewy and Amazon to join the team, more on that later).\n* Create the Ultimate Gaming Platform\n   * \"Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors.\" (Create a marketplace of wanted products and services, i.e. Amazon, Target, App Store)\n   * Provide and expand \"larger gaming catalogs\" (Capture all games)\n   * Create \"community experiences\" (This could be both physical and digital experiences)\n   * Provide \"streaming services\" (New vertical opportunity for content creation, tournaments, and others)\n   * Support \"Esports\" (Expanding scene that is not going away)\n* Transition to Digital\n   * \"Industry developments in recent years\" include \"transition from physical hardware to digital streaming\" and the \"explosion of mobile.\"\n   * Expand \"digital content.\" (This needs to be a focus as it's competing against Steam, Blizzard, App Store, etc)\n   * Allow \"online trade-ins.\" (This would be a game changer)\n* Cut Excessive costs\n   * \"Cut its excessive real estate costs\" and \"identify duplicative, under performing stores and plan to forgo lease renewals.\"\n   * Streamline \"Non-core operations in Europe and Australia \\[...\\] in order to reduce losses and potentially generate cash.\"\n   * \"Near-term increases in cash flow stemming from the console cycle can also help finance the future.\"\n\n**The Financials**\n\nAnalysts are valuing GameStop as a traditional brick-and-mortar business. If Ryan can properly execute and transform the company, I believe they can become the Target and Chewy of Gaming with potential verticals of streaming and Esports (not factored into this calculation for now). GameStop makes roughly $8 Billion in Revenue, however it is currently valued at a $3.5B Market Cap as it bleeds cash. Target makes roughly $78B in Revenue with $3.3B in Net Income and a Market Cap of $96 Billion. Chewy makes roughly $4.8B in Revenue, losing money but growing quickly, and is valued at $44B in Market Cap. Target and Chewy are valued at 1.25x to 9x Price to Sales respectively. This equates to $10B to $72B Market Cap transposed to GameStop. Obviously, this is very simplistic and does not consider their balance sheet and other factors, but given these metrics:\n\n* GameStop stock price potential is between $143 to $1,032 a share based on a current revenues.\n\nNote this is assuming $8B in Revenue. If GameStop can grow revenues, focus on digital to improve margins, and expand within the growing total addressable market, I see potential for higher prices and achieving Target to Chewy-like multiples.\n\n**The X Factor**\n\nI believe Ryan Cohen was offered to lead GameStop's transition with significant control and autonomy. Otherwise, I do not believe he would have joined the Board. In his letter, Ryan simply stated that \"RC Ventures is not interested in receiving a lone seat on GameStop's ten-member Board. It is not enticing to become an isolated stockholder advocate on a Board that has overlooked years of digital revenue opportunities and presided over massive value destruction without assuming full accountability.\" With the recent additions of two Chewy Executives to the Board of Directors, a new Chief Technology Officer who was the Engineering Lead in Amazon Web Services, a new Customer Care Executive from Chewy, and a new Fulfillment Executive from Amazon, I believe Ryan is executing his vision and revamping the GameStop team.\n\nNotice his hires are from Chewy and Amazon? Ryan Cohen was obsessed with Amazon‚Äôs customer centric philosophy and built Chewy to follow that same model. He is hiring digital and e-commerce focused leaders to manage this transformation. Ryan's customer centric obsession is what allowed Chewy to beat Amazon. If GameStop pivots to digital and follows that same obsession, this will be a great opportunity to win.\n\nFurthermore, I believe Ryan's vision is the right roadmap for GameStop. Digital e-commerce, streaming, and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future. GameStop will need to revamp and modernize their website and phone app, but I am sure that will follow in the months ahead. GameStop has the financial and brand assets that should weather this storm, but execution will be key. Ryan owns nearly 10% of GameStop, so he has a vested interest in its success and has much more to lose than my stake.\n\nSo degens, I say think with your heart and not with your smooth brain. Strap in and sit tight, this rocket ship may turn into a long journey to Mars. Maybe Papa Elon will be our catalyst.\n\nP.S. If we all buy something from GameStop this quarter we can load this rocket ship ourselves.\n\n**TLDR; Ryan Cohen is Jesus.

As things like fiber & 5g become more accessible, it seems like centralized computing will inevitably see a resurgence. Once those technologies are mature, you can get the latency down to where the user wouldn't really know the difference.\n\nI see it a bit like the EV vs. ICE car debate. The ICE converts fuel to mechanical energy, and we're all driving around with our own little engines producing the power we need right now. The EV has a battery that's likely charged by some gigantic engine at the power plant. Rather than going directly from fuel to motion, the EV puts a few more steps into the mix - electricity generation, transmission, battery charging, then finally conversion to mechanical energy.\n\nOn the face of it, people used to think that an EV ended up being less efficient because of all those extra steps. Right now that's how people see centralized computing. The truth now is that EV's are just more efficient. All those losses are so low & the power plants are so much more efficient than any ICE that it is still more efficient to go the electric route in basically every scenario in a developed nation. All those improvements to the infrastructure took time, but now we're here.\n\nThe same thing will be true of centralized computing. Once the data infrastructure makes it not matter what the physical location of the computing hardware is, we will see massive gains in computer performance by switching back to the centralized model.\n\nAt that point, custom retail hardware will be essentially pointless. It would be significantly more expensive & still perform worse. \n\n**TL;DR** That market will vaporize overnight, and I am pretty sure every manufacturer knows it.

But for long term investors the stock itself is their parameter, they are looking at holding for years possibly.\n\nThere is also value in the amount of time you research a stock, so if you invested 10 hours reading about GME and Cohen and short interest etc, then that is part of your investment. Pulling out your cash and putting it into a new stock will require a new investment of your time.\n\nI get what you‚Äôre saying, it‚Äôs mental gymnastics to some degree, but if someone is planning to hold longterm, then their parameter is the stock and what matters is the amount of profit in that cell on their spreadsheet.

And it‚Äôs not hard to be a bull on GME especially at $50 which is crazy overvalued and will remain so unless Cohen captains the turnaround of the century. \n\nSo to attempt to answer this question:\nThe question of why this might not happen is so easy to answer with GME. Digital gaming marketplaces are already over saturated, so are e-sports streaming platforms. Both new games and key resellers already have many good marketplaces, and as a gamer I really don‚Äôt want to have to use any more than I already am. So unless GameStop can get some big AAA exclusives on their platforms to force people in I really don‚Äôt see how they will successfully enter this segment. If they can make the digital trade-in model work and maybe renting digital games at good prices then maybe they can make a stand, but the competition is extremely fierce. 10+ yrs too late imo.\n\nThey could try to rent out hardware as game streaming. This is a segment that isn‚Äôt filled yet. However they would compete with fucking Google Stadia, and getting a platform for this up an running is really expensive unless you already have the infrastructure (which their main competitor already have). \n\nAmazon with Twitch, Google with YouTube and even Facebook already occupy the game streaming market. Once again you could try to pry some exclusive streamers and tournaments to force people over, but this has been tried previously and hasn‚Äôt worked, the streamers have gone back to twitch eventually. However, they might somehow get exclusive rights to the next Fortnite or something so I won‚Äôt rule it out. Highly unlikely though, as that would mean the new game foregoing ads on the existing platforms through established streamers. \n\nSelling hardware, like custom PCs always have a place in the market if the deals are good enough so they might be able to carve out a market here. Margins aren‚Äôt necessarily catastrophically bad however you would be hard pressed to rocket a company to the market cap they‚Äôre currently at with this alone.\n\nSo unless GameStop can get great deals with studios and streamers and get exclusivity going, I struggle to see how they are going to rocket. I don‚Äôt even think the company will die, but I think it is extremely bullish to assume the company will claim a fair value of $50 a share even within the next 5 yrs, if ever.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that market saturation is the problem.

It's the policies Gamestop currently has in place for them to adhere to and a lack of clear return communication from them to the customer in an acceptable timeframe. I'll give a personal example here. Two actually. \n\nMy wife ordered a PSVR waaaay back in 2016 or 2017 for me for my bday. She paid for it and then waited. And waited. It missed my bday and delivery window by weeks. Everytime she called to find out where this pricey item could be they would just give her an \"Oh it is on its way\" and that's about it. My wife to this day will not even step foot inside a Gamestop let alone shop online with them. They made no effort to remedy the situation at any point in the entire process. \n\nI rarely go to Gamestop myself anymore since there isn't much reason to as all the games we purchase are digital these days with rare exception. But PS5's and Series X had dropped and you guys likely know the rest so I'm going to skip to January 7th of this year. That is the day I managed to order my PS5 bundle after trying and failing since launch. \n\nAll told the bundle cost $777 and was considered a pre-order not expected to ship until January 29th, my birthday. I was fine with that and expected a wait. What I didn't expect was to get a delivery alert on Friday January 15th saying my console would be delivered on Monday the 18th! Monday comes, delivery pushed to Tuesday no reason. Tuesday comes and delivery changes to pending. Call FedEx customer support every one of these days trying to get an answer. Long story short my bundle was jacked by a driver probably in transit. \n\nFedEx tell me a couple days later their investigation is complete and they sent compensation to Gamestop as compensation along with paperwork. Call Gamestop and am told by the rep who has a terrible phone line making it near impossible to tell what they are saying but I get it. They have to do their own investigation over 7-10 business days even though FedEx has already completed it what they need to know and all Gamestop should have to do at this point is verify with FedEx and replace my shit. \n\nAmazon would have done it the day FedEx told me it was stolen. Gamestop has completed their investigation and updated my order based on availability with a given date of \nI shit you not, 4/0/21 with the dates for the most part bundle items listed as Feb and Mar of 2020! I get that they're placeholders. My original order still says preparing to ship on the order page. The whole thing is a confusing mess. I requested to be called when they completed investigation and got nothing. Not even an email. \n\nI have no control over how the replacement will be shipped even though I said I'd pay for an overnight ship in discrete packaging. Anything to make sure this doesn't happen again because it's not an isolated incident. This has been happening to customers since launch! They, nor has FedEx, done any sort of anything to prevent this from continuing to happen. I will never, ever buy something from Gamestop online again because of this. My friends will never buy anything from Gamestop again because of this. \n\nAnd I can't help but circle back to the fact that Amazon would have bent over backward to have my console bundle in my hands immediately. The fact they have not kept bundles aside for this exact reason is baffling to me. It has happened enough that some consoles should be kept aside just in case. Or there should be a route for them to get a console sent directly from Sony instead. Anything other than this snails pace 'I don't know' bullshit happening to me and others this has happened to. \n\nI believe Ryan Cohen and Co can pull it off but epic level horseshit like that not getting fixed double time will make that route that much harder. My opinion obviously so others mileage may vary if they have always had a great experience. I'd argue that a great experience having a game replaced or other item is fine but eating the cost of a busted game is not the same as having a nearly $800 console bundle stolen in transit and the replacement philosophy is \"We will try eventually\"", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow, someone actually doing some real analysis. \n\nYes, I agree.

I use downvotes for lube so please fill up my jar.\n\n**The Landscape**\n\n>Explosive Growth in the Gaming Industry\n\nWhich is mostly converting to digital. Gamestops BIGGEST crux. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Existing \"strong brand\" and recent Reddit frenzy is net positive to the brand, increases awareness, and strengthens its base.\n\nStrong brand???? Gamestop is literally a meme in the gaming community for how much people HATE it. Their consistent anti-consumerist  practices have bled onto any reputation they have left. Gamers literally jizz when they get the chance to tell someone how much they don't like Gamestop, leaving their revenue to basically be driven by soccer moms, confused grandmas who buy xbox games for playstation, and $GME memers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Large customer base and 55 million PowerUp members.\"\n\nHoly shit this is hilarious. Dude, everyone has a powerup membership. They hound the fuck out of you when you buy anything there to sign up. IT'S FREEEE (emphasis on reeee). I still have my powerup membership (just checked) and I haven't bought anything at gamestop in six years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Large retail and physical footprint.\n\nAgain. This is more of a crux than a bonus. Brick and mortar everything is on its way out. This is not exclusive to Gamestop. Yes, I've heard of their build a bull workshop idea but given their anti-consumerist mindset and millennials/gen z known to be a discount conscious generation... good luck. \n\n>Evolve into a Technology-first company... GameStop will have to \"begin building a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers.\" **(Ryan successfully executed this vision with Chewy and he can do it again in gaming)**\n\nAn online shopping store for all of your techy needs with competitive pricing? Hmmm never heard that one before. You're telling me Gamestop (who sells used games for $50) is going to find a way tobe competitive with Amazon, Newegg,  AND Microcenter prices? P.S. Chewy was way different. He created something that was unique to the market. Not saying he can't do that here but being an e-commerce store will not be good enough. If anything it just puts Gamestop on end-of-life support. \n\n>  \nCreate the Ultimate Gaming Platform\n\nAnd what publisher would get behind this? What does Gamestop have to offer that Steam isn't already dishing out. Not to mention more and more **developers are migrating to their own platforms** (in addition to using steam because it's impossible to compete with them.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Shift to purchasing from mass retailers and other online competitors.\" (Create a marketplace of wanted products and services, i.e. Amazon, Target, App Store)  \n>  \n>Provide and expand \"larger gaming catalogs\" (Capture all games)  \n>  \n>Create \"community experiences\" (This could be both physical and digital experiences)  \n>  \n>Provide \"streaming services\" (New vertical opportunity for content creation, tournaments, and others)  \n>  \n>Support \"Esports\" (Expanding scene that is not going away)\n\nI don't even need to break down why this is literally just fluff with not actual substance. Might as well be a politician. The only thing of value here I would say is the E-sports.\n\nSkipping the last bits of this section as it's just reiterations of points I've already tackled or thanks that mean nothing as it was priced in before the pop (like cost cutting, etc).\n\nI think Ryan Cohen has bit off more than he can Chewy imo. Like good luck bud. Gamestop's image to the gaming community alone will keep this from ever succeeding in the near future. Having said that, if anything were to save this company it would be you apes buying $3000 mid-tier build-a-bull builds so you could burn unicorns, I mean shorts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay done. Sorry, had a redbull. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR** \n\nFuck this DD fluff bullshit.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

CHWY undercut the likes of petsmart in a market that pivoted to online sales over night. CHWY was perfectly primed for this. Where we stand, GME will not recreate that success.\n\nGME is competing with giants such as Walmart and Best Buy, who honestly have much better access and supplies. When PS5 shortages are/were occuring, it was Walmart that was in the lead for restocking. The same goes for games, which Walmart and Best Buy often offer more enticing deals on new products.\n\nFinally, and here's the most damning piece, the likes of Microsoft and Sony are cutting out the middle man more and more as they encourage players to buy games digitally via their gamestores rather than hard copies. These digital buys are going up and GME is getting cut out completely. \n\n>Digital e-commerce, streaming, and mobile is the future and Ryan fully acknowledges and embraces that future\n\nI want to pick this apart for a moment because, honestly, I think Cohen is blowing smoke up all your asses. Consider all 3 of those areas in which Cohen hopes to take GME into. They're all saturated and have their major players. He hasnt revealed any innovative ideas, just a \"I think GME would do well if it tried this or that\". The \"e commerce\" idea frankly baffles me as they were already selling shit online before Cohen took over. Streaming....lol good luck. Well infact they've tried streaming before and it didnt work out. Now I can already hear you saying that everything Cohen turns to gold and to that I say: prove it. CHWY doesnt offer any form of streaming so I'm curious to know if he even knows what to do with streaming. Btw, Twitch is owned by Amazon (just found that out) so good luck fighting against that titan. Finally, mobile. Really....you retards are impressed that he wants to get into mobile gaming?

I've got GME stock, but honestly I don't believe in a play that is not the current short squeeze.\n\nShifting Gamestop into a viable digital first business is a much harder problem than the problem Ryan Cohen solved with Chewy.  With Chewy there was no dominant player who owned the digital pet product market in any meaningful way.  In gaming, there are 6 companies effectively strangle holding thier own monopolies on digital game distribution each with thier own immense and unassailable moat.\n\nLets start with the easy ones.  Mobile gaming is both the largest and the fastest growing sector in gaming.  Gamestop currently has virtually no footprint in mobile.  It's dominated by Apple and Google respectively who are unassailable because they ship thier marketplaces pre-installed on the phones they offer, and thier marketplaces have infinity historical content.  They can also afford to throw infinity dollars at exclusive content rights to squeeze out any other competitor that tries to make a play for thier markets.  Gamestop won't make much new money in mobile.\n\nNext we have console gaming.  Gamestop currently makes all thier money off the backs of the shrinking minority of console game players who want a physical copy of the games they are buying.  Digital distribution of console games by a third party is not possible, the three console game companies, Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo each allow digital installation of console games exclusively through thier own online markets, and its somewhere between impossible to illegal to install or use a third party marketplace on any of these platforms.\n\nWhat GameSpot can do, and already is doing with limited success, is selling physical copies of console games to customers online, and then shipping them those physical copies.  How many of you prefer buying bluerays on Amazon over just getting the movie you want to see on netflix or disney plus?  There's some evidence that future generations of consoles will not even include support for physical copies of games.  This market is not long for this world in my opinion.\n\nFinally we have PC gaming.  Gamestop technically does business in the PC gaming market, but physical copies of PC games are a tiny tiny market.  Only the biggest game developers even bother to get disks printed any more, and the population of PC gamers who prefer physical medium account for easily WELL under 1% of all sales.  PC gaming has basically no need for brick and mortar locations, so those locations don't help Gamestop attack this market in any way.\n\nThe company Gamestop has to defeat in the PC market is Valve.  Valve has a library of somewhere in the area of a million games available on thier platform.  Valve has a spectacular reputation amoungst customers of games, and they have again and again crushed attempted competitors in the market like a horse shaking off a hundred attacking ducks.  They have a decent albeit strained relationship with game developers who have mixed feelings about the dog eat dog openness of the game market on Valves platform.  Exploiting this tension was recently attempted by Epic games with thier own competing digital marketplace.  It has largely failed to make a dent.  Valves marketplace is extremely feature rich, surprisingly reliable, and customers using the Valve platform are resistant to change because of sunk cost.  Gunning for Valve is a fools errand, and I don't think Ryan Cohen is the man for the job, as cool as he is.\n\nThere just is no obvious way to make the GameStop digital market big enough to keep the company at the size it is at right now.  And going forward in gaming, there is very little obvious use for brick and mortar locations.  If GameStop does find some kind of clever way to maneuver around the big digital players that already exist, it's not clear that those players won't just find and close whatever holes GME is exploiting and take that money for themselves.\n\n140% short interest is certainly obscene, and GME doesn't have to go out of business in the near future.  But it's very hard to see them realistically claiming a sizable chunk of the all digital market in gaming even if Jesus himself were running the company.  They're fundimentally backed into a very tight corner, and they have very little room to move.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't think anyone is expecting them to capture digital game sales, that ship has sailed and is too expensive to enter. You're competing with Epic (free weekly games) & Valve in the PC space and it's a non-starter when it comes to the platform holders (Sony, MS and Nintendo).\n\nHowever, there's a ton of money to be made in gaming outside of selling the games. Here are examples:  \n\\- Gaming Merchandise   \n\\- eSports  (which I think will be the big money maker)  \n\\- Gaming Hardware & Customisations\n\nThe key for GME is to become a provider to the gaming whales and maximising the ARPU of the whales through merchandise, special editions etc...\n\nThat business will also be supported by the fact that pre-owned and physical games are definitely here to stay because of the economics of the game market.

This winter I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into agricultural blackberry futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about David H. Murdock, CEO of Dole, and his pseudo-monopoly over bananas, I decided to do something similar with another fruit. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's blackberry yield would be smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in Central Mexico and a colder-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around the middle of January and prices skyrocketed, but the blackberry bubble burst on on January 28th. Unfortunately, the recent concerns over high-flying stocks driven up by large short covering caused a massive drop-off in demand due to the futures being associated with a Canadian technology company of the same name, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of February 8th, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive blackberry shipment from the Mexican state of Jalisco, scheduled for early May, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in March, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the blackberries in this shipment were absolutely gargantian, some topping 20 grams each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per kilo.
