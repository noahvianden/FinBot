My best stab at this is -$1,405.65 ($0.65 fee) to buy put + $1310.65 to sell equal but opposite put + $1500 ($15 x 100) in the money from $175.95 break-even) = $1,395 profit if i exercise (aka buy the stock then sell immediately ) ... or do i just ALWAYS sell the opposite but equal put if the stock is well in the money and not much time remains?

Case in point, it is abundantly clear that Ark believes in a genomic evolution, which I agree.  It is also clear that Ark has its money in the CRISPR approach to gene editing.

TALENs is, theoretically, a technique with lowest possibility of producing an unintended genetic errors on the patients.  CRISPR is in the middle of the road in terms of safety.  The advantages that CRISPR has over other methods are ease of design and scalability.  The problem is no one knows or can predict the outcomes of gene editing.  Bluebird bio just suspended their study of a gene editing treatment for patients with sickle cell disease because five years after the initial treatment, one patient developed acute myeloid leukemia and another has myelodysplatic syndrome.  No one knows if this is due to the treatment or these two patients simply acquired these ailments.  The problem is that both of these conditions are disorders of the blood, and so is sickle cell.  And Bluebird Bio uses TALENs gene editing method, which theoretically has the highest level of safety.  The domino effect that follows is that almost all the companies in the genomic sector are down today ranging from 1 to 37.85%.  \n\nThe holding of Ark’s ETFs are usually about 50 or so companies; they basically buy all the major players in a given sector with significant over reliance on a handful of companies as previously indicated. The idea behind it is that if a couple of them do well, the return appears high simply by the fact that the holding is small.  Ark can do that because it has the fund to do.  Its not because the individuals behind those ETFs are way ahead of their time; they are betting just like we all do when we invest.  If such is the case, then the questions that should be asked before buying Ark’s ETFs are: 1. Is the expense ratio justified?, 2. Is the risk reasonable?, 3. Are there similar ETFs?, and 4.

The last such one was in 2015, and the mystery holding turned out to be Phillips 66 ￼ (PSX).\n\nThe SEC can grant institutional investors confidential status if it agrees that public disclosure would move the stock price and make it more difficult for the investor to complete its buying program in the stock. It is possible that Berkshire will continue to keep the mystery holding confidential. News of a new Berkshire holding can sometimes boost the stock, thanks to the Buffett imprimatur.\n\nThe mystery holding could be sizable, at $5 billion to $10 billion.\n\nGary Black, a private investor and former CEO of both Aegon Asset Management and Janus Capital, surveyed his more than 50,000 Twitter followers and their top choices among four selections were Disney and PayPal.\n\nBlack has been an influential bull on Tesla (TSLA), but said last week that he was out of the stock, citing the company’s lack of a clear forecast on 2021 deliveries and the risk of a first-quarter earnings miss.\n\nIn recent quarters, Buffett has sold out of Berkshire’s holding in Goldman Sachs Group ￼ (GS), sharply reduced a stake in JPMorgan Chase ￼ (JPM), cut a longtime position in Wells Fargo ￼ (WFC) and bought stakes in a group of drug stocks notably Merck (MRK), AbbVie ￼ (ABBV), and Bristol Myers Squibb ￼ (BMY).\n\nSource: Barron's\n\nI think if Buffett select, it could be stable dividend payers such as xom, cvx and hd.

Last earnings report was Q4 2020 in December, outperformed expectations. Q1 earnings due in the first couple weeks of March. Residential real estate has done well on the stock market recently, Lennar is one of the top performers in that sector. Hit 52 week highs last week. Trending toward a minor adjustment, so the dip could be a nice entry point as well.\n\nETSY ($ETSY): ETSY stock blew up since the start of last summer so the window for quick 100% returns has passed, but due to its gaining popularity as an alternative online marketplace to amazon, has had rock solid consistent growth week after week. \n\ni’m not a financial advisor or stock market wunderkind by ANY means so take what i said with a grain of salt. do what you will with this information but be sure to do your own DD as well.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I love Etsy, was about to take the plunge a couple of weeks ago despite the high P/E and then it shot up again hahah 🤡", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Just adding my own perspective from the inside - I’m a seller on Etsy and know many others. While it may be killing it now, if a competitor ever enters the arena seriously I’d start paying attention. Etsy often doesn’t take the side of sellers and many who are successful bail ASAP. It’s also flooded with knock-offs and mass produced foreign market items. I still use it for the channeling of buyers but would gladly leave if I had another option - and do look from time to time. Almost every press release I read from them disappoints me from a sellers perspective. But that’s just my $.02... it seems the stock is doing well regardless.\n\nEdit: I suppose what I’m getting at is that as a business which relies on external sellers, I would expect a higher regard and support for said sellers. Many buyers think Etsy is similar to Amazon in that it’s a centralized company selling goods, when it’s the opposite. I feel as if outsiders to the Etsy process were aware, it wouldn’t be as celebrated.

When Chinese copies are often the first several pages of a search, I would argue that the marketed implied handmade quality has become less important. I don’t want to get further off topic so I’ll leave it there.\n\nI find Pinterest to be a similarly-veined investment which is attempting to empower the creator relationship in a win-win fashion. With their recent deal with Shopify (a loose competitor to Etsy), they are enabling the small business, the creator, the searching visitor, and Pinterest themselves to all achieve their goal.

The people who could be making the most money on the platform are incentivized to go stand up their own shops outside of Etsy instead. That should be a high ranking concern for the company. Retain your money makers and everyone wins.\n\nAs mentioned, competing with knock-offs which are not policed at all. They make thousands of sales so the site won’t go after them. I get it but it defeats the spirit of the brand. The interface as a seller is changing in lateral moves. I find the community has a hard time keeping up with changes and figuring out how to run their shop. Options are moving between menus and there is a notable gap between app and web interfaces. Odd ranking systems for their search. The policy to prioritize items with free shipping when studies have shown that buyers are deterred by this for a handmade selling platform. It also forces sellers to increase their prices to ‘safe’ levels so as to not be abused into eating exorbitant shipping costs.

Ebikes are booming and in more and more countries/cities bicycles are slowly, but steadily being considered as a legimate form of sustainable mobility (and it doubles as exercise too). In some countries ebikes have been increasing in popularity so much that even some car manufacturers have been developing their own bicycles. Shimano is a stable & well managed company, fairly valued, favourable market trends could benefit this company. Many governments in different countries are proposing tax deductions for the purchase of an ebike to help speed up to transition to sustainable, green mobility.\n* **DOMO** (Domo) (data visualization & business intelligence company, with a really, really good product).\n* **SNE** (Sony) Undervalued conglomerate that has a large & growing entertainment business (music, TV, anime, movies, gaming), a semiconductor business dedicated to imaging/sensing technology which will undoubtedly play a very important role this decade. On top of their growing entertainment & semiconductor business, their consumer electronics business is doing very well nowadays compared to 5 years ago.

Used to be a bit of a struggling fitness equipment company until 2019. Got new management in the middle of 2019. They started to focus more on unique, quality equipment and connected fitness (digital coaching, they introduced a subscription service called JRNY which got pretty good reception). stay-at-home fitness equipment demand has been a huge, huge boon to them obviously, but imho the turnaround of this company actually started before the covid boom if your look at their past earnings reports. Covid just completely accelerated their turnaround. It looks like they're on a very good trajectory now imho and the demand for their products remains sky-high (much higher than 1-2 years ago). Their forward P/E is pretty low at 17. Also, there's pretty high short interest in this stock (20%), those shorts might help drive the stock price up if Nautilus maintains its renewed trajectory.\n\nSony, Turtle Beach and Nautilus are examples of companies that used to be struggling companies.

{"title": "[Quality DD] Xeris Pharmaceuticals is the most ridiculously undervalued pharma stock in the market right now.", "selftext": " Alright guys,\n\nI've got a solid one here and spent quite a bit of time on this. Two Words: Xeris Pharmaceuticals. They already have two recently approved and commercialized drugs(Gvoke for diabetes) that did roughly $20m in revenue in 2020 during COVID and with only six months to market since it was launched in June 2020. For example analyst estimates for Q3 was $4m, they did $9m. They beat analyst expectations every time. Really shows strength by management, but we trading at less than the low estimate for their U.S sales estimates. Peak Global for Gvoke is $500m a year, and they recently got EU approval for 27 countries. Short manipulation and OPEX manipulation fucks this one up a lot. To put it short, my first price target is $30, and others well over $50. here is why. Xeris pharmaceuticals is a platform pharmaceutical company that has two revolutionary techs: XeriJect and XeriSol. Essentially, the technology creates the revolutionary potential to address the limitations of conventional medicines with low stability and low solubility. Many medicines require water, refrigeration, larger dosing and with an inconvenient delivery method(IV, rectal, etc). The Xeri-technology solves these problems, no other company can do this shit. Its patented too.\n\n My favorite part of this is CEO Daddy Paul. Management in this company is top fucking notch. All were part of the same team in selling their previous company Durata for $23 bucks/share, and many many other companies. All have connections in big pharma and lead the commercialization efforts of many drugs. Paul Edick has extensive experience in big pharma companies including lead positions as President of Asia Pacific and Latin America operations at Pharmacia(Acquired by Pfizer in 2002 for $60bn) and at Searle Pharma as President for Asia Pacific, Canada, and Latin American operations. He lead the global commercialization efforts of $3bn/yr Celebrex along with John Shannon. Then in 2006, Paul became CEO of MedPointe Healthcare, which he later sold to Meda of Sweden for roughly $820m, the deal closed in 2007. In 2008, Paul was chosen to lead Ganic Pharmaceuticals, a $1bn Warburg Pincus-backed Investment Search Vehicle, as CEO to acquire specialty pharma assets. During this time Paul acquired an asset coming out of Pfizer, an antibiotic called Dalbavancin, which he quickly turned around into a fully fledged company, taking it public as Durata Therapeutics (NASDAQ:DRTX) in 2010. After several years of commercialization of development, Paul sold Durata to Actavis(now Allergen) in 2014 for roughly $675m. After some time, Paul exited retirement for the third time at the request of his previous investors to potentially lead a variety of companies. After looking through over 30+ companies, Paul chose Xeris Pharmaceuticals, which he officially joined in 2017 as CEO and Chairman. \n\n \n\nJohn Shannon, COO and now more recently President, served as the CEO of Catheter Connections for a couple years until it was finally sold to Merit Medical in 2016. John also served alongside Paul at Durata as CCO until its acquisition. Prior to these roles, John has a extensive history in big pharma, notably as VP at Baxter Healthcare, where he commercialized and drove sales for two drugs: GAMMAGARD and ADVATE ( $1bn/yr each).\n\nEssentially Xeris is a BO target in the future. Also there was a recent CEO interview, Paul literally stated at like 1:40:00 something or around there that while they did do an offering at a low price, investors will be happy when Xeris will be trading at $40-$50 soon. So the link cant be posted, but search it on youtube: Tales from the Trenches: Paul Edick, CEO of Xeris.\n\nThey have a bunch of other things in the pipeline. Excluding any licensing potential from their technology, their pipeline peak global sales is **close to $2bn annually.** Underfollowed and Under fucking valued. They are focusing on selling their diabetes drug and have 3 drugs for licensing, pramlintide, Diazepen, and their current Gvoke Offering in Europe. No company was ever able to combine Insulin and pramlintide together, Xeris tech did it. CEO stated at a recent conference that FDA was highly interested in that Phase 3 program and its a \"gamechanger\" in a $5bn US market. Diazepam is for seizures and currently it must be injected anally, Xeris technology fixed that with their tech, now its the first easy to use intramuscular injection. Global market for Diazepen is smaller at only $1bn. They added two more drugs to their pipeline. Guys NOTHING in this company is currently being valued in their stock price, this should be trading between $1.5bn to $3bn already. Even their current approved drug peak sales at $500m isn't valued properly! Using an average industry comp of 2-3x peak sales == $1.5bn, that's for the approved Gvoke alone.

To simplify the model using these numbers is just bad. It's not simple, simple would be looking at the prices when the markets reach equilibrium state and estimate how much people will pay for a mile with 70% saturation.

{"title": "AMC Blockbuster DD: The Sequel", "selftext": "**Disclaimer: None of the below is investment advice. Do not make any investment decisions based on the whatever I post online or say.**\n\nEDIT: ***There's a tl;dr at the beginning of Fundamentals and Mementals sections.***\n\n## EDIT: YOU DEGENERATES CAN'T READ SO I'LL SAY IT HERE. POSITIONS = 15,000 SHARES AT $2.4\n\n[my positions](https://preview.redd.it/lbvq40i68qh61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed321d66832747606d1e081ef2e897ec20248283)\n\n*don't know why my screenshot doesn't show on reddit, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/2YvrkR0 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirstly, I want to thank everyone who commented constructively yesterday on [my initial AMC DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ljz99b/amc_blockbuster_dd/). A lot of good input and questions. I thought it'd be best to try and summarize/address a lot of the concerns raised in a second DD, where I can get more into the details, in advance of the market opening tomorrow.\n\nThis sequel DD is split in Fundamentals and Mementals. A tl;dr is at the top of each section. At the bottom you'll find my thoughts on catalysts and forward momentum drivers. You don't have to agree, that's just how I see things. I'm not trying to convince anyone. My position is 15,000 shares at about $2.40 price. For those who wonder why I didn't sell at the squeeze: I bought the shares before the stock started mooning and had sold covered calls. It was too expensive to get out of them, so I was rolling them up. Unfortunately for me, the squeeze subsided before I could extract myself from the calls, so I'm still in, and at a substantial unrealized profit as well. **My horizon is up to the end of 2021 the latest, so I'm only assessing the potential for the share price to go up until then** \\- I'm not in it for years. I'll probably sell some CSPs in the meantime and if it stabilizes higher by June or earlier I'll sell some CCs for income.\n\nI'll preface this DD by saying that in 2020, and it looks like in 2021 as well, fundamentals don't mean much one way or another in my opinion. It's pure moment trading in the market from what I gather and everything is overvalued. Every-fucking-thing is overvalued, so saying that a company's fundamentals aren't that great means shit when you got stocks with $bn market caps which have never turned a profit, have no product and won't sell anything for years to come. Investors are looking for what's least overvalued, or what may benefit from momentum over the next few weeks/months and jump on it as soon as possible. Today 2/15 the markets were closed in N.America, but Europe was open and anything related to post-Covid normalcy skyrocketed. All leisure/travel stocks mooned even though noone is travelling yet. I do really expect something like this will be happening in the american stock market very soon, if not immediately, as well. People will try to position themselves for the post-covid times as sentiment shifts to positive. I expect big rotations out of tech stocks and likewise into leisure/travel/socializing and back-to-business stocks. I do think AMC is one of the beneficiaries, irrespective of fundamentals or not.\n\nFinally, all my figures are taken from the company's own annual report unless stated otherwise.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Fundamentals:\n\n**tl;dr = if AMC does not change strategy it will stagnate and it's share price will not move much. I think $5 is the bottom anyways so getting in at this price point is fairly low risk. Should the price drop more after buying in you can make up the difference with CCs over a few months. Should it stay where it's at, again, selling CCs is a nice way to make money. But don't sell CCs just yet, because when it rallies you'll be trapped. Wait until it's price stabilizes.**\n\nOnto the details:\n\nLet's get something out of the way really quickly. AMC reaching meme status did not do anything for its solvency. Nothing, nada, 0. AMC had managed to raised capital through debt and equity BEFORE it became a meme, so shut up with that bullshit and google the timelines. Their CEO had announced that bankruptcy is off the table way before the stock took off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome share prices for your pleasure and education:\n\n[chart from IBKR](https://preview.redd.it/1x6u00gl0qh61.png?width=1912&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d6a517d3b01e3f2a85380e6d2b058d160fb5335)\n\n*again, the chart I uploaded to reddit doesn't show up on my end, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/VwK58BR \n\n**Highlights:**\n\nMar 2015: **$35** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end\n\nJan 2015: **$22** @ 97.5m shares outsatnding by year end\n\nDec 2016: **$35** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end\n\nMarch 2017: **$31.5** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end\n\nAug 2017: **$13** @ 128m shares oustanding by year end (20.3m shares issued in Feb at @ $31.5)\n\nSept 2018: **$21** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end (retired 24m shares in Sept @ $17.5)\n\nJuly 2019: **$9.5** @ 104m shares outstanding by year end\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe above is some food for thought for those who say that AMC has diluted itself so much the price will stay forever low. As you see, the AMC share price has fluctuated wildly despite being diluted in the past, and despite revenues and profits not growing much. Therefore anyone who says this will go to $1 because of debt or dilution is talking out of their ass and is too ashamed to say they are a bear. The price has gone up and down despite being diluted and borrowing increasing, and it will go up and down again. The question is what will drive it either way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShares dilution from 2020 onwards:\n\n* Feb 21st 2020: 52.5m Class A and 51.7m Class B\n* Jan 2021: 287m Class A and 51.8m Class B\n* Jan 2021: 44.4m shares added due to convertible bonds sold as shares\n* 2/15/21 estimated shares outstanding are: 287m+51.8m+44.4m = 383.2m (my estimate, could be wrong)\n\nNote: there is a difference between shares outstanding and float. Float is what is available to buy in the market, which is of interest when you start thinking about short interest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to the following sites:\n\n* [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC)\n* [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amc)\n* [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/amc/key-statistics/)\n* [https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults\\_companyquotes](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC?mod=searchresults_companyquotes)\n* [https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amc-stock)\n\nFloat is between 56.1m to 115m depending on where you look.\n\nBtw, they all quote shares outstanding as 287m, so maybe I'm double counting something?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShort interest:\n\nAccording to these sites the short interest ranges from:\n\n* [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/AMC/short-interest/)\n* [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AMC.htm)\n* [https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)\n* [https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest](https://docoh.com/news/benzinga/19561873/top-30-high-short-interest)\n\n37.7m shares and some quote 79% of float. Clearly a lot of sites are calculating float as 56.1m.\n\nIf anyone has any official sources on short interest it'd be great to see. In any case, I'm not advocating that this will be short squeezed. That has nothing to do with my thesis. On 2/25 the Q4 ER is taking place so we'll have a definitive answer on shares outstanding.\n\n**Tickets, sales, customers:**\n\n2019 = 356m consumers\n\n2019 = NYC, LA and Chicago represent 17% of USA total box office. AMC holds 39% market share there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2019 annual report](https://preview.redd.it/mxpbc9wp0qh61.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bcac6e37fa3fa23c30d671ac3a42c8ddb859237)\n\n*The image I uploaded may not show up. Another link:*  https://imgur.com/WARXMTh \n\nIt appears that there are y.o.y fluctuations on attendance. Adjusting the 2010 box office revenue for inflation ([https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/)) would result in 2019 sales of $12.5bn, when real sales were $11.4bn. Therefore, when adjusted for inflation the box office sales are not keeping up. However, it's worth noting that neither the ticket price nor the indoor screens have increased by inflation, and looking at the figures AMC is making more money per screen. I believe the reason why box office sales haven't kept up to inflation is because the strategy for theatres has been stale. I also want to believe that COVID has been a wake up call for the theatre industry to diversity and execute on more bold strategies, which combined with cost cutting measures should pay off going forward.\n\n**Competition:**\n\n2019 annual report = the 3 largest exhibitors are AMC, Regal (now bought out and turned private) and Cinemark, which account for 60% of box office revenues. Back in 2000 they accounted for 35% of revenues, so there is substantial consolidation happening.\n\nNon-theatrical competition is of course the streaming services, cable tv, pay-per-view etc. In reality it's only streaming services as pay-per-view and cable tv is dead as a dodo.\n\nCurrent (2021) peers are IMAX, Regal and Cinemark.\n\n**Ops:**\n\n2019 annual report: 1,004 theatres (636 in US) and 11,041 screens (8,094 in US). The rest are in Europe and Saudi Arabia. Market leader in USA and Europe.\n\n26% of their revenue comes from int'l market. Europe is reopening fast and the UK GBP (biggest int'l market for AMC) is increasing in value, which in combo with a weak US dollar will bolster revenue figures.\n\nA lot of people commented on AMC not making money and that it's doomed etc. Looking at their financials:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e](https://preview.redd.it/4am3oenr0qh61.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d128de7c97c295f2552e4ca95d068c43f42ed8e)\n\n*The original image uploaded doesn't seem to show up, so here's another link:*  https://imgur.com/Gx9Ded6 \n\nIt seems to me that the biggest bummers with regard to their operating income have been rent and Opex. Rent expenses went up purely due to accounting standards, but the end result is that it made their EBITDA look worse. Should accounting treatment rules had not changed their 2019 EBITDA would have been very close to 2018.\n\n*Note: in one of my responses to a comment in my previous DD I erroneously suggested (that's what I thought) that the capex servicing and SG&A were what was dragging them down, but that seems to remain stable year on year - which are of course dragging them down, but are not what causes fluctuations in their yearly profitability.*\n\nNow, we know that AMC has done a lot of work to keep rent costs down, and has done massive strides to reduce OPEX. Hence why I strongly think the profitability margins will improve going forward, all else remaining equal. Just look at the int'l markets where OPEX was the reverse (4.3% down y.o.y) and how it made all the difference in their bottom line. Add to that the fact they have gotten rid of a lot of underperforming screens. OPEX should go further down as everyone gets vaccinated and any additional spending on COVID sanitizing is no longer necessary.\n\n**Capex:**\n\nBetween 2015-2019 AMC has built 37 new theatres with 310 new screens and bought out 700 theatres and 6,500 screens. They have doubled their capacity in 5 years. That's a lot of CAPEX spending, and obviously a lot of borrowing to deliver that.\n\nCapital spending was $0.5bn in 2019, $0.6bn in 2018 and $0.6bn in 2017. This is resulting to about $300m cash outflows to serve that capex, per year from 2020 and onwards.\n\nIt appears that capital spending has stopped, so at least no more new servicing costs.\n\n**Debt:**\n\n2019 = $4.8bn\n\n2020 (9/30): $5.82bn, but we know that in 2021 about $600m was converted to shares, so debt should be about $5.2bn currently. Again, if I've missed any bonds let me know.\n\n**Comparables:**\n\nPrice to Book (ttm) and 5yr avrg:\n\nAMC -0.26 / 1.16\n\nMSGE 0.85 / 0.63\n\nCNK 2.41 / 3.12\n\nIMAX 3.34 / 3.54\n\nAMC has the lowest valued share price amongst its competitors, therefore appears the cheapest across the peers. It also trades far lower compares to its 5yr average compared to its peers. Should the tide change it should see its price equalize to the others then there is a great upside. You may say that AMC has a lot of debt etc., well the rest are not in a much better position, with CNK being screwed with Regal for instance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Mementals:\n\n**tl;dr: A lot of positive catalysts await, and every single piece of news will boost the price. Aside a resurge of COVID there is nothing stopping people returning to the theatres, and a slew of blockbusters will be coming out soon to entice them. A change of strategy should also help add some growth to the revenue which will only boost prices further.**\n\nIf we were to ignore fundamentals, like the rest of the market does, then we need to look at AMCs potential for popping, squeezing or rallying. I'll start by saying I don't think a short squeeze is in the books. I just doubt it. There's a lot of confusion around its short interest and float. What I do know is that the float has increased a lot compared to early 2020, but it appears that short interest has increased as well. I don't think that shorts have covered to a large extent since mid-Jan and I can see - through checking the IBKR availability of shares to borrow - that shorts are hitting it every day. It's worth noting that its share price is now 100%+ higher than were it was when they were shorting it, so who knows, but I don't count on it.\n\nWhat I'm thinking is catalysts that will push the price upwards. I do expect that people are just gagging to go back to the cinema. That's not going to change once things reopen. Things that I expect will make the price rally:\n\n\\- COVID vaccine roll-out proceeds well and movie studios decide to finally start releasing movies. That should happen once capacity restrictions are lifted at movie theatres. There will be a big marketing push around this in the news.\n\n\\- NYC and LA announcing the reopening of theatres at full capacity. This will happen and will happen soon. It will lift the price by a lot as those two are the price revenue makers for AMC.\n\n\\- Partnership with a major streaming service. Netflix, Amazon or Disney, or even bought up by a major movie studio. The synergies are insane and the worst case scenario for those giants' balance sheets is negligible. Streaming service subscription numbers are stagnating and streaming giants are forced to increase prices (hi Netflix) to make up for growth. Expanding through an acquisition of AMC makes sense to reach out and grow further. It'll be like Amazon buying up Walmart. Low chance but even chatter about it will push the price up fast.\n\n\\- Summer (and Xmas) are the prime seasons where studios release movies. This summer should be huge in terms of releases and times well with the reopening of theatres. This is guaranteed.\n\n\\- Wanda converted their shares and is no longer the controlling shareholder. This allows substantial more maneouvering ability to the executive team to do things differently.\n\n\\- COVID restrictions lifted sooner than expected. This will allow AMC to use the cash pile it has squirreled for a tough 2021 in repaying debt faster, reducing interest expenses and improving its net income. Any announcement around retiring debt will push the price up.\n\n\\- More strategic changes towards PVOD, eSPORTS, booking theatres to people through apps etc. to utilize all the spare seating capacity. Even at peak revenue AMC is only using 17% of its seats, so it's got a lot of idle capacity it can make money off with 0 additional costs. AMC should pivot to additional offerings on top of movie releases to capture more footfall in its screens. I do believe that COVID was a wake up call that will push them to more innovative ways of generating revenue.\n\n\\- As people return to theatres they will realize a lot of locals have shut down. There will be consolidation due to natural causes. Fewer screens but the same number of movie-goers. That's a benefit for AMC.\n\n\\- With sentiment improving around the economy reopening a lot of these stocks that were hit hard by Covid will get extreme tailwinds that will make them rally. Look at what happened when the Pfizer vaccine was announced with the massive rotation out of tech stocks. I expect similar moves, sooner rather than later. Biden is doing a decent job with vaccine roll out.\n\nI believe that $5 is the new bottom of the share and I think we will be seeing a lot of weekly pops with small pullbacks, basically higher highs and higher lows, going forward. If you actively manage your position you may be able to exit at the high points and reenter at the pullbacks for additional profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't see any negatives aside from COVID resurging for some reason. I do believe that the very worst is past for the theatre business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finally, let me address some common comments:**\n\n\\- I got Netflix, why would I go to the movies?\n\nYou've had netflix for years, yet you (and everyone else) still goes to the movies. The movies are not gonna die anytime soon. Worst case they won't grow and stagnate, but they are here for years to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- The studios will just offer their movies to streaming and not to theatres.\n\nAbsolute bullshit. Theatres are doing the opposite, pulling out catalogs from netflix. They are in a conundrum as they don't really know what to do. They don't want their movies streaming (because it's far, FAAAAAR less revenue for them) through 3rd parties but at the same time cannot create their own platforms to stream. The latter is just stupid. The CAPEX required to build your own platform is high, and the benefit is trivial since they can play movies in theatres and keep the majority of the ticket price. Besides, streaming movies only works for low budget films. Any blockbuster requires the cinematic experience. Very few people have top-model TVs at home with surround sound, and even if they do, 4K streamed over the internet results to sub-par quality. It just does not compare to the cinema quality. The only realistic alternative to cinema for home entertainment is having a top of the line tv+sound+bluray. But that's not streaming is it?\n\nIf streaming was to kill off theatres then VHS, DVD and Bluray would have done so before (Studios would have released straight to DVD, why didn't they?). It never happened and for good reason. People go to the movies because of a) The cinematic experience, b) they combine it with a night out, c) it's a way of socializing and much more. That won't go away. Btw, Disney, despite having a streaming platform decided to go ahead with theatrical releases of all its movies in 2021, and won't offer them on streaming at the same time. Get it now?\n\nAnother reason why that won't work = Look at Disney, they offered Mulan through their own platform, so what best example to examine. They did not offer it as part of the subscription, so forget about paying your monthly neftlix and having new movies for free. They instead priced it at about 2x movie tickets. Even if they are to continue that with their next releases it's not really that much more affordable compared to going to the movies, is it? So don't expect Universal or 20th Century offering you all their new movies for $10/month. Ain't gonna happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Theatres have been open since August but noone is going\n\nNoone is going not only because of COVID concerns, but there are no movies to see. You need studios to release their movies for people to return. I don't expect them to do so until restrictions are lifted and everyone can safely return to the theatres.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- So, what else besides James Bond is coming in 2021? why would I go to the cinema for just 1 movie.\n\nYou are an idiot. Here is a list of upcoming blockbuster releases: [https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/](https://qz.com/1948011/the-2021-movie-calendar-previews-hollywoods-new-normal/)\n\nLook at summer time onwards, there is a hot movie almost every week. Most of the movies in the first half will likely be released in the second half after all, making it a bonanza of new films coming out in summer onwards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Theatres are dead in the long term, aren't they?\n\nWe are all dead in the long term. I don't care. Let's focus in the next six months ok? My investment horizon for AMC is up to the end of 2021 the latest. In a best case scenario I expect the recovery to be fully priced in by summer time when I will exit or just start selling CCs again. I may exit/renter several times to what I think may be short-term peaks and troughs. I'm not Buffett so I'm not buying for life. I'm in this for the rally to normalcy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\###I may edit this post at the bottom to address any recurring comments.\n\n\\###I'm also planning on buying some calls if IV goes down a bit\n\n\\###I won't be doing another AMC DD for a few days at least, maybe after 2/25 when ER happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disclaimer: None of the above is investment advice.

{"title": "RKT DD Part II: A former employee's take on Rocket's Culture and how it will allow them to become the \"Amazon of financial services.\"", "selftext": "**\\*Disclaimer\\*** this is a 15-minute read. I’ve seen a lot of posts on Rocket, but no posts focus on their culture. A lot of posts explain ***what*** they're doing, but this one will explain ***how*** they're doing it.\n\nIn RKT DD Part One, I discuss why and how RKT is being manipulated by institutions by way of shorting and by manufacturing negative narratives in effort to accumulate more shares for cheap. *Refer to RKT DD Part 1 Below:*\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but\\_analysts\\_say\\_rkt\\_isnt\\_a\\_buy\\_no\\_shit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfsacx/but_analysts_say_rkt_isnt_a_buy_no_shit/)\n\nIn RKT DD part II, I will discuss the single reason I have such an oversized position in RKT.\n\nThe single reason my bullishness and conviction has not wavered since IPO is because of Rocket’s **company culture** – which I was lucky to witness firsthand while working at Rocket from 2013 to 2015. Based on my experience, Rocket’s culture is the reason no insider selling took place following their lock-up expiration period on Feb. 2. Rocket employees, especially their executives, don’t view Rocket as just a company. They view Rocket almost as a religion, which shapes their belief system and influences how they work and live.\n\nIn a 2017 Harvard Business Review article, the author discusses how effective cultures oftentimes require shocking rules in order to produce shocking results. The first two companies he discusses are none other than AMZN and RKT. After living Rocket’s culture and researching Amazon’s – it is astonishing how similar both cultures are. *Article Link Below:*\n\n[https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company](https://hbr.org/2019/12/to-build-a-strong-culture-create-rules-that-are-unique-to-your-company)\n\nBoth AMZN and RKT are not defined by what they do, but rather who they are. Amazon’s culture is what allows them to be in various industries all while maintaining their identity. Culture is the glue that unifies every part of Amazon’s diverse business together. Culture is the same unifying factor that allows Rocket Founder, Dan Gilbert to own and operate over 100 companies (15 of which are under $RKT).\n\n# Introduction to RKT’s “ISMs” and “ISMs Day”\n\nRocket’s culture is based around 20 “ISMs” (aka philosophies) which serve as guiding principles. I will admit that these principles are obvious, and many companies likely have similar ones. But companies’ values are meaningless unless they are embedded into the company’s day-to-day norms.\n\nGilbert indoctrinates new hires by devoting 8 hours every three weeks to host **“ISMs day.”** ISMs day is a day-long seminar hosted by Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner for new employees to help them understand the deeper meaning of Rocket’s core values. Gilbert spends the entire day explaining how these values allowed him to transform himself from a pizza delivery boy to the owner of an empire with a net worth of $50B. They even hand out an ISMs books which are essentially corporate bibles. I kid you not, if you make a mistake at work, some directors will make you read out of the ISMs book as if you were repenting for your Anti-ISM sins.\n\nAs a former United States Army captain, I can tell you that Rocket’s first 4 months of indoctrination was almost as effective as the Army’s 11-week Basic Combat Training course held at Ft. Benning, GA. Dan Gilbert understands psych 101 and how to effectively use it to produce his army of soldiers.\n\n# “Every Client, Every Time - No Exception, No Excuses”\n\nLike AMZN, standards are very high at RKT, especially when it comes to customer service. If it is discovered that an employee failed to reply to a customer’s email or phone call on the same day, then they will receive a “no return call complaint” (NRCC). No matter if you’ve been with the company for 15 years or 15 days – if you get three NRCCs, then you are automatically fired, on the spot, “…no exceptions, no excuses.”\n\nMy most memorable moment of **“every client every time no exception no excuses”** was when I failed to call back a customer who did not qualify for a mortgage. The denied customer called the hotline in search of his banker (me). Three hours after he was routed to my phone, I got an email from former Rocket Companies CEO Bill Emerson inquiring on the incident – he even CC’d Dan Gilbert. **That’s right boys and girls, I was on the same email chain as Uncle Dan himself, getting bitched at by the former CEO of RKT** (The former CEO would run circles around Jay Farner).\n\nThe former CEO didn’t go through the president of mortgage banking who would then go through the regional vice president, who would then go through my director and then to me – he cut out all the bureaucratic layers to discover why I failed on one of their guiding principles. *(Rocket HATES red-tape bureaucratic layers; it is not in line with their culture and they prefer a flat hierarchy).* The RKT CEO even had a 5-minute call with my director as a follow up. CEO Bill Emerson dropped everything he was doing because nothing was more important than one of Rocket’s guiding principles: **“every client, every time, no exceptions, no excuses.”**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# “It’s Not About Who Is Right, But What Is Right”\n\nAll individuals within Rocket Companies are held to the same standards defined by the company’s ISMs. It doesn’t matter if you are a lowly janitor or a Regional Vice President with a corner office view. Dan Gilbert formed a flat hierarchy reflected in another ISM, **“It’s not who is right, but what is right.”** I have witnessed a Regional Vice President of Mortgage Banking get double demoted to a banker solely because he started to arrive 20 minutes late to work every other day, for a few weeks in a row. Those 20 minutes are a big deal because at Rocket **“Every Second Counts” (another ISM).**\n\nDuring my first ISMs day, Gilbert and former CEO Bill Emerson further proved they were a flat hierarchy when they gave their personal cell phones to the audience of hundreds of newly hired employees. Dan did this to drive home the importance of customer service within Rocket’s culture.\n\n*“if you guys ever get too busy to return a customer’s phone call – let either of us know and we will call them for you,”* said Gilbert.\n\nOf course, no one was stupid enough to do this, but we knew it was meant to drive home their message on **customer focus**.\n\nI witnessed many employees let go for little things like this. It served as a reminder that either you lived the ISMs or you left the company. Leadership understood toxic attitudes were contagious, so they would quickly remove the cancer before it could spread to other teammates. If you quit the company and tried to give them your two weeks, they would decline and then show you the door. I am talking The Office, Michael Scott to Toby style exit.\n\n# “Ignore the Noise”\n\nISMs exerted such a strong force on me, that even my parents and friends accused Rocket of being a cult – but instead of listening to them, I would **“Ignore the noise,”** which is an ISM that means, ignore the “naysayers” and never let them stop you from success. There will always be noise in our lives – but the truly successful are able to ignore it and complete the task ahead.\n\nI was legitimately offended when people accused Rocket of being a cult. They didn’t understand that hard work and hustle was required for the finer things in life. Rocket made us proud of the work ethic it instilled, so we took it personal when an outsider insulted the empire Dan had built. The same empire that is now single handedly saving the City of Detroit. We didn’t understand why people would bad-mouth a company who gave young, non-college educated kids the chance to make $20,000 a month in exchange for hard work. RKT strategically empowered those who were never empowered, in exchange for their utmost loyalty and devotion to the company (more on that later).\n\nI also remember when **“ignore the noise”** was used against me. I complained to a co-worker about working another Saturday and instead of agreeing with me, he looked at me with an almost robot-like stare and said, “**ignore the noise,** man.” Rocket had programmed him; he wanted no part in speaking ill toward the company that shaped his belief system.\n\n# “We Are The They”\n\nRocket was able to create a culture so strong that the employees within Rocket looked at the company as an extension of themselves. Any negative remark against the company, was a negative remark against the individual employee, which is why I took it personal when people accused Rocket of being a cult. **“We are the they”** was an effective ISM designed to unify the individuals within Rocket as one. **“We are the they”** means that there is no “they.” The “they” is all of us. “**We Are The They”**: One team. United. All in the mission together.\n\n# Action-oriented ISMs (i.e. “Innovation is rewarded but execution is worshipped,” “we’ll figure it out,” “Every Second Counts”)\n\nRocket’s ISMs are a roadmap designed to destroy the conventional bureaucratic BS that is so common in legacy companies like General Motors or IBM. Don’t you hate when you have hour long meeting at work and by the end, no decision was ever made? Rocket loves ideas. Employees can even email Dan Gilbert directly (flat hierarchy) when you have an idea. But Rocket places more emphasis on action out lined in ISMs above. At Rocket they realize you cannot cross every “t” and dot every “I” before launching a new innovative idea. If you did, progress would never be made – they emphasized that employees **“figure it out”** by doing and trusting the idea and refining along the way. A crucial step in acquiring and growing separate businesses and ideas.\n\nIt’s not just the customer-facing bankers that carry the ethos. Every. Single. Person. in the company, responds with a sense of urgency.\n\nNow you “naysayers” might be asking how do I know if Rocket’s culture still is this way and that it extends to every part of the company. I left Rocket in 2015, and I am now a supplier for them. I deal with their facility management department and they are just as on the ball as their customer-facing bank force. They respond to my emails the quickest, out of any of my 400 customers. It is apparent that their culture runs deep and extends throughout the entire company, not just their sales team.\n\nWhat happens if you are not on the ball? Simple: you are fired. This company is on the **lunatic fringe** of perfection. The same amount of perfection that Amazon demands, which is outlined in one of Amazon’s 14 leadership principles “Insist on the Highest Standards.”\n\n# Who Does Rocket Hire and why?\n\nRocket hires anyone and everyone. Gilbert also strategically hires underdogs. He doesn’t care if you have a college degree, high school degree or neither – he hires almost anyone to see if they fit into the culture he created. If not, they are fired at a moment’s notice.\n\nHis way of hiring non-college educated kids, who somewhat embody Detroit, is genius. The non-college educated, young 20-year old’s are given a second chance: a chance to make easily over 6-figures. Keep in mind that these are kids who worked jobs such as bartenders or waitresses before Rocket took a chance on them.\n\nNon-college educated employees typically promote faster than the college educated ones.\n\nWhy? Because these employees understand that no other company will compensate them the way Rocket does. Rocket empowers those who have never been empowered in exchange for their full devotion to the company and its philosophies. They are the ambassadors of Dan’s ISMs.\n\n# How have these ISMs changed me and Detroit?\n\nThese ISMs not only transformed me into a more effective employee, but equally they transformed me into a very entitled customer when I was outside of work. Whenever I got bad service, I would become irritated. Rocket had programmed me on how service was supposed to be and that anything short of perfection was unacceptable. I didn’t realize how truly special and impactful Rocket’s culture was until I left and worked for another fortune 500 company. Its true: leaders either create a culture, or the culture will create itself.\n\nRocket also used the location of its headquarters as a symbol of hard work and resiliency. In 2010, at the height of the recession, Detroit’s unemployment was 3x the national average. Nothing was in downtown Detroit at the time. Detroit went from the richest city in the world in the 1950s to the symbol of tragedy at the beginning of the 21st century. When companies were leaving Detroit during the height of the recession, Dan Gilbert was going against the traffic and moving his entire team from Livonia, Michigan to the heart of downtown Detroit.\n\nI can’t explain to you the difference Dan Gilbert has made in downtown Detroit. Everyone laughed at Dan’s decision to move Rocket Companies to downtown Detroit – but Dan followed two ISMs **“Yes before no”** and **“you have to believe it to see it.”**\n\nThey doubted Dan’s ability to revitalize downtown Detroit just as they doubted his ability to issue mortgage loans virtually on the internet in the 1990s, just as they doubted his idea to perform the mortgage process on only an app, with no loan officer, in 2015. The same way they doubted Gilbert could win an NBA championship with one of the worst sports teams in the league (do you notice a trend?)\n\nThe same way they doubt Dan Gilbert will be able to f\\*\\*ck the shorts who are driving down his stock.\n\nThey’re also now laughing at Dan’s vision to turn Detroit into the fintech hub of the world. But Dan follows **“you have to believe it, to see it”** to the T. And his bold actions inspire his army of soldiers who wear the Rocket badge around their neck.\n\nFollowing the 2010 move, Detroit has become Rocket’s symbol – it has totally transformed the company and its employees to have an underdog mentality with the hunger to prove itself.\n\nThe character of the city — its grit, resilience, and fortitude — gave the company mythology for the brand and its founder. This has been a part of the storytelling mechanism by which Rocket evangelizes itself to the market…both locally and beyond; and it’s quite powerful.\n\n[https://preview.redd.it/x9ggu2ubcih61.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=140490c084822f4a98394b2a21bfe07d518d7f47](https://preview.redd.it/x9ggu2ubcih61.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=140490c084822f4a98394b2a21bfe07d518d7f47)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Why is Rocket’s Culture important?\n\nRocket is more than a company; it is a belief system that unites 20,000 employees to a common goal. This belief system allows for many strangers to cooperate effectively – just as the belief system of religion connects millions across the globe.\n\nCulture isn’t about what gets done, but how it gets done. Rocket’s belief system can apply to any industry, not just mortgages. That’s why Gilbert pounds into his employee’s heads:\n\n*“it’s not what we do, it’s who we are that defines us.”*\n\nIt’s why Gilbert went public: he wants to compete with silicon valley and incentivize software programmers to join his religion by offering stock options. He wants to use RKT stock as currency to acquire other fintech companies and have them adopt his unifying culture which has brought him to where he is today.\n\nIt’s why he owns all the historic buildings in the heart of downtown Detroit. Yes, there's a part of this that is about community and altruism, but it is also about business. It would be much harder for RKT to capitalize on it’s business plan to create the Amazon of financial services if their companies were spread out across different suburbs. By owning the majority of Downtown Detroit (which he does), Rocket is able to capitalize on talent and the millennial trend to work in urban cores all while creating a synergistic energy among Rocket’s multiple companies which will further revitalize Detroit in the process.\n\nI see why those looking from the outside in think that Rocket is just a mortgage company. But those that work there understand mortgages are just the start of Rocket’s empire. Trust me, but as Dan Gilbert would say, you have to **“believe it, to see it.**\n\nGilbert's empire is just getting started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTO SEE MY POSITIONS CLICK BELOW:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le7stn/calling\\_rkt\\_a\\_mortgage\\_company\\_is\\_like\\_calling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le7stn/calling_rkt_a_mortgage_company_is_like_calling/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo view all of Rocket's 20 ISMs, please refer to the link below:\n\n[https://www.myrocketcareer.com/About-Us/Our-Philosophies](https://www.myrocketcareer.com/About-Us/Our-Philosophies)\n\nEdit: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "id": "lkpg7d", "created_utc": 1613429632.0, "score": 656, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 289, "comments": [{"body": "I've been holding since IPO.

{"title": "SILVER, the investment that has no risk and infinite possibilities! DD on $PSLV and more!🚀", "selftext": "Ok no risk might be clickbait, no investment is fully risk-free but I still stand buy my point: buy silver, let me explain:\n\nSilver massively undervalued and like GME it's possible to fuck with Wall street if it squeezes. A silver squeeze you ask? Isn't the silver market too big to squeeze? Silver ETF SLV (which is a scam) admits it's possible and that they're vulnerable to one. [http://gata.org/node/20913](http://gata.org/node/20913)\n\nHow is a squeeze possible then? Let me quote a Bloomberg article of 2014 to explain:  \"About $5 trillion of silver and $18 trillion of gold circulated globally last year, according to CPM Group\". $5 trillion dollar you say... After a quick search on the internet you will find that both total supply and total demand for silver hovers around 1 billion ounces a year. [https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/](https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/) This would mean that in 2014 (when the price was around $20 per ounce) the true circulating supply was $20 billion, a difference of 250 times! This difference is what we call 'paper silver' and just like paper hands it sucks, driving down the price. \n\nIf the price of silver increases massively, those who create paper silver will lose a lot of money, and if it keeps rising it's just a matter of time before futures and fake ETF's will stop providing it. If that happens the price of silver will inevitably rise way further as supply will decrease up to 250x!\n\nBTW: In the near past JPM was punished for manipulating the silver market as well, just a sign that stuff like this happens to a market this big.\n\nATTENTION  **🌈🐻** :\n\nAre your expectations on the market negative? Do you think stock prices will fall? Do you believe we are in a bubble? I found the perfect investment: Silver! After the great recession and the short crash last year silver crashed quickly before it rose to the occasion. In 2008 it crashed a bit, only to rise almost 5x afterwards. In 2020 it dropped to appox $12 an ounce and rose to nearly $30. If you think the stock market will crash, this is a great opportunity.\n\nOk, now that the **🌈🐻** are interested, we can continue.\n\nTime lag is a phenomenon in economics where there is a delay between an action and a consequence. Right now we are in the middle of this. As silver is sold in many forms (Physical, ETF, Trust, Futures) it's prone to price lag. Look at your local Bullion dealer. Are there many coins/bars in stock? Probably not, and the price has hardly increased last month. By buying trusts that actually own silver like $PSLV and $PHAG you can profit off this phenomenon.\n\nREAD IF YOU'RE A BOOMER:\n\nSilver is actually a great long-term investment. It is important for many technologies we will see a lot of in the future. Think about batteries, solar panels and medicine. With the market for all of these 3 increasing quickly. This could be sped up by the US government if the current administration starts funding projects for renewable energy and electric cars. Also, in 10 years we will see a peak in Silver mining, but after that there will most likely be a decline in supply until the mines are almost completely empty. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344913002747#sec0080) \n\nImportant sidenote: If you want to profit of a possible squeeze you can also look into buying stock of silver miners. These will obviously rise a lot if the price of silver goes to what it should be worth. \n\nConclusion: There are many possible scenarios imaginable in which silver prices will rise a lot, both in the short and long term. Buying silver futures does nothing, nor will buying $SLV. Buy physical silver or silver trusts which market values are the same as the amount of silver in their vault! \n\nTL;DR: \n\nIs this really needed?
