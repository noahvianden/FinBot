In regards to the original question, one of the greeks, \"theta\" will erode the time value of your option over time regardless of what happens to the price and you will end up with zero.  A better long term strategy is what Warren Buffett does, sell far out in time puts on SPX and let time decay work in your favor.  SPX \"always\" goes up over enough time and he takes the premium that is deposited into his account and buys other companies with it.  Options sellers have a statistical advantate (70-80%) and are \"the house\" or the \"insurance company.\"  I do these all the time, bull put or bear call vertical credit spreads, and you have to know what you're doing or you'll blow your feet off, but they're very good, consistent income producing trades.  \n2. Regarding Slim Margins 1999 comment, knowing how and when to exit is way more important than when/how to enter. It's ridiculously easy to watch a good trade go south.\n3. Campinbgbushes is on the right track with short time frames.  Time is the enemy of the option buyer and the friend of the option seller, but only to a point.  Too much time give the underlying time to move which can burn the seller.  For the buyer, something has to happen soon, the buyer has to be right about time, direction and price.  The seller just has to be right about where the market is not going to go, but time is noone's friend in the end.\n4. MBHNYC and stop losses, I've found that \"mental\" stop losses are beter than physical ones.  Options pricing is so volatile that physical stop losses get whipsawed a lot, especially near the open and the close and as you get within a few days of expiration.  Stop losses are important, but not in the traditional sense of when you're trading stocks.\n5. Ohfat is on the right track using SPY, QQQ versus individual stocks.  Not as exciting but way, way more consistent.  If you're an option buyer, consider bull/bear debit spreads versus outright puts and calls.  Way less risk an plenty of potential.

{"title": "NVAX - The Vaccine Play So Bad It Might Just Work", "selftext": "Considering 50% of you retards can't even read, I'm going to keep this short and sweet.\n\nIf you haven't been keeping up with NVAX since their P3 results came out, the company has been hit with multiple delays over the course of the year, apparently stemming from their difficulty scaling up manufacturing.  Unlike the big boys, NVAX had no global presences prior to OWS, so it's understandable to see some growing pains as the company rolls out a vaccine in only a year's time.\n\nThe good news is the company has stated that they are past any scaling issues and are in the final days of completing their EUA packages and will be submitting to most non-US markets by November 5th. After submitting, the company can expect approval toward the end of November or the start of December. The company expects to submit to the FDA towards the end of year and should be approved in the US in January.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recent Events:**\n\nRecently, NVAX has been hit with a triple whammy of bad luck, sending their SP from 260 to 130 in only a matter 4 weeks.\n\n1. We had the great market crash of 2021 (I know I'll tell my grandkids about that)\n2. News of Merck's anti-viral drug hit the news, driving down all vaccine stocks\n3. And the dagger, Politico's article stating NVAX's manufacturing issues - [LINK](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/19/novavax-vaccine-rush-process-global-campaign-516298)\n\nThe good news with the Politico article is that it is either old news, intentionally false, or just overstated as the company released a PR the next morning saying that issues have been solved and they will be submitting for approval in 5 major markets within the next 2 weeks - [LINK](https://ir.novavax.com/Novavax-Reconfirms-Confidence-in-Regulatory-Filing-Timelines-and-Manufacturing-Quality?sf153130962=1)\n\nA Cantor Fitzgerald analyst even spoke to NVAX after the article and this is what he had to say - [LINK](https://twitter.com/AlYap73961573/status/1451160899193122827/photo/1) \\- He kept his overweight $272 price target for the company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Fundamentals:**\n\nWith this current beat down on the SP, the company is now trading for less than 2x their expected 2022 revenue. To give you an idea how cheap that is, Moderna is currently trading at about 6.5x their 2022 estimates. If we give NVAX the same multiple we're looking at a 650 SP. Obviously, the company's lack of product on the market is discounting that, but as soon as the company files for EUA, those concerns should be put to rest.\n\nBeyond COVID, the company has a flu vaccine that should be coming to market as soon as fall of 2022 - [LINK](https://ir.novavax.com/2021-09-23-Results-from-Novavax-NanoFlu-Influenza-Vaccine-Phase-3-Clinical-Trial-Published-in-The-Lancet-Infectious-Diseases)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SI%**\n\nFor you mouth breathers out there, the company has a 8.2% short interest. It also has a small float of only 74m shares, 55% of which are held by institutions, so this thing could really rocket once news breaks. To give you an idea, this thing went from 120 to 330 in a week after their P3 results came out in January.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: NVAX has several upcoming catalysts in the coming days, weeks, and months that could turn this into a 10+ bagger by the end of the year. 2-3 bagger if you're a pussy and only buy shares.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position:**\n\n11/5/21 150c/160c/180c\n\n11/26/21 200c\n\n2/18/22 250c\n\n4/14/22 300c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGLTA that follow me on this play!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: WHOA!

I did 100% of the work myself with help only from my brothers and a couple friends in the evenings and weekends. They only helped on big parts of the renovation. \n\nIt was my first home and I actually borrowed more than 100% of the value of the home. Purchased the home with 0% down, and had a secondary loan from the same bank that was 80% of the proposed post renovation value of the home.\n\nI was able to finish the renovation having spent very little of my own money. Spent roughly $100k on the home, it appraised for $135k. Refinanced the 2 loans into a single mortgage, still not coming out of pocket at all yet.\n\nFew years later I decided to move to a different city. Sold that house for $165k. Instead of buying another home in the new city I moved into an apartment and used the equity from the sell of the first home as down payment on a nice townhome right in downtown. I never spent more than a few minutes at a time at this property, I immediately started renting this home out.\n\nPurchase price was around $200k, rent was $1600 a month. My mortgage was $800.\n\nAfter 1 year of ownership I went back to the bank, they no longer viewed the house as a liability against my debt/income, but rather a cash flowing asset and source of income.\n\nAt this point I had saved up enough of a down payment to buy another home, taking out yet another mortgage. I moved into this home.\n\nLather, rinse, repeat. 10 years later (from buying my first home) I now have multiple rental properties, have flipped several homes and properties and the home I currently live in ($345k value) has no mortgage on it.\n\nWhen I started this adventure I was only earning about $45k a year. So chances are YOU can probably do the same. I obviously earn far more than that now.

He attempted to get Kansas entrance as a slave state, basically continuing Bleeding Kansas (which Pierce started), managing to piss off pretty much everyone.

He also must have peered into the future and took a page from the modern Left because he stuck his nose, face, and a fist into the Supre Court's deliberations and manufactured support for Dred Scott.  In his final address to Congress he basically blamed the North for the imminent secession, saying they were being obnoxious, while also saying that the South should just stfu.  In the election after his one term, he failed to do *anything* to bring his party together, instead tepidly supporting his vice-president, despite pretty much everyone else wanting Stephen Douglas.  Buchanan supported the Corwin Amendment which would have put an amendment into the Constitution saying that Slavery could not be stopped by any *other* Amendment.  Fortunately, that was DOA. He then followed this by completely fucking up the start of the Civil War (which occurred after Lincoln had been elected but before Buchanan was out of office).  He made a half-hearted attempt to help Fort Sumter and then literally did nothing.  People forget that early in the war the South vastly outperformed expectations, and a good deal of that is because Buchanan did nothing to get the military ready to suppress an active rebellion.  He also left the country in $17M of debt, despite his promises to do the exact opposite.  He supported the North in the war, but in the most lukewarm fashion, again managing to piss off both the north and the south simultaneosly.   BTW, the Civil War was known as Buchanan's War around the time it was fought.  \n\nGranted, Pierce was also a fucking train-wreck (understandable given the horrible things that happened to his children, particularly his son after he was elected), but Buchanan pretty much guaranteed we would have a Civil War that dragged out via his ineptitude both before the war, and right after it started. \n\n\nBy the way, do you ever just marvel at the murderer's row of presidents we had just before and just after Lincoln?  Filmore, Pierce, Buchanan, (Lincoln), Johnson, Grant.  In retrospect, perhaps if the people preceding Lincoln hadn't been so bumbling we wouldn't have needed Lincoln in the first place.  Also, the retroactive air-brushing of Grant the past decade or two has been ridiculous.  Check out [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States) rankings, and look at the ones for Grant from pre-2000.

Kansas was Buc's attempt at compromising and holding peace.  Most people either forget or never even knew that the Civil War wasn't started for the right to keep slaves - it was started because the modernized and mechanized North passed laws stating that contracts to expand west could not be done with slaves, which was basically the North's way of fucking over the South (which had no railroads or modernized means of production) and ensuring that the South would get NONE of the money for the western range expansion.  It was some robber baron bullshiit. Lincoln didn't even abolish slavery until the Civil War was well underway (it was, what, something like 2 years in by the time he issued the Emancipation Proclamation?). To use WSB terms, the North were the hedge funds, and the South were the guys who got slapped with PDT restrictions.  Now, were his methods in trying to avert war sound?  Ehhhh, mixed bag, mostly no.  But he was at least trying.  Pierce wanted to create a scar (and did so).  He was inept, but he wasn't evil.  Pierce was.  Plus, it's just poetic that Pierce's presidency was capped off by finding out his own party wasn't going to nominate him for re-election, so he got drunk then ran over and killed a woman with his horse, becoming the first president to get a DUI :P.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe TL:DR here is nothing Buc did had lasting resonating effect on the country for generations.  He was a one-shot and everything he was involved in was ultimately forgettable and had no permanent effect.  What Pierce did created a scar that still lingers 200 years later.  What Carter did by giving away the most important shipping lane in the entire world was ensure generations after would suffer additional costs for goods (also something that continues to this day).

You can borrow more from the next generation to pay it back since they'll get the interest which will be sent back in taxes and so on. \n\nThe problem is govt decided to spend like crazy because interest rates (set by the fed) were so low that it made sense to do so. If you can borrow money for 0 collateral and 0 interest definitely do it. There's no downside. Private companies did the same. This is how Trump actually failed us. The economy was doing great when he took over and he pressured the fed to keep interest rates low (replacing Janet Yellen with Jerome Powell to do so and later openly blasting Powell his own appointee for higher interest rates) to make himself look better and even tried to make interest rates negative in the US. Now we're terrified of raising rates to fight off inflation because both govt and private companies took on so much debt that it'll be rly painful if they can't borrow more down the line to slowly pay off those debts. \n\nThe solution the fed has is \"tapering\". We gradually ease up interest rates so it costs just a bit more to borrow. Companies will report lower profits and govt has to ease up taxes a bit to cover the difference. This is a huge difference in comparison to Regan era solution to stagflation.

{"title": "Choo Choo - All aboard the $PRPL train (again)", "selftext": "Hello retards, here we go again. What better train to hop on the Purple wagon than now? This company doesn't need any introduction on this subreddit, but YOU may need a few good reasons hop on again. Just keep scrolling.\n\nFirst of all, let me tell you about my last DD that you may find in my profile or here ([https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/ijnu6v/goldsport\\_discoveries/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/ijnu6v/goldsport_discoveries/)). Introduced a company to reddit that returned a 10x on investment under a year after my post. I think Purple can be one of winners that can return a solid 3x over the years.\n\nTLDR; Purple Innovation is a mattress company that is capitalizing on current market trends and stealing market share from their competitors at a very high double-digit rate. The company has made it public that they plan to keep taking market share at a 30% CAGR for the next 5 years. This hypothesis was tested using various models below. Models provided by all the 3 models below state that the company is undervalued on every metric.\n\nThe major catalyst coming up the Q3 earnings on Nov 10. If the company can confirm what is assumed in this post, that the exact status of the company's production is higher than ever, and they basically resurrected from its ashes (like a phoenix) - Purple's share price should soar to 25-30$ in the short term a much higher in the years to come.\n\n# Introduction\n\nI've dug and listened to most earnings call and analyst conference over that past year and glanced over all the 10Ks and Qs to familiarize myself on the company. First will discuss the current market, current state of the company, and then the upcoming catalysts and sales forecast.\n\n**The Market**\n\nThe current state of the market is positive growing slowly year over. The industry trends are also positive for Purple, while I agree with the CEO that there's a shift in consumer behavior to lean on the healthy side. Meaning humans are making self-improving decisions, doing more exercise, eating healthier, getting more sleep. Purple's mission to help people sleep better is capitalizing on those trends but most of their growth is driven by taking market share and no expanding at the market rate - hence why these industry trends won't be discussed in this DD.\n\n[Stealing market share](https://preview.redd.it/xiz6te63hov71.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d1ccc1df8d6c13b49db7b73c9a8a598554dfc2d)\n\n**The Bad**\n\nEarlier this year an unspeakable incident happened in their factory, a death of an employee (14/05/2021) caused major production slowdowns and made them rethink their workflow around the Max machines. The delays suffered by the company were also caused by new safety measures retrofitted to existing machines and a change in their workflow to improve safety.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wet7at49dov71.png?width=1085&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c2897f5bc73e1f39e3388c4456345a487c86779\n\nThis had major impact on the Q2 numbers and the share price took a major hit since that time. The production slowdown has also negatively affected their existing relation with big retailers in the US as said by the CEO during their recent Q2 earnings call. During that time orders were not sent on time and lead to huge backlogs. The incident created a $50MM net revenue that was not captured in Q2. \"This could have been the summer of Purple\", said my its CEO. In the release was also said that the company had missed earnings by around $0.08 and exacerbated the downward trajectory for its share price. Sales were approximately flat for that quarter at 182,586 compared to 186,429 for Q1. Another driver for lower earnings was a $11.2MM litigation fee for the accident. This tremendously impacted the earnings and I will forego this expense in the model section of this post.\n\n[Daily chart $prpl](https://preview.redd.it/w3u0zjcddov71.png?width=1285&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2c5d800076b3da88b5faddbac489756a6ce2618)\n\nGiven the above, the share price is down, the outlook of the company provided its numbers only is dim ‚Äì but that is exactly when and investors must strike. When everyone thinks the company is finished and is priced so cheaply it is exactly at this moment you want to place your bet. Let me give you a few reasons below.\n\n**The Good**\n\nThe company has remained cashflow positive through these events and flat on earnings. The company has paid a lot of debt and its current debt situation net of current period is $40,4MM and renegotiated the term loan at Libor + 3% (currently at 3.5% total) and now has a $55MM revolver line that they have not taped into yet.\n\nDuring that last call, CEO Joe Megibow stated that the want to tap in that line is high but that the current CAPEX needs a sufficiently met by its current CFO (Cash Flow from Operations). This good news for investor in a way since the company will not increase its operating leverage.\n\nThe backlogs were cleared since August and since end of July the company has been running at full capacity. The started the year at 6 Max Machines and now have 8 machines, coming back with more capacity than ever. The CEO also said that they believe the incident was isolated and it has no meaningful impact on their ability to scale in the future. The company is currently working to reestablish their relationship with retailers and prove themselves as a key supplier in the industry\n\nNot only they produce a larger number of mattresses, they also have raised their mean price across the line and focus on expanding the top line to continue to increase their average selling price. Expand the top and dissolve the bottom is a great business motto and Purple is doing just that.\n\n# The Future\n\nLet's now talk about the company's $2.5B revenue plan in 3-5 years. One of the things that makes this plan so great is that no global expansion, no category expansion or other sector expansion, is factored in here. A very low risk strategy. It doesn't rely on a special acquisition or that the competition doesn't ramp up, or anything else. To deliver on that promise the company must only continue to do what they are currently doing and keep capturing market share. The main factors  modelled below will be an increase in sales, future margin assumptions, and CAPEX expansion. The growth statement made by the company is to be tested if it may be achievable by the company or not in the future.\n\n**Sales**\n\nFrom a first glance, the mattress industry being 'relatively flat' by the CEO at 6% and stated at around 3.2% by Statista. An average of those 2 will be used to forecast long term industry growth. These numbers are not very important since the company's strategy is to capture or take market share from existing players.  Meaning they can grow at a much higher rate than the industry's growth rate since. They are able to capture market shares a high rate since their product offering is unique and they have strong marketing footing. Said during the Analyst call in June, 90% of their 2020 revenue leveraged proprietary technology. This strategy has been working well so far for the company as shown by the image below. The company was able to grow approximately 50% between 2018 and 2019, and 2017 to 2018. This enables me to believe that the company's stated 30% CAGR for the next 3-5 years is quite achievable if not a conservative estimate.=\n\n[78 CAGR](https://preview.redd.it/axxcqjy5hov71.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=37125f6349eb6647f3207b8ada199911648211a2)\n\nNot only they plan to grow at a very high rate, but their 2025 goals will be achieved by working hard on margin expansion, lowering costs, production optimization, and better sourcing of raw materials. They will drive up their average mattress sales price from $1,900 to $2,400 over the next few years. As per below, the mass premium and premium segment of the market represents near 50% of all retail revenues. Purple is positioning itself very well to capture high margin revenues as their mean selling price is well above the $1,000 mark.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02k7ec2ndov71.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc83ff245c0bab1726b5d8c9578e9cf498aba7e5\n\nSaid during the Q2 call by the CEO, \"Purple is a world class product but not yet a world class manufacturer\". They already hired a former Toyota employee to help them optimize their production chain. Toyota being an efficiency leader, Purple will only benefit from this headhunt. A new distribution center in Georgia (East coast) will also help to keep distribution costs low to better serve the growing demand statewide for the company.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fuly6jnydov71.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=94910ed147b5656d4f04bafca84ac0a6dd50de1f\n\nThe channel by which they are selling are also changing quite fast. During the pandemic the DTC channel capture most of the revenue of the company but since the reopening, the trend is reverting the wholesale and retail. 8/10 of Purple's customer prefers to lay on the mattress before purchasing. Purple wants to place itself in a position to offer this feature to its client and that is why they plan to open many showrooms to meet their 2025 objectives. Currently at 15 showrooms and plan to reach 200 of top shelf real estate locations, to maximize returns on investment. This will be factored in our CAPEX expansion and in the valuation model of the company later. It is not clearly demonstrated in the 10Qs provided by the company but historically wholesaling and retail have lesser gross margins than DTC. The company believes in improving their production efficiency that even factoring the channel environment they can still deliver near 40% gross margins - an assumption that I will leave out of my model and retain a flat 55% given by taking the average of the past 6 quarters.\n\nWe will focus mostly on the $2.5B goal in the short them but the growth story of Purple doesn't stop there for the company as shown below. With an upcoming R&D center and other investments that the CEO was very excited discussing, M&A, talent acquisition, vertical integration and roll ups. The future of the company is very promising both on a medium and on a longer term basis. I will try to capture this long term growth in the last model that I will talk about using a discounted cash flow method.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/282obph8eov71.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8c5c42003c4f4b57e39eca9f2e491051e454d18\n\n# The Valuation\n\nThe valuation of the company will be estimated on 3 different time horizons, and 2 different models.\n\n1. Using a multiple approach of EPS\n   1. To value the 2 upcoming quarters of the fiscal period\n   2. These quarterly estimates will be summed with the first other quarters of the year to estimate the full 2021 fiscal period.\n2. A DCF model will be used to value the terminal and long term value of the company\n\n**Upcoming release**\n\nOn a shorter timeframe, we will try to estimate the share price of the company after the Q3 release that are coming for the 10th of November. I will repeat a few main point that were discussed above.\n\n1. The $11.2MM litigation expense will be remove from expenses\n2. The $50MM net revenue generated by the incident will be added back\n3. Margin will remain at an average of the past 6 quarters and so are all the other rows\n\n[Quarterly revenue estimates](https://preview.redd.it/0ficx4mefov71.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c503fd84ec822ec317a3d9711eab555b233a83b)\n\nUsing the information in the previous quarterly releases and the assumptions above the share price of the company is currently fairly valued to undervalued. Factoring a $50MM or 26% jump from Q2 to Q3 representing the $50MM of net revenue loss. The rest of the year is modelled using a flat growth rate to represent the past growth and to better increase the odds of this model. The $11.2MM was also omitted from the model to better forecast what would the company looks like on a forward basis. Looking at the multiple of EPS on the bottom right, the company looks fairly valued at P/E of 25 and under valued at using a multiple of 30. The current PE ratio of the whole market sits at 28.63 PE ([https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio)). A large proportion of the SP500 is FAANG stocks and technology stocks which are skewing this number so with no growth factored in it is safe to say that the company should recover to at least the $25 range after the quarterly release, giving it exactly the market PE. Depending on the outlook of the company and your expectation of the sector, one could accepter an event higher valuation.\n\nWith a simply return to the mean or put it simply that Purple is able to return to capacity and how the company was before the incident, its share price should recover to a number between 21.84 and 30.58 depending on the valuation. Quite achievable.\n\n**The next 5 years**\n\nThat said, we all know that companies are not priced on their current value but on their future expectations. Let me know show you what this company can do in the future if they simply deliver on their promises by continuing to do what they do. Sale mattresses, open new showrooms, expand their retail relations and optimize their factories to increase margins. No gambling or far fetched expectations here. The company already grew at around 78% CAGR over the past 4 years and should be able to meet expectations in the future given the current effort deployed by the company.\n\nLet's first discuss the sales forecast below. Revenue is forecasted to grow at 30% CAGR and the yearly values are shown below. To represent a rapidly growing company the Marketing and Sales category was increased a bit in 2022 and 2021 to represent inflation and efforts to drive sales up. R&D was also increased year over year to try to represent higher R&D cost and future investment in their upcoming R&D center. Terminal growth rate was also taken for Statista.\n\n[Sales growth](https://preview.redd.it/v45ymsilfov71.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7212b8062834948ee91b6b52e86e7b3858a307e)\n\nBasically, modeling the worst outcome where they meet the $2.5B plan in the 5th year and not the 3rd. Using the sales numbers above and a few assumptions. Even using high marketing and sales increase over the years, a high effective 21% tax rate, flat gross margins, it is estimated that the company will earn around $1.84 per share in 2025. This model is very conservative as it basically assumes flat gross margins and increases in costs over the years which is contrary to what the CEO believes. He believes they can reach 40% GM over the years which would have such a profound positive impact. The same can be said about the Operating income or EBITDA proxy. Here we have 6.64% Operating income on Revenue but on previous slides they forecast a  a 15% EBITDA margin. Once again, the print below is forecasting quasi worst-case scenario for the company.\n\n[5 year revenue estimates](https://preview.redd.it/if8y6g86fov71.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=637dfac4f63283fdb2484d4afc7f67a28bfb9c8a)\n\nEven then, the company manages a share price of 37.12$ on a 20 PE ratio and a $46.40 using 25 for the ratio. I believe a 25 ratio here would still be appropriate given the long-term outlook of the company and the current valuations of the market.\n\n**Long term valuation**\n\nUsing a discounted cash flow valuation model, we will try to capture some of this long-term growth. The first table of the print below takes the average of a few important variables when valuing Free Cash Flow to the Firm. Over the recent years, the company did invest in CAPEX, suffered Depreciation, and has paid stock-based comp. the Net change to working cap is quite negligible. Here are my assumptions to the model broken down by variables below:\n\n1. CAPEX was modelled at 4.51% given the average below and compounded at 25% YoY + the showroom expansion. Showroom expansion was increased using a straight-line increase of 46 showrooms per year at an average cost of 550k stated in the Q2 Earnings call.\n2. To remain on the safe side, Depreciation and amortization was forecasted multiplying the average of 0.78% over the past years an adjusted that number to grow at 500% compounded over the 5 years of the model. The company has barely any depreciation now but wanted to model what the future may look like and with all these showrooms and retail expansion should ramp up considerably.\n3. NCWC was modeled as an  average of forecasted sales with no adjustments.\n4. Stock based compensation was forecasted at 0.65% of estimated sales with a -50% adjustment as the company is not a start-up anymore and the decline of comp from 2019 to 2020 was -0.78%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[DCF CF](https://preview.redd.it/fvy4mr80gov71.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=35df3efc6df3322c62f587b823619ebfd91c0865)\n\nMore model assumptions for the DCF are listed in the print below. To estimate the present value of future cashflow, one needs to find the Weighted Average Cost of Capital to add precision to the model. You can think of the WACC as the discount rate. The rate at which future cashflows need to be discounted. The WACC goes a step further by representing each cost category and weighting them by the capital structure of the company. Cost of Debt was given in the last 10Q at 4.5% and the Tax rate was given an arbitrary 21% going forward. Cost of Equity was estimated using the following values and the CAPM. Beta was provided by Yahoo finance at 1.46, Risk free rate by the current 1.7%-ish 10-year US gov notes and risk premium of Purple given a 9% to keep on the safe side. The WACC of 14.41% is high for the company and should reduce considerably in the future after a few great quarters or years, which will reduce the WACC and increase quite considerably the value of the company.\n\n[DCF WACC](https://preview.redd.it/j9knehx2gov71.png?width=1464&format=png&auto=webp&s=220af4c4436454fad4b929bfceba5d82627565b0)\n\nThe 3rd and final model included in this DD, the 2-period DCF model. Using the forecasted revenue in the previous screen captures above the adding back the some of the values below to find FCFF over the next 5 periods. We then use the last revenue value of 2025 multiply it by 1 + the final growth rate of 3.2% and find the PV of the future cashflows of $1.8B. Summing up the PV of all CFs we arrive at a net present value of $12.252B, finding the MV of debt in the future and dividing that by a 2x amount shares, once again to air on the safe side, we find a SP of $91.29 for Purple.\n\n[FCFF DCF](https://preview.redd.it/2wrkobjbhov71.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=626bab0f2aa33db34f20e68edba40566da956097)\n\nGiven the 3 periods evaluated above, it is clear that Purple has a bright future ahead. As soon as the market will realize this in the next earnings release I expect the share price to recover in the high 20s and low 30s. If Purple continues to deliver in the following quarters and years we can expect a $60+ price is not unreasonable. I would like to place to emphasis on high cash producing capacity of this company. Purple marks its 6 years of existence and is already at 55% GM, what the future holds for this company is very promising. Cash is king. As the CEO said \"In the next release we will have a very clear line of sight on where the recovery and expansion is going. Demand is there and traffic is there\".\n\nI personally am very exited to see how this will pan out. I think the market is pricing too much risk in $prpl share price and I think this represents a great opportunity for us degenerates. All the 3 models above with a conservative approach are all valuating Purple at a much higher price than the market is right now. Investing in Purple now could return at least 2-300% on shares and for all the reasons above I think it merits at least regular-sized position in my portfolio. Place your bets kids, welcome to the casino.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mandatory disclosures:**\n\nThis is not financial advise and this post simply represents MY opinion on the company. It may or may not be in fact what turns out. Your mileage may vary.

Two large positions were opened or added to during Q3 of this year. First Wasatch Advisors added 1.6MM shares during that period for around $37MM depending on SP at that time. There are multiple reasons why a company would buy shares and being bearish is most certainly not one of them. Total of position worth approximately $152MM. Wasatch advisors are currently outperforming SP500 by around 20% currently since 2019. A new holdings for Scout investments worth around $6.8MM. This fund is outperforming the market by around 11% since 2019. You buy stocks when they are beaten down. When the markets sees no future for that company. You buy against the odds.
