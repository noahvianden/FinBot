Should I try to roll my puts or average down or should I try to catch it as it falls?\n\nTerminology. You started by asking about short positions, then talked about (presumably long) puts. A put is not a short. It's a *bearish directional play*, and so is shorting shares, but that doesn't mean a put is a short, any more than a call is a deed to some real estate, even though they both want the price of the underlying to go up.\n\nThe old phrase \"stairs up, elevator down\" is relevant here. Declines tend to be sharper and shorter in duration than rises. That means that timing is that much harder to get right on bearish plays. So you need to use strategies that spread out your risk of getting the timing wrong. Rolling puts on some schedule is one way to do that. Shorting shares is another (no expiration, so you can basically hold indefinitely, as long as you have the buying power to avoid a margin call).\n\nIf you decide to roll puts, you need to define an upper limit on either the total holding time, the total capital outlay, or both. Say you think the correction will happen within 30 days. You do a weekly put that is 2 weeks out and roll at the end of each week. So for example this Monday you might open the Nov 5 and then roll out to Nov 12 on Oct 29. But you only do that through Dec 3 or something like that. Or, alternatively, you give up after you've spent $X on puts that did not pay off.\n\nIf you are completely unsure about when the event will happen, it's best to just short shares and avoid expiration timing altogether.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "One method is a ratio spread.  \n\nSell a put at the money, buy two puts out of the money, located where the net will be a modest credit, say 0.50.   \n\nFor a 60 to 90 day period.  \n\nThis works best for low implied volatility envirionments.  \n\nExit **before** the mid-point of the term to expiration  \n (30 days, or 45 days for the two examples)   \n to avoid the pool of loss on modest down moves.  \n \nThis is for big moves down. \n\n\nExample with SPY  \nLINK:  http://opcalc.com/ClS    \n \nBuy 21 Jan 2022  $420.00 Put\t2 --\t$6.44\t  \nSell 21 Jan 2022  $452.00 Put\t1  -- $13.99\t \nNET\tCREDIT  $1.11  \n\nCollateral of  $3200 required. \n\n---  \n\nAnother method is a calendar spread.  \nYou could put out a fleet of these, expiring monthly.  \n\n\n\nHere a DIAGONAL Calendar  PUT Spread   \nIntending to reduce the cost, with the short higher than the long.   \n\n**RISK** if the stock goes rapidly down, and if it goes below the LONG PUT.\n\nExample with SPY  \nLINK:  \nhttp://opcalc.com/ClW     \n \nSPY Diagonal Calendar\nBuy 17 Dec $420.00 Put\t1\t$3.67\t \nSell 3 Dec $430.00 Put\t1\t$3.31\t \nTotal\t$0.36  Debit  \n\n$1000 collateral required.  \n\nYou could enter with two separated calendar spread to capture modest moves down. \n\nHere that might be   \nDec 17 $425 2x Long put // Dec 3  2x $430 short  put   \nDec 17 435 1xlong put // Dec 3 $440 1x short put.  \n\n\n\n---", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I’ve noticed with my broker, that when I’m selling puts and I have cash, it’s automatically made as a CSP.

Once you set the win condition, know what you need to put together each year in your preferred timeframe.  Again, spreadsheet.  Be sure to max out your employer match in any retirement plans, and set up a Roth IRA for yourself so your gains are tax free on the back end.\n3. Once you've got that down, read about an industry or product that fascinates you until you start seeing something many people don't.  For example, we currently have a giant supply chain issue due to the pandemic.  Someone more thoughtful than I has likely done some deep dives into who the main players are, what progress is being made, who's going to survive or come out on top, etc.  You don't need to know everything about everything; you need to know a lot about one useful thing.  Bitcoin is intriguing to me and I grasp the premise, but I'm nowhere near being able to make a significant move in.\n4. Enjoy life.  Although trite, it is true: you can't take it with you.

I am impressed by its performance! Not perfect, as evident, but VERY GOOD!\n\nGary should watch that and rethink his position w.r.t. other companies achieving FSD by 2025. I dont see anyone nearly as close as Tesla. Especially not with high def maps and lidar.\n\nDetection of what is around is one thing. Camera only vs. Lidar + Maps is in the end just money you throw at the problem. With cameras only a bit cheaper but a lot harder to get right. But I think Tesla done it on this one. No question about it. But reacting appropriately to a given situation is where the real magic is in FSD. And no one else has that. And no one else will get there as far as I can see. Camera only is just a waypoint on the path to autonomy. Detecting depth on cameras only is just a simpler subproblem of autonomy. Its a hard problem, no question about it, but its not the hardest one.\n\nThis was brilliant!", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Give it 3 more years and what Tesla will have will seem like magic.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I dont think its gonna take 3 years... maybe 1 year.. probably less.

The widespread adoption of electric vehicles, grid storage batteries, and solar, would forever change energy generation and use for civilizations worldwide.  Elon Musk and his team will settle for nothing less than a full transition of the world to renewable energy.

They did what was necessary to survive and then thrive.   That's why I became a TSLA investor in 2011.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) is another company that I think fits these 3 categories.  The stock has been beaten down this year, but the product is potentially game changing and the leadership both ambitious and sincere.\n\nFurther down the line, beyond 2030, I think the next giants may emerge from the Genomics and Biotech industries.

But the company does have a wealth of data concerning what its customers watch, which the company uses to determine the value derived from individual programs.  \n>  \n>“Squid Game” stands out both for its popularity, and its relatively low cost. The South Korean show, about indebted people in a deadly contest for a cash prize, generated $891.1 million in impact value, a metric the company uses to assess the performance from individual shows. The show cost just $21.4 million to produce -- about $2.4 million an episode.
