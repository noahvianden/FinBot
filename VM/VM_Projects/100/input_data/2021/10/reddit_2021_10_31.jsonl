{"title": "YOLO SPY CALL PLAY. 3k into 30k", "selftext": "I've been making a good amount on this bullish October push with SPY calls, and was thinking of rolling a good 3k into some options judging by Friday's last 30 min bullish push upwards of $3. All this FUD of crashing etc etc is scaring whoever the fuck out of this once in a lifetime bullish market that has been going on for the last year and a half. Is it going to \"crash\" once the FED stops buying assets and begins tapering? Yes. Is that going to happen in the next 3 weeks? Probably not. My bet is December or January. Still waiting to hear our lord and savior JPOW tell me on Wednesday that \"Inflation is transitory, fuck your puts.\" and he's keeping this crazy train running for another month or so.\n\nMy play then, is that I think the SPY will do 1 of 3 things opening into November.\n\n1. Straight bull rush the first week to 470.20. I don't think this is VERY likely, but it could happen. If anything goes well it should do a steady $2 or so a day climb with decent slow swings and quick buybacks, alongside strong EOD volume pushes.\n2. Maybe go up for 1-3 days then do a fake dip out before shooting up. More likely I think.\n3. Fib retracement 30%, probably down to 445-455ish before a huge push into the rest of November. This could also be a very likely scenario that might go with number 2. This would suck if you buy the calls on Monday and it drops 10 bucks. Good news is, I think they will hit no matter what.\n\nIt doesn't really matter what options happens as long as you look at Friday's graph(10/29/2021) and ask yourself, \"Does this look like it won't hit $470 (10 gain ) in roughly a month?I am almost certain it will.\n\nThat said, I have multiple option plays. The 3 that look the best to me are\n\n6 $500 ATM 460c Strike:11/19/2021 (Safest option, and 100%ish gain)\n\n30 $100 OTM 470c Strike:11/19/2021(Decent OTM option, even if it doesn't hit and runs up 5 bucks, you can still take a 150%ish gain)\n\nOr...\n\n300-350 $10 OTM 480c Strike:11/19/2021 (Most yolo option with a fair bit of play. This contract is right at the price where the option is going to start going up to 20, 30 bucks every 2ish bucks as the delta gets higher. These options will skyrocket if this thing gets anything over 460, which it is indeed about to do, in my opinion. The loss potential is right where it will start to go down a bit, but the good thing is the initial contract is only worth 10 bucks a piece. This means you might lose 1-5 bucks each contract if it goes down to retrace, but if this goes past 460 anytime in the next 3 weeks you're looking at roughly a 100-1000% gain. Based on my retarded math skills, I think a price increase to $470 will net each contract to be worth roughly what the 470's are right now, which is $100 per contract and a 1000% gain of 3.5k to 35k. Feel free to cash out at 465 and take 15kish if you don't wanna get greedy. I don't even think I have factored in implied Vol.)\n\nNow you may be saying to yourself this either sounds amazingly retarded, or amazingly retarded, but why? How? When?\n\nWell, that's my question to you. If I seem wrong in my calculations please let me know, if I am missing something, please let me know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut do yourself a favor and open the Strike:11/19/2021 calls and look at the open interest for the 460-470's. Don't even need it to hit 480 if it rises quick enough.\n\nDon't need much DD when the FED is buying everything for another month or so, but I have 2 friends that work at brokerages and I asked them both about the taper. They both said they were talked to about something like that happening but \"not yet\" as in a month or 2 out still I think. Maybe beginning 2022.\n\nPretty sure we're going up as the music continues to play. Worst case scenario, I lose 3.5k. Best case scenario, I make 15-30k ++++++++++++++\n\nEdit1: I think I am gonna go with option 3. A true Yolo. I lose 3.5k or gain $1-$35,000. If you truly follow the OI here, I see a bull rush to at least 470 by the end of 3 weeks, followed by a significant pullback to whatever until mid December, late December you see the calls start to stack again starting at the $460 and going into the $480 range.\n\nGuys, I think this might be the most retarded thing I've ever done, and my Grandma keeps telling me to \"be careful\" Whatever that means, but my other account is up 5k YTD so I'm still not really worried.\n\nEdit2: Option 3 theta decay holding x350 contracts. It's a 0.05 theta right now, which is about 5 bucks a day at the current price. Theta is almost non-existant till you get to that last week or the price moves toward 470ish, which at that point you SHOULD be up at least 5-10k anyways so it doesn't matter.\n\nFYI If you don't know anything about options or the Greeks, please watch this video before you message me with \"What should I buy?\" type questions, I am not a Financial Advisor.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgisRHEQ2FM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgisRHEQ2FM)  \n\n\nEdit3: Last Min change. Running both options through OPC multiple times, I think that the $475 strikes will have a significantly higher chance of hitting, and make you more money if the stock doesn't shoot up as quick as it we want. If the stock is sitting at 470 on Nov. 12th ( One week before xpry) with the 350x0.10 contracts at 480 it will be a profit of 70% ($2100), but if you take 120 of the 475's for the same date and if the stock is stetting at 470 with these calls you'll still be up 212% ($6360) and I will be looking to see, that Friday.", "id": "qjelqs", "created_utc": 1635641470.0, "score": 131, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 130, "comments": [{"body": ">Still waiting to hear our lord and savior JPOW tell me on Wednesday that \"Inflation is transitory, fuck your puts.\"\n\nAre you going to actually wait for this information or are you going to act before the information?

If your goal is to achieve the mathematically best risk-adjusted return, people who know what they’re doing will leave you in the dust. \n\nI feel so sorry for people who believe all of this nonsense. Mark Minervini and others are living proof of what’s possible. My own story is just one minor and unexceptional example. My business partner turned $5k into over $900k in one year, before the age of twenty. While I wouldn’t recommend his method to others (it takes pretty exceptional talent), ordinary people can easily outperform QQQ consistently, if they’re willing to spend five years learning and are passionate about trading, humble, and have realistic expectations. \n\nFor anyone who knows what they’re doing, passive investing is a nonstarter. \n\nArtem", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah but what you're saying is basically the exact reason passive investing is popular and recommended for most people.

That number is down to 2%\n\nWhy – The market has become more efficient.  It is harder to exploit.  What were sources of \"alpha\" are gone, dramatically reducing the ability to generate alpha.  The remaining competition is going to get better and better because the men and women left standing are more skillful than the people who were playing before.\"  90% of trading is done by institutional investors that know what they are doing.  And more money is chasing that shrinking pool of alpha that is available.  \n\nTaking more risks in your portfolio (IE – Leverage) doesn’t not increase your alpha.\n\nActive management is a zero-sum game.  For every winner, there must be a loser.  And usually that loser is an individual investor.

As 10% is 10%.\n\nThat being said if you are starting out lower shares could cause a few problems, mostly if you don't have access to a platform that allows fractional shares.\n\n1)Let's say you get a dividend of 10% a year as a simplified example. 1 share at $1000 you get $100 dividend. Great but now you need $900 more to get another 1 share.\n\nIf the price was $100 a share and you bought 10 (same $1000) you would be able to reinvest it and have 11 shares at the end of the year.\n\nWith the $1000 share you would have 1 share and $100 waiting for you to get enough to invest. This slows you down, this becomes less of a problem as you go but can be tough at the start. In this example it limits the ability for the compounding interest to be fully efficient.\n\n2) Smaller amounts of shares can be a problem if you wanted to rebalance or decide to change investments in the future.\n\nKeeping with the previous example of prices per share, if I had 3 shares at $1000 and it went up 10% I may want to take that 10% and invest it somewhere else. Sadly, I only have 3 shares so the best I could do is sell 1 share. So instead of just rebalancing with the 10% I would be limited to rebalancing with 33%.\n\nIf each share was $100, I would have been able to sell 3 shares. Keep my $3000 still invested but move the $300 to something else, vs selling 1 of the 3 shares for $1100.\n\n3) As others have said, it would also involves options, but as you are starting out, this could be something that isn't important to you.\n\nAll of this kinda revolves around you having a basic ideas and understanding of what you are doing, the risks and goals and plans for the investment.\n\nHopefully you understand the risks and basics of investing vs just trying to cash in on a way to get rich, because others have had luck. It is always a bit worrying when the only socks people reference are the \"popular\" picks at the time. \n\nIf you are starting out, please take some time to look at the basics and save yourself the costs of multiple small mistakes costing you your hard earned money.

I’d rather have a stock that is priced at $2000 go up 25% then a  stock priced at 50 go up 20%. Regardless, if you put x money in, the share price won’t matter, only the percentage it goes up by.\n\nIn fact if you have a company who’s stock is like $2000 they are more likely to have a stock split, stock splits bode very well for stock prices as it allows institutions and individuals to leverage their portfolios with options strategies.\n\nLet’s say I want to sell a cash covered put (which would essentially be you being paid to promise to buy 100 shares of a company if the stock falls below a certain (strike) price, and if it does not fall below the price then you keep the money (premium) they paid you, and if it does, you still keep the money). Now if I want to sell a cash covered put, I need to have the cash to cover it (thus the name) and so I would need 100x$2000= $200,000 for a cash covered put on a company’s $2000 stock. This is a lot of money, and it makes sense why you would be more willing to buy and sell options if instead of paying $200,000 you only had to pay $20,000 if they do a 10 to 1 split, or $2,000 if they did. 100 to 1 split.\n\nThat being said, you can also see the upside to having lower share prices. Lower share prices are more inviting towards (smaller) investors and just the psychology of seeing a low prices makes you think the price is cheap. However, the reality is that a companies share price is NOT a good indicator of how expensive or cheap it is. For example, berkshire hathaway class A shares are worth a staggering 420k+! Sounds like the most valuable stock out there, right? \n\nWell yes, and no. As an individual share yes it is worth a lot, but that’s only because they divide the market capitalization (the total value of all shares outstanding combined) amongst very little shares. In fact Berkshire Hathaway, while having a large market cap of over $600B is not worth even half of Apple, which has a market cap of over $2Trillion. Which means, if we look at the total worth of all shares, Apple’s shares are far more valuable than all of Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares combined.\n\nOn a side note: If your friend is giving you this type of advice, AND is telling you to buy hype stocks such as Palantir and Lucid, you’re better off not listening to him at all. If your looking to learn about how to invest, I’d stay away from the majority of youtubers, most of them are only performing well because the market has doubled due to its exaggerated rebound from the COVID crash, anyone can do well in a bull market. If you’re really interested in learning finding books, doing research are all great ways, but those are often time consuming, if you want to use youtubers and advice, I would recommend Everything Money ‘s channel.\n\nedit: \nif all of this isn’t complicated enough, you all have to consider revenue, income, P/E, sometimes P/S,  shares outstanding change, and more.

Buy one or two shares at a time in a company like Palantir or LUcid (theres a good chance you’ll lose money in these - at least short term). For stocks with massive high stock prices, like Tesla, use a service like Robinhood or Charles Schwab to buy a bit at a time. Maybe $10, $50, or $200 (your choice).

It will irrigate and check soil pH level. Elecitricity draw is nominal, and the sun does most of the hard work growing the vegetables. \n\nThe average parking space is 320 sq ft; covering 8 parking spaces with farming automation could place 13 farm.bot's above a Supercharger parking space. Water reclamation and timed irrigation can also be automated. \n\n240 Supercharger locations in California, assuming an average of 5 parking spaces, that's 1200 parking spaces, or 384,000 sq ft. Assuming the Farm.bot can be lined up to maximize use of the space, that's 1,989 Farm.bots. \n\n1 Farm.bot Genesis XL's can produce (optimized for growth time and rotation) enough vegetables to average out to 18.0 cups of consumable vegetables per day. Multiply that by 1,989 Farm.bots and you yield a potential 35,802 cups of vegetables per day (this doesn't take into consideration the calorie needs, so they're not optimized for caloric needs. See below for calorie optimization). \n\n35,802 cups of vegetables per day just for California. Placing farm/food automation near Superchargers means it's always near transportation systems, and always near a feasible power source with potentially backup power. Water can be optimized using rainfall and storage, or utility water. \n\n1,989 Farm.bot Genesis XL's would cost $9,945,000 just for the bots. Not sure the cost for how to deploy, and where, but just focusing on production, that's 35,802 cups of vegetables per day just grown at Supercharger locations. Scale it up, and start including other locations that similarly match Superchargers; or simply add parking lot cover/roof and continue to deploy the same way. \n\nOPTIMIZED FOR CALORIES:\n\nLet's just grow Black Beans, which have a high calories per kg count. 1,989 Farm.bots sitting on 383,877 sq ft of farming space can produce 7.23 calories produce 77.79 calories per sq ft per day. This equates to 29,863,634 calories per day in black beans. 2,000 calories per day is optimal, but trying to keep as many people alive as possible means rationing, and 1,200 calories per day can keep you \"alive and healthy\". \n\nThat means we could provide 1,200 calorie meals made up of black beans to 24,886 people per day. In California alone, we have 8 million people who qualify as \"food insecure\" (don't know where their next meal may come from). Using farming automation and rationing, for $9,945,000, we could feed 24,886 people. Forcing people to skip a day so others may eat seems cruel, so with a larger capital investment, more automation can happen not just at Superchargers, but rooftop farms, parking lots, warehouses, etc. We waste a LOT of space that we could automate into food production to keep people alive. \n\nUsing the black bean optimization, we're looking at $9,945,000 to feed 24,886 people, or $399.62 per person in perpetuity (other studies or calculations can tell how long the machines would last, maintenance, etc). That's $1.095 per person. More than 38 million Americans suffer food insecurity per year. For ~$41.6 million dollars, we could create the infrastructure to solve food insecurity in America. It isn't optimal diet, but it prevents the awfulness of starvation taking lives. \n\n811 million people around the world suffer food insecurity, but with a similar system like this (not necessarily black beans, I'm not a botanist nor a farmer), automation infrastructure could exist that produces enough food, by caloric need, to satisfy all starving people for $887.93 million.\n\nAdditional costs to consider:\n\n- soil purchase/maintenance/rotation\n- electricity needs of automation\n- individuals to oversee harvest and collecting the vegetables\n- repairs and maintenance\n- potentially a canning factory or service connected to this, to preserve the black beans and add to the reach of the program (canned foods become non-perishable, and can be shipped or stored)\n\nMy point is just that $887.93 million, we could barely scrape above the caloric needs of the food insecure. By quadrupling that investment to $3.551 billion, you protect against many concerns and overproduce calories to the point that food can reach everyone. \n\nWith a group like Tesla, they could start branching out into other types of services such as this. Tesla's manufacturing and automation capabilities seem perfect for operating a project like this, and could also add to the opportunity to learn about food automation in preparation for colonization of Mars and other planets beyond.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "TL;DR…\n\nHe asked for money, not ideas. /s", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "6 billion a day maybe.
