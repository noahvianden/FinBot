These next-generation modulators will replace today’s modulators that are made with expensive inorganic materials that no longer are able to scale up in speed and efficiency and consume massive amounts of power. LWLG polymer enabled modulators are 3x faster than today’s technology and require less than half the power to operate. In fact, these modulators are so “low power” that they eliminate the need for a driver on a chip which is an expensive and power hungry component.\n\nModulators are the backbone of the Internet whereby they are the primary active component within transceivers that switches the 1’s and 0’s of data via light.\n\nWhile the stock has increased significantly during 2021, it is anticipated that another massive run will occur within 12 months as their commercialization partners are made public and the technology becomes available to purchase. For several years, LWLG has been working with numerous Tier 1 companies under NDA and have a packaging partner who has assisted in developing their product based on their customer input. Earlier this year in May at the company’s annual shareholders meeting, LWLG finally revealed their commercialization plan which brought on new investor interest. \n\nLWLG’s proprietary polymer modulators will be integrated into silicon photonics foundries’ “menu” of options for chipmakers. It will be a natural and easy choice for transceiver makers to choose the fastest and most efficient modulator available. \n\nModulators are not only found in data center interconnects and transceivers, but also they are found in any device that processes data with light such as LIDAR for cars and medical sensing devices. Without a question, the addressable market is in the billions of dollars annually. \n\nToday data centers consume likely 5% of the world’s electricity. The value of drastically reducing the energy cost via LWLG enabled modulators is quite valuable in itself. \n\nThe CEO of the company, Dr. Michael Lebby, is one of the top minds and visionaries in the field of Photonics.

Note that there are nearly 3 million small to mid size data centers in the US alone. For the sake of easy calculations and to be “conservative” I will calculate revenue numbers from hyper scale data centers only. \n\nEach hyper scale data center contains upwards of 100,000 transceivers. The LWLG patents show that there are 4-8 modulators per transceiver. \n\nThat equates to 400,000 to 800,000 modulators per hyper scale data center. The industry goal over the next 5-10 years is to get to $1 per gbps in transmission costs. That’s certainly not the cost now, but to be conservative let’s say a 400 gig transceiver costs $400. \n\nThe big unknown that I cannot answer is cost of the modulators in each transceiver. Let’s estimate in the future 15% of the cost of a transceiver is modulators. That equals $60 per transceiver. I’d say this is conservative, too, since these high performance modulators should be the key value piece in future high performing transceivers. \n\nThat’s $6 million worth of modulators per hyper scale data center. $3,600,000,000.00 worth of modulators to supply ONLY the hyper scale data centers.\n\nAnother question is how often these transceivers are replaced? What is the recurring revenue possibility? \n\nOf course they won’t get to immediate 100% market share, but this just goes to show how big these numbers can get.

In Investopedia's credit card database, the average interest rate on credit cards was recently 19.62 percent. That is a rate of return that few investments can match.\n\nAnother compelling incentive to pay down debt is to improve your credit score, which is crucial if you ever need to borrow money, such as for a mortgage or a car loan. If you can secure a loan at all, having a low credit score can mean paying higher interest rates.\n\nYour credit score can have an impact on other elements of your life, such as insurance premiums, whether or not a landlord will rent to you, and even whether or not an employer will hire you.\n\nPaying off debt, especially if you have a lot of it, can be a wise decision just for that reason.Psychology plays a role in this as well, just as it does in investing.
