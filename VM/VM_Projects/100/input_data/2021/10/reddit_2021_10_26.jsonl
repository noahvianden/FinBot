{"title": "DFV's Roaring Kitty Spreadsheets Recreated with Free Data!", "selftext": "I have been working on a project to recreate DFV's Roaring Kitty (RK) spreadsheets that he used to track movements and metrics on thousands of stocks. This latest version tracks top movers, insider buying, industry breakdowns, and calculates multiple value metrics. I would love feedback and recommendations.\n\nThe spreadsheets now track:\n\n* A universe of over 3,000 stocks (and can handle thousands more)\n* The biggest daily movers\n* The biggest weekly movers\n* The stocks with the most insider buying\n* All stocks based on their industry and sub-industry\n* Valuation metrics for stocks that warrant further analysis\n\nYou can [view a working demo of the version v0.6 stock tracker here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1peYe8V-PDQwueKSbgGTgQXT5zFYhQ8niZvMJo3S_YI4/edit#gid=171851922&range=A1:C1). \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A view of the Weekly Movers](https://preview.redd.it/6qmdznrqoqv71.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=75fb079f8779aa5ca6373b59eb26c486dba4ac31)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Industry Tab View](https://preview.redd.it/314xiswsoqv71.png?width=1913&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2d1db0eabc359bb01b1c09418302000c310a4ce)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI started by breaking down [how the RK spreadsheets work together](https://www.reddit.com/r/RKSP/comments/nz32uu/rk_spreadsheets_and_how_theyre_related_link_to/). I got most of it right, but later learned I made a few mistakes.\n\n[How the RK Spreadsheets are connected and work together](https://preview.redd.it/zf3cg8zvoqv71.png?width=2002&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a8975bd30f5d721e41a5c16f7401d3495f1abc8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I built a working [Stock Universe (v0.5)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QAKESea8lpez5uTOdDyFJh3URpRNMnodRPAdFsD143Q/edit#gid=284741622&range=A1:C1) that acts as a database tracking over 3,000 US stocks.

You can download the v0.5 version sheets for yourself and put them to use. Just keep in mind they get a little slow during market hours, and sometimes crash (the new v0.6 is much better!). \n\nI highly recommend watching the [Roaring Kitty Tools Part 3 (Spreadsheets)](https://youtu.be/7wjWnMcdnlQ?t=240) video to understand how these sheets work.\n\nThe latest version (v0.6) has much more capability, is much faster, and works really well during market hours, but is still a work in progress.
