The companies have discussed a potential price of around $70 a share, which would value Pinterest at roughly $39 billion, one of the people said.\n\nSome interesting questions:\n\n* What is the potential synergy between these two companies? \n* What is your price target for Pinterest? (Disclosure I'm a bagholder at $75).\n* This seems clearly like a planned leak. What is this leak trying to achieve?\n* Are there better companies for acquisition of Pinterest?\n* What is your long term view of Pinterest?", "id": "qc3wuo", "created_utc": 1634744928.0, "score": 457, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 200, "comments": [{"body": "Well, at this point after the last few ERs, I would be fine cashing out at $70.

If they don't have anything to spend the money on, they send it to us as dividends\n* Dividends reduce the value of the company, and the shares, but we get the value in cash instead\n* When the company doesn't pay a dividend, they're using that revenue on our behalf to invest in the company to increase the value of our assets in the long term\n\nSo the revenue per share is what you get every year from the company, you either get it directly as a dividend, or you get it as an investment in your asset. Either way, that's how much benefit you get from owning a share. The price of the share is the cost to secure that stream of revenue. So then the question becomes \"how many years of revenue do I need, to make the cost of the share worthwhile?\"\n\nIf a company has a PE ratio of 15, it means it costs you 15x their last year's revenue to purchase the company. For companies that aren't growing or shrinking much, and hopefully pay drive dividends, this is a very useful metric. If you pay 15x revenue, and hold for 5 years, that means you've earned 1/3 the cost of your share back, and you've still got the share to sell. If your hold for 15 years, then in a way you've gotten all the cost of your share back, and anything else you get at that point is pure profit. And it means that given similar risks, all companies with a PE of 15 are giving about the same return.\n\nBut that's assuming that the future looks like the past. If the future is different than the past, then a backwards looking PE might but not be very useful at all. For example, if a company is increasing it's revenue at 100% per year, then in 15 years you'll have gotten about 1000x the first year's revenue, not 1x.\n\nPE ratios are just a simplified price tag, and they can work great.

What are biggest hurdles?  \nA: We don't want to add any new products in a cell constrained world. After Model Y ramp in Austin the focus shifts to CyberTruck which will depend on cell production and industry headwinds.  \n\nQ: With FSD miles exploding as more drivers get access, what will iteration look liike? Weekly or daily?  \nA: It's not about how much data we can collect, but how quickly we can process the data collected. This is where Dojo comes into play as it'll allow them to iterate faster. Realistically it's still not that simple.

And improving the quality of the cars is reducing the need for service in the first place. | Expanded growth of Superchargers is happening. They've doubled the network in the past 18 months and they plan to triple it in the next 2 years. They are adding mobile charging stations and will fiddle with pricing to encourage off-peak charging. They are also adding software updates that route you to less congested charging stations as part of the mapping software when considering the total duration of a road trip.\n\nQ: Is Tesla considering other ways of monetizing AI beyond FSD? And will games be built around FSD data?  \nA: Maybe use Dojo as a NN training system for other companies, but Tesla is too busy using it for themselves right now.  \n\nQ: How has FSD take rate changed since the monthly subscription was introduced?

(Another Space Spac)!\n\nFirst off, I'm going to only briefly touch on the technical prospects of the company. I have been assured, by people who are much smarter than I am, that they are fucking great. Head over to r/RKLB and check out what the nerds think. Here are highlights that I've selected because I think they're cool:\n\n* **Vertical Integration** \\- They make all their own shit, in house. 3D printing? Yup. Custom robotics production? Yuup. This is responsible for-\n* **Slashed Lead Time** \\- For commercial purposes, they've cut the time it takes to get your social-creditscore monitoring CubeSat into orbit from years to ***weeks***^(\\[1\\]). Seriously.\n* **Standard Setting Pricepoint** \\- USD$5,000,000 gets whatever the fuck you want into orbit^(\\[1\\]). Compared to other options that cost $200,000,000 or more. *We could crowdsource like six of you degenerates and have that stupid Harambe statue off this planet and into orbit in less than a month.* That's fucking bananas.\n* **Helicopter Retrieval of Rockets** \\- After having demonstrated the reusability of their boosters, they're now experimenting with *mid-air* retrieval by helicopter^(\\[2\\]). They're dope and they do dope shit, okay?\n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot. If you take one thing away from this fever dream of a highschool essay, it's this:\n\n* **THEY ARE AN ACTUAL, FUNCTIONING COMPANY THAT HAS CUSTOMERS WHO PAY THEM.**\n\nThis is something that *no other* space spac spork what-the-fuck-ever can boast, with one exception. They've delivered almost **two dozen successful payloads for NASA**, over one hundred satellites put into orbit successfully. **They've been working for giant names like NASA, Lockheed Martin and AeroJet Rocketdyne since 2018.** They have a button on their website that **you can click, and reserve a launch.**  Even Virgin Galactic ($SPCE) can't figure that part out.\n\nSuck on that, Branson.\n\n[No no, not these guys. AeroJet RocketDyne. The guys who work for the US DoE and made the nuclear generators for the Mars Rovers? \\[3\\]](https://preview.redd.it/h4xts6z2dou71.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eed61e7ac5d18382583b1771f6b654b0c109e579)\n\n**The only comparable company is SpaceX.** Yes, *that* SpaceX.\n\n# I Just Remembered SpaceX Exists, and Now I'm Uninterested.\n\nBut what about Elon, you ask? Surely the TechnoKing will use his superior intelligence, resources, suspiciously good hair and Meme Mastery to crush any competition? **Wrong.**\n\nRocketLab doesn't want to directly compete. **They are servicing a specific niche, and being the best at it.** Their Electron rocket is small, efficient, agile. They may not get to carry the men to walk on Mars, but when Bezos needs another bottle of champagne aboard his Orbital Space Harem, or when the astronauts on the 2030 moonbase need fresh porno mags, they'll be there.\n\n**Betting on RKLB isn't betting against Elon**, it's betting that that Elon and all these other big dick billionaires are gonna do what they're already doing; build the infrastructure necessary to leave the poors behind on this dirty, boiling rock.\n\n# Okay, Now Tell Me a Different Thing.\n\nI'm glad you asked! Introducing Peter Beck, CEO and founder. I'm not gonna suck the man's dick too hard, but let's set the record straight. He's not a businessman, he's not a pretty face, **he's a goddamn rocket scientist.**\n\nHe is not doing this to get rich. He is not doing this to be famous. He has been making rockets for nearly three decades because he *fucking loves rockets.* **RocketLab has pulled top-tier talent from global competitors** because this is the company you want to work for if you want to be on the bleeding edge of rocket tech.\n\nThere's a cute anecdote about his parents getting called to a grade-school counselor meeting to discuss his \"absurdly unachievable dreams\" of \"building rockets for a living\".\n\nOh, did I mention that he's a **Professor of Engineering** at the University of Auckland, **without having ever attended university?** ^(\\[4\\]) He just skipped the part where he drops out of college and went straight to the 'being a maverick' part. Fuck you, Zuckerberg. Fuck you, Gates.\n\n**Peter Beck eats, breathes and shits rockets.**\n\n[The stone cold stare of a serial killer.](https://preview.redd.it/mm8djq0bdou71.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1611a8b49600c35f63587c9b4040fe28bb26962)\n\n# He Looks Like Fat Dennis Reynolds in That One Episode.\n\nA little.\n\n# Do You Really Think You Noticed Something Wall St Overlooked?\n\nYes.\n\nThis is a growth play. **This is a 15† year old company that** is good at what they do, and are getting better. RocketLab **has completed investment into upscaling their infrastructure** to meet growing demand^(\\[5\\]).\n\nThey have a proven track record. They have first mover advantage. They have the financial backing of major players. **They have rockets that work.** I really can't stress how unique that is.\n\nThere's an incredible amount of risk associated with space and space accessories. If you had looked at Apple in the nineties as a struggling computer company, you might have missed the story about Steve Jobs' singular and impressive passion for being a demented control freak^(\\[6\\]). **This is a story about vision and dedication, and also rockets.**\n\n[Yeah, yeah. I'm not a big charts guy, sue me.](https://preview.redd.it/a5lholwfdou71.png?width=1283&format=png&auto=webp&s=755686c4dedd425fd8e0f9760af835fbc9129109)\n\n# This Chart Looks Like A Regular De-SPAC PnD, tho?\n\nAdmittedly, the chart looks gross, and not just because it's yahoo. This chart in particular however, is a filthy little liar.\n\n**RocketLab was taken public via de-SPAC about a month ago.** I think you can guess where. Because of all the weird activity and the small time frame, a lot of useful indicators are wonky here. In spite of all this, **I think now is an excellent time to start building a RKLB position.** Surprise, surprise.\n\nIn terms of getting dumped on further, downside risk is mitigated as **RocketLab has recently unlocked the PIPE shares and filed an S1-A to offer shares at $16**^(\\[7\\]).\n\nRocketLab also had very high Short Interest until recently. **Cost to borrow dropped from over 100% to below 40% in the last few days**^(\\[8\\]), which would seem to indicate Shorts are interested in covering at these levels. As of writing, **RSI has broken below 40** which would indicate it is leaning towards, if not already, oversold.\n\n**In terms of potential upside, they have earnings and two rocket launches scheduled in November**. Remember, these aren't tests. They're putting functional satellites into orbit for BlackSky^(\\[9\\]). Additionally, **early investors are incentivized to keep the price high** as they get additional equity paid out if the stock stays above $20 for twenty days out of thirty^(\\[7\\]) before the end of March.\n\nThese launches are going to be great publicity as **RocketLab is gaining a critical mass of attention**. If we get even one-tenth of the speculative valuation that Tesla has, I will be a very rich man.\n\n# Okay, But What If I'm A Bear?\n\nIf you are worried about inflation, Chinese fuckery, the debt ceiling, energy crises, World War III or the boogey man, then I'm not sure why you're reading about speculative tech growth companies that build expensive, highly combustible space trebuchets.\n\nRocketLab is subject to the whims and vagaries of the market just like everything else. If the apocalypse starts, I'm not worried about money.\n\n**I am very bullish.** I will remind you that **nothing has fundamentally changed about any of these bearish narratives yet we are approaching SPY ATH**. Stonks only go up. Twerk cock, fist on chest, no fear, etc.\n\n# tl;dr\n\nI Like Space. 🚀🚀🚀\n\n# Disclaimers and Positions\n\nPrice Target: $20 End of March '22\n\n800 shares @ \\~$12 cost basis\n\n\\-2 12.50p 11/19 for 1.50 credit\n\nAs far as my bona fides, I've made almost 100k YTD starting with an 8k account exclusively trading memes, sentiment and momentum.\n\nYou want some advice?

Also, none of this is financial advice, and I drink my dog's dirty bathwater to cure covid.\n\nI can't read tea leaves on when, but this feels an awful lot like the dotcom bubble.

Competition starts taking market share (they're down to 20% of the global EV market now, from 60% 3 years ago)\n2.

Costs of battery materials begin to rise, as more and more manufacturers start bidding for the same Lithium, Nickel, and Cobalt that Tesla needs.\n\nI gotta finish by saying that I'm a huge fan of the company. I think they brought America back as a brand of American car that is forward thinking, revolutionary, and desired. If you would have asked me if BMW would start losing sales of their beloved 3 series to a 45k American alternative 10 years ago, I would laughed in your face.\n\nI just can't look at their balance sheet and see how it's worth what people think it is a at the moment, and don't see Elon delivering on his timelines and functionality any time soon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*shrug\\*", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "> I'm not a fucking day trader", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Bc he’s a big ole titty babt", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Shorting pets.com would have made you go broke even if you correctly called it garbage and just shorted at the wrong time.

This isn’t in massive quantities, but currently at low-medium scale. It’s a risk, but still very reasonable they hit medium-high scale near term.\n\nGigapress is very much not a fantasy it’s already hot and ready for Berlin. The casts can be seen at the Berlin factory, and they made no indication in any of their earnings calls of Gigapress being a risk.\n\nA few positives you need to consider as well. A large number of new car buyers are now saying their next car will be an EV over ICE. This is because longer vehicle lifetime due to lower maintenance. EV’s are currently also only 3% of all car sales, so theres a massive gap they need to fill. Even if you think competition is coming, competition has plans all the way out in 2024, and in low volume. There’s enough room for Tesla to dominate and competition to scale.\n\nA potential tax credit of 7500 is also bonkers and would potentially mean that Tesla wouldn’t have to lower prices for several years.\n\nCybertruck production beginning in 2023 means that Tesla has another massive lever to pull for high ASP vehicle without needing to even lean on a 20k car yet.\n\nFSD doesn’t need to be L5 ready, but it’s definitely improving rapidly. If it can be a very good L2-L4 system where you need to be hands on wheel, but it’s basically relaxing, take rate could improve drastically.\n\nPrice cuts cause exponential demand increases, not linear. Even if a price cut was needed, such as 10k, this could very easy triple the total number of customers. Assuming other improvements as mentioned, such as gigapress, 4680, then even with a 10k price cut, they may still be able to maintain 30% or higher margins.\n\nChip shortage is expected to alleviate soon, which should improve margins very nicely.
