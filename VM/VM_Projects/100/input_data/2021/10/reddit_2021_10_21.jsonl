Tesla is moving from charging a flat price for FSD to a subscription model. Under such a model, it would be pretty easy to envisage Tesla licensing the technology to other makers for 50%.

I'm not entirely sure how much it will help AMD in the PC space, but I could see AMD/Xilinx chips being used almost everywhere else (phones, automotive, medical devices, etc etc etc).\n\nI'm also looking forward to AMD's chip stacking technology which we should see in 2022.  There's also word floating around that they're bringing chiplet architecture to their graphics line.  If the performance improvement is anything like Ryzen we're going to have our minds blown.\n\nRegarding Apple, they never used AMD in the first place so it's not like AMD took a loss there.  I think x86 will dominate PCs for years to come.  Same thing in the server space.  You can't just go to a new chip architecture without rewriting and retesting all your software.  Only companies that are highly vertically integrated like Apple or Amazon is capable of such a thing, and even for them it not easy or cheap.\n\nAnother reason I'm bullish is Intel.  They're losing market share to AMD in every market.  They've never had an answer to Ryzen (we'll see what happens with Intel's upcoming chips). They're a big lumber giant that got lazy and complacent. They've been making big noise and headlines about all the great things they say they're gonna do and how they have so much \"leadership\", but so far it's just a lot of chest thumping and hot air.\n\nSorry if this has a total lack of fundamentals or technicals.  I look at enough hardware reviews/news and I'm around enough like-minded people that it's hard not to see that all the momentum is on AMD's side.

We don't need a bunch of conspiracy theorists to figure out these things, and there also things that are really problems because the cars are so popular and the company is growing so quickly.\n* Unknown issues - for example, there was a problem with the automated pack assembly in Giga Nevada during the Model 3 ramp up. There's undoubtedly been lots of parts supply problems that have held back production of different models at different times. And there's other issues that are going to come up, specific problems with the new factories that will slow things down, etc.\n\nTSLAQ has never spotted one of those second kind of problems ahead of time. They come up with lots of conspiracy theories and ideas about fraud and drugs and ponzi schemes and problems with suppliers or financing or almost anything else. But for all their critical thinking they've never once landed on an issue that eventually turned out to be a real problem. But they have a great track record of \"false positives\" of coming up with serious, 100% certain, big problems that never turn out to be an issue. They even have people doing flyovers and going out to count cars and bothering employees sometimes, etc. And lots of them seem to know owners and/or employees that have the inside info about some serious complaint, and nothing ever comes of it.\n\nIf you want to know what's good and bad about Tesla, just ask an owner, or an investor.

{"title": "The Passive / Index Investing Bubble is Causing Inflation", "selftext": "In late 2019 Burry issued a warning about index funds claiming that they were creating a bubble akin to CDOs from the GFC. That being because Index funds simply passively invest flows into a basket of underlying stocks with no security analysis being done. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ stocks are the largest benefactors of this. Especially tech stocks. It creates a positive reinforcement loop wherein winners that are included into the indexes are then rewarded with more flows from the index funds. \n\nThe problem comes when stocks are not being priced based on fundamental analysis and realistic expectations of the future and rather on their ability to disrupt, innovate and or change the world. With a historically high CAPE ratio and large equity bubbles that are obvious to the even the most amateur of security analysts it begs the question, How do these stocks keep rising? \n\nOne half euphoric anticipation and greed, one half passive flows.\n\nGreat, but how is that inflationary?\n\nCost of equity.\n\nCost of equity = Risk Free Return + (Beta x (Average Stock Return - Risk Free Return))\n\nYou can think of it this way. If a stock has an intrinsic value of $100 and it's current market price is $25 then as a shareholder I would hope that the company would buyback shares instead of reinvesting into the company (There are always what ifs and caveats but generally this is logical). Now lets say the price goes to $150, as a shareholder I would encourage the company to reinvest into the business instead of buy back shares at an overvalued price.\n\nSince we have established that the big tech names and speculative companies that are not currently adding tangible economic benefit (by tangible I mean goods such as shirts, concrete, food Etc) are the largest benefactors of the Index and speculation bubble, we must assume there are losers. Since the winners are tech and speculative stocks then the losers must be the tangible goods and \"value\" stocks. Imagine a friend getting excited to buy a paper mill company, or electrical wiring producer. The thought of that seems taboo in the current market structure. Pricing has reflected this. Small cap value has been severely under performing the S&P 500. This underperformance is not to be confused with the underperformance of earnings or fundamentals. \n\nSince price has not followed the fundamental performance of many of these boring stocks, what has been the result is an attractive share buyback opportunity. In the long run this may prove bullish for shareholders when the market reprices the undervalued companies, however a more sinister problem emerges. When a paper mill would rather buy shares back then to invest in new paper mills what follows is a shortage of paper. What happens in the wake a producer shortage? **Inflation**. \n\nWhat companies can generally handle inflation well? Companies with absurd FCF and monopolistic pricing power. See Amazon, Apple and Facebook. Well if it is the case that the hedge to inflation in the equity markets are the giants of tech then it must mean that once again the losers are the boring small cap producers of real goods. As the variable costs of producing tangible goods increases while the fixed costs of running a SaaS company stay relatively the same, the variable cost heavy business will fall further behind. The only variable cost business that can truly weather the storm are those that have an effective monopoly on their market like Apple and Amazon. \n\nThis may create additional downward pressure on the small cap tangible producers who are forced to raise prices not only because of increasing variable costs but a lack of adequate equity sale opportunity of which is in part due to a index / passive bubble.\n\nOf course there will be a large implication on the debt markets but I don't feel the need to speculate too far away from the central thesis of this write up.\n\nCovid supply chain issues are inflationary. Fed policies are inflationary. Current legislation is inflationary. Public sentiment concerning inflation can lead to a self fulfilling prophecy of which, is inflationary. The incentives to turn against the only adequate energy resources is inflationary.

They haven’t reached full communism yet.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "lols, let's dig into Communism, for you know not what it is or means.\n\nWhat Is Communism?\n\nCommunism is a political and economic ideology that positions itself in opposition to liberal democracy and capitalism, advocating instead for a classless system in which the means of production are owned communally and private property is nonexistent or severely curtailed.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nCommunism is an economic ideology that advocates for a classless society in which all property and wealth are communally-owned, instead of by individuals.\n\nThe communist ideology was developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and is the opposite of a capitalist one, which relies on democracy and production of capital to form a society.\n\nProminent examples of communism were the Soviet Union and China. While the former collapsed in 1991, the latter has drastically revised its economic system to include elements of capitalism.\n\nUnderstanding Communism\n\n\"Communism\" is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of ideologies. The term's modern usage originated with Victor d'Hupay, an 18th-century French aristocrat who advocated living in \"communes\" in which all property would be shared, and \"all may benefit from everybody's work.\" The idea was hardly new even at that time, however: the Book of Acts describes first-century Christian communities holding property in common according to a system known as koinonia, which inspired later religious groups such as the 17th-century English \"Diggers\" to reject private ownership.\n\nThe Communist Manifesto\n\nModern communist ideology began to develop during the French Revolution, and its seminal tract, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels' \"Communist Manifesto,\" was published in 1848. That pamphlet rejected the Christian tenor of previous communist philosophies, laying out a materialist and—its proponents claim—scientific analysis of the history and future trajectory of human society. \"The history of all hitherto existing society,\" Marx and Engels wrote, \"is the history of class struggles.\"\n\nThe Communist Manifesto presented the French Revolution as a major historical turning point, when the \"bourgeoisie\" —the merchant class that was in the process of consolidating control over the \"means of production\" —overturned the feudal power structure and ushered in the modern, capitalist era. That revolution replaced the medieval class struggle, which pitted the nobility against the serfs, with the modern one pitting the bourgeois owners of capital against the \"proletariat,\" the working class who sell their labor for wages.\n\nn the Communist Manifesto and later works, Marx, Engels, and their followers advocated (and predicted as historically inevitable) a global proletarian revolution, which would usher in first an era of socialism, then of communism. This final stage of human development would mark the end of class struggle and therefore of history: all people would live in social equilibrium, without class distinctions, family structures, religion, or property. The state, too, would \"wither away.\" The economy would function, as a popular Marxist slogan puts it, \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd>\n\nCommunism failed due to several reasons, including a lack of profit incentive among citizens, the failure of central planning, and the impact of power being seized by such a small number of people, who then exploited it and gamed the system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, there is no such a thing as \"the richest man in china\" because the state owns shitt and people don't.

Nothing else is currently gathering as much data to train as Tesla.

{"title": "Why $SAM is the ultimate lotto", "selftext": " \n\nSup retards. So we know a lotto ticket is a **low cost, high reward** scenario. We fully expect to get no return but there is a chance it can payout well. This is my *ultimate* lotto ticket. Like there is no way this thing should print, but on the chance that it does… it could be explosive returns.\n\n**TLDR:: $SAM 900c 12/17 if you wanna actually post gain porn someday.**\n\n**\\*SAM 12/17 900c\\*** you can snag for .75 fill. (75 bucks if you somehow didn't understand)\n\nLet’s say you go above the ask and pay $85 for one of these tickets. **These used to be worth over $40,000.**\n\n \n\n[peak value of 43k\\/contract](https://preview.redd.it/5cp1etjriuu71.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fadca8804c33a5d0964a5a9ab14fed2b23fa5306)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*So, what happened?\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell SAM didn’t meet expectations with their hard seltzer sales last earnings. Thing is, I am in college. I'm sure the rest of you college tards can confirm that now that colleges are back in person, white girls are drinking Truly (the seltzer SAM makes), like it's water. Seriously, these girls putting it in their hydro flasks and sippin during class. They are fiends. There is no way seltzer sales will continue to be declining. They will only increase.\n\nSAM has a $6.4bln market cap, 9.3m free float, ER 10/21. This thing is primed to explode harder than Orange Man after seeing his gains today (iykyk).\n\n\\*Technicals:\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[this thing is ready to launch](https://preview.redd.it/s7oum7owiuu71.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=02869c8a94edbec84c02b1de021a922e00ac69d0)\n\n**Oversold.** Sitting right on the 200ma weekly. It’s very rare for an equity to lose this. It’s the hardest support. Daily is rounding out. Appears to be a lack of sellers here as the stock is down over 50% from 2 months ago. $539.19 is daily resistance and would signal a trend reversal. 4 hour: 50MA showing resistance - $529.11, if the 9EMA crosses the 50MA we would get a micro reversal. 531.92 would trigger a buy signal on the 4hr + daily. MACD has crossed bullish on the DMA’s - just waiting for volume. Analysts: out of 12 ratings that I’m seeing we have an average of $800’s. That’s 25% above where it is now. Many remain with a PT of $1400. There is an analyst who has a PT of $400. Hypothetically if SAM were to touch its ATH again, this would be a 300 bagger.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[look at that yuuuuuuuge gap](https://preview.redd.it/0o25dpcziuu71.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c96c97289a06b4618a3a63a3272a8dfc0a18339)\n\nAs you can see, $SAM also has a huge gap to fill from $700-900. With such a small float, this thing is ready to fly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill this hit 40k/contract again? Probably not. Will this at least be profitable? I certainly think so.\n\nMy position: i picked up some SAM 900c 12/17\n\nTLDR: SAM 900c will make us fucking rich. NFA.

That's the average of the bid and ask price. If the bid is 1.95 with 150 open bids and ask is 2.05 with 75, it's probably pretty accurate. There's probably also a lot of volume and open contracts. If it's showing 2 bids at 1.00 and the ask is $3.00x150 with 200 open contracts and 0 volume, it's just one asshole asking way more than they're worth who owns the majority of open contracts. It probably closed at 1.25 yesterday. That's why you'll often see OTM options shoot straight up at open and then drop as they don't get any bites on contracts that are 5x more than they closed at the day before.\n\n(2) Contract premium/percent gain\nIf a contract is worth 1.50 and it goes up 0.15 to 1.65, you see a 10% increase. If a contract is worth 0.02 and goes to 0.03, you see a 50% increase. So the 0.02 contract looks like it was the better pick. but if the bid is 0.02 and ask is 0.03, it probably doesn't matter, because you'll have to sell it for 0.02 and there goes your 50% gains. A one cent change may not hold on those lower premium options. Also, some securities trade in only 0.05 increments, so that has to be taken into account as well. Just because it may say a contract has a premium of 0.08 doesn't mean anyone can even sell it to you for that. You'll have to pay 0.10 unless someone offers it for 0.05, but that would be a 50% drop, so it may not happen.\n\n\nIf you haven't already, learn about the \"greeks\". There's lots of good youtube videos, so just find a few until you come across something that explains it well to you. Implied volatility (IV) is a big deal. It's sort of a measure of trading momentum, and the percentage by which IV rises or falls can dramatically impact options premiums. You'd like the IV to be as low as you can get it. The higher the IV, the bigger the risk, because IV crush is when the IV drops from say 350% to 120% and kills the premium even though the underlying stock may have not dropped. You can even lose money if say the underlying stock is at $50 today with an IV of 350% and closes tomorrow at $50.75 with an IV of 120%. Sure, the stock went up, but people aren't going crazy trying to trade the calls. Maybe the day before it was $50, it was $38. It went up 30% in a day, IV shot up, premiums shot up. The next day it cooled down, IV dropped, premiums dropped, and you lost money even though the stock increased in value. Likewise, you can lose money on puts the same way even if the stock goes down. Fun!\n\n\nNone of that was financial advice, but I will say this: If you don't know much about options, don't throw money into them until you have some understanding. Sure you can make a lot of money quickly, but you can lose it just as fast. OTM contracts usually lose money, so if you get enamored by gain porn on here and try to bet $1000 on some 3dte (days to expiration) options that are 200% out of the money, you're probably going to have a bad time. Even if you get lucky the very first time you try it, you'll almost certainly not get lucky over and over again. You'll probably lose all those gains immediately. Start off by paper trading. Use some sort of programs that will let you \"buy and sell\" options in a simulation where you're not actually risking any money. Do that until you at least understand the basics. Even when you start trading for real, don't risk your rent money, just what you're willing to lose.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for all that info!

PayPal was at a very overbought level and could continue to run down into the 180s very likely. The 3rd party taxes is a pretty big freaking deal and horrible for them (also Venmo). Not only will they “100%” lose growth as many private hair stylists, handymen etc will search a new way to avoid taxes probably pushing cash again as it’s not unpopular, just inconvenient. Not only will they lose that but just basic people that are just too dumb to read and know it’s goods and services will also stray away so they don’t pay taxes paying suzie for lunch because they just don’t understand. \n\nIn a nutshell though 230s-240s should have alot of support. I think it will break that level but needs a negative market run or a catalyst maybe earnings in a couple weeks because of a “comment on the call” after hours. I find it hard to believe PayPal would rally before seeing the effects in 1st quarter earning after the new taxing takes place in 2022. But as far as a temporary pump?
