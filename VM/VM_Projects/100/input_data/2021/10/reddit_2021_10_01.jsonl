I was ready to start investing, did a bunch of research on stocks and options (taking detailed notes on the InTheMoney videos, reading everything I could, etc), and was excited as hell.  LEAPS seemed like the perfect balance of safety and leverage. \n\nI thought the timing was great — vaccines had just become available, and the delta variant hadn’t arrived here yet. \n\nI wanted to go with an ETF as well (seemed safer), and did a bunch of research and went with ARKG.

I thought, “even if the price goes down a bit, I have a whole year for it to go back up.”  But you never know what is going to happen, and the market is a brutal teacher.  You’re not getting a refund if things go south. \n\nUnless you’re ready to place that 3.5k on red or black at the casino, I wouldn’t buy LEAPS yet. I thought I had done my research because I understood how options worked and read A TON.

Buy a little, watch the price, and when it goes down, buy a little more. The stock will inevitably go down at some point after you buy, and when you have cash ready to buy more, you can lower your average cost. The chances that you’re buying at the lowest point the first time are almost zero (several times I’ve gone all in on stocks thinking they’d never be that low again, and then they drop like 10 more percent). \n\n-Reddit and Twitter both like to pump stocks.

Government protection and business interference.\n\nIf it is so save Volkswagen in Germany or GM in the USA or everywhere else, Governments will do all they can to make the taxpayer subsidise the inefficiency of the legacy Dinosaurs. What Biden is doing is just the beginning. Too many trade union jobs and too much political influence is at stake.\n\n2) Late party for ICE vehicles\n\nThe car business is a business with very low net margins, 3-4% in most cases. Every car maker which manages to increase prices 4-8% with some excuse or other (chips) will double or triple its profit per car sold. This will allow them to absorb a lot of waning car sales for another 2,3, perhaps 4 years.\n\n3) Sheer numbers\n\nThe planet wants, on average, 90 million cars a year. In 5 years' time, Tesla will not produce more than 5 to 7, all others together perhaps once or twice as much. Even with waning sales, there will still be a base level of demand for company cars and the like, and he who can't get a Tesla will get either an ICE vehicle or an inferior non-Tesla electric car if he can get one. In time (say, 2035), as the big names ramp up production, you will have a market of 90 million EV, of which 20 million Tesla and 70 million inferior non-Tesla. Not enough to get really fat, but enough to survive and get a piece of the action.\n\nI think something similar to Apple phones will happen. Apple never took all of the market. Even now, they only have 20% of the sales. But they make 80% of the profits.\n\nThis is the situation I see in 2031 or a bit later: Tesla has 20% of the market and 80% of the profits, the others share the rest among themselves; the Chinese producer will dominate China but the tariffs will not allow them to crush GM, Ford, Stellantis etc. The legacy maker will get out of this with one or two limbs amputated, but alive.

That would be 6.834M cars per year by 2026.\nThis is in-line with what the company has repeatedly guided (average 50% growth in deliveries/production YoY long-term till 2030). As per their most recent conference call (and many discussions with Elon prior), as far as they can see (and from what wait times for their vehicles globally indicate as well as the pre-order list of vehicles like the cybertruck) demand for their vehicles is virtually unlimited.\n\nTesla currently has an average selling price of 49 078 (Automotive sales revenue of 11.672 billion/237823 cars sold) as of the last quarter.\n\nAllowing for a gradual decline of ASP to 44 000 per year by 2026 (44 000 is the price of the cheapest current tesla vehicle in the US- the Model 3 SR+), that would equal 2026 automotive revenue of 300.696B in automotive revenue (44000 x 6 834 000).\n\nTesla's current gross margin is an industry leading 30% with healthy operating margins of about 15% despite barely producing any of their higher margin vehicles (S & X). Let's conservatively assume these margins stagnate at their current level till 2026 for whatever reason even though Tesla's long term margin have been trending upward due to a greater portion of their production coming from their newer and more efficient factories with lower operating costs.\n\nThis leaves 45.104B operating profit. Assuming 15% for tax (they paid 12% for tax in the last quarter) that leaves 38.338B net income after tax for the year 2026. (Note that Tesla has minimal amounts of debt to pay down, unlike most other automakers.)\n\nDetermining a PE in 2026 is a more subjective question subject to a lot of external macroeconomic influences. Amazon has traded at a PE of 90 or greater for most of its life while it was in a similar phase of growth (though in fact slower than Tesla currently), but I'll assign a PE of 70 to my net income value, again, to be conservative, which gives a market cap of 2.683T (and a stock price around ~2600) for their auto manufacturing business alone.

The Chinese govt is putting in place environmental and energy regs that will affect a lot. This isn't the first time this has happened. It's not new. The last time was just before covid and it cause lots of headaches. But we adjusted and got through it.  \n\n\nRegardless, how that affects non-China mfg. Basically how that works is the vast majority of products we buy today would simply be far too expensive to have mfg in North America. It's not just the higher mfg cost, but then every tier of distribution multiplies on that higher price. So we are talking 200% on average inflation over night. That is not an exaggeration, that is what the real numbers add up too.   \nThese products would simply cease to exist, and that is a significant portion of the goods we consume. That will be one hell of a shock to the world. Not just consumers, but all the mounds of US jobs in shipping, distribution, warehousing, retail, etc. And all the indirect jobs of course. In other words, not mfg in China would make the great depression look like child's play here in the US. It's simply not possible to come back from that without either going back to the way it was, or massive increases in mfg automation in the US. Yes, robots taking US mfg jobs absolutely results in more US jobs later in the supply chain. Robots keep costs down so that products can cut in distributors and retailers.  \n\n\nmfg in other low cost nations are possible of course. And we do a lot of that now. But especially in asia, any crap the China goes through will drastically effect all other Asian countries. Maybe Africa? But really, no other country has the infrastructure for mfg like China does, so a ton will be lost in logistical efficiencies. As an example, the US isn't setup for mfg anything like what China is. It's seriously significantly easier to find manufactures and have them make stuff in China than it is in your own US state. Seriously, it is ridiculously hard to find mfg here at all to even respond. Even if we wanted to mfg in the US, and I still do try many times. We can't find anyone to make our goods.  \n\n\nLong story short.

In December 2018, the company signed a deal with Novartis subsidiary Sandoz to sell, distribute and co-brand Tilray's non-smokeable/non-combustible medical cannabis products in legal markets worldwide.  \nOn June 19, 2018, Tilray announced the launch of High Park Company   \nwhich would operate in the adult recreational cannabis market to   \nestablish unique adult-use brands in Canada upon its legalization.\n\nIn July 2018, Tilray became the first cannabis company to trade publicly on a major U.S. stock exchange, opening on the NASDAQ exchange at a price of $17 per share, which increased in September 2018 to $214 per share, and then descended to $29 per share by August 2019. The IPO raised US$153 million.\n\nIn 2018, Tilray announced it had entered into global alliance with   \nSandoz, a division of Novartis to co-brand and distribute   \nnon-combustible medical cannabis products in global markets where it is   \nlegally authorized. The Globe and Mail dubbed this partnership as ‘big-pharma’s first foray into cannabis’.  \nAlso in 2018, Tilray announced a $100-million joint venture with the world's largest brewer, AbInBev to research non-alcohol tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)-infused beverages, through their respective subsidiaries, Labatt Breweries and High Park Company.  \nIn 2019, Tilray signed a $250 million revenue-sharing deal with U.S. based brand company, Authentic Brands Group, to leverage ABG brand names, such as Juicy Couture, Greg Norman, and Nine West to create cannabis products. ABG has a portfolio of over 50 brands.  \nIn February 2019, Tilray acquired Manitoba Harvest, a hemp foods   \nmanufacturer, for $317 million from Compass Diversified Holdings. The acquisition allowed Tilray to use Manitoba Harvest's retail distribution network to enter the U.S. CBD market.

When legalization happens, they can just flip a switch and those bonds would convert to ownership of Medmen making them a U.S. MSO operator. This is actually the smarter way since they don't have to burn cash trying to pioneer new markets with ununiformed excessive state fees and taxation on top of risking their hard assets in the States since marijuana is still illegal federally. They also already have US operations with their Sweetwater Bev and Manitoba Harvest products that are even sold at Costco.   \n\nAlso, are you aware how much money and compliance changes it takes to move from an OTC exchange to a real exchange like Nasdaq/NYSE? I can tell you that it's definitely not happening overnight when the US legalizes and none of the current top US MSOs that's traded on the OTCs right now are currently structured to be able to so its going to take time and $$$. \n\nAlso, you're forgetting that Tilray is already the largest Cannabis company in the WORLD by revenue.

Nasdaq only requires the company to be legal in the country it operates in.\n\nWhen MSO's are allowed to uplist, institutions will be allowed to invest as well, and the money will pour into the companies these institutions feel are the best.  Likely which will be curaleaf, trulieve, cresco, tilray and canopy growth.  There will be billions of dollars invested into this sector from institutions, and it will mostly be spread between these 5.
