So this is how it's supposed to work?  They did it right, then?  It was just unavoidable circumstances?  If someone told me that I'd fucking fire them on the spot.  They MUST have an understanding of what went wrong and how they could mitigate the risk of that happening again or they can't be in that job.  Something could ALWAYS have been done better.  ALWAYS.\n\nSometimes, the cure is too expensive for the disease... but at $210B loss in one year collectively...  no, they could have had suppliers BUILD dozens of chip fabs for that.  Basic risk management should have mitigated this whole thing at that level of loss.\n\nI know how chip allocations work, as I've had experience with that in my business.  It's widely reported the automakers cut their allocations when Covid hit, and now they can't get them back in any reasonable timeframe.  If it was as granular a decision as the articles imply, then that was monumentally stupid.  However, I'm open to it not being quite that simple.\n\nThere's no magic \"automotive supply chain\" crap to this.  I don't care if the actual allocation decision was 3 layers down the vendor food chain.  The automaker should have had visibility into every part that goes into every component in the car and full supply and lifecycle management overviews of everything.  If there's a risky but cheap part, they should have paid the vendor to stock and manage it.  It's been a year.  This is too early to have this sort of problem for shit as cheap as microcontrollers.\n\nThe electronics manufacturing industry is FULL of things that takes 6 months to 1 year lead time... that's got to be managed.  They can't trust the vendor to do that, there are too many vendors.  If they trust the vendor, then they'll be running into failures every week if not every day.\n\nI have products with hundreds of components, and I have had a difficult time making sure there's never a single part in any BOM that is going to screw me over.  A single part can completely shut me down, so I manage that problem.  In fact, if I failed to produce product for even a couple weeks, my customers would lose faith in our ability to deliver and as a critical path supplier they'd find another source... potentially destroying my entire business with a single mistake... so I sure as hell try to make sure that doesn't happen.\n\nCars have thousands of parts from probably thousands of vendors.  A part becoming unavailable (temporarily or otherwise) at some level in the chain probably happens all the time.  You're right that I have no idea how they manage that, but they must manage it.  The risk, with thousands of parts, would seemingly DEMAND that they have some kind of oversight and risk management into every last part everywhere.\n\nThis is basic risk management.  They HAVE to be (usually) pretty good at risk management.\n\nIf you're going to tell me something like \"they just order X number of ECU modules for delivery over Y months, they don't track what's in the ECUs the vendor does that\" then they're fucking idiots and that can't be how it works.  It'd fall apart in a month.  SOMEONE at the company looks into that stuff in more detail.  It's totally reasonable that some parts of the company only see the vendor modules as black boxes that they get on a schedule for assembly into other units or completed cars... maybe that's what you saw... but that can't be all there is.\n\nNo... what it sounds like is the process, whatever that was, was deeply flawed or someone ignored the process and royally screwed up. \n\nI won't even say I could have done better... because this chip shortage stuff is fucking hard.

They just look at the surface and think \"well other companies will do it too\". However, when you really dive into it, you'll see how far ahead Tesla really is.  \n\n\nThe engineering in their car is at least 5 years ahead of competition and the gap will keep on increasing because of the way the company is set up. Legacy automakers build a car by having different engineering teams build each of their component separately and benchmark performance to other cars. Tesla builds their cars by having all teams work together to build the best car possible. Not only that, their processes ensure that each improvement can be implemented as fast as possible.  \n\n\nJoe Justice did a video about this on youtube, Tesla implements about 27 production changes per week per model. Legacy automakers usually take months or years to approve a single change like this because they have to review each step of the production. An example of the impact of this is Tesla's recent delivery numbers that blew away estimates while every other automaker was cutting production by like 20-40% due to the chip shortage. The reason why Tesla wasn't affected as much is because they're able to use different chips and wrote their own software to ensure compatibility. People might say that eventually other automakers might be able to do this too, but by then Tesla is already going to be focusing on fixing another issue that legacy automakers didn't even think of yet.  \n\n\nAlso, current production of ICE cars is about 100M vehicles per year, 2B cars in the fleet in total. Tesla that is the leader right now produced 500k EVs last year and is about to reach 850k this year. Even if all other automakers were able to catch up to Tesla overnight, there is still an insanely untapped market out there. As costs keep going down, EVs will easily outclass ICE cars from all perspectives. And IMO, legacy automakers are not currently setup to properly profit (yet) from this market without cannibalizing into their own profits (selling less ICE, massive costs of revamping their factories).  \n\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that people give a lot of credit to Elon Musk and how he has a cult following, but engineers and other senior management at Tesla are just hella smart people.

Let's look at simple supply and demand. High supply means low prices especially made worse if low demand.\n\nSo look at housing costs which are 4-10 times any sane value when you look at their physical appearance.\n\nNow what does this mean? Well look at the income that one can get in California. That basically starts justifying the size of income. \n\nSo what does this mean? Well if people were living in great depression leveled of migration than no single story 2-3 bedroom homes wouldn't be worth 400k. They would be no more than 100k since there is no employment, there is no large income earners. There is no demand for homes. People are leaving to look for work and somewhere they won't starve. California has the opposite of this. It's generally the high living costs thanks to housing marketing existing for profit not having everyone have some kind of shelter like a Communist/socialist may promise (Reality is California is no where close communist, it's generally controlled by white high income earners that maybe get 100k year and have insane property wealth aka NIMBY).\n\nReality is that there are no cheap homes, people want to live in the state while having high income results with housing being adjusted or costs increasing to sell to high income earners. Poor people are fucked.\n\nWhat about taxes? Well the UC and California State University system exists. I can name Irvine, Berkeley, LA, etc. all paid generally by the state. Can you name any other state that rivals California in sheer wealth placed in top universities? \n\nFinally the homeowners tax ironically makes it so it's worth never selling. It's basically no change to the tax of the property until the next buyer. So if you want to sell then buy cheaper it's impossible now for someone who bought a house that was affordable on their income isn't possible due to having 4-10x increase in value.
