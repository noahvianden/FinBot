{"title": "ULTIMATE Guide to Selling Options Profitably PART 5 - Diving Deep into Volatility (Important)", "selftext": "# This post will dive into one of the most important concepts in options trading.\n\n# Understanding this concept will change the way you think about options trading (for the better). The concept is called volatility.\n\nAs an option trader, you are expressing a view on volatility... some know this and others don't :P\n\nBecause options expire, we now have be aware not just of what direction the stock will move, but *by how much* it will move in a given time period.\n\nNote: you can find the previous parts of this series on my profile.\n\nIf you have questions about this post, please leave a comment and I will get back to you.\n\nLet's get started!!\n\n# Example 1: Comparing 2 stocks.\n\nLets say we are looking at $AMC and $KO (Coca Cola), and we want to compare how each of these stocks moves over a 3 day period.\n\nIf we look at KO, this is a company that has been around for a long time. We understand how much money they make, how they make it, what their future revenue is likely to be, etc.. So on a day to day basis, we shouldn't expect massive swings in the stock price.\n\nPerhaps on day 1 we see the stock move +1%, then -1% on day 2, and then +2% on day 3.\n\nBut what if we looked at AMC?\n\nFrom what we know about AMC, it moves a lot. It could move up 10% 1 day, down 15% the next day and the back up 20% on the third day!\n\nThinking about these two stocks. It's should be clear that KO is much more stable than AMC. There is a lot less risk on KO than AMC.\n\n# So, which of these stocks do you think would have more costly options?\n\nThe reason AMC options would be more pricey relative to $KO is because there is more *risk* that AMC moves a lot. Remember, the options market tries to price what is going to happen in the future.. Since it is a lot more probable that AMC moves 10% tomorrow than Coca Cola, *the options of AMC imply more future big move risk than the options for KO.*\n\n**The simple way to put this would be:** ***AMC is more volatile than KO.***\n\nIf both stocks were trading at $100 per share, we would expected a $100 strike call option on AMC to be much more expensive, since there's a higher chance of it having a bigger move. Remember! In a trade, there is a buyer and a seller.\n\nSo if that option on AMC was only like $2, we would all want to buy them, and no one would want to sell them, so the price would go up (supply and demand).\n\n# So why do we care about volatility?\n\nIt's the factor that the market looks at to determine how much the options should be trading for.\n\nMost retail traders are *price insensitive* in the options space. They are more focused on the *exposure* the options give them, rather than the cost of the option. But as we move through this lesson.. really start to think about the value of options. If we can go out and find an option trading for $10 that is really worth $5, we've found a really good trade. So let's try to tie everything here back to *the value of options.*\n\n# Checkpoint summary 1:\n\n1. Volatility is simply the size of the move for a given stock.\n2. The a big factor in the price of options is how volatile the market thinks a stock will be in the future\n3. Since volatility is a big part of how the market prices options, we can say that the option prices *imply future volatility*.\n4. volatility is not direction. fundamentally it is the size of the moves, not the direction the stock goes.\n5. If you are trading options, you are trading volatility. Understanding volatility is an important part of understanding how to trade options.\n\n# The 3 Circles of Volatility\n\nNow that we understand (in general) what volatility is, we need to understand that there are *different forms of volatility* that impact every single stock. To explain this, theres a demonstration made by Predicting Alpha that explains it really well. It's called the **3 circles of volatility**.\n\n# There are 3 forms of volatility that impact any given stock.\n\n1. The first form of volatility is called **market volatility**.\n\nThe market has volatility. All of the stocks we can look at exist within the market. Let's say the market crashes. All of the stocks that we are looking at would also take a huge hit. The market overhands all of the stocks we look at, and what happens to the overall market impacts all of the stocks.\n\n[All stocks exist within the market, and are therefore subject to what happens to the market.](https://preview.redd.it/cbppljlin1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b0ded0cb0d5b558f3008f4a1efe67f9f7482d17)\n\n2) The second form of volatility is called **non-event volatility**\n\nLet's say we zoomed in and looked at one stock in particular. We would find another form of volatility called *non-event volatility.* Non event volatility is the movement of a stock on its regular day to day. How has the company been doing? Does it move on average 1% a day? or 10% a day? For example, $KO is going to have less non event volatility than $AMC. Different stocks move different amounts regularly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Each stock has its unique day to day movement, specific to the trading around that company.](https://preview.redd.it/4147qqrbm1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=84e86d5ee4777cb3f564d2578916a5afcfadfbcd)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) The third form of volatility is called **event volatility**\n\nIf we zoom in a bit further, we see that within each company there are key events that drive big movement in the share price. Earnings events, product releases, drug approvals, etc. Company events introduce new information into the market, leading to \"jumps\" in share price that we typically wouldn't see. Because of this, events can drive short bursts of high volatility for a stock.\n\n[Within the regular movement of a stock, there are big events that drive short bursts of rapid stock movement.](https://preview.redd.it/emm3b69am1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2291be9a53ffa643efa9a93703aa698600456551)\n\nBy taking these 3 forms of volatility into consideration, we are able to understand what's causing the stock to move, or impacting the price of the options.\n\nFor example, If the stock market crashes, it will overshadow the non-event volatility of a company. Even though the stock maybe moves only 1% a day on average, a market crash could cause it to move a lot more.\n\nFor another example, When GME was moving like crazy over the last few months, event volatility around their earnings releases was almost the same as non-event volatility, almost as if no \"event impact\" was being priced in.\n\n# Relating it back to options\n\nLet's say we are looking at an option expiring in 30 days. Taking into consideration the 3 forms of volatility, the market is going to try to determine how much the stock is likely to move over the next 30 days.\n\nIf the stocks trading at $100 and the at-money call and put are each going for $5 (5% of the share price), we can add them up and see that the \"range\" the market implies (the at-the-money straddle) is $10 in price, or 10% of the share price.\n\nThis tells us that the market thinks the stock will move up or down 10% in the next 30 days. The option prices are reflecting the *market implied volatility*.\n\nLet's say in the middle of those 30 days there is an earnings event. We can now says that the market volatility , non event volatility AND event volatility are all a part of the \"10% up or down\" that the market is baking into the price of the options.\n\n[All 3 forms of volatility are impacting this option. Can you think of how the event volatility can skew our view on the time period?](https://preview.redd.it/o1enqjj8m1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=55e6e9fc6f3a8526c23bbdcb7051cd6a18b89d76)\n\nWhy is this important? Well, if we know there is an earnings event in the middle of that time period, we can use the 3 circles to think that *a lot of the 10% move the market is implying might happen on that 1 day, and we will see very small moves on the other 29 days.* We can use some analytics tools to try to separate the event and non event volatility to understand if this is the case, which is really useful for selling options and knowing *exactly what you are selling.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[We can extract the event volatility from the non-event\\/market volatility. This helps us understand how much the market is implying for the event, and how the value of options will change after the event passes.](https://preview.redd.it/o8rck0o6m1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2e27dde1e3bb5669d9aec66f27bf95ddab48f0c)\n\nThe picture above shows the term structure for DAL and how much earnings event volatility is priced into the different DTEs (earnings is this week).\n\n# A cool thing about the 3 circles of volatility is that we can isolate which one we want to trade\n\nDepending on what you think is mispriced, you can isolate one of the forms of volatility. For example, If you just want to trade an earnings event, you can structure your trade to remove a lot of market and non-event volatility!\n\nMore on this in a future post where we talk about earnings trading.\n\n# Checkpoint summary 2:\n\n1. There are 3 forms of volatility that impact a stock. Market volatility, non-event volatility, and event volatility.\n2. Market volatility is like the \"tide that rises and lows all ships\", non-event volatility is the day to day movement of a stock, and event volatility is a short burst of big movements caused by new information coming into the market (earnings, product releases, etc).\n3. The option price reflects the impact of each of these 3 forms of volatility within the days to expiration of the option.\n4. We can isolate different forms of volatility depending on what we want to trade.\n\n# Implied VS Realized Volatility.\n\nImagine you are at a horse-racing track, and you want to place a bet on the next race.\n\nYou take a look at the odds, and see that the horse named Seabiscuit has 4:1 odds on it coming first place. Nice! The market is saying that you only need to risk 1 to make 4 if Seabiscuit comes in first. You do some math, and you think that theres a 50% chance he will come in first (market is implying about a 25% chance) and decide it's a good bet. So you place your bet.\n\nThen the race starts, and even though he was off to a good start, Seabiscuit ends up coming in 4th place. Damn.\n\nWhen you went to place the bet, the market gave you a bet you could choose to take. The market was *implying a certain likelihood of that horse winning*.\n\nThen the race started , and the *realized outcome,* or what actually ended up happening was that Seabiscuit lost the race.\n\nThis is like what happens in the options space..\n\n**Implied volatility** is how much the market *thinks* the stock will move in the future.\n\n**Realized volatility** is *how much the stock actually ends up moving.*\n\n# How does the market determine implied volatility?\n\nThe basic way to think about this, is that the market participants look at the 3 circles of volatility and make an opinion about how much each of them will impact the stock between now and the option's expiration. The market consensus on each form of volatilities impact will then become the *market implied volatility*.\n\nIf the stock moves more than what was implied, the buyer makes money.. If the stock moves less than what is implied, the seller makes money (there is nuance to this, but for this lesson we are keeping it simple).\n\n**note**: There are tools out there that help you graph and analyze the difference between implied and realized volatility. You can get some basic charts in most brokerages. My preferred tool is Predicting Alpha Terminal which allows me to do some unreal analysis.\n\nFor example, here's the IV/RV ratios for $KO and $AMC.\n\n[There are tons of analytics specific to volatility. The insights help us understand the value of options better, and therefore make more money trading.](https://preview.redd.it/kovfuu04m1t71.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b3afacbcd6bdb598d3c39ed1e6061096986e011)\n\nIt's pretty cool. This shows us the gap between the implied and realized volatility for each of those companies on the same graph. Looks like they have both steadied out to a similar spread.\n\n# Checkpoint summary 3:\n\n1. Implied volatility is how much the market thinks the stock will move in the future\n2. realized volatility is how much the stock actually ends up moving\n3. If we have a different opinion from the market, and we end up being closed to what the stock \"realizes\" , we should make money.\n\n# OK so we understand the \"bet the market presents us with\" (implied volatility), and \"what actually ends up happening\" (realized volatility), but how do we know what side of the trade to be on?\n\nYou remember in the horse racing example how we said that you think the odds of Seabiscuit winning are 50%, but the market is implying a 25% chance? This is an extremely important part of the example.\n\nThe reason it is so important, is because *that is why you took the bet!*\n\nThink about it. If you agree with the bookie on his odds and likelihood of winning, why would you take the bet? You know that he skews the odds a bit in his favor (revisit my post on expected value if you need to), so taking that bet would have negative expectancy.\n\n# The reason we took the trade is because our forecast for the race was different from the market.\n\n# We do the same thing in the option market.\n\nThe market presents us with options priced at a particular implied volatility level. *Our job is to come up with our own forecast of future volatility.*\n\nYou can think of your \"forecast\" as your opinion on things. If the market thinks a stock isn't going to move a lot, but you think it will, options are cheap. If the market is implying that the stock will move more than you think it actually will, options are expensive.\n\nIf we can develop a really solid forecast of future volatility, options trading becomes pretty straight forward. Now of course, if it were easy to do we would all have matching lambos already. But this is the fun of trading, the better opinions you can develop, and the better you can express those opinions, the more money you should make.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n*\"Gold slips away from the person who invests gold into purposes through which they are not familiar\"*\n\nThat is a quote from a book called The Richest Man in Babylon that often comes to mind when I see traders getting into trades without understanding the product and space they are participating in.\n\nTo be honest, a lot of times it's this lack of familiarity that can drive inefficiencies that more sophisticated traders profit from.\n\nLet's keep in mind that options are volatility products. Let's strive to learn more about how these products are priced and how to create good views of the future. There is plenty of opportunity for retail traders to make money, but it all starts by understanding the product we trade, and how to trade it.\n\nIf you have questions, please leave them in the comments below and I will do my best to get back to everyone.\n\n# In my next post, I will dive into how to isolate event volatility for earnings trades, and how I have been able to make a living trading earnings events as a primary strategy.\n\nHappy trading everyone.\n\n\\~AG", "id": "q6pq5c", "created_utc": 1634055331.0, "score": 631, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for the info...trying to learn as much as I can to become a better options trader, I've only been trading for about 8 months and have done alright, this helps me understand why some of my trades have done better than others...", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "hell yea.

{"title": "I Interviewed 20 Leading Wealth Management Firms: Here Are All Their Strategies", "selftext": "I sold a company I created, and after the press release went out, I was inundated with very gracious offers to take and manage my new found money for fees. At the time, I presumed these wealth managers, after managing hundreds of millions - if not billions - of other people’s money for decades, would have developed advanced strategies and tactics for ensuring success. Surely, they would have teams of analysts scouring the markets for opportunities, technical indicators, news events, macroeconomic data and breakthrough innovations at all times to stay a step ahead of the pack. I was dead wrong.\n\nWhat I discovered was an antiquated industry that relied heavily on the belief that they knew better and were on top of things. In fact, there was very little effort that went into managing OPM (other people’s money), and that most of the energy went to finding and onboarding new clients.\n\nI’m not saying that their strategies were bad or didn’t work. I am only stating that they were neither complicated nor impressive. In short, anyone here could repeat the same strategies and save 1% of their money a year in perpetuity. Without further ado, here’s what I learned:\n\n**Goldman Sachs**\n\nIt’s important to note that there are various divisions within GS wealth management that handle money differently. I break it down into low net worth, mid-net worth, and high net worth offerings. The low net worth folks are given Marcus, an automated investment system that simply relies on ETFs paired with some basic bond funds. It’s the same as buying Vanguard Target Retirement funds.\n\nThe mid-net worth offering is where I spent the bulk of time understanding. They find 30 stocks to invest in from different sectors with an attempt to represent the sector weighting of the S&P 500. As the SPX is largely tech, they are overweight technology. Basically, they take the SPY and cut it down from 500 companies to 30 companies.\n\nWhy would they offer a less diverse array of stocks?\n\nThey state as the reason that they are better able to manage 30 investments than 500, and since they are not trying to beat the returns of the index - their words - they’d rather find stocks with lower beta (volatility) and thus likely lower returns.\n\nThey locate these stocks by running basic stock screens within the S&P 500 once per quarter to ensure solid performance and find better investments. They target a 6% annual return after accounting for their 1% fee on your money and they offer some financial planning services if you have over a certain amount of money invested with them.  This amounts to $10,000 per year for a $1M portfolio for many years - a lot of money to part with.\n\nDid I mention, you have to liquidate your entire portfolio prior to working with them, unless you happen to already own one of the 30 stocks they pick? So there are tax consequences of getting involved.\n\nFor the HNW folks, the above offering is available and they offer additional products, such as the ability to invest in private equity, REITs and hedge funds. As you might imagine, the more money they manage, the more “free” accounting services they include.\n\n**Personal Capital**\n\nThis may actually be my favorite, given the simplicity of it. They take the main sector ETFs and eliminate any stocks that are losing money, to recreate their own ETFs by sector. They charge you a fee to use their ETFs.\n\nThey start with an equal amount of capital going to each sector ETF, but allocate more money to the sectors with the worst performance record from the year before. They do this annually. They do nothing all year.\n\nThey charge a fee for managing your money. I recall it being 25 or 35 basis points, but you have to also pay to use their ETFs so it creeps towards the better part of a percentage point very quickly and is much more expensive than simply buying a Vanguard S&P 500  fund or a group of the sector ETFs calling it quits.\n\n**Ritholtz Wealth Management**\n\nIf you’ve watched CNBC regularly, you’d recognize the commentator Josh Brown - a partner of Ritholtz Wealth Management. He’s the one with the thick New York City accent. When I found out I may have the chance to have his insights managing my money, I was excited as he always seemed so knowledgeable. But the wealth management shop was not impressive.\n\nIn fact, their model was exactly the same as that of Goldman Sachs: they pick about 30 stocks, stick your money in them, rotate them every quarter, and keep volatility low on the stocks they pick. They target 5-6% annually, net of fees. Yes, you heard that correctly, 5-6%.\n\nThe next group of wealth management shops all fell into one of three other categories: SPY collars, ETF aggregators, or tactical investors\n\n**SPY Collars**\n\nThis strategy involved putting all of your money into the SPY ETF then selling call options on that investment out of the money a few months out at a time. They take the income from the sale of these options and purchase out of the money puts on the SPY for similar expiration dates. This strategy enables them to control your target return while limiting downside. For those who are not used to options, here’s how it works.\n\nLet’s say the SPY is trading at $400. You own it. You sell someone else the right to buy it from you for $440 for $40 per call. So long as the SPY stays under 440, the other person will not execute the call and you get to keep the money for the call premium. If the SPY goes above 440, you have to either sell your shares at $440 (plus pocket the $40 per call option premium, making this a sale at 480) or buy the call back at a higher price than what you sold it for. You’d lose money on the call, but the SPY shares have gained in value, so you still come out ahead. You are just not as ahead as you would be had you simply bought and held the SPY all the way to $490. This creates a ceiling in terms of the max amount you can obtain on the upside of your investment.\n\nThe option puts work the other way, protecting your investment on the way down. Since you used the premium collected on the sale of the call to buy the puts, you haven’t spent any new money but have bought yourself insurance. If the SPY drops, the value of your put option (a short on your own investment) increases. This increase offsets your losses, protecting you, especially in the case of extreme correction.\n\nIf the SPY rises, you lose the value of your put, so you have to account for that in your net income for the investment.\n\nIf you don’t follow this, don’t worry, the net effect is they use options to prevent a major loss but in doing so, they also prevent you from having any major gains. You are trapped or collared within an acceptable range of returns. Over time, you will not beat the S&P 500 index with this strategy and they say this.\n\nSo there is only value to this strategy if you simply are unwilling to trade a really bad year once in a while for a great year once in a while. It’s mostly about your investment time horizon and whether you need regular access to the money.\n\n**ETF and Mutual Fund Aggregators**\n\nAbout 7 firms I interviewed used this strategy. I heard the same thing so often, I thought maybe they were dumbing it down for me. Essentially, they just bought all sector ETFs or a basket of mutual funds for you. A few of the firms would use the collars I spoke of above if the market got a little choppy, but most did not.\n\nThis strategy was most common with smaller wealth management shops - under $250M AUM - which tried to differentiate themselves as financial planners that happen to look after your money. The bulk of them did very very little to watch the market and most flat out stated they only looked at these quarterly.\n\nI could not understand what they did all day until one referred to himself as a market psychologist because his job was to calm clients down when the market shits itself. I have vodka for that, so this strategy was not for me.\n\n**Tactical Firms**\n\nThese firms were harder to find and their DNA was more similar to day traders in terms of their mentality. They invested in a basket of stocks they thought represented a blend of value, growth, and good dividends. They chose them annually but were much more likely to liquidate and go to cash if they thought a correction was coming so they had cash to buy the dip.\n\nOne thing I did learn from them though was tax loss harvesting - a term for specifically taking losses on investments to offset gains on others.\n\nThe best way they did this was by rolling calls on equities that had risen in value. Imagine holding Apple stock and selling a call on it. If Apple goes up, you must then choose to sell the stock or buy the call back at a higher price for a loss. If you do the latter, in year 1 and sell a second option in year 2 at the same price or more than the call you bought back, you can write off the loss in year 1 while avoiding actual losses.\n\nYou can roll calls like this forever, amassing paper losses while you actually gain in the value of the underlying equity. It was a nice trick I’ve used many times now, especially when I want to sell something I’ve held for years with significant gains.\n\nTheir desire to protect the portfolio, I felt, prevented them from participating in the quick rebounds in the market. In 2019, when I spoke to them, they felt a crash was imminent and had gone to 60% cash in their portfolio. I never reached back out to see how they did, but I suspect they were buying the dips in March 2020.\n\nTheir overall returns were around 10% but not as good as simply buying the SPY and holding. But they did seem to be able to minimize the downside of some on major events.\n\n**In the end, I never hired any of them.** I decided instead to use what I learned and what I knew and manage my own money. In case you read this far and are curious, yes, my returns have beaten all these firms’ average returns and I’ve actually learned a lot in the process.

If you want investments managed then a percentage of assets makes more sense)\n3. Investment strategy should add value above what you can do on your own. If you don't know the difference between a stock and a bond, then many money managers can probably help you as they have simple investment strategies that intermediate investors could replicate with some effort.\n4. Make sure the advisor specializes in people like you.  Most of their clients should fit your profile.

You should be focusing on growth oriented and value oriented strategies. Typically, investment shops will specialize in just one of these. These shops will employ in house research staff that follow companies, read 3rd party research reports, speak directly to management, personally do “channel checks” all in a passionate entrepreneurial effort to make sure they know more about these companies than anyone else. The market value based management fee that you are looking at saving buys you more than you initially realize. The value of these services also cannot be realized unless you’ve got some real personal experience with them. For less than 1% you should not only get managed portfolios of handpicked stocks by a group of people who often spend their entire waking day thinking about businesses (not just stocks), but you also get access to estate planning/tax planning individuals who have the bandwidth to add a layer of management to separate your portfolios from the “model” as your needs require. For example, keeping capital gains to a minimum if you have positions with relatively large capital gains. They are also equipped to harvest losses at yearend to offset taxable gains very efficiently. Just examples among a laundry list of services.\n\nif you are interested in learning about your investments, they will coach you on the firm’s investment philosophy and guide you through market fluctuations & life goals, always tying the minor details back to the big picture with the firm’s investment philosophy as the guiding force.\n\nTypically you get this kind of service from a boutique but any shop can technically do this for you. Also regarding the annualized targets you alluded to as being crazy low. This number is annualized. The actual expectation is to have a mix of years that are much higher and much lower than the expected annualized return. I would assume that this is an after tax/after management fee return too. The return assumption is typically an industry wide assumption.\n\nThere is actually very little that you can learn from conducting interviews. Most wealthy individuals will park their cash at multiple managers and get to know them over time.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nEdit: Why would you even attempt to do all this on your own when you have multiple millions in liquid financial assets and tomorrow could be your last day on earth.

The fed has the power to increase or decrease the reserve requirement to get banks to lend less or more. The problem is since 2008, the banks have been holding so many excess reserves the FED doesn't even need a reserve requirement anymore, there are many theories for this however I belive that because the fed started paying intrest on excess reserves the banks are less willing to lend.

The banks aren't extending credit during this crisis even with the dramatic increase in reserves and we can see even with inflation bank reserves reached a new high in Aug 2021, I am totally prepared to be wrong but until rates rise and especially as they are getting paid intrest on excess reserves I don't see the banks starting to lend again.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "To answer your question on why banks are holding more money, I was a bank risk regulatory agent (on the bank side) from 2008 post-crash to 2011. \n\nThe simple answer is that the FDIC increased capitalization requirements after the the 2008 crash and does so when there's a potential toxic asset problem, as there was during the pandemic. You're correct that this is for anchoring against the risk of holding potentially problematic loans... basically the reserve banking equivalent of a margin call.\n\nThe effect of 2008 decreased the appetite for unanchored leveraged risk in banks, and the end result is that even when the FDIC doesn't require expanded capital, banks have become a bit conservative and view stability to be a bit higher of a value than they did before 2008. \n\nYou're also correct that there's a relative monetary incentive with low rates to hold back on lending, but in my experience there's a real effect from the increase in the power of risk and compliance departments and post-2008 a risk-off appetite for high risk lending relative to what was there before. I also think that banks have been expecting easing to reverse and don't want to get caught without a capital buffer if they're required to reduce their capital reserves through a rate increase.\n\nBasically, no... the banks don't expect inflation or QE to be permanent, but they're banking (no pun intended) on the need for a capital hedge.\n\nThe OP's position basically has two massive holes that you can drive a truck through in the core of their argument:\n\nTheir presumption is that M2 expansion has created capital competition for goods through increased demand that is far and away beyond the norm, when the actual consumer spending figures demonstrate we're still below the consumer spending expansion trendline and we're just filling a gap:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/fDtjPfH](https://imgur.com/a/fDtjPfH)\n\nThis is also not reflected in the capital velocity graph they provided, though to be fair I think QE does distort that graph to some extent.. but it still demonstrates that money isn't pressuring the economy the way monetary policy hawks suggest. OP suggests in another post on another subreddit that they think that capital velocity comes \\*after\\* inflation, which is just not how price discovery works.\n\nThe other gaping hole is that the whole argument basically hinges on the idea that QE is inherently inflationary...\n\n...in which case we have to ask why the 2010s weren't an inflationary hellscape given the massive expansion of M2 after the 2008 crash.\n\nClearly, it's more complex than that and monetary policy is not the only factor in generating demand and inflation.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "There are core component factories in the semiconductor supply chain that literally burned up during initial Covid days.

I believe they’ll use that assumption to keep interest rates as low as they can. As long as quantitive easing is happening, the fed will be under immense pressure to keep rates low, as the US simply cannot afford debt at higher rates. Current administration (and really U.S. politics as a whole) has a fixation with spending money. That tide is difficult to turn. As a result, I believe the fed could ultimately plunge rates even lower (or negative) to keep the boat afloat for as long as possible. The unfortunate reality is that at some point somebody has to pay the piper.\n\nI suppose at the end of the day, when the other pent up inflationary forces we see begin to mount, the fed still has to raise rates. I’m most cautious about how long that will take. Six months? Six years? It’s impossible to know.\n\nI’m excited to read which asset classes you think can weather this type of storm. It’s a question I haven’t quite answered myself as I weigh the potential of a certain digital advance we’re making that has become it’s own asset class (I can’t just say it because auto mod will delete my comment).

If a person is a driving enthusiast, and they compare the Mach E to the Model Y, it is impossible to prefer the Ford. It’s not even close.

{"title": "Guys, we seriously need to get something clear: selling options is NOT alpha, profit or premiums. The only alpha is the expression of the trade", "selftext": "There's a lot of new thetagang sellers here, which is great. But many of you have the wrong impression that just because you're writing the option puts you on the right side of the trade.\n\nIn an efficient market, options are priced to break even over time. That means if your odds of winning are 5:1 then your payout is 1:5 or a net neutral. Now in reality, markets aren't efficient but the concept stands that just because you \"collect theta\" doesn't suddenly give you big ape brain. \n\nSo why are so many people making money on CSPs?  Because it is a directional bull trade... in a bull market. Your alpha is in predicting the direction, time and distance. That means the underlying thesis (stock goes up) is what makes you money, the put option you wrote is an expression of your bull belief.\n\nNow the important part. We are arguably on the cusp of veering out of a bull market into a sideways or bear market. At the very least there will be chop. So a true theta strategy does NOT mean ALWAYS SELL CSPS. If that is all you do, then that means you are mega bull. And that's fine if that's your prediction, but if you are 100% that the market will rip, then call options are also a valid expression of your trade thesis.\n\nAgain, butterflies, iron condors, calendars, spreads.. these are all expressions of a trade, nothing more. Selling options are not inherently profitable.\n\nI know the standard belief here is \"But I collect theta over time so I do get profit\", the right way to think of writing the option is that you exchange risk (time) for cash (\"premium\"). It's like getting paid to play stand in a cave with a sleeping bear. Just because you haven't been mauled doesn't mean it's risk free. Every second you are in the cave is risk and you charge a premium for the time that has passed. \n\nFinally, for the wheel folks that say \"I don't lose, because I just take assignment\"... That's like saying you took a 20% loss on FB common stock, but you didn't really lose because FB stock will gain it all back in a year. Cool story and all bro, except your broker still took a 20% haircut on your capital for that trade you didn't lose on. So pro tip, take the skirt off, put on the big boy pants, eat your wheaties and take your fucking losses like an adult.\n\nGood luck out there.

We don't have natural rates in the US anymore, they are centrally controlled.\n\nTo keep our economy stable and our debts serviced we need mild inflation and near zero interest rates.

Debt deflation will reduce available money to service debt while at the same time putting upward pressure on rates which only adds to the difficulty of debt service.

The interest rates should follow, not lead. And exactly WHY would the public generate a perception that the future value of money sucks? Because they believe the value of money will be sabotaged by the central bankers. In the 70s we closed the gold window, and had the oil crisis. These things spooked investors, shook their faith in the USD, and kicked off some whacky moves.\n\nWhat happens when most people feel that money 10 years from now will be worth half what it is today? Naturally a lender would want to make at least 100% in interest, plus more for the risk. But what if the central banks require interest rates of zero? There is a conflict. This is where we are now.

Monetary expansion spurs demand in the short term, especially so when peoples’ expectations of inflation rise, as they then rationally decide to buy things now that they know they’ll need in the future that will in all likelihood be more expensive (when they otherwise wouldn’t have done so). Effectually it pulls demand from the future forward, and higher demand causes prices to rise, and it takes businesses time to find their new market clearing price (i.e. a new equilibrium between supply and demand), so along the way shortages occur as everything is bought up until prices rise enough to prevent that from happening.\n\nTo explain more simply with an example:\n\nLet’s imagine a company has the capacity to produce 100 widgets a week and sells 99 of them a week for $1/each (i.e. anyone who is willing to pay $1 for said widget is able to purchase one). The next day the Fed turns on the printer (brrrr), and everyone gets $1k deposited into their checking account. All of a sudden, there are now 200 people willing to buy that widget for $1 because people now immediately have more disposable income. Boom, there’s a shortage of widgets. All 100 get sold, and the company isn’t able to supply 200/week. Thus, they will raise their prices as high as they can until the demand for their widgets returns to at most 100/week. They of course don’t know what that number is so they just have to raise prices incrementally until they find it. So they raise the widget price to $1.10, and they sell all 100. Okay, now let’s raise it to $1.20, well shit we still sold them all. Let’s keep going. And go they do until they reach their new equilibrium.\n\nThat’s just the demand side of it too. They will of course try and expand production, but expanding operations takes time, and for many businesses the marginal cost of producing each additional widget rises after a certain point (due to limitations with labor and technology, among other things), and then of course if they try and produce more than 100/week they then are spurring more demand from their vendors with the inputs they need, so then you get producer price inflation. At the end of the day a significant amount of monetary expansion introduces volatility to businesses and it can be difficult to manage.\n\nAnd while things will eventually settle down and return to “normal” with regards to the supply/demand dynamic, it’ll just all be at higher prices (since monetary expansion devalues the currency in real terms). When you have more currency chasing the same amount of goods and services, that’s what happens. It gets even worse when you have more currency chasing less goods and services (from something like a pandemic which shuts down parts of the economy).\n\nSource: I work in corporate finance and it’s a shit show right now.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> Why do you feel like monetary expansion is fueling demand here?\n\nBecause it always does. That additional money doesn’t just sit around doing nothing indefinitely. People do stuff with it. What really matters is where that additional money goes - that will determine where you see the bulk of the price inflation. For instance (and I’m generalizing here, i know there are other factors involved), the easy money policies preceding the GFC were aimed towards real estate, hence the real estate bubble. After that popped, most of the stimulus was aimed at the financial markets (given the crisis that followed was financial in nature). What did we get? The longest bull market in financial markets in US history. Now with COVID, much of the stimulus is more broadly aimed at the general economy by going directly to people and businesses via huge amounts of fiscal stimulus (think stimmy checks, child tax credits, enhanced unemployment benefits, loan forbearance, PPP loans, and soon infrastructure, etc). So what we get is more general price inflation. Of course, interest rates are also at zero too, so loan induced monetary expansion (by the nature of how fractional reserve banking works) will also cause loan dependent industries like real estate to experience price inflation too. In the absence of lower rates and QE (i.e. monetary expansion) a lot of the spending we’re seeing wouldn’t be possible, as the deficits we’re running and the debt we’re accumulating to fund this spending wouldn’t be affordable at naturally occurring interest rates. If the government tried to borrow trillions from the market without the assistance of the printing press rates would skyrocket and the debt would be unserviceable, and thus wouldn’t be taken on to begin with.\n\n> From what I’ve seen this looks a lot more like supply-side problems related to the pandemic, which suggests the inflation rate is indeed transitory.\n\nWell, define “transitory”. How long is it? Technically everything is transitory if you expand your time horizon enough. Demand side inflation from additional monetary expansion included. If you stop expanding the money supply at an increased rate than normal, the inflation rate will eventually revert back to it’s normal rate. So yes, once the genuine supply side issues resolve themselves whatever impact they are having on higher prices should go away, but we have still significantly increased the money supply, so the inflation rate is still going to be more than it otherwise would have been from that alone until prices reach a new equilibrium. And since it takes time for that to happen, and we are still actively expanding the money supply at an increased rate, seeing 2% inflation again sometime soon doesn’t seem plausible.

It's a beautiful way to measure inflation because it naturally accounts for virtually all confounders like currencies and prices and technological progress, and can be compared going way back into history without making a bunch of adjustments or substitutions.\n\nIn general, comparing a quantity of anything (like, say, gas) to the number of hours of labor it takes to afford that thing is a better way to track inflation/deflation than paying attention to the price of that thing. The nice thing about light is that it's necessity is almost universal. And while \"light quality\" is a thing, that's only important to people working in a studio and a few weirdos like me. Easily lost in the noise. At least for now.\n\nI just wish it had a ticker.

We can see this throughout history.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yep, exactly.\n\nBut I think you have it backwards. Energy is less useful than light when it comes to measuring & understanding inflation, because the way it benefits from technological advancements and people's relationship is much more complicated, making it a lot less fungible. An example, a huge number of people are currently willing to \"overpay\" significantly for certain types of energy in certain cases, even when there is substantial opportunity cost and even financial stress to doing so.\n\nAs an example, you drive a gas car and I drive an electric. Let's assume our vehicles have equal efficiency and we're neighbors. You're spending a little more than 2x per kWH than I am because you prefer your transportation-creating kWHs in liquid form rather than chemical battery storage.\n\nWorse, actually, because the idea that your car is as efficient is just mythical. If you add up all the conversion and transmission losses, my electric is much more efficient at converting kWH from the wall outlet into miles than yours is at kWH from the pump into miles. My electric stores less than half a gallon worth of kWH but still makes the 30-mile round trip to the office, which takes you around a gallon at 30mpg (more, because your cold car is not getting 30MPG and it takes several miles to warm up), because your engine is so fucking lossy and (probably) always will be. Not to mention that you have to take time and effort out of your week to go specifically to a pump to purchase those transportation kWH, where as mine are piped directly into my home for less money than you pay to have them pumped out at a location not of your choosing.\n\nBut we both turn on the lights when we get home and pay the same thing for the same useful thing. And one of us might be overpaying, but only because even overpaying is still so cheap that it's not worth the time and effort to buy and swap out a cheaper light bulb. Even overpaying 100% is probably less than a second of labor difference every year.\n\nAnd while there are some people willing to pay more for higher quality light, it's not really enough to make a dent in the large scale. Even overpaying a few labor hours in a year for higher quality light, those higher quality light devices will last 5, 10, 15 years, maybe more, so it still mostly ends up being noise, especially since very few people do it. Unlike with, say, gas. Plus light is now cheap enough that it's hard to get \"stuck\" with a bad light source. Unlike, say, a car.\n\nThen think about heating. Why electric in some places and gas in others?\n\netc. etc.\n\nEnergy in itself isn't useful; it's what gets done or happens with it. Light in itself is useful. So using light instead of energy factors out (or, rather, factors in) a lot of opportunity cost tradeoffs and transmission costs and all sorts of other things that would otherwise have to be manually accounted and adjusted for.\n\nWhich, again, is why it's so neat as a measure. It's useful and valuable to nearly everyone in nearly the same way.\n\nBut even comparing labor-hour to kilowatt-hour is more useful than the CPI for understanding inflation, methinks. Not more useful for predicting what the fed will do of what government policy will be, though, of course.

That’s inflation.\n\nSo, when you raise wages, owners will often eat the cost for some time, until they decide that they can’t or don’t want to, and raise prices.\n\nNow, the real issue is that profit margins are controlled by 1 thing only. Competition. As we have bowed down to our mega corporate overlords to become effective monopolies, when they decide to raise prices to increase their margins, they get to decide their margins are whatever the fuck they want.\n\nThe best example is the glasses industry. Luxotica has a monopoly in practice and their margins are insane. Wages could triple and they’d still have high profit margins. When they raise prices, that’s contributing to inflation, sure, but does not reflect a competitive market. You really think your sunglasses cost anywhere close to an iPhone X to make and sell? Pfft.\n\nAnother great example is healthcare in America. Healthcare is a myriad of regional monopolies. In most places in America you have 0-1 options within an hour of your home. That’s why hospitals will charge $100 for a piece of gauze you can buy for $0.50 off a pharmacy. Because you have no choice. A captive audience.\n\nSo, each time we collectively decide to buy from a large corporation and drive a mom and pop shops out of business, we are laying the groundwork for future out of control inflation.\n\nControversial opinion here. Where no competition is available, profit margins on each type of good sold should be capped to protect the consumer (perhaps some sort of National benchmark on profits margins by category). So, if only 1 hospital is available, they should not be able to make 1000% on gauze, and instead should be able to charge up to X% more than what a hospital in a competitive market charges (say a city with 20 hospitals).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "In some markets, like pharma, sometimes inflation happens because “fuck you.” Their production costs go down, their supply chain becomes more efficient, and they decide to 5x the price of insulin just because they can.\n\nIt’s absolutely ridiculous.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Keep buying those puts eventually it'll work", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I can’t believe people are this stupid.
