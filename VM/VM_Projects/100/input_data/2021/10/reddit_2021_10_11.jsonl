What you are describing is one of the ways a Wheel can fail.\n\nI had 4 different Wheel trades that were in that state. For example, I wrote puts at some level like $80 and the stock fell to $60 and never recovered after months. It just kept trundling along between $60-$65. The $81 calls paid $.01 and I wrote those for a while.\n\nIn that case, I eventually cut my losses and wrote a call at $65 and just took the loss and moved on to new trades, never to touch that underlying again. **But it's still a loss**. No amount of collecting credit on the put or call side could make up for that $15/share loss.\n\nThis is why stock selection is critically important for Wheel success. Sometimes you'll get it wrong, but as long as most of the time you pick a stock that will go up on average, you'll never need to write a call below the cost basis of your shares.\n\n> If I'm truly doing a wheel strategy I'd like to open up a new CSP as soon as possible, so I thought a closer ATM/ITM call would call away my shares quicker so I could open up a new CS\n\nThat's an incorrect mindset for Wheeling. **Wheeling requires patience**. You should not rush the CSP phase. You have to play the game by the rules. And one of those rules is to not write calls below the cost basis of your shares, even if that means you only make pennies per call, *because you have faith your underlying will recover and grow on average*. You patiently wait for that growth to return to normal. Your CC phase may take months, but if your forecast for the stock is correct, it will eventually pay off without having to take a loss.\n\nIt's worth noting that everyone running Wheels since the pandemic started has had a rough time.

I know it is generally thought to be a big no.  However, I am trying to look at using options to reduce capital requirements and get a bit of extra leverage on the returns with the combination of delta and vega increase, obviously at the risk of delta really hurting me. \n\nFor instance, if I have a $250 risk I am willing to take on my account, but want to trade a deep ITM call with a delta of 0.99 on NCLH for example, how would I go about risking only $250?  I figure if I buy the January 2023, $2.50 call and pay $2380 in premium, I am at an advantage to the market because I am getting about a $0.25/share discount vs. the real shares (let's assume I get filled right at the mid price for simplicity).\n\nSo how would I place a stop loss on this?  I know it sounds dumb but I can just place a stop order at $21.30, however, the bid/ask spread is ~$1.00, meaning I could incur upwards of a $350 loss if I get a bad fill due to slippage based on the present spread. Is there no adequate way to place stop losses on options or is the best way to do this to just buy as many contracts as your risk allows?\n\nIn this scenario I am then looking at $37.50 calls for the same expiration but I am getting eaten alive by theta because they are so OTM, the % probability is very low.   There has to be a method someone has devised that is better than either of these to not get theta-killed so willingly on OTM or to not get killed by the spread by trying to swing a deep ITM.\n\nWould a hybrid approach work better perhaps?  Where you get something more near term (say 6-8 month expiration) and go ATM or only slightly OTM where you can just buy your risk (say March, 2022 $30 call), but expose yourself to delta and theta moves but you have a bit more help with gamma and vega?\n\nAny ideas?

How are you getting a $0.25/share discount? Are you saying the call at that time was priced *below* parity (call price < stock price - strike price)? That shouldn't be possible. Everyone in the market would be all over that call arbing the hell out of it.\n\nI'm looking at the quote right now and it is $.10/share **over** parity.\n\nA few other editorial comments until I get to your question:\n\n* If you are buying 99 delta calls, you might as well just buy shares. There is nothing but disadvantages vs. shares going that deep, like expiration.\n\n* Stops can be profit preventers as well as loss preventers. If your position goes down 2% one day and you stop out at 1%, but it goes up 3% the next day (vs. your opening price), you just missed out on a 3% gain.\n\n---------------\n\nOkay, now to your question. You've already identified slippage as the main obstacle. If the bid/ask spread is larger than your risk tolerance, it's going to be extremely difficult to stop out at your preferred limit. \n\nOne alternative is to use a **trailing stop $ (rather than %)**, if your broker supports triggering on the bid.

That's an essential piece of information for any discussion about a trade.\n\n> Let's imagine there is a large upward swing and the short call gets ITM before expiration and the holder decides to exercise it.\n\nHow long before? If we are talking more than a day, it's extremely unlikely, unless the holder of the call hates money. Early exercise, even for deep ITM calls, usually loses money for the exerciser. The only time this happens is if the holder will be compensated for the loss of time value, like they get stock in time to receive a huge dividend.\n\nSo let's say it is the day before expiration on the short call.\n\n> If I understand correctly, the short call would \"disappear\" and I would get shorted with 100 shares instead.\n\nNot \"instead\", but yes. A short call delivers shares and receives cash. So you will be short 100 shares AND you will receive 100 x strike price in cash.\n\nSettlement on assignment is T+2 for shares, T+1 for cash (like if the call was on SPX). So if expiration is Friday and we are imagining this early exercise happened on Thursday, you would be notified of the assignment sometime in the early hours of Friday morning, like at 3am. The call would disappear from your portfolio at open of Friday morning and the cash and/or short shares may also appear on Friday morning, but the shares wouldn't be settled until Monday morning. I believe, but am not 100% sure, that the cash will also not be settled until Monday morning. Unsettled shares and cash can \"appear\" in your positions view, but you can't trade on them until they are settled, unless you have a margin account and your broker will float you the settlement value.\n\nPut another way, you *might* be able to trade with the shares or cash on Friday, but it's more likely you'll have to wait until Monday morning.\n\n> So it would be better to sell it if I cannot cover without otherwise, isn't it?\n\nYes.

First, as a beginner you should avoid holding anything through expiration. Expiration has maximum risk. Second, CSPs are **sold** to open, not bought. \n\nYou didn't mention how much credit you got. That is an important piece of information for making decisions. The credit remaining determines your exit strategy. A common exit strategy is: 50% of profit, 100% loss, before 12 DTE (assuming 45 DTE open). What that means is if you got $3 in credit at open, you would close or roll the CSP as soon as it was worth $1.50 (half of your initial credit), or as soon as it got close to being worth $6 (so you would lose 100% of the credit you collected), or if you are 12 calendar days from expiration with neither the profit nor loss level met.\n\nMore about trade plans and exit strategies here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan\n\nNow all that said, should you mistakenly open the CSP with too few days to expiration and are stuck on expiration day, yes, you would keep your entire credit if the stock is above your strike. If it is below your strike, however, you will be forced to buy 100 shares at the strike price.

Each strategy has its pros and cons and suitability depends on the situation at the time.\n\nOne way to decide between the two is consider your risk/reward goal. A CSP can lose more money than a long call, if you include the risk of owning assigned shares. A long call has unlimited upside, while a CSP has a capped upside.\n\nAnother way to decide is if you are playing for or against theta decay. Use the CSP if you want to exploit theta decay, use the long call if you think theta decay will be a small cost of doing business.\n\nBTW, if you go for the long call, decide on the likely timeframe for the profit event and then add 50% + 10 days to the expiration, to give cushion time for your forecast to be right and to avoid the worst part of the theta decay curve. So if you think your profit target will happen in 5 days, use an expiration that is (5 x 50%) + 10 = about 13 DTE, give or take. If the next monthly expiration happens to be 18 DTE, go for that, as monthlies tend to have better liquidity than weeklies.\n\nThe way you decide which strike to use is again risk/reward. More ITM is more expensive, thus you stand to lose more if your forecast is wrong, but gives you higher delta, so more money for favorable movement and higher probability of profit. More OTM is less expensive and thus higher leverage for gain% and you stand to lose less, but gives you lower delta and less money for a favorable move and lower probability of profit. \n\nEverything in options is a trade-off, so there is no \"best\" when it comes to applying strategies.

Bitcoin looks to be preparing for a hefty run to the upside, so altcoins (which is almost my whole portfolio) are having the liquidity sucked out as people pile into bitcoin. Once bitcoin has its run, altcoins are going to go insane and put in higher percentage gains than bitcoin.  \n\nThis is just from my research and I recommend you do your own, but I’m expecting bitcoin to pull back to around 48K before we start really taking off.

Smaller returns (still likely a 100% return from 50K to 100K) with lower downside risk. ETH will outperform Bitcoin while still having similar downside risk, but altcoins like ADA, DOT, even Solana (which I have some issues with because of how centralized they are) will provide even higher returns once the liquidity flows back into them. \n\nAlso keep in mind that crypto has been in a bull run since March 2020.

It drives too close to center, and crosses center, of unmarked wide residential roads.

I slowed the set speed down, and it will gladly navigate around the road closed signs.

For example Gary Black uses 2% I believe whilst today’s 10 year bonds are 1.61%. \n\nFor me the question is - is it expected? If it’s expected then the market has priced it in. Sure there might be a short term shock over a few weeks because some weenie babies cry over spilt milk but the market will bounce back. If say the Feds increased interest rates from near zero to 2% literally tomorrow at open then holy shitballs - there would be some massive chaos in the market, everyone adjusting and a new low equilibrium would be found. IMO this was the basis for Michael Burry’s short a few months ago and Tesla’s SP would be impacted significantly by surprise interest rates (which IMO there shouldn’t be any surprise when it goes up mid next year and some tapering maybe later this year or early next).\n\nBut famous investors like Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet and many others do not do their investing (buy/sell) based on macro but instead focus on the business.

If interest rates went to 2% tomorrow there will be an argument to reduce the equity risk premium at the same time, as equities become less attractive than bonds on a relative basis so like you say you can’t just focus on the 2% interest rate assumption when determining impact on growth stocks. I think this is the ‘adjustment to equilibrium’ you’re referring to but posting info for the OP benefit.\n\nAs you say focus on company intrinsic value; I believe that Tesla’s future growth is currently undervalued and if interest rates rose like that, then growth stocks in general would go down but the sheer amount of growth from Tesla might make it even more of a ‘safe haven’ in that circumstance.

{"title": "Taiwan/China War?", "selftext": "I’ve been seeing a lot of news coming out of Taiwan and China recently suggesting that hostilities may be escalating. \n\nWhile I DO NOT BELIEVE A FULL SCALE WAR IS LIKELY, the increasing rhetoric may present some interesting investing plays. It’s important to recognize that even though a war is unlikely to happen, the market can still be shook in predicable ways just from sensationalist news hype, etc. Like the old adage says: ‘Buy the rumors, sell the news’. Folks are commenting on this post from the perspective of ‘what happens if war occurs’ or ‘how unlikely it is’. Neither of those are the point. The point is the following: ‘how will the markets be affected by the prospect of continuous, increasing hostile rhetoric?’\n\nPersonally I am buying some shares and short term OTM calls in DFEN, which is a leveraged ETF that tracks defense stocks. Some quick background:\n\n-\tThe People’s Republic of China (what we think of as China) considers the Republic of China (what we think of as Taiwan) as an integral part of their territory\n-\tThe Chinese government has rattled their sabres for decades and has consistently and vehemently declared Taiwan as their territory, and pledges to reoccupy it \n-\tThe United States has taken a diplomatic soft/strong approach where they oftentimes seem to pledge to protect Taiwan but do so hesitantly in fears of provoking the Chinese \n-\tTaiwan has the 19th largest GDP in the world and is home to Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), one of the most successful and prolific semiconductor companies \n-\tRecently revealed reports show that the US is helping to prepare Taiwan for an eminent invasion from China\n-\tRecent US weakness in global geopolitics (Afghanistan RIP) may make adversaries more brazen and likely to consider provocative actions\n-\tThe Chinese and Taiwanese governments have both recently made numerous statements and declarations regarding an eminent invasion. Hostilities are markedly at a more than short term high.\n\n\nSo given the ongoing tension, and recent notable increase in hostile rhetoric, how can we prepare ourselves?\n\nLet’s say the rhetoric increases…\n\n-\tHow would TSM share price be affected? Would competitors like Intel be an interesting play?\n-\tHow would this affect the current semiconductor shortage and associated logistics issues?\n-\tWould defense investments be a good idea (Boeing, Ratheon, Lockheed, DFEN)?\n-\tWhat can we do now?\n\nWe should always keep in mind that stocks can and will be affected without a single bomb necessarily falling.
