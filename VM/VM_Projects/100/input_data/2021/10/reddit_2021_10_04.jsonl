You're thinking about price the right way, as premium (time value) + parity (stock-strike).

The mkt is. The fact that you are surprised by that probably means there is a trade to be made (sounds to me like you think its too low). Keep in mind that the premium in the 20c is the same as the premium of the 20p at all times. We can talk about either those ITM calls or the put, it doesn't really matter since we are discussing premium only. \n\nSo the question becomes how much do you think the time value should be? Why? Is time more valuable when VXX is lower or when VXX is higher? If VXX goes down, does it go down fast or slow? What if it goes up? If time value is a proxy for \"price of protection\", do you think people are more likely to want to purchase protection when VXX is up or when it is down? Does their willingness to buy protection change the higher or lower it goes? \n\nThese are hard questions, but there are essentially how the market prices volatility curves, which is the premium in options.

That seems strange since the time doesn't differ between those two...just the intrinsic value. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI fully understand the arb argument you made above and see that the ITM call can't be valued the way I thought, but then that begs the question of where that difference in time value is coming from.

You would expect the $100 call 40 DTE would have some time value, right? Well, what about the $1 call? What is the probability that a $1 call will be worth parity after 40 days? Practically 100%, right? It's effectively the chance that the company won't go bankrupt in 40 days.

You can make a perfectly acceptable diagonal spread with that strike.\n\n>  Not sure if this in general was a mistake to close out a contract so early,\n\nNot only is that *not* a mistake, that is the best way to roll profits out of a diagonal spread.

Rather, exercise requests go into a sort of queue, and everything gets mopped up overnight.  What happened to you is how assignment works.  It's how the OCC works.  It doesn't vary by broker.\n\n>  \n>  \n>How do you guys think I can avoid this situation in the future? I'd like the long leg option to be exercised when the short leg is exercised.\n\nYou can avoid the situation by being aware of when you have a short call and there is an upcoming dividend date.  You can check to see whether you're at risk of early assignment by determining whether the dividend exceeds the extrinsic value of the call.  If so, you can avoid this situation by buying to close the short call before the ex-dividend date.  If you do get assigned, you can't have the long leg exercised when the short leg is assigned, and you usually wouldn't want to anyway, because you'd be giving up the remaining extrinsic value on the long leg. Better to sell it and buy to cover the short shares on the open market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In my case, closing the short position before the market open on 10/5, do I still need to pay the ex-dividend?\n\nI've never heard of a brokerage processing a request to exercise outside of market hours.

You sell to open a put spread on ABC at the 100/105 strikes, both OTM around 30 delta. The 105 strike pays $6 in credit and the 100 strike costs you $5, for a net $1 credit on a $5 spread.

The market seems less interested in the 100 strike for reasons that are not clear. It only goes up to $5.25. To buy to close, you have to pay $13 for a put you only got $6 for, netting a $7 loss, and you have to sell a put for $5.25 that you paid $5 for, gaining $.25. .25 - 7 = a -$6.25 loss.

So if you wrote a 4400/4410p Nov 19 spread, closed for a loss, and then wrote an identical 4400/4410p Nov 19 spread, that would certainly be a wash sale.\n\nWhere things get a lot more fuzzy is if the spread is slightly different, like 4400/4410p Nov 19 AM vs. PM expirations, or 4400/4410p Nov 19 vs. Nov 26, or 4400/4415p Nov 19.

They have no impact on your taxes, as long as you keep both ends of the wash sale in the same tax year, and dispose of the loss-carrying position in the same tax year.\n\nWash sales just add the loss to the cost basis of the disqualifying trade. So instead of deducting the loss directly, you \"carry it forward\" to the new trade. The deduction becomes \"built in\" to the gain/loss of that new trade. So you get the tax deduction one way or the other.\n\nIt's only a problem if that new trade isn't disposed of in the same tax year. If you have a $1000 loss in 2021 but you don't close the carry forward trade until 2022, you don't get the benefit of the $1000 loss on your 2021 taxes, you'll get it in 2022.\n\nSo **TL-DR**, as long as you dispose/close wash sale carry forwards in the same tax year, you can ignore wash sales completely.

We think there are many tentacles of future growth opportunity for Nvidia inclusive of the data center momentum that they are seeing today\" - Wells Fargo analyst\n\nNvidia is a big winner of many of the big tech events of the past year, including the global chip shortage, cryptocurrency volatility, and mining, the relentless fight by PC gamers to find RTX 30 series graphics cards in stock, and rising demand across segments-from work-from-home laptops to data centers. During it all, NVDA stock has continued its relentless climb, adding over 60% to its value so far in 2021.\n\n# Q2 Earnings\n\nAlmost all the company's business segments registered eye-popping growth in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2022. The company reported a record Q2 revenue of $6.51 billion. This was up 68% year-over-year, which handily beat forecasts. Gaming revenue — all those RTX 30 series graphics cards — hit $3.06 billion, up 85% YoY. Datacenter revenue also set a record at $2.37 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.04 per share (compared to 55 cents a year ago) also beat estimates.\n\n# Crypto Market dependence\n\nWhen of the negative points in NVDA Q2 earnings is that CMP sales came in well under the company’s estimates. CMP is a graphics card that was designed specifically for the cryptocurrency market. When the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin fall, crypto mining rigs power down. Miners stop buying GPUs.\n\nFor Nvidia, this was felt in Q2. The company had projected it would sell **$400 million** worth of CMPs in the quarter. Instead, it sold just **$266 million.**\n\n# Future Growth In the Gaming Segment\n\nNVIDIA's 80%-plus market share of gaming graphics cards will be a big tailwind for the company. Its video gaming revenue more than doubled last quarter to $2.76 billion. Jon Peddie Research estimates that the market for discrete gaming GPUs could jump from $23.6 billion last year to more than $54 billion by 2025. NVIDIA's dominant market share means that it could win big from the additional revenue opportunity. \n\n# Arm Deal\n\nNvidia is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings from SoftBank for approximately $40 billion, which would be a game-changer in its data center segment. The acquisition is currently held up in the approval process, but Nvidia told investors on their recent earnings call that the deal should get done. Denial is certainly a risk for Nvidia's stock price, so it's something to be aware of. recently Chinese and British regulators have had serious concerns about the acquisition and could block it.\n\n# Advanced Micro Devices ~ $AMD\n\nAMD has been making a comeback for years with a fast-improving lineup of chips addressing the laptop and PC markets, as well as hardware for data centers and the cloud computing services built on them. AMD is on track to record 50% revenue growth in 2021. The company's market share gains in the client and server CPU (central processing unit) markets, as well as the growing demand for graphics cards, have helped it to raise the guidance.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: wccftech](https://preview.redd.it/faswa7u5dgr71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=99fdf6382da174aa1c34fff4ffb72dab7abaa7f2)\n\n#  Q2 Earnings And Growth\n\nOn July 27, AMD recorded 99% YOY revenue growth, to $3.85 billion, operating income of $831m (380% change YOY), and Net income of $710m - 352% YOY growth. The company consistently winning market share from Intel. Video game platform \"Steam\" reports that AMD's share of the client CPU market has now exceeded 30%, a massive improvement from three years ago when it held just over 16% of the market.\n\n[ AMD website - q2 Financial results](https://preview.redd.it/jjeh28b8dgr71.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=1194ec52ebd44ff97c9ae9686ff69f63d4787d4b)\n\n#  Video Games Potential Growth\n\nVideo game consoles have been in hot demand since last year, Sony could end 2021 with sales of 17.9 million PS5 consoles, up from last year's 4.5 million units. The PS5's sales momentum could remain strong with Sony expected to ship over 33 million units in 2022, 50 million units in 2023, and 67 million units in 2024. Meanwhile, sales of Microsoft's Xbox Series X are expected to jump from an estimated 3.3 million units in 2020 to 12 million units in 2021, and 37 million units in 2024.\n\n**AMD** supplies semi-custom chips to both Sony and Microsoft for their latest consoles. Nvidia, on the other hand, supplies chips for **Nintendo**'s Switch consoles. The Japanese video gaming company estimates that it could sell 25.5 million units of the Switch in the current fiscal year that ends in March 2022.\n\n# Xilinx Acquisition\n\nAMD's $35 billion merger with Xilinx is expected to be completed by the end of this year.the merger will allow AMD to expand the chips it offers the customers and it will take on Intel. The merger could make AMD one of the biggest tech companies and could expand its market share significantly.\n\n# Intel ~ $INTC\n\nIntel’s stock has underperformed the market in recent years, It’s struggled with R&D, manufacturing, and management issues. the stock gained 15% in the past 3 years while the PHLX Semiconductor Index's gain of approximately 130%.\n\nIntel fell behind **TSMC** in the race to create smaller and more advanced chips. and lost market share to **AMD** in PC and data center CPU markets.\n\n[ IMAGE SOURCE: INTEL](https://preview.redd.it/sxqjttladgr71.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b541cb7bc838e7c7ddb580196ebc1e085bedce22)\n\n#  New CEO = New Future?\n\nIntel’s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, set his eyes on reclaiming the process lead by 2025. Gelsinger plans to achieve that goal by spending tens of billions of dollars on new foundries, upgrading the company's plants, expanding its third-party foundry services to pull orders away from TSMC, and attracting government subsidies in the U.S. and Europe to resolve the ongoing chip shortage and eliminate the industry's production bottlenecks in Asia.\n\nIf Intel achieves all those goals, its growth could accelerate over the next few years and make it a compelling long-term investment again.\n\n# GPUs War\n\nIntel generates most of its revenue from PC and data center CPUs and abandoned the high-end GPU market amid fierce competition from **Nvidia** and **AMD**, but it's now trying to bundle its new GPUs with its CPUs. Intel could challenge Nvidia and AMD in the laptop market with its DG1 mobile GPUs, pursue the desktop market with its DG2 GPUs, and enter the data center GPU market with its top-tier Ponte Vecchio GPUs.\n\n# Financial Comparisons\n\n[Market Size](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Market%20Cap?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit)\n\n1.

Given that AMD's growth pace was better than NVIDIA's in Q1 and Q2 and is likely to keep up that momentum for the remainder of the year, it looks like the better option right now. AMD also looks like a better buy for those looking for a growth stock at a reasonable valuation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>***Personal note:*** *Feel free to diagree and express your opinion about the post.*\n\n**Sources:**  \n[Jika.io](https://www.jika.io/dashboard/tools/multiples/AMD:NVDA:INTC/advanced%20micro%20devices:intel:nvidia/Revenue?ref=nvdastonkssubreddit) \\- Companies comparisons  \n[Motleyfool.com](https://motleyfool.com/) \\- stocks news  \n[nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com/) \\- news and information  \n[amd.com](https://amd.com/) \\- investor relations  \n[investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/) \\- investor relations", "id": "q17xof", "created_utc": 1633362049.0, "score": 209, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 132, "comments": [{"body": "Great write up\n\nMy money is in AMD", "score": 104, "replies": [{"body": "I second this.

You seem to have a good understanding of these companies what they do, how they make money, etc. And it is totally correct that AMD and NVDA will likely continue to grow at a faster rate than Intel, but I think it is very important to also consider the price you are paying for a stock. At the end of the day a good company can still be priced too high to buy into with any real margin of safety and in my opinion that is the case with both AMD and NVDA. Personally I like discounted free cashflow to determine fair value and if analyst's estimates for revenues over the next 5-10 years are even remotely accurate (which they usually are) AMD and NVDA both look to be trading at much higher prices than what I calculate their intrinsic values to be. Intel is around or a bit below its fair value depending on what numbers you use, but of course there are reasons it is being valued much lower than the other two.\n\ntldr; IMHO (strictly my humble opinion and in NO WAY financial advice): AMD and NVDA are trading too far above intrinsic value to be good buys, and of course even if Intel's stock price looks attractive if you do not like their business prospects for the coming years it may not be a good buy either so I guess I didn't really help you at all lol", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "That's the most important point.

If you're selling a spread for a credit, then you get to keep that credit no matter what happens so you're starting out with profit and all you have to do is try to hold on to it (and there are lots of ways to do that).  I think most people use options for gambling and for insurance, so think of thetagang as an insurance company and we only lose if something really bad happens that causes everyone to cash in on their insurance policy all at the same time.

Most of y’all assumed it was way out bc of US legalizations taking forever… Y’all went to pursue vanity in other run ups while I built my my kingdom. I have passionately followed the incessant fall in TLRY price since January of 2019… Since then I have yet to lose any money because I quite simply do not realize losses. In fact all I have done is increase my ever cheaper stock in increasing amounts 😳. Would you look at that. \n\n(Plz skip this) \nWhat have y’all been doing?  AMC can go burn in hell where it belongs for charging 15.00 for popcorn…movie theatres are fun and all but all the big media giants have learned to profit without theatres…. In fact they profit much more… there will always be demand for theatres… but now new releases are available on native streaming platforms. \n\nSo yeah idek why I mentioned that… tbh I may be what you call “high af”. 😘 But you don’t have to be high to want TLRY stock.. They are the best positioned of any major weed company to profit in the coming years…go check out the TLRY subreddit for the company news and developments since earlier this year… it has all the info you need. \n\nBasically it boils down to German, then European Legalization. With German election results showing that the SPD (the opposition to merkel) has won, legalization is nearly certain as the vast majority of that part and its supporters are pro legalization….as is their Green Party who  is most likely to merge with the SPD. (Awesome) this is big bc Germany only has two liscenced operating distributors and the largest one is TLRY…\n\nUS legalizations are just now around the corner and it’s best to be in it earlier.. the price has most likely bottomed out and after earning October 7th that will most likely show strong results we will be set for 20+\n\nThe time is now …\n\n(This post was created with the help of Tornado Of Souls - Megadeth)\n\nTLDR: TLRY is not an awful company like other weed companies (I’m looking at you ACB)… With recent news it will spike… it’s a big company too… this isn’t goofball shit.", "id": "q12oik", "created_utc": 1633343075.0, "score": 546, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 238, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|17|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q12oik/tlry_real_talk_weed_stocks_in_general_too_kinda/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lap7fu/recaf/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=q12oik)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=q12oik)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I bought in post Aphria merger, still holding but down like 60% lol", "score": 81, "replies": [{"body": "tilray best mj company in the world all other companies run by little girls", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "This comment looks to have been written by a 6 year.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "this comment looks like it was written by a little girl", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "This comment may have been insulting, if I was a 6 year old.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "This comment is a 6 year old girl.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "lol 😂 looks like you won!", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Wow man puts on you missing the borat inside joke ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "That makes no sense, you mean calls on me missing the inside joke dipshit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 76, "replies": [{"body": "October 7th", "score": 47, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Open 🚀", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "That mean it'll go down.", "score": -15, "replies": [{"body": "CITADEL SHORT BOT!!!

{"title": "Here's why Tesla won't have any Competition for Most of the Decade", "selftext": "There are 5 bullet points that need to be checked off for a company and its EV to be competitive with Tesla EVs. We'll break it down into 2 bullet points for the company, 2 bullet points for their EV, and 1 bullet point that actually makes the first 4 bullet points moot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a company to be competitive with Tesla it needs to fulfill 2 requirements:\n\n1. The ability to produce 500k+ EVs a year, or more specifically at least 80% of Tesla produces for the same calendar year. There's literally no other company that can do this at the moment, and there won't be until Tesla tops out production after the decade has passed.\n2. The ability to produce an EV at a cost of no more than $30k. Right now, there's 0 doubt in my mind that the Ford Mach-E and other crappy EVs cost at least $50k to manufacture. A Tesla SR Model 3 costs $40k to the consumer, and probably only around $30k for Tesla to manufacture it. To be even more strict, a company needs to create an EV that only costs them $30k-$35k to be competitive with Tesla.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a company's EV to be competitive with Tesla it needs to fulfill 2 requirements:\n\n3. An affordable price for the EV. Some companies have achieved this. The Ford Mach-E, VW's ID.3/4, Chevy's Bolt Fire are all affordable to the consumer. This is just one bullet point though, and bullet point 2 still looms large.\n\n4. Customer satisfaction. First and foremost, Tesla has a supercharger network. Soon to be open to everyone, but up until now this bullet point couldn't be achieved by 'competition.' Also, people love their Teslas, and in particular, the long range that other EVs can't achieve without breaking bullet point 3 and 2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd finally..\n\n5. The EV market is growing fast enough to support Tesla selling every EV they make \\*plus other EVs from other companies\\*. At some point, probably after 2030, 90% of cars will be EVs. Tesla will not have a market share of more than 25%, and yet they will have sold every EV they've made this decade at margins likely better than the ones we saw in Q2 ER as they continue to scale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, you guys do some research and find a company and it's EV that fulfills bullet points 1-4 (you can't), and if you somehow do find a company and EV that fulfills bullet points 1 - 4 (say.. in 2026 maybe), then I'll just point to bullet point 5 to remind you to stop being a stupid bear.\n\nIf you're wondering why it will likely be 2026 or later by the time a company fulfills bullet points 1 - 4, it's because Tesla spent a decade of burning billions of dollars in R&D to figure out how to mass produce a commercially viable EV. Elon, and his autistic brilliance, was the one to experiment with making their own magnets with unique chemistries in the motors, metal alloys and casting processes to optimize factory space and cut costs and weight on their EVs.
