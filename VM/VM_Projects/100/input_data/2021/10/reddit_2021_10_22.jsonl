{"title": "Snap’s Financial Update Was So Bad, Facebook and Twitter Stocks Are Falling, Too", "selftext": "Snap stock plunged in late trading Thursday after the social-networking firm posted disappointing revenue growth and guidance that fell shy of estimates. The parent of Snapchat said its advertising revenue was hurt more than expected by Apple ‘s change in the rules surrounding advertising on mobile apps. The miss weighed heavy on shares of other major social-media companies. Snap (ticker: SNAP) stock was down 21% in premarket trading Friday. Facebook (FB) was down 3.9% on the news, while Twitter (TWTR) was off 4.5%, Pinterest (PINS) had fallen 2.6%, and Alphabet (GOOGL) had slipped 1.8%. Snap is the first of the companies to report September quarter results.\n\nFor the third quarter, Snap posted revenue of $1.067 billion, up 57% from a year ago, and below the company’s guidance range of $1.07 billion to $1.085 billion. Adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, was $174 million, well above its guidance range of $110 million to $120 million. On a non-GAAP basis, the company earned 17 cents a share in the quarter, beating the Street consensus of 8 cents a share. The company said it grew daily average users in the quarter by more than 20% to 306 million.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Snap is projecting revenue of $1.165 billion to $1.205 billion, well shy of the Street consensus forecast of $1.36 billion. Snap is projecting adjusted Ebitda for the quarter of between $135 million and $175 million.\n\nSnap blamed the miss in part on changes in Apple’s (AAPL) advertising tracking practices that make it harder to track consumer behavior across apps and websites. “Our advertising business was disrupted by changes to iOS ad tracking that were broadly rolled out by Apple in June and July,” the company said in remarks prepared for the company’s earnings conference call. “While we anticipated some degree of business disruption, the new Apple-provided measurement solution did not scale as we had expected, making it more difficult for our advertising partners to measure and manage their ad campaigns for iOS.” Snap said the issue “was compounded by the ongoing macroeconomic effects of the global pandemic, with our advertising partners facing a variety of supply-chain interruptions and labor shortages.” The company said that factor reduced the “short-term appetite to generate additional customer demand through advertising at a time when their businesses are already supply-constrained.”\n\nSnap added that Apple’s changes have “upended many of the industry norms and advertiser behaviors that were built on IDFA, Apple’s unique device identifier for advertising, over the past decade, which now require a double opt-in by users in order to access directly.” The company noted that Apple has rolled out a proprietary solution known as SKAdNetwork, or SKAN, to allow app-based advertisers to continue measuring their advertising on iOS. But it says results have been disappointing. “The initial results we observed using SKAN were generally aligned with prior industry-standard solutions, and we were among the first platforms to lean into this solution and push for widespread industry adoption,” the company said. “However, over time, we saw SKAN measurement results diverge meaningfully from the results we observed on other first- and third-party measurement solutions, making SKAN unreliable as a standalone measurement solution.”\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/snap-stock-price-earnings-apple-51634851073?mod=mw\\_quote\\_news](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/snap-stock-price-earnings-apple-51634851073?mod=mw_quote_news)", "id": "qdef1b", "created_utc": 1634900310.0, "score": 411, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 149, "comments": [{"body": "for Facebook  monetisation from ads is huge, most revenue is in the US.\nIOS' marketshare in the US is very large (+55%), thus FB revenue at least in guidance for the 4th quarter (with holiday sales) should suffer quite badly.

{"title": "Tesla Stock Hits New High. Here’s What Could Come Next", "selftext": " Tesla has hit a new all-time high in Friday trading. The stock’s recent run has been incredible. Now the question is how high can it go. Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock is at $906.50, up about 1.4%, in recent trading. The S&P 500 is up about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added about 0.3%.\n\nThat’s a record for the electric-vehicle maker. Its old high-water mark was set on Jan. 25 at $900.40 a share, according to Dow Jones Market Data. On Thursday, Tesla closed at a record for the first time since Jan. 26. Shares are up about 39% over the past three months, pushing the market cap to roughly $900 billion. (Tesla has about 1 billion shares outstanding, making the math easy.) \n\nBulls, naturally, see more gains ahead. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Tesla raised his most bullish case for Tesla stock to $1,500 a share from $1,300 after Tesla reported better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday. “Tesla is rising because earnings revisions are soaring,” points out Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund Active exchange-traded fund. Analyst estimates for Tesla’s 2022 earnings have risen to about $8 a share from $6 over the past few weeks. “Rising estimates drove Tesla to the moon in 2020. They will drive Tesla to $1,000-plus in 2022,” Black says. \n\nIves rates Tesla stock Buy, and Tesla is the largest position in Black’s fund. Yes, there are still Tesla bears out there who believe the stock is overvalued. The bottom third of analyst price targets averages about $425, less than half of where the stock is trading.\n\nBears expect the sky-high valuation to give investors pause eventually. Stocks don’t usually fall just because investors, collectively, wake up one morning and feel differently about valuation. Something has to happen. The overall market could tumble, or the business could trip up. Analysts expect Tesla deliveries to grow from about 890,000 units in 2021 to 1.3 million in 2022.

Tesla is worth more than all car manufacturer combined.\n\nI'll give you a legit answer for the sake of your knowledge (and NOT for the sake of \"I'm right! you're wrong!\"... so no arguing desired here)\n\nThe difference is the profit margins, and expenses between, say.. Toyota and Tesla. First and foremost, Tesla doesn't pay dealerships, salesman or for advertising. Secondly, Toyota (and other legacy automakers) actually have a negative gross margin for each car sold. They rely on dealership car maintenance and taking loans and financing for customers to make money. It's an entirely different business model when you think about it.\n\nAlso ICE cars had their exponential decline in costs in the early 20th century. They disrupted the industry, and now EVs are doing the same. EV costs are declining and will decline to levels lower than the cost of teh ICE automobile (because it's simply a better solution!). Elon was the one that decided to take the huge risk of investing millions, and then billions, into EVs to drive down their costs by scaling and innovating repidly. Tesla is beating everyone to a \\*better solution for cars\\* by 5+ years and billions of dollars of research. You simply can't compare ICE to EV vehicles in terms of margins, \\*AND YOU DEFINITELY\\* can't compare the businesses built around the ICE vehicle to the businesses built around the EV.\n\nAnyway, I like a metric of gaap earnings per car sold. Tesla just made about $6800 per car sold (GM and Ford somewhere around $1000 per car sold). Take that $6800 and multiply by 1.5M, or 2.5M or 5M EVs sold for Tesla in whatever year you believe they achieve that goal... then you got an idea of how much earnings Tesla could make.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "> Tesla is worth more than all car manufacturer combined.\n\nYour data is wrong.

This gives us three possibilities:\n\n* Tesla is going to generate much more profit over the long term than other automakers\n* Tesla is overvalued\n* All other automakers are undervalued\n\nReally, the question we should be asking, is why are all other automakers valued so low? The entire global auto manufacturing industry is valued at less than one large tech company like Apple. Does that make sense?\n\nEspecially now, countries around the world are subsidizing the purchase of new cars (as long as they're EVs) and many are talking about it being illegal to buy new petrol cars in the next 10-15 years. We'll likely see a lot more pressure to have consumers upgrade to a new car (as long as it's an EV) at a faster rate than they would've otherwise.\n\nEVs are less complex, and should be easier to manufacturer. The need to accelerate the turnover of the entire global auto fleet should be a huge opportunity for the auto industry. Every automaker should see huge opportunities over the next decade or two, and should be positioning themselves to take advantage of it now.\n\nBut we don't see that at all. The world's largest automaker, Toyota, still hasn't made any significant investment in EVs. They're not even sure EVs will be the dominant technology going forward. VW is at least talking about EVs being the future, but they seem to be caught up in internal politics and slowed down by their huge and complicated management structure. Most other automakers are still only making one or two compliance cars at low volumes.\n\nIt seems like investors just don't think that the legacy automakers are going to navigate this global transition to EVs well. In fact, at the current valuations it seems like investors expect there to be some bankruptcies.\n\nAnd then there's Tesla, which is growing faster than any other large manufacturer in history, and is earning profit margins significantly higher than any other large automaker. At their current levels they're already posting quarterly EBITDA numbers in the range of other large US automakers like Ford and GM, even though they sell a fraction as many cars, just because they have such good margins on every car.

None of these companies comes anywhere close to Tesla's valuation and there's no guarantee that Tesla will even be around in 20 years. \n\nThe competition in the EV space will be fierce. I don't think Tesla will win this battle in the long run, especially against Japanese and Chinese companies that have very low costs. Tesla is losing market share against it's competitors: \n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-market-share-drops-ford-gm-audi-2021-10](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-market-share-drops-ford-gm-audi-2021-10)  \n\n\nI don't dislike Tesla, but I see them more as a niche high end EV car company, like a BMW or a Maserati. I don't think the masses will all be driving Teslas. They may do well, but these valuations don't make sense to me with the amount of risk involved.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Well, honestly that's a reasonable view.  I personally don't see how anyone who isn't closely following Tesla can really see why this is wrong.\n\nSo, a few rhings.  First, it's not easy to manufacture cars in volume. Tesla is the first in many decades to make it.  The new guys are not likely to succeed.  Those that do are very much not likely to get to Tesla's level of efficiency in manufacturing and build cost.  The legacy guys have other problems I'll mention letter.\n\nChinese companies are the only realistic threat, as the government there can absolutely throw ridiculous money at them to help.  So, there's that. \n\nThe value of the market to Tesla's market cap is significantly higher than it is for others.  The normal gross margin for cars from legacy guys is around 13-21%.  Tesla's is almost 30% and that's without the massive improvements in cost coming with the Austin and Berlin factories. They will literally be cranking out car frames like matchbox cars.  I expect gross margin to be in the 40s sometime in 2023 at latest.\n\nThis leads into the incredible fact that Tesla is just ridiculously better at building EVs (talking factories, not car build quality).  You'd think that over a century of experience would give the legacy guys a strong advantage, and I used to think it would, but that's not turning out to be the case at all.  The focus on entirely out of the box thinking had already produced crazy good improvements, and Tesla is not stopping.  Now, I knew a company that tried to be a think tank doing what Tesla does way before Tesla (going back to first principles, blank slate designs) but they just weren't good enough. It takes crazy good engineers to pull off. Tesla, being the number one destination along with SpaceX for college graduates has a massive advantage in talent, and they really make it work.  It's not something that is likely to be duplicated any time soon.\n\nThis is, incidentally, why I am so into Tesla. It's mostly the manufacturing and engineering. I'm not really super motivated by the environment (allthough yes it a problem).\n\nTesla is pushing for cheaper cars. They are designing a 25k car, but when they are so inundated with orders they won't waste effort that could be directed to making more of the expensive ones.  However, eventually at 50-70% yearly growth they'll fill the need at the model 3/Y price point and then they'll start building the cheaper one.  The original roadster was 109k-170k, they're getting more affordable all the time.  The 3, when you consider gas and service, is about the same as a Camry already.\n\nThe competition (outside of China) is barely a blip on the radar.  Multiple legacy guys have announced plans for more or less 1M EVs in 2025+.  Tesla is there now. In 2025 Tesla will be 5M+.  Then take Lucid. People act like they're going to eat away at Tesla, but thier own stated roadmap shows the ramp for producing those cars will not be significant vs. Tesla for a decade. It's really, really simple there.\n\nThe legacy guys are expected to just wake up and win some day. A year or two ago, that was a reasonable assumption. It's not, now.  They are just not making big enough commitments on batteries, for one.  Analysts are just not looking hard enough at what will totally happen when they can't get batteries.  It'll be the chip shortage all over again.  VW is the only one that seems to be taking it seriously enough to even survive.\n\nThere's also the huge huge problem of dealerships.  Dealerships are business models based on service, and there will be a lot less of that.  Right now, charging stations at dealerships are often broken, and it's not uncommon for it to be hard to get them to even show you the EV.  Dealerships know EVs are a big problem for them, and they're not going to be very willing participants in this.\n\nSo, did I mention manufacturing?  :). One last point. Several legacy guys are investing ~30B to build out factories for batteries and cars at that 1M level in 2025.  Tesla is spending less than a tenth of that for the same capacity.  They are massively more capital efficient.  That is not a small thing.\n\nI hope this helps someone...

For manufacturing, Intel is turning to TSMC’s N6 process to do it. Given Intel’s Q1’22 release timeframe, Intel’s Alchemist GPUs will almost certainly be the most advanced consumer GPUs on the market with respect to manufacturing technology. Alchemist will be going up against AMD’s Navi 2x chips built on N7, and NVIDIA’s Ampere GA10x chips built on Samsung 8LPP. That said, as AMD can attest to, there’s more to being competitive in the consumer GPU market than just having a better process node. In conjunction with the use of TSMC’s N6 process, Intel is reporting that they’ve improved both their power efficiency (performance-per-watt) and their clockspeeds at a given voltage by 50% compared to Xe-LP.

Let me get straight to the point.\n\n# I think we will experience some headwinds over the next 12 months.\n\nThere. I said it. Now for those of you with higher IQ, let me explain why I think that.\n\n**1. Inflation is at the highest level it has been in the past 13 years (since 2008)**\n\nDespite what some of you may think, we cannot print money forever. Printer cannot go brrrr always. We had fun with the printer since March 2020, but the effects are starting to show. Food, gas, real estate, stocks, digital currencies, wage subsidies, unemployment benefits - the society is flooded with cash. We are literally swimming in it. Sure it's fun when SPY goes up **31.6%** over the past 12 months, but this leads to inflation and inflation is bad. Why? Because high inflation puts pressure on a government to increase the value of the state pension and unemployment benefits and other welfare payments as the cost of living climbs higher. Inflation expectations -> wage demands -> rise labour costs -> lower  profits for businesses. This is why at some point, our saviour J Pow will need to address this. In fact, he already announced it, which leads to my second point.\n\n**2. FED announced tapering will start in November**\n\nTapering means the gradual slowing down of purchases of securities and bonds. Simply put - printer will slow down. Most of you have never seen the stock market without the printer. You think 31.6% a year for SPY is normal. You are not aware that SPY was flat for 13 years (*0% between Mar 2000 and Jan 2013*). Most of you are not reading the news. You did not read the news in Jan 2020. You thought corona was a Chinese problem. You did not read the news in Mar 2020. You were buying puts, when J Pow publicly said he's going to turn on the printer. Even if you read that, you had no clue what that meant. You held your puts and watched them melt as printer did its thing. Now, we are in a similar situation. J Pow announced he will slow down the printer, you don't know what that means, you are still holding calls and looking to buy more because \"stocks always go up\".\n\nIn conclusion:  \nprinter brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr -> stocks brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  \nprinter brrr -> stocks brrr\n\n**3. Interest rates will need to go up**\n\nOne way to curb inflation is to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates means it'll be harder to borrow money. Less borrowing, leads to less liquidity to buy houses and stocks. Less buying, prices cool down. I'm not calling for a crash, but a 10-20% cool-down will be enough to wipe out most of you with your clueless strategies, if we can even call them strategies.\n\n**4. China is slowing down**\n\nI know Evergrande paid its bills this month, but they did it by waiting until the last day before announcing bankruptcy. This is not normal. If they had so much trouble this month, who can guarantee they'll be able to pay them next month? On top of that, an average Chinese citizen realized that real estate does not always go up. This change in mindset will cause slight fear, which leads to lower demand for real estate which will eventually show who is over-leveraged. (*hint: It's Evergrande*) You might wonder, how would a slowdown in Chinese real estate affect us in North America? American corporations generate significant profits by selling stuff to Chinese people. If Chinese people are not happy about their houses and apartments going up in value, the last thing on their minds would be to buy new iPhones, purchase Teslas, and buy commodities to build more real estate. We are more connected than you think. When something happens in China, it affects everyone. Don't believe me? Go back to January 2020.\n\n**What should you do?**\n\nSlow down a bit. Relax. Think. Take it easy with calls. Take the foot of the gas pedal. I'm not calling for a crash. I'm not telling you to short the market. Just don't be caught off guard, when big boys cash their chips and go home. You don't want to be the last one to leave the casino.
