{"title": "CEO Pat Gelsinger and Other Intel Insiders Bought Up $2.5 Million Worth of Stock", "selftext": "Edit: OPTIONS STRATEGY: \n\nINTC: BUY: Jan 19 2024 Call option at $50 strike costs about $7.5 per call\n\nFor short term if INTC goes to around $56 the option will be worth around $11.7 (it was this price on october 21 , 2021) so you can sell early (before expiration), or for longer term strategy, just hang in there until INTC builds their new factories, releases their GPUs and CPU's, and potentially goes higher than $70. Others here have said they expect 2-5x depending on their execution of their objectives.\n\nThe issue for large traders may be low liquidity for this strategy on leaps. For them , they may have to outright buy shares to lock in their buy price and then slowly transition those into leaps depending on liquidity.\n\nInsiders buy for one reason and sell for many reasons, so part of this strategy is relying on insider signals: \n\n\n>https://www.barrons.com/articles/intel-stock-insiders-buy-51635285346\n\n>Intel insiders, including CEO Pat Gelsinger, disclosed they bought a total of $2.5 million of stock of the chip giant on Monday. Some insiders made their first open-market purchases of stock, and others bought for the first time in years.\n\n>Intel (ticker: INTC) stock has been lagging behind the broader stock market with a 3% loss for the year to date. For comparison, the S&P 500 index has risen 22% so far in 2021.\n\n\n>Intel CEO Gelsinger paid $500,000 for 10,000 shares, a per-share average price of $49.94. According to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gelsinger now owns 219,750 shares. It’s Gelsinger’s first open-market purchase of Intel stock since he became CEO in February.\n\n>Director James J. Goetz led the buying, paying $1 million for 20,000 Intel shares, an average price per share of $49.76. A partner of venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital, and an Intel director since 2019, Goetz now owns 198,521 Intel shares. This is his first open-market purchase of Intel stock since November 2019 when he bought $5 million of shares.\n\n>Longtime director Frank Yeary paid $500,000 for 10,000 Intel shares, a per-share average price of $49.66. A managing member at private investment firm Darwin Capital Advisors LLC, Yeary made the purchase through a family trust that now owns 57,998 shares. Yeary also owns another 810 Intel shares in a personal account. This is Yeary’s first open-market purchase of Intel stock since October 2010 when he bought $290,000 of shares.\n\n\n>Risa Lavizzo-Mourey made her first open-market buy of Intel stock, paying $250,000 for 5,000 shares, an average per share of $49.50. A Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Professor Emerita, University of Pennsylvania, Lavizzo-Mourey joined Intel’s board in March 2018. She now owns 12,079 Intel shares.\n\n>Former HP (HP) CEO Dion Weisler paid $250,000 for 5,015 Intel shares, a per-share average price of $49.85. Weisler, an Intel director since June 2020, now owns 11,952 shares. He bought Intel stock earlier this year, paying $250,000 in May for 4,464 shares, an average per-share price of $56.", "id": "qgkld7", "created_utc": 1635295587.0, "score": 333, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 110, "comments": [{"body": "OP is spamming this in every stock/investing related subreddit FYI", "score": 153, "replies": [{"body": "They want someone to hold their bags", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "> They want someone to hold their bags\n\nWithout a doubt.

O. Box 64854, St. Paul, MN 55164-0854 serves as Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Berkshire’s common stock.\nBerkshire has two classes of common stock designated Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Shares of Class B common stock are not convertible into shares of Class A common stock.\nRegistered owner’s holding Berkshire stock in certificate form or through EQ’s direct registration system, may contact EQ directly for instructions regarding changes in registration, including shareowner’s mailing address or conversion of Class A shares to Class B shares. Correspondence may be directed to EQ at the address indicated above or at www.shareowneronline.com. Telephone inquiries should be directed to the Shareowner Relations Department at 1-877-602-7411 between 7:00 A.M. and 7:00 P.M. Central Time. Certificates for re-issue or transfer should be directed to the Transfer Department at the address indicated above. Shareowners can also view account information at the EQ website www.shareowneronline.com.\nIf a shareowner has lost or misplaced stock certificates, he or she should contact EQ to arrange for replacements. Transfer agent’s, including EQ, will require the shareowner to provide an indemnification bond based on the value of the share certificate being replaced. Shareholders are encouraged to contact EQ periodically to verify the mailing address of record to assure that Company communications are delivered. We encourage you to vote on shareholder proposals contained in our annual proxy solicitation. Contact with EQ is established automatically through the voting process.\nShareholders of record with EQ, who wish to convert Class A common stock into Class B common stock may contact EQ in writing. Along with the underlying stock certificate, shareholders should provide EQ with specific written instructions regarding the number of shares to be converted and the manner in which the Class B shares are to be registered. We recommend that you use certified or registered mail when delivering the stock certificates and written instructions.\nOwners holding Berkshire common stock in street name (in a bank, broker or other nominee account) should contact the bank, broker of nominee for changes in registration. If Class A shares are held in “street name,” shareholders wishing to convert all or a portion of their holding to Class B should contact their broker or bank nominee.

Even Intel's Rocket Lake flagship couldn't keep up with the new Core i5 chip which ends up 13% faster in single and 10% faster in the multi-core tests.\n\nThe Intel Core i5-12600K beats the Rocket Lake flagship, the Core i9-11900K, with ease and it shows that Intel is seriously going to give AMD a tough time in the mainstream segment if these numbers are to be believed. We are just a few weeks away from the NDA lift and the Core i5-12600K is going to be one chip that many consumers, especially gamers, are going to be interested in.", "id": "qgx0uj", "created_utc": 1635342292.0, "score": 194, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 135, "comments": [{"body": "15 of your last posts are about Intel.

My preferred method would be a Financial Transactions Tax; every time you withdraw money (over a limit) you get taxed.  And/or there's the proposed 'penny tax' on High Frequency Trading (something that adds absolutely nothing to the public good).  Or you could consider the loans people take out against their unrealised gains as income, and tax that.

The car order on Monday, the largest-ever for EVs at $4.2 billion, was such as watershed moment that it propelled Tesla Inc.’s valuation past $1 trillion.\n\nJust as surprising: The company behind it all is barely out of bankruptcy. Only 17 months ago, with the Covid-19 pandemic raging, Estero, Florida-based Hertz was so troubled and its future so uncertain that it was forced to seek protection from creditors. Now, under the control of hedge fund and private-equity owners, Hertz is leaning on mobile technology and digitization to transform a stodgy industry known for uninspiring cars and poor customer experiences.\n\nUnder the agreement with Uber Technologies Inc., drivers for the ride-hailing giant who previously had to provide and maintain their own EVs will, starting Nov. 1, be able to rent a Tesla from Hertz instead. It’s an alternative to buying or leasing and, according to Hertz, will be cheaper than either.\n\n“Now is the time to drive a green recovery from the pandemic,” Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based Uber, said in a joint statement with Hertz.\n\nNew Strategy\n\nPartnering with Uber and Phoenix-based Carvana addresses two key weaknesses in the rental business: asset-utilization -- how actively a car is rented out; and resale recovery -- how much of the purchase price is recouped when the car is sold. By opening part of its EV fleet to ride-hailing, Hertz is aiming to maximize revenue per vehicle and improve profit margins. \n\nThrough the new deal with Carvana, one of the two biggest online car marketplaces, Hertz hopes to eliminate the discounting necessary when selling vehicles from its fleet through dealers and wholesalers. Consumers will be able to buy directly and pick up cars as soon as the following day. Carvana, home of the car vending machine, earns a commission.\n\nUnder the Uber agreement, drivers will pay a preferred weekly rate for unlimited miles in the Hertz EVs, plus expenses for recharging and incidental damage. Hertz, as with all rentals, covers or absorbs the cost of financing, basic maintenance, insurance and depreciation. Uber is offering drivers a zero-emissions incentive of $1 a ride for using EVs and 50 cents for every rider who chooses to go green.\n\nHertz has been renting to Uber drivers since 2016. Its new agreement builds on that program, adding at least 50,000 Teslas to the pool of available vehicles by 2023. The new EVs will be available first in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington, D.C., with a nationwide rollout to follow in coming weeks.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's snowballing people nice.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "👏", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Most people don't have any real hobbies outside of work, eating out, and vacationing", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Well that’s sad.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Isn’t it?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I work in an 'ealry retirement' industry where you can punch out after 20-25yrs and it's incredibly sad how many retire and then come back within 6 months as a contractor, bored out of their minds and ready to kill their wives and kids they've been able to avoid for 20 years\n\n\nPromised myself to never do this", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Lol Uber jumping on the bandwagon before they will be obsolete once FSD robotaxis are released", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Uber can maintain our cars day to day for a fee", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "It’s just PR stuff.

But they could say that Chevy is going to be an EV brand by 2025\n* Start building some battery factories and/or partnering with a battery manufacturer to make new factories. To be competitive with Tesla in 2025 they'll need way more than 100 GWh of dedicated cell supply (plus more from suppliers/partners probably). They're not going to have it if they're not building the capacity now\n* Build a ground up factory to produce a $25k, 250 mile EV. Something that won't be profitable unless it's made in huge numbers, and make the investment now to make that kind of production possible. Maybe even roll out a new brand like they did with Saturn (except don't sabotage it this time)\n\nGM can still borrow money, they're still making money selling parts and doing financing, they could raise capital if they had a very ambitious plan to back it up. But They're years behind right now, to catch up in 4 years they need to do something big. The fact that they haven't actually announced anything big (besides plans to do a little brand engineering to make 30 different models out of a handful of EVs) means that they probably don't have anything to announce.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Start building some battery factories and/or partnering with a battery manufacturer to make new factories.

No idea about the brand or something, payed about $150 for it. Bought it on a market in Japan. Its apiece of beauty and I dont know why it was only $150. If you can, get one with a rough surface (like bang marks) on the sides, helps prevent cutted parts to stick to the side of the knife. Thats the only drawback I have with mine, the sides are too smooth and stuff just doesnt want to come off.\n\nWhat I learned in the years since I bought it: treat it well. Dont scrape over a surface horizontally, cut only on wood, dont cut hard things like bones. Dont put it in a drawer. When cutting meat or vedgetables, it slices in very clean cuts, I enjoy that a lot when cooking! Avoid cheese or other soft but sticky material, the sharpness doesnt do anything there and you need a lot of force to overcome the sticking part. Once through, you tend to ram it into the board with too much force.\n\nThe knife shines when you sharpen it with wet stones to at least 3000, better 10000 grains per inch and use polishing paste on leather afterwards.The stones and sharpening equipment is at least $100 extra. But worth it more than the knife in my opinion. The sharper it is, the less force you need using it. Its sharp enough if it can shave the hair on your arm. I sharpen it every 2/3 month, depending on usage and damage.\n\nIf you buy a knife, Damascus doesnt seem to be all that important.

They're just over $200 for most types https://www.chefknivestogo.com/gihakn.html I mention it because you won't usually see this kind of steel recommended online, probably because it's seen as a \"compromise\"?\n\nBut there's tons of great knives from small blacksmiths in the $100-200 range, that'll outperform anything we can get at a place like Williams-Sonoma, it just takes a little research to find them, and maybe a little patience to wait for them to be in stock.

Certainly looks that way.\n\nSo a company like Toyota can already manufacture and assemble everything else electric vehicles need like a steel/aluminum body, a metal alloy chassis, power windows, windshields and windows, infotainment center, comfy seats, air conditioning, safety monitoring systems, axles, brake pads, dashboards, cup holders, and seat warmers.  Just not the batteries and motors yet.  And Toyota has an installed capacity for those things to the tune of 10M vehicles per year. \n\nSo all Toyota needs to do is build out their electric motor and battery capacity to match their already immense capacity to produce the rest of the car.  They built a little under 11M vehicles in 2019, and only about 20% of that manufacturing has to do with the engines. \n\nAt under 1M cars projected to be produced this year, Tesla has quite the production gap to close.  Now once the new plants in Berlin(side note there is no way they factored wholesale electricity prices above $150/mWh in Germany when calculating their marginal cost of production),Austin, and Shanghai up ASAP and they can increase that capacity to 3M per year by the end of 2023.  They still have to buildout triple their capacity to even have a chance to breathe down Toyota’s neck.\n\nI guess my point in this is that Tesla’s biggest problem is expanding capacity because they’re going to spend much more than a company like Toyota to get there. You can’t discount the value of the replacement cost of Toyota’s existing assets.\n\nSo my big question is, why doesn’t Tesla just use their largest advantage - an astronomical market cap- to do an all-stock transaction and just acquire a large legacy manufacturer and jump forward in capacity by 5-10 years?\n\nI don’t have a position in Tesla because I have no idea what it’s going to do with any degree of conviction, but I just don’t see a $1T company when I look at their best case scenario as an auto manufacturer.

In a world where worldwide obesity has nearly tripled since 1975, 39% of adults aged 18 years and over were overweight in 2016, and most of the world's population live in countries where overweight and obesity kills more people than underweight, [link](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight along with other statistics such as 463 million people live with diabetes and 1.13 billion people live with hypertension (also known as high blood pressure) – conditions that often occur together and are among the leading global causes of poor health and death [link](https://world-heart-federation.org/news/the-cost-of-inaction-on-diabetes-and-hypertension/), it’s not too surprising that people are turning towards plant-based foods-– which are a large part of a vegan diet – particularly fruit, vegetables, nuts, pulses and seeds, as they have been shown to help in the treatment of many chronic diseases and are often associated with lower levels of type 2 diabetes, less hypertension, lower cholesterol levels and reduced cancer rates [link](https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/enjoy-food/eating-with-diabetes/veganism-and-diabetes). \n\nFrom an animal welfare perspective – it turns out that an estimated 99% of US farmed animals are living in factory farms at present. By species, it’s estimated that 70.4% of cows, 98.3% of pigs, 99.8% of turkeys, 98.2% of chickens raised for eggs, and over 99.9% of chickens raised for meat are living in factory farms [link](https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates), less than ideal conditions within these farms where ‘animals are packed in as tightly as possible to maximize output and profit, even though this causes many to die from disease or infection before being sent to the slaughterhouse’ [link](https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/) has also contributed to an increase in the awareness of and consumption of plant-based foods on ethical grounds.\n\nThe third driver’s been getting the most airtime recently since it seems the planet’s actually pretty fucked, with a new report by the UN Environment Programme that came out yesterday finding ‘new and updated Nationally Determined Contributions only take 7.5% off predicted 2030 emissions, while 55% is needed to meet the 1.5°C Paris goal’ [link](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/updated-climate-commitments-ahead-cop26-summit-fall-far-short-net) a.k.a a bunch of countries do not want to make the necessary concessions to preserve the planet in its current state. These ‘Latest climate promises for 2030 put the world on track for a temperature rise this century of at least 2.7°C’ [link](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/updated-climate-commitments-ahead-cop26-summit-fall-far-short-net), with the planet still on track for catastrophic heating [link](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/10/1104012). Why is any of this important/relevant in this context? It turns out that ‘the animal agriculture sector is responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions,’ [link](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/climate-change-animal-agriculture-factsheet.pdf) highlights include 9% of annual human-induced CO2 emissions,3\n37% of methane (CH4) emissions, which has more than 20 times the global warming potential of CO2,\nAnd 65% of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which has almost 300 times CO2’s global warming potential [link](https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/climate-change-animal-agriculture-factsheet.pdf). Not that it’ll happen anytime soon but it turns out that cutting meat and dairy products from diets could reduce an individual's carbon footprint from food by up to 73 per cent. If everyone stopped eating these foods, researchers at the University of Oxford found that global farmland use could be reduced by 75 per cent, an area equivalent to the size of the US, China, Australia and the EU combined – leading to a significant drop in greenhouse gas emissions [link](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/veganism-environmental-impact-planet-reduced-plant-based-diet-humans-study-a8378631.html). One survey found that ~23% of people were interested in cutting down meat consumption for the sake of the environment, showing an additional market for producers of plant-based food [link](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44488051). \n\n**Part 2 - Company Overview and Value Proposition** \n\nLet’s take a look at what Tattooed Chef’s all about and what sets it apart in the marketplace. In the company’s own words - Tattooed Chef is a leading plant-based food company offering a broad portfolio of innovative plant-based food products that taste great and are sustainably sourced. Tattooed Chef’s signature products include ready-to-cook bowls, zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, and cauliflower pizza crusts, which are available in the frozen food sections of leading national retail food stores across the United States. Understanding consumer lifestyle and food trends, and a commitment to innovation, allows Tattooed Chef to continuously introduce new products. Tattooed Chef provides great-tasting, approachable, and innovative products not only to the growing group of consumers who seek to adopt a plant-based lifestyle, but to any of the “People Who Give a Crop” [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/).\n\nThe Company’s current market opportunity is worth $42 billion and consists of a number of frozen food categories including frozen appetizers & snacks, frozen breakfast foods, frozen entrees, frozen fruits & vegetables, and frozen plant based meat alternatives [link](https://gyazo.com/c586290597f7fccff2db2ad399e09f41). It’s worth noting that frozen plant-based meat alternatives in which some of its most comparable comps are, is only worth $0.8 billion, in comparison to the other massive segments such as frozen entrees at $23.1 billion and frozen fruits and vegetables at $7.6 billion. The growth in the frozen food category (a key areas where TTCF competes) has been primarily driven by the recent product innovation as a response to the growing demand for great tasting, clean label and convenient options. The overall frozen food category outpaced the general center of store food categories. Millennials and Gen Z are driving growth in the frozen foods section due to convenience, frozen fresh and plant based foods, with the number of consumers who say convenience had a significant impact on their food purchase decision growing from 49% in 2017 to 57% in 2019 [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nThe Company’s product portfolio consists of entrees, breakfast, vegetables, pizza, meat alternatives, and with yesterday’s acquisition news – they’ll also be entering into nutrition bars. The growth in their portfolio and product range has been pretty explosive, especially in the last year where they went from 38 total products and 17 total new innovations in 2020 to 73 total products and 35 total new innovations in 2021 (thus far) [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb).  \n\nA key strength of Tattooed Chef and its USP is its vertically integrated operations that enable it to create a strategic advantage, through vertical integration they have control of ingredients and prioritization of product, the ability to go from innovation to market in as little as 3 months with experience in manufacturing, distribution, supply chain. As of their past IR deck presentation they highlighted four manufacturing facilities and capacity available to achieve $500+ million in revenue. This will be increasing to five with Belmont’s acquisition and likely higher revenue potential.\n\nIn September 2021, key highlights included 52% year on year growth in revenue from $67.9 million in the first half of 2020 to $103.4 million in the first half of 2021, 82% year on year growth in the established brand from $38.0 million in the first half of 2020 to $69.1 million in the first half of 2021 **with no investment in marketing and brand until 2021**, strong resources with ~$140 million cash balance, 275k square feet of manufacturing capacity to quadruple in 2021 and opportunity for strategic M&A (closed 2 key acquisitions in 2021), and growth in sales and marketing including launching the first national media campaign, tripling of branded store count and creation of 35 new product in 2021 [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). Despite the initial lack of marketing – testimonials such as President and CEO Salvatore Galletti stating that ‘Target said it was the most successful frozen food launch in the history of Target’ during the Q1 2021 earnings call show how popular the products are – even with minimal marketing.\n\nThe expansion in national distribution has been remarkable, with growth from 1,614 stores in 2019 to 4,272 in 2020 i.e., ~165% increase. The goal in 2021 was to reach 10,000 total stores, with 8,355 already achieved in the 1H of 2021 – by the 3Q 2021 it’s expected that national distribution will have expanded to over 12,000 stores which would be a ~180% increase with the year not even being over. This was facilitated in part by the number of major retail customers that Tattooed Chef was able to onboard – in 2020 key customers included Walmart, Sam’s Club, Costco, Target, Trader Joe’s, and Aldi. In 2021 this list expanded with 20 additional key customers highlighted, including Kroger, Whole Foods, Albertsons Safeway, Harris Teeter, and Publix. In a study of mass retailers, 3 of the top 10 items including the #1 and #2 since launch in March 2021 of plant based frozen entrees belonged to Tattooed Chef, with dollar velocity over 60% above the nearest top 10 competitor [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb).   \n\nMarketing and branding only really became a component of Tattooed Chef’s outreach in 2021, which makes their success thus far even more impressive in my opinion. The goal is to reach 80% of all Plant Based Intenders (78 million customers) through the national media campaign. I would really recommend taking a look at the IR presentation which has been linked here in several other places to understand more about how Tattooed Chef describes the plant-based intender and the wide cross section of society from which they come – urban dwellers, parents, under 35 year olds, people who want to eat less meat, aspiring & practicing vegetarians/vegans, pescatarians & flexitarians – there’s something for everybody in Tattooed Chef’s product portfolio and they’ve segmented their target audience pretty well. The campaign is running through 10,000+ TV spots plus targeted digital video and streaming – one every 15 minutes, and 24 top tier networks plus Hulu and Programmatic Connected TV/Streaming. As of August 3, 2021, brand awareness grew from 6% to 15% [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nThe Company has stable leadership and has been family run, while also adding experienced folks from the industry to the management team. This includes Sam Galletti – the CEO and President with 35 years of experience in the food industry having served in both operational and investor roles within seafood, breaded vegetables, salsas and dips, grilled chicken, and organic foods companies. Sarah Galletti – the Tattooed Chef & Chief Creative Officer who was the creator of the “Tattooed Chef,” joined the Company in 2014 and spearheaded shift to plant based and has experience as a former chef in Italy. Stephanie Dieckmann – Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer who joined Tattooed Chef in 2017 and has over 12 years of experience in the food industry, also being the former CFO of APPA Fine Foods. Matt Williams – Chief Growth Officer who joined Tattooed Chef July 2020, has over 25 years’ experience in CPG including roles at Dean Foods, Coca Cola and PepsiCo [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\n**Part 3 – Recent Updates**\n\nYesterday on 10/27, Tattooed Chef entered into an agreement to acquire Belmont Confections, a private label co-manufacturer of nutrition bars, for approximately $18 million in cash and stock. The transaction has been unanimously approved by Tattooed Chef’s Board of Directors and the acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021. The transaction allows Tattooed Chef to further diversify its product offerings and enter into the $10 billion global plant-based bar category. At full capacity, Tattooed Chef believes the Belmont facility can contribute over $100 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-acquire-belmont-confections-120000434.html), for a reference point – TTCF currently expects 2021 revenue to be $235 million to $242 million so having just under half of that come from Belmont alone in a couple of years in a new market segment is a pretty big deal.\n\nEarlier this month on 10/4, Tattooed Chef announced six of its entrée bowls are available in approximately 1,200 Publix Super Markets (“Publix”) stores as of October 1, 2021. Sam Galletti, President and CEO of Tattooed Chef, added that with the addition of Publix, Tattooed Chef products are now in more than 13,000 stores nationwide including Kroger, multiple divisions of Albertsons, Sprouts Farmers Market, Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam’s Club [link]( [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-now-available-publix-120000419.html).\n\nOn August 10th, Tattooed Chef announced it has launched four entrée bowls including two new flavors at Sprouts Farmers Market in approximately 340 stores [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-launches-innovation-items-120000798.html). \n\nIn July, Tattooed Chef announced that it expects to launch its branded products across multiple categories in approximately 1,800 Kroger stores nationwide later this summer. By September, shoppers can find a variety of Tattooed Chef’s plant-based offerings including pizzas, entrée bowls, and vegetables in nearly every Kroger. A total of 12 SKU’s will be rolled out nationally [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-launch-kroger-stores-120000706.html). \n\nOn May 18th, Tattooed Chef completed the acquisition of New Mexico Food Distributors, Inc. and Karsten Tortilla Factory, LLC (collectively referred to as “Foods of New Mexico”) for approximately $37.0 million in cash [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-completes-acquisition-mexico-100000887.html). The acquisition of Foods of New Mexico allows Tattooed Chef to expand further into the $20 billion Hispanic/Southwest Food sector and beyond, including frozen, refrigerated, and ambient products. Utilizing these new capabilities, the Company expects to launch Tattooed Chef branded products in additional categories. Foods of New Mexico’s two facilities total 118,000 square feet and\nprovides Tattooed Chef additional capacity to continue to innovate [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb) and is expected to contribute $200m to annual revenues in the next two to three years [link](https://www.just-food.com/news/plant-based-firm-tattooed-chef-to-acquire-foods-of-new-mexico/). \n\nSo in the span of 5 months, some of the highlights of Tattooed Chef include completing an acquisition that doubled the number of manufacturing spaces it had (from just Italy and California to adding Foods of New Mexico, Albuquerque and Foods of New Mexico, Karsten), agreeing on another acquisition that will enable it to enter a new market segment and have another production facility (both of these acquisitions are expected to contribute a combined $300m to revenues in two-three years – more than the expected full year revenue of the Company this year), launching into two major nationwide chains and continuing to innovate and launch new products – whatever knock anyone may have on them you can’t deny that they’re moving pretty quickly to lock in sources of major revenue growth. \n\n**Part 4 – Financials and Valuation**\n\nRevenue – Revenue for the first half of 2021 was $103.4 million, an increase of 52.2% from $67.9 million in the first half of 2021. The increase in revenue was primarily due to growth in sales of “Tattooed Chef” branded products. [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_003). For the full 2021-year, Tattooed Chef expects revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58% to 63% compared to 2020. This guidance implies 49% year-over-year growth on the base business to $222 million, and a $13 million to $20 million contribution from one of the two facilities included in the Foods of New Mexico acquisition [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results). Tattooed Chef is expecting to reach revenue of $1 billion in 2026, so increasing by 5x over the next five years [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-this-food-company-growth-stock-plans-to-generate-%241-billion-in-revenue-2021-02-07), with the expected contributions from two key acquisitions this year – they could reach that number even earlier than 2026.  The Company expects Foods of New Mexico to contribute up to $200 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-enters-agreements-acquire-new-mexico-food), and the Belmont Confections facility to contribute over $100 million annually in revenue in the next two to three years [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tattooed-chef-acquire-belmont-confections-120000434.html). If we do some pretty rough (by pretty rough literally don’t take this as any kind of in-depth analysis – just guesstimating) back of the envelope math and assume conservatively that both acquisitions begin contributing these numbers in 2024, and assume $240 million for the Company in revenue for this year with a slightly lower year on year growth rate of 50% just to make it easier for numbers’ sake, that would mean $360 million in 2022 (excluding acquisitions), $540 million in 2023 (excluding acquisitions), and $810 million in 2024 (excluding acquisitions). Add in the expected $300m the that Foods of New Mexico and Belmont would be expected to contribute by then and you blow past the $1 billion number a couple of years early (this is assuming of course that operational capacity can sustain these numbers – the Company currently is quadrupling capacity in 2021) [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nGross Profit – Gross Profit was $13.9 million in the first half of 2021, compared to $13.0 million in 2020 – while this was an increase in absolute terms, the Gross Profit Margin declined from 19.1% in 2020 to 13.4% in 2021 thus far. This was primarily due to expenditure on infrastructure to support current and expected growth in operations and increased raw materials, packaging, freight and container costs due to inflation [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). The Company has forecasted improving gross profit margins for the full year 2021 in the range of 16% to 22% [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results), due to leverage of fixed costs on higher volume, benefit of new equipment to enhance operating efficiencies, and the product and channel mix [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb). \n\nAdjusted EBITDA – Adjusted EBITDA was ($9.2) million in the first half of 2021, as compared to $9.0 million in the first half of 2020. This was primarily due to public company accounting costs that were not present during the 2020 period, as well as significant increases in promotional expenses, marketing expenses, professional services, and freight and container costs [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/static-files/b80402bd-23e6-44f9-8126-ac02e6703afb), this is forecasted to be ($14) to ($17) million for the full year 2021 so still decreasing in subsequent quarters, but at a lower rate, as the Company is committed to an aggressive plan of growing its brand through extensive marketing and promotional spending that has already produced significant revenue growth in both grocery and mass retail [link](https://ir.tattooedchef.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tattooed-chef-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results). \n\nMarket cap of TTCF [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF) is $1.5 billion, in comparison to ‘competitors’ such as Beyond Meat who have a market cap of ~$6 billion [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BYND/). Quotation’s emphasis because TTCF is competing in a broader range of segments so they’re not exactly direct comps but one of the closer ones we’d be able to look at here. Beyond has cash on hand of $1 billion compared to the $140 million that Tattooed Chef had in the last quarter, and also has ~2.5x the revenue with $257.59 million compared to $103.4m for Tattooed Chef, however the revenue growth was only 22.4% for Beyond so ~2.5x less than the 52.2% for Tattooed Chef, with Beyond incurring significant losses as well so as a growth story I would really think that TTCF is valued at magnitudes less than it should be. \n\nThe analyst consensus for TTCF is a buy with an average price target of $23.50 so a 32.17% upside from current prices [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TTCF/price-target/), compared to BYND which has a consensus hold and an average price target of $112.24 so a 18.93% upside from current prices [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/BYND/price-target/), with a P/S of 10.22 for TTCF [link](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-TTCF/financials-statistics-and-ratios/price-sales/) compared to 13.25 for BYND[link](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-BYND/financials-statistics-and-ratios/price-sales/), it would also seem like the more attractive investment with higher upside.   \n\n**Part 5 – Bear Case**\n\nWell the most obvious risk would be that the Company’s not profitable - as a growth story, it has a higher focus on revenue growth than profitability and my interpretation is that achieving higher revenue is the primary concern over the next couple of years, meaning that there is going to be cash burn in the short-term and I wouldn’t expect them to become profitable till probably around mid-2023. The one-off valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $47.22 million skewed numbers a bit for this year, but if they were to continue making similar amounts of losses (excluding the one-off) so in effect  ~$15 million in the first half of 2021 and doubling that to ~30 million for the full year, they would probably have enough cash to last 3 years – this is of course a very, very crude estimation as losses would not stay the same in absolute terms, the Company has estimated it’s gross profit margin would improve and they could become profitable within a couple of years as well and keep themselves in the running for longer.\n\nFrom what I understand, the Company is also authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and currently have 81,938,668 shares issued and outstanding, meaning if it seemed like there was going to be a cash crunch, they already have the authorization for a potential dilution which would be a point of concern for any equity holder. I doubt they would need to call on this at least for a year or two and potentially not at all if they turn profitable soon but you can never be certain so worth keeping in mind [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_003).   \n\nAnother risk would be the promotional/marketing/professional service expenses which seem to have the biggest percentage increases since 2020, as the company continues to build brand awareness and expand its distribution points and stores, marketing expenses especially would be likely to continue to rise. The Company has said that ‘We expect overall operating expenses to decrease over time as a percentage of revenue as many relatively fixed operating expenses will be spread over increasing revenue, but expect freight and container costs to remain high (relative to historical) as a percentage of revenue for the foreseeable future,’ [link](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1741231/000121390021042632/f10q0621_tattooed.htm#a_007). The latter sentence about freight and container costs is concerning to me because in my opinion that’s one of the types of costs that a Company doesn’t have too much choice over e.g. if someone is selling you raw material and it becomes too expensive it’s within your control (hopefully if the product isn’t too niche) to switch to another supplier, but here with shipping costs companies are less likely to have that sort of leverage and would probably end up just having to absorb the cost, especially in this case where Tattooed Chef has a production facility in Italy – not something that I would expect to remain constantly high in the long-run but with current supply chain constraints it’s worth keeping an eye on.\n\nFinally, this is more of a mixed bag of bull and bear, as we’ve seen earlier – the current opportunity market for Tattooed Chef’s diverse range of products is massive and while having a wide variety of products is great as a buffer in the event one particular segment faces issues e.g. as we’re seeing now with Beyond [link](https://www.reuters.com/business/beyond-meat-forecasts-disappointing-revenue-pandemic-uncertainty-2021-08-05/), there is a risk that increasing competition in this market – especially by firms leveraging economies of scale by operating in just one particular segment, could pressurize margins (although since Tattooed Chef is vertically integrated, it should be more resilient in this regard than competitors that aren’t).\n\n**Part 6 – Short Interest**\n\nHigh short interest pumps are now everywhere – like cheese in a mousetrap with half-baked numbers that just act as clickbait or a cause for people to fomo in. Nevertheless, being aware of short interest as a concept and having the numbers is a useful data point to have – though I would urge anyone reading this not to just look at SI numbers when making an ‘investing’ decision. Broken clocks are right twice a day and there are undoubtedly companies for which there is a good justification for folks to be doubling down on shorting them. [Let’s take a look at TTCF’s short interest numbers using the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/). \n\n* Short Interest – 15.5 million shares out of 82 million total shares outstanding. With insiders holding almost half the shares, that leads to short interest of 37.43% of free float [link](https://gyazo.com/c18de608d5efde59055092e26bd6c7a3), Additionally, with utilization of 98.56%, there’s very little left for shorts to borrow to depress the price further [link](https://gyazo.com/3b067c76c0cc8c9d268e3089c9b6c498).\n\n* Market Cap – $1.5 Billion so at the lower range of a midcap stock, would require a few hundred million for shorts to cover if they were the only ones trading on a given day so would require a good amount of capital to exit or to add further to their short position if they decide to double down. Insiders hold 45.03% of shares outstanding, while institutions hold 16.87% of shares outstanding (30.7% of the free float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTCF/holders?p=TTCF).  \n\n* Extremely Memeable – Can’t think of too many better causes to get behind than saving the planet by eating your vegetables – if only you’d listen to ma when you were a kid and ate some broccoli instead of meatloaf we wouldn’t be in this mess.\n\n* Low Liquidity – Average volume per yahoo finance is around 1.5m shares, with current volume around 20% lower than that so <5% of the free float. Any inflow will cause the share price to move pretty significantly, which would be exacerbated by the fact that the most recently reported days to cover was 13.49 [link](https://gyazo.com/817e2edb0eb27d294c414d19eed52f58) which means at the current volume shorts would need almost 3 weeks to cover their positions. Over the last quarter, it seems that institutions have been loading up on TTCF for cheap, with institutional inflows of $119M and only $6.57M sold [link](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TTCF/institutional-ownership/) so a net increase of ~95%.\n\n* Low Risk (IV) – Yep, current IV is 47.1% for 10/29 and 11/5 options so pretty cheap to load up on if you’re so inclined. A good resource to understand the mechanics of a gamma ramp can be found here in my opinion if that’s the sort of thing that interests you [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/prcdnr/why_you_suck_ass_at_gamma_squeezing_and_what_you/). \n\n**Part 7 – TL; DR**\n\nThe total global plant-based retail market size is expected to reach $162 billion in 2030, increasing by more than 500% from $29 billion in 2020. Key drivers that result in folks pursuing a plant-based diet are typically health, animal welfare and the environment. Tattooed Chef’s current market opportunity is worth $42 billion and consists of several frozen food categories including frozen appetizers & snacks, frozen breakfast foods, frozen entrees, frozen fruits & vegetables, and frozen plant-based meat alternatives.\n\nTattooed Chef is a leading plant-based food company offering a broad portfolio of innovative plant-based food products that taste great and are sustainably sourced with signature products include ready-to-cook bowls, zucchini spirals, riced cauliflower, acai and smoothie bowls, and cauliflower pizza crusts, which are available in the frozen food sections of leading national retail food stores across the United States. The Company’s product portfolio consists of entrees, breakfast, vegetables, pizza, meat alternatives, and with yesterday’s acquisition news – they’ll also be entering into nutrition bars. The growth in their portfolio and product range has been pretty explosive, especially in the last year where they went from 38 total products and 17 total new innovations in 2020 to 73 total products and 35 total new innovations in 2021.\n\nA key strength of Tattooed Chef and its USP is its vertically integrated operations that enable it to create a strategic advantage with control of ingredients and prioritization of product, the ability to go from innovation to market in as little as 3 months and soon to be 5 manufacturing facilities. Key highlights included 52% year on year growth in revenue from H1 2020 to H1 2021, 82% year on year growth in the established brand from H1 2020 to H1 2021**with no investment in marketing and brand until 2021**, strong resources with ~$140 million cash balance, 275k square feet of manufacturing capacity to quadruple in 2021 and opportunity for strategic M&A (closed 2 key acquisitions in 2021), and growth in sales and marketing including launching the first national media campaign, and tripling of branded store count with key customers including Walmart, Sam’s Club, Costco, Target, Trader Joe’s, Aldi, Kroger, Whole Foods, Albertsons Safeway, Harris Teeter, and Publix. In a study of mass retailers, 3 of the top 10 items including the #1 and #2 since launch in March 2021 of plant based frozen entrees belonged to Tattooed Chef, with dollar velocity over 60% above the nearest top 10 competitor.\n\nRevenue for the first half of 2021 was $103.4 million, an increase of 52.2% from $67.9 million in the first half of 2021. For the full 2021-year, Tattooed Chef expects revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58% to 63% compared to 2020. Tattooed Chef is expecting to reach revenue of $1 billion in 2026, so increasing by 5x over the next five years, with the expected contributions from two key acquisitions this year – they could reach that number even earlier than 2026. Gross Profit was $13.9 million in the first half of 2021, compared to $13.0 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA was ($9.2) million in the first half of 2021, as compared to $9.0 million in the first half of 2020. \n \nMarket cap of TTCF is $1.5 billion, in comparison to ‘competitors’ such as Beyond Meat who have a market cap of ~$6 billion. The analyst consensus for TTCF is a buy with an average price target of $23.50 so a 32.17% upside from current prices, compared to BYND which has a consensus hold and an average price target of $112.24 so a 18.93% upside from current prices, with a P/S of 10.22 for TTCF compared to 13.25 for BYND, it would also seem like the more attractive investment with higher upside.   \n\nRisks include the Company not being currently profitable due to an immediate focus on the top-line, potential for dilution as the Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and currently have 81,938,668 shares issued and outstanding, likelihood of increasing marketing expenses even though the Company has an expectation of a decrease in OPEX as a percentage of revenue. \n\nTattooed Chef passes the SMELL test for with high SI if the conditions are right, as short interest is 37.43% of free float with utilization of 98.56%, market cap is at the lower range of a midcap stock so capital required to cover is not insignificant in the event of shorts wanting to exit or doubling down on their positions, meme-ability is high, liquidity is low with around 1.5m shares traded on average and 13.49 days to cover, and low risk as IV is sub 50% for the next couple of weeks of options in the run-up to earnings.\n\nAppreciate y’all for reading this if you made it this far. I’m playing the runup to earnings because the stock has barely moved with yesterday’s acquisition news and I believe there’ll be some short covering going on in the meantime over the next couple of weeks in expectation of a growth beat as certain milestones that could impact that have already been surpassed e.g. the target of 12,000 stores by Q3 2021 was already announced as over 13,000 in the 10/4 press release. If it does end up picking up in the short-term, I’ll be looking to roll the gains into leaps post-earnings.

It is garbage, stop shilling it.\n\nPlease see my post from June 15th, in response to a very similar shill.\n\n\\----\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nThere are too many players in this market doing too much better. And they have actual IP to back them up. Beyond Meat and Impossible are vastly superior.\n\nHere is a telling quote from TTCF's S-1:\n\n\"As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have any issued patents and have forgone pursuing any patent applications. As a result, we cannot rely on any protection provided under applicable patent laws\"\n\nThat is a huge problem. The reason that Beyond Meat and Impossible are valuable is because they can create products that no one else is allowed to create. For Impossible, their compound that uses iron ions and heme to create a bloody/meaty taste blows the competition out of the water. For Beyond, they have patents focused more on replicating a more satisfying texture. These cannot be replicated without either R&D on alternatives, or by infringing a patent.\n\nBut TTCF has no degree of protection. Cauliflower Pizza is not new. It is very gay, but not very new. The same can be said of the entirety of their portfolio of products. It's all commodity food-stuffs that any competitor can do better.\n\nThe demand for Cauliflower Wings is not that fucking high. However, the demand for something that tastes like an actual burger, without the use of beef, is extraordinarily high.\n\nThat is the difference. I do not recommend shorting it. But it seems like it is not worthwhile to allocate funds on this.\n\n----\n\nReply to another shill: \n\nThe biggest issue with this is that it does not expand the market. I am a devout carnivore and have a very negative view of vegans. I still tried Beyond Beef and the Impossible Burger out of curiosity. I ended up getting both again when I got bored of a standard chicken, pork, beef, lamb rotation.\n\nI would not consider any of this company's products because they are: 1) Not novel 2) have terrible vegan flavor profiles 3) overpriced. Vegan food is super cheap and requires little prep.\n\nAll of TTCF's products already have rivals in the market:\n\nCauliflower Mac & Cheese - Amy's, Lavo, Trader Joes\n\nCauliflower Crust Pizza - Newman's Own, Nature's Promise, Caulipower\n\nAcai Bowl - Like, millions of competitors.\n\nThere is simply no moat. So, they need to win on scale. Against people who already have that in spades.\n\nOut of all the things in the market right now, betting on yet another vegan food company with cheesy hipster branding is not what I would be doing.
