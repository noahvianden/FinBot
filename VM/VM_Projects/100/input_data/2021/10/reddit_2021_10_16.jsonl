{"title": "Why Polestar and not Rivian might be the best investment in EVs this year", "selftext": "Polestar which is a swedish electric vehicle company that has ACTUAL REVENUE from vehicle sales worldwide is going public! They have delivered well over 20,000 vehicles so far, and they are projected to have a revenue of $1.6B this year.\n\nHere you can see some sales data from Europe, not included are the sales in China and North America:\n\n[https://www.polestar-forum.com/threads/polestar-european-sales.573/page-10](https://www.polestar-forum.com/threads/polestar-european-sales.573/page-10)\n\nThe table shows the numbers in million SEK, **Polestar did $636 million USD in revenue in 2020 which is slated to grow by 151% in 2021 to $1.6B:** [**https://imgur.com/PpSpkrX**](https://imgur.com/PpSpkrX)\n\nThat’s BEFORE the release of the Polestar 3, their new SUV which will be made in the USA in Ridgeville, NC, as well as their 4th model which is the Polestar Precept. It is a full-size electric sedan comparable to an S-Class or the Lucid Air in size.\n\n**Sales Channel:**\n\nPolestar has more traffic than Rivian and Lucid Motors combined: [https://imgur.com/NUYjdQS](https://imgur.com/NUYjdQS) The Source of this data is Similarweb.com. Given the fact that all 3 use their website as the main sales channel this is a pretty significant finding. Polestar also has more Google searches than Rivian or Lucid Motors: [Google Data](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?hl=de&tz=-120&date=today+3-m&hl=de&q=%2Fg%2F11c20cdcdf,Polestar,Rivian&tz=-120&sni=3)\n\n**Why is GGP\\*I trading at $10.02 if it is as great as you claim?**\n\nGGP\\*I is a SP\\*C, which means when it went public it was just a trust-account full of money. These kinds of IPOs are bought by arbitrage funds, that receive a share of a warrant for each unit they buy. Before GGP\\*I announced to merge with Polestar nearly 100% of its float was owned by these arb funds. They sell the shares at $10.xx because their aim is to make a few % return and hop into the next IPO. So in the last couple days these funds unloaded about 65M shares on buyers who want to hold because of Polestar. You can easily imagine how such a big supply willing to be sold at $10.xx will keep the price down. I am estimating we are about 15M shares or 5-6 trading days away from these funds having sold out. And since most buyers until then have a cost basis at $10.xx they won't sell for a few percent in profit.\n\n**Upside:**\n\nI am pretty sure you guys know that LCID is trading at $44B and Rivian is looking to IPO at $80B this year. Together they have delivered 0 vehicles to their customers, Polestar is going public at $20B at $10 per share. You can do your own math but I am pretty confident a 50% upside or $30B marketcap are realistic for this company.\n\nI was an investor in LCID and now I am in Polestar. Both companies offer exceptionally great returns IMO but at $10.02 and 20B market-cap Polestar seems to be a lot cheaper at the moment.

{"title": "Why simple Dollar Cost Averaging still the king of all investment strategies? - Analyzing 3 decades of market data to find best DCA Strategy", "selftext": "By now we have all heard the virtues of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and that you should never try to time the market. Basically, it has been repeated ad nauseam that\n\n>Time in the market beats timing the market\n\nBut what is interesting is that I could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollar-cost averaging.\n\n**Theoretically, there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hard-earned money once a month into SPY, right?**\n\nSo in this week’s analysis, we will explore various methods to do DCA and see which one would end up giving you the best returns!\n\n___ \n\n**Analysis**\n\nGiven that dollar-cost averaging is about holding investments long-term, we need data, lots and lots of data! For this, I have pulled the adjusted daily closing price & Shiller P/E ratio of SPY for the last 30 years \\[1\\].\n\nNow we have to devise different methods to do the Dollar-cost averaging that will maximize our long-term return. We will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles (all of them would be investing the same amount - $100 every month but following different strategies)\n\n**Average Joe:** Invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending (this would be our benchmark)\n\n**Cautious Charlie:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio \\[2\\] is lesser than the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold Treasury-Bills \\[3\\]\n\n**Balanced Barry:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio is within +20% \\[4\\] of the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold T-Bills\n\n**Analyst Alan:** Invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last all-time high, else will hold T-Bills \\[5\\].\n\nGiven that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment, I have considered the starting point to be 1st Jan 1994. So the analysis is based on someone who invested $100 every month since 1994. In all the above strategies, we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied. I.e, in the case of Cautious Charlie, he will keep on accumulating T-Bills every month if the PE ratio is not within his set limit. Once it’s below the limit, he will convert all the T-bills and invest them into SPY. \n\n___\n\n**Results**\n\nBased on the time period of our analysis, we would have invested a total amount of $33,400 till now.\n\n**Return Comparison - Different DCA Strategies** \n\n|**Investment Strategy**|**Portfolio** |**Investment Strategy**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Average Joe|$169,036|406%|\n|Analyst Alan - 1% drop|$168,129|403%|\n|Analyst Alan - 3% drop|$166,658|399%|\n|Balanced Barry|$162,150|385%|\n|Analyst Alan - 5% drop|$154,441|362%|\n|Analyst Alan - 10% drop|$146,392|388%|\n|Cautious Charlie|$139,696|318%|\n\n \n\nNo matter what strategy we use, the most amount of returns were made by the Average Joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending. A close second was Analyst Alan who accumulated money in T-Bills and only invested when the market dropped more than 1% from its all-time high.\n\nThe least amount of returns were generated by Cautious Charlie who only invested if the PE ratio was lesser than the last 5-year average (basically by trying to avoid over-valued rallies, he ended up missing on all the gains), followed by the Analyst Alan persona who waited for a 10% drop from ATH before investing.\n\n___\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThere are some limitations to the analysis.\n\na. Tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis. Both of these would adversely affect the overall returns\n\nb. Since I am only using the monthly data for the P/E ratio and my SPY investments (due to data constraints), a much more complicated strategy involving intra-month price changes might have a better chance of beating the market (at the same time making it more difficult to execute).\n\nc. While we have analyzed the trends using the last 30 years’ worth of SPY data, the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say 40, 50, or even 100 years.\n\n___ \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month. I also checked for various time frames \\[5,10, 20 years\\] and various endpoints \\[Just before the covid crash, after the crash, before J-Pow, etc.\\]. In none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average Joe in the total returns.\n\nSince this is an optimization problem, I am [sharing all the data and my analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JK4b-CYgvlSH-FqYvCBEve0RQ3ACmJNsmTwzLV7jqWs/edit?usp=sharing) in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive risk-adjusted market-beating returns.\n\n___ \n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance API and longtermtrends.net. While the P/E ratio was available for the last 130+ years, the daily closing of SPY was limited to 30 years.\n\n\\[2\\] We are using the Shiller PE ratio - this ratio divides the price of the S&P 500 index by the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the previous 10 years. This solves for the brief period in 2009 when the normal PE ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis.\n\n\\[3\\] We are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the T-Bonds\n\n\\[4\\] The 20% cut-off is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends\n\n\\[5\\] The idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from JP Morgan which stated that 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones", "id": "q9cys4", "created_utc": 1634394106.0, "score": 1444, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 169, "comments": [{"body": "How about Leveraged Larry who borrows an amount equal to future contributions, invests that money now, and gradually pays down the loan with what would have been the future contributions (a la the Lifecycle Investing book)?", "score": 205, "replies": [{"body": "Whoa!

Look at is this way: If you could go to the bank and borrow $100k at 5% and they had $100k bonds you could buy that were paying 10%, you'd be earning $10k per year at a cost of $5k per year = net result = $5k profit; it would be silly not to do it.

Don't ask them.\n\nThen the same stock that suffered correction and didn't recovery suffers a second improbable correction, and again, another even more improbable lack of recovery, so fictional Bob can buy more.  \n\nThis happens multiple times, defying all probabilities.

Did it drop 75% to allow Bob to buy all them cheap shares?  Surely a 75% upside rally will solve everything.  No?  It now needs a 400% rally to work, the kind that are just sooooo common.\n\nDue to calculus, that's the only curve shape in which DCA would outperform other common strategies.  It essentially requires someone to make a terrible original stock choice, then continue making bad choices through statistically impossible crash after crash, just so they can acquire lots of shares in a company that then has a near miraculous recovery.

So buying or selling a stock option can be seen as asking someone with a lot of capital to simulate a certain trading strategy for you.\n\nThe total delta value of your position is equivalent to the # of shares you currently hold (or are short if your delta value is negative).  If you own 10 shares of the stock, your delta value is 10.  If the share price changes and a month passes, your delta value is still 10.  For options, on the other hand, your delta value will actually change as (1) time passes, and (2) the share price moves.  That’s essentially because there is an algorithm buying and selling shares on your behalf as the share price changes and time passes.\n\nAs the share price moves, your delta value could increase or decrease (depending on your position).  As people mention, if you hold a deep OTM call option (meaning that the strike price is >> the current share price), then it will have a delta value substantially less than 100.  But as the share price approaches the strike price, the delta value will increase; someone is buying shares on your behalf.

The current turmoil in the Chinese real estate market will be a key test as to how far the CCP is willing to let major firms bleed before riding to the rescue. Keep in mind that the state has said that there are too many Chinese EV vehicle makers and so consolidation will occur. Nio presently does not have its own factory and claims it will have one running in 2022 despite the supply and energy issues that have occurred starting late August and have continued through September. The 10k delivery number was interesting (we shall see if supply chain/energy issues affect q4 production, if they don't my fuckery afoot radar will be going off) and I am unsure how they plan to compete price-wise in the European markets in the near term given they have no factory plans for the continent. They have to ship their cars to that market. \n\nDividends can be great if the firm is already the big boy in the sector and has no real competition. You cannot acquire a competitor because either the SEC will not allow a merger or they won't sell. What do you do with the capital that is big enough to acquire a competitor but too small to expand the business into a new sector? Is an oil company going to do a 180 and start the next Tik Tok?\n\nTesla will probably never pay a dividend much like Amazon never will. They would rather, as you pointed out, increase shareholder value through acquisitions and appreciation of stock value and R/D new products. Tech heavy-driven firms that offer services direct to consumers have a lot of room to acquire new firms and expand their business outward. This will occur until these firms are stopped by the SEC from merging and antimonopoly laws are used on them. Then dividends might be on board but that is at least 5 years from now. \n\nLastly, Nio's share structure is sketch imo because it is an organ of Nio Capital and not its own stand-alone firm. Putting aside Cayman island ADR issues my major concern is they've been using capital raised from selling shares to buy out unnamed equity stakeholders. Goldman's 60 dollar price target is not conflicted as well and not credible because of a major conflict of interest as they are one of several street (Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse) banks acting as market makers to sell their stock offerings.
