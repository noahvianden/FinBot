{"title": "I made $500,000 trading stocks and options in 18 months. These are the 15 things I did that worked best.", "selftext": "I failed a lot while trading before, during, and after succeeding. I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. \n\nThese are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.\n\n**Understand the Trading Environment**\n\nOne mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.\n\n**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. \n\nIn between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).\n\nI try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. \n\n**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**\n\nThe sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it’s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.\n\nLast year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt. \n\nLast year you couldn’t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. \n\nOne of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.\n\n**Make The VIX Your Friend**\n\nThe VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It’s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. \n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don’t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I’ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. \n\n**Selecting Trades & Investments**\n\n**Have an Allocation Plan**\n\nThe first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:\n\n* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.\n* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It’s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.\n* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.\n* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. \n* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It’s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I’ll let you know in 10 years if it works.\n* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  \n* 1% in other things I can’t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.\n\n**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**\n\nUnless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. \n\nI’ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. \n\nMy favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack’s VGM measures a stock’s value, growth rate, and momentum. It’s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what’s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. \n\nThe list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.\n\nA friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don’t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there’s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it’s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   \nI use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn’t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it’s because there’s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven’t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they’d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn’t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.\n\nI use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.\n\nFidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.\n\n**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**\n\nIf you’ve invested actively for a while, you’ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. \n\nI’ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What’s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. “Goldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode”), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. \n\nI am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.\n\n**Good Things Come in Pairs**\n\nJust about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I’ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it’s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. \n\nSimilarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it’s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.\n\n**Exercise Financial Discipline**\n\nEven when I’ve been successful picking investments, I’ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We’ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That’s usually the moment I’ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:\n\n1. Take Profits Often.   \nWhen an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  \nIf you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  \n\n2. Fail Fast.   \nIf the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  \n\n3. Profit Both Ways.   \nIf a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \\~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa.  \n\n4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   \nI have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  \nOn the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money.  \n\n5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   \nThis is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn’t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   \nSo if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there’s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.", "id": "qi92fg", "created_utc": 1635500383.0, "score": 7899, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 716, "comments": [{"body": "And you started with? 600k?", "score": 2675, "replies": [{"body": "OP: \"Inherited $1 million start of the year and now I have $500k... #winning\"", "score": 1858, "replies": [{"body": "I know a guy that can turn that into fifteen bucks", "score": 59, "replies": []}, {"body": "did you invest in wish? if so i know the pain", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "Do you believe in wish?

I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, \n\nWhat is your starting point. How much did you compound in the last 3 years (CAGR) what is you maximum downturm? \n\n\n\n>Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market.\n\nIf you have ever been in a bear market, you know that good earning reports can spiral down stocks. \n\n\n>In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back. It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).\n\nThis is plain wrong. The market fluctuations and volume between earnings is not higher than those during earnings. If you look at individual stocks volume actually often increases or decreases around the earnings date (of course it does). Professional Asset managers also don't rebalance their portfolios depending on when earnings hit, but often at the end of the quarter or after digesting the latest earnings report (that is why the biggest stock moves are often around earnings). \n\n>I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season.\n\nGood luck with that in the future. Nobody can anticipate when they are coming. \n\nTake Advantage of Sector Rotations\n\n>The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. \n\nThat is just not true. If you look at sector rotations, these can often take years to play out. Oil was in a decade long bear market. How can you easily predict the turning point? Professional investors also often sell off sectors that have performed poorly and buy overperforming sectors (oil in favor of tech for example in 2019). \n\n\n\n>Last year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt.\n\nThis is just wrong. Look at oil, gold miners etc.... it might be, but it might not. \n\n\n>One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.\n\nThat strategy works in a bull market until it doesn't. Tread carefully this is quite risky. \n\n\n\n\n>My favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. \n\nThose tools are available to everyone and will not guranteee outperformance. \n\n\n>Be Wary of Analyst Opinions\n\nAgree\n\nEDIT: Also you risk/reward ratio is mathematically not good.

There's very little derivatives exposure because most Evergrande debt is owned by Chinese state banks which are not allowed to use CDO derivatives, so this can't infect the international banking system on the scale of 2008.\n\nIt's the China supply chain issues which impact the West more, but those have to do with the energy and shipping crisis and are likely to subside by Spring.\n\nUsually the crisis comes from the unknown unknowns and I see much more risk in the US right now because literally everything is in a bubble due to the massive Fed and government stimulus since March 2020. When things are priced for perfection they can go down on the slightest of bad news.\n\nCommodity prices went down due to the reduction in construction activity in China, which is good for the US economy since the US is a net commodity importer.

But, we have been in a roaring bull market ever since the Covid crash of March 2020, so a LOT of people have made some impressive gains during this time, by simply going long SPY or QQQ options or 3x ETFs after pullbacks and selling into overbought rallies. You do a LOT of work - seems like it's your full time job. Most traders or investors have other things going in their life - so they only have so much time to spare for trading. Just being realistic. In my experience, keeping things simple and being very careful about your leverage are keys to long term success in the market. When traders watch too many things they can get lost in a maze of over choice and conflicting signals, indicators, advice.  Also, one can make a lot of money fast trading options and lose all of that money even faster in a series of bad trades. Leverage can be a wonderful thing and a horrible thing. There is an old Wall Street saying that goes \"don't confuse brains for a bull market.\" There are many economic indicators that are suggesting a possible end to the current bull market - so you will have to adjust accordingly, or, we will see another post here that you lost $500,000.

It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.\n>If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.\n\nHave you factored in the tax ramifications of doing this?  While i appreciate the idea of locking in gains (Allianz actually has an annuity which lets you lock in gains on a market linked strategy) there is a reason that professional trades don't do this.

Generally speaking, Id recommend you keep a high flyer unless you know its a silly mime stock or something that wont do well long term.  \n\nI do sometimes buy stuff that I intend to trade from the onset. For example, airlines during the crash were the easiest doubles ever. Just too obvious after it was clear both parties would bail them out. As soon as they returned to old levels I got out. You might say that options would have been better in that case but the problem is I had no idea when the correction would happen.

Mainly, there will ALWAYS be something that out performs what you did. But did you buy it? Did you pour your resources into it and keep unwavering conviction throughout the process? Did you sell at the exact right time? This is all assuming you somehow found this coveted, mysterious out performing instrument. \"Hey! Shibu-shit-fuck coin returned 1000000%! Did you beat that? No? You suck!\"\n\nLet's talk about the intangibles. A simple SPY comparison falls light-years short of the full situation. OP is very profitable and even if he didn't outperform the SPY, he has given himself plenty of experience that he can build upon. What can he do in the next two years? The next five? The next decade? He can exponentially grow this skill to absolutely crush the SPY and 99% of retail investors (which he's already doing). \n\nOn top of all of this, OP is generously sharing his methods. Are they perfect? No. But maybe instead of immediately bashing success, you can actually listen to what he says and potentially set yourself up for a better future.

They have always made GPU's but they never focused on performance before. But they can most assuredly compete. They have the tech and manufacturing to do so. Further its not really a GPU that makes mining better, its simply the parallelism that was built into GPU's about 10 years ago. There is no reason why you cant build that into any regular CPU. In fact, it a lot more efficient to place that feature directly on the CPU. \n\nI wouldnt worry about Intel yet, but you do need keep an eye on them.

They get more processing with the same amount of electricity thus saving electricity costs.\n\nNVDA also enjoyed a COVID boost from people staying home but thats over now and PC sales are back to decaying.\n\nAlso note that the big crypto currencies have a mining cap. Which means that eventually the mining will be over. But there are obviously thousands of other \"coins\" to mine if you are so inclined.\n\nSo again, the question is do you believe in crypto mining or not. If you do, then NVDA will be fine.

It may never work properly and game devs are certainly not fanatical about the idea. But lets talk about that if you want. \n\nSteam gaming would be a disaster for Nvidia unless GeForce NOW succeeds. What do you think will happen if anyone nails stream gaming? GPU sales will plummet. This is why they are trying to hard to push GeForce NOW but it doesnt look good right now. I commend them for trying because if streaming does happen and they arent competitive then things will be worse for them but its not as easy as building it and expecting everyone to come. That wont happen. \n\nMind you I like their idea for streaming more than Googles but still, they are at a huge handicap without dev support which they definitely dont have. This is why Google tried to create their own studio (and failed lol). They will need to pay devs off for supporting their platform and/or start buying studios otherwise GFN is going to fail and they need to work fast because competition is everywhere already. It would be trivial for MSFT to do the same thing. There is nothing stopping Sony or Ninny from doing it. Steam can do it. Hell there are even small 3rd parties that offer the same services and I would look out for Amazon. They need to move fast.\n\nSo why is GFN so important and why would unit sales dive? Because you only need enough GPU's to handle peak usage which is never going to be 100%. Right now, everyone has to have a GPU per device they intend to game on. I have several if you look around my home. There is one in every console, and one in my laptop, one in my main PC, and my wife has a decent one in her PC and soon my 3 kids will need one. So all in all, at any one time, due to different platforms, I need up to 5 GPU's and thats likely to climb to 8 or more in a few more years. But in general, we dont all game at once. Its not like I can play on all the systems at once. So in reality our peak usage is only 2 (myself and the wife). So Nvidia has gone from selling me 5 GPU's to 2 and even that is probably not needed. Its probably closer to 1.4 or 1.5 per 2 people even less as they scale.\n\nSo what I am saying is needs to control the platform or this would be a bad thing for them because it competes directly with gaming platforms that they sell GPU's to. Similar to how Intel sells far less CPU's now than they did 10 years or 20 years ago. People simply dont need as many PC's any mores. Most are happy with just a phone. For Nvidia, if people are happy with just streaming, then kiss even more PC's goodbye and kiss powerful consoles goodbye too (they will still exist but be more like a Roky or Firestick).\n\nIts funny, but I think if 3DFX has survived till today, their business model would have probably won the streaming wars in the same way Apple managed to come back and win several markets by just surviving and waiting for the environment to be more friendly to their business model (being proprietary).

The entire cloud gaming market is like $60m in 2021 LoL. Adoption right now is practically 0%. There is no market. And mind you Nvidia's cloud business launched in 2015... The beta launched in 2013!\n\nSo in all that time, they still havent been able to garner significant interest in the tech. And what has changed since then? The problem has always been internet connections and they have not improved much since then and since then network traffic has skyrocketed offsetting any upgrades by ISP's. You can thank video streaming for that. But ultimately, Nvidia has no control over ISPs and network performance and thats the barrier to adoption.\n\nBut the even bigger issue is lack of dev support. They simply dont have it. Even if every ISP rolled out super fiber tomorrow, GFN still wont have the big games. Whoever has those games will win the streaming wars. It is what it is. So at some point, they will need to pay off the devs or buy studios.\n\nIm not writing off GFN completely. There is still some chance it might work but right now, its not looking good at all. The odds of success are very low... like maybe 1% odds. The reason for this is low barrier of entry given the companies involved. Steam would win this war instantly if the got in because devs are so dependent on them. There is no way they turn their backs on Steam even if they dont like their policies.

Console sales are actually down generation to generation for two generations straight now (PS3/4 era and way down from PS2 era). Take away mining and you back to pre-2019 levels for that segment.\n\nThe only other thing they have is server gpu but thats going to be multi year cyclical as well and its going to shrink quickly as all the companies jumping on the bandwagon realize that AI/ML is actually modern marketing hype and not really AI at all (not as defined prior to the 10 years ago). 99% of the time it does not provide useful new data. It just an insane capital costs with no practical benefit.\n\nSo why do it? For old companies, they fell for the promise of useful new data. Some idiot exec came in on their horse spreading fear and misininformation about how they might fall behind if they dont have some \"AI\" centric data processing. Corporate boards fell for it (aka FOMO). Most will realize very soon that A) the data is not new or useful, just the same old stuff presented differently, and B) you dont need a lot of horsepower to get said data thus whatever they need will simply move in house.\n\nFor new companies, its a buzzword to get investor money and they are hoping that it can churn out something useful later (though most already know it wont... they just dont care). Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but all AI/ML as defined today is actually exactly the same as old statistical analysis we did in the 90s and 2000s. None of it is new except maybe the addition of vision and mechanical sensor stuff. How many companies are actually developing 100% online robots that need cloud based processing? Those are the only ones who will need cloud based processing long term. Thats not to say there isnt useful scientific application to current ML but for most of those who actually do something useful with it, they will do it in house because cloud is both insanely expensive and slower for their purposes. This doesnt benefit Nvidia directly anyway.\n\nAI/ML is not going to be a long term cloud trend. Hence why I dont bring it up.

If it were legal I could \"buy\" an endless chain of houses using the value of the last as colateral on the next.  \nIt is considered by law that the private individual is **not** the owner of the <**value>** of the asset. If you have a mortgage  you know this  - er -  that's what all those papers are about you signed when you made the agreement with the bank (you need to read them and I guess you probably have? ).\n\nHowever, a bank, an IFI, a private financial institution, does not give out a loan in the form of \"a bag of fiat cash\", it simply adds **credit** to your account.  \nYou now owe the bank the loan plus the interest - that loan plus interest **is an asset** on the books of the  financial institution, and it **can** lend any part of that asset out, as it sees fit, today, as a loan to a second individual or institution.. It simply adds credit to the second account.  \nIt now has **two** accounts both 'owing' the bank and can justify both.

The leasing period and leasing fees are adjusted to ensure full amortisation of the leased item.

Or, $677.45 for the -50%. This leaves Tesla with room to run from its current position of $1,100 a 23% gain to the final breakeven point or, 54% to the final optional step.   \n\n\n**Worst Case:**   \nTesla runs up from my even price of $1,354.91 to $2,100 a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap. I'll take a half a million dollar loss which I can afford all day, any day. Won't kill me. (-50%).  \n\n\n✍️**Note:**  \nIf Tesla doubles from its current price, it will be worth more than Apple and Microsoft by $1 Trillion Dollars.  I strongly believe the ROI for new buyers is dramatically decreasing. In other words, the Greater Fool is running low/near the end. There is too much risk, too many emotions, and greed flowing around. Be fearful when others are greedy. In this case, ill profit from their beyond delusional greed. Or, Tesla is currently at peak levels and I don't even get to the next steps.

They point to profit per car, and ignore the fact that while impressive, the share of cars sold has to be maintained, and it’s shrinking. They point to battery and autopilot tech, but fail to explain who will buy either, when most of the big companies are just building their own.\n\nYes, it did have amazing numbers in September. It also sold a grand total of 12k cars the previous two months for all models combined. If it keeps selling month over month at that rate, that counts for….wait for it: 300k cars a year. Grats. All of europe. If it’s the number one car on the market across all of europe sustained for 12 straight months, it ads 50% to it’s global sales volume…and still doesn’t sell half the cars vw sells in the same region in that timeframe.\n\nVw pe? 10.\nTesla pe: 350.\n\nSo: tell me how they’ll justify their price by making up that 35x the revenue that vw does in emea alone? That would require them to be responsible for 1/2 the cars sold. In the world. It’s either that or they find some other way to reach that revenue by making their cars and services even more profitable.\n\nHell, if a tesla cost 0 dollars to make, and sells for 50k on average, they’d still need the majority of the car market to bring their stock price in line.\n\nAgain: great company. One of the best cars ever made when it released, full stop.\n\nI just now see valid alternatives, a shrinking share of the market, and no path to the forward profit margins to justify their stock price today.\n\nAnd again, I didn’t ignore you because you’re 100% right: emotions are making this stock moon, and that sentiment changes, it’s foolish to short it.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Also, it's inevitable for market share to shrink when more companies get into the EV market, that's simple economics.
