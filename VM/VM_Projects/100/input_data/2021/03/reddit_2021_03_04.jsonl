{"title": "No need to panic", "selftext": "Why is the market tanking in recent weeks?\n\nFirst, what it isn't: Treasury yields.  Don't listen to the news.  This just means that no one wants to buy bonds so the price of bonds is going down to attract new investors.  This happens in a healthy economy.  Can't believe the fake news is really pushing this.\n\nWhat I would see if this was anything other than a correction:\n\nConsumer cyclical and natural resource holdings would increase with major investment firms.  Positions in small cap stocks would decrease.  Real estate holdings would increase.\n\nHow I know these things aren't happening:\n\nIt's best to track these activities through major firms and ETFs.  I track SPY's holdings daily.  They have teams of analysts and resources I just don't have.  They're the first to know.  I do not watch the news for financial information.\n\nSo what is it?\n\nI see firms reorganizing portfolio's for a post-C19 market.  IE, aerospace and defense stocks are going up - Raytheon is up 12%/Boeing up 16% in the same time the Nasdaq was down 9%.  Travel stocks like JetBlue are also doing well in that time frame.\n\nWhen will it stop?\n\nWho knows, but it couldn't have been expected and it's too late to sell high and buy low now.  I'm waiting it out.  I have been increasing positions with remaining cash but I'm out going forward.\n\nWill tech rebound?\n\nYes.  New tech is where the money is.

So you won't sell many bonds with a low rate.  Thus, if bonds need to be sold, the rate goes up.  This is an indication that no one is buying them and the money is likely going to the market or being held as cash.   Thus, a yield from a bond is how much money you'll make based on the rate of return.  This is reflected in the Treasury Yield curve.  The  curve itself reacts faster with short-term bonds than long-term bonds.   If they cross, this can be a bad indication of rapid market changes.

Bond yields have risen quite quickly.  There is also concern about inflation picking up.  Those aren't bad things on their own - in fact they signal a healthy economy.  But they are bad for stocks, and certain stocks in particular.  There are two reasons.\n\n1) TINA.  Part of the reason why the bull market has been so strong for so long is because interest rates and bond yields have been rock bottom for a long time.  That means there is no other place to earn a return on your money than the stock market.  So investors have been piling money into the markets for years.  But now that bond yields are rising, suddenly there is an alternative.  As yields and interest rates rise, fixed income investments become more attractive.  So people pull money out of the markets to buy bonds and other fixed income securities.\n\n2) Higher interest rates and inflation are very bad for stocks that are valued based on future growth.  There are some other threads in the sub that explain why.  The bottom line is that stocks that are valued based on projected revenue growth but that aren't profitable now are the ones that suffer under a high interest rate and high inflation scenario.

{"title": "PSA: Buy and hold only works if the stock is actually good", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not predicting a crash or a correction, but am merely stating my opinion IF it does happen. \n\nThe premise of buying and holding is that you are buying companies with good fundamentals and poised for continued growth in future. I have seen a lot of people on many posts saying that ‚Äòthey have done they DD‚Äô which honestly is probably 30 mins on checking Reddit and Stocktwits for bullish sentiments instead of really downloading and reading the company‚Äôs financial records, future growth prospects etc. \n\nI think it is a good time to evaluate if your stock can handle a huge drop in price and still allows you to have conviction to keep holding. A lot of stocks are down 20-30%+ or more from their ATHs at this point, and if a crash or correction does happen (I believe NASDAQ is at or very near correction territory at about -10% from ATH), it‚Äôs going to see one crazy drop of -10-30% in a single day just like what happened in March. \n\nCan you handle it? If you can, the stock is a conviction pick for you. If not, perhaps consider buying something that you have truly done DD in. I have certain holdings that I believe to be dangerous when a correction or crash comes, like NIO, NET and JD (NET and JD have a growing consumer base and they will continue to grow, but at current market cap I deem it to be dangerous. NIO is super dangerous but it‚Äôs house money at this point since I got in at 15$ and sold more than half at 44$ long ago) But I got them at prices low enough to be able to withstand it even if they dropped more, they are a smaller % of my portfolio and I am willing to risk a loss for a more aggressive approach. \n\nI also have holdings which I will definitely add more if a crash does happen,like MWK and DIS. Tech is never going to be irrelevant after Covid, the transition to value stocks is temporary and it‚Äôs clear to me, so I am still ever so bullish on tech stocks and e-commerce. \n\nIt‚Äôs obvious no one can be unaffected when you see your NLV drop, and that much is the same for me. However, at the end of the day, if this stock is something viable for years, buy and hold works, if it was a one time hype, reconsider your approach. I never got into green energy stocks because they are either mostly unprofitable or have no working product. Climate change and all is real, but it takes a lot of time to get there. Oil is still going to be a huge deal for decades regardless and I am quite tired of people having done ‚ÄòDD‚Äô in some holdings that do not make any sense. \n\nPart of my holdings are aggressive,which makes it more volatile during a market correction. But ALL of my holdings are at least generating revenue and have a product that is being sold that I personally find to be indicative of what they are accomplish in future. I can never ever buy into a company that makes no revenue and I can only respect the balls of people who buys into such companies because they have strong belief that the company will be successful in that venture. If they buy at a point when the company is still in development, they definitely deserve a much better % in profits. I can never do that personally myself because I am not that ballsy.\n\nThe Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel is a GREAT book that was released last year and talks about handling your money in the stock market. Please read it if you can, great book, has definitely helped me to manage my emotions in the stock market. No one loves taking a beating everyday, but some things are worth holding on to. \n\nI was there during march and all my holdings took a minimally 27% (I remember this number specifically because I was counting numbers that day) dive in a single day, I never sold and we recovered. It is great to buy and hold, statistics and numbers shows that it beats timing the market, but if only works if the company isn‚Äôt some overhyped unicorn crap. Please stay safe everyone and I hope for this to turn positive soon like everyone does. Ultimately, you invest in consideration for your family (especially those married and with kids), so do not put money that you cannot afford to lose.

That means the huge majority of smart money is still holding and doesn't think there's a reason to panic. When smart money panics, you have the covid crash.\n\n\nSecondly, its important to understand why there is so much red recently. The main reason is the fear due to the rising 10 year old treasury yield.

The fear of massive interest rates are irrational, and as i said earlier, its only ~7% of people who are pulling out of nasdaq, that's a small number of people who's irrationally fearful. Feds have been under their target of 2% for a LONG time, they aren't concerned about this.\n\n\nAdditionally, Biden agreed to tighten the covid stimulus requirements. This is good news because it means its less likely to over heat the economy beyond control. And when that stimulus does get released, its hard to imagine it won't at least give a small boost to the markets.\n\n\n\nI also think we need to look at the bright side.

{"title": "Warren Buffet's stock strategy is more relevant now than ever.", "selftext": "Over the last couple of weeks, there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growth/tech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to \"re-opening\" or value plays. The key take away here has to be this:\n\nIf a 10% drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock, you should have never bought that stock in the first place.\n\nContrary to popular belief, stocks do not always go up. In fact, most stocks fail to beat the market in the long-term, with few exceptions. Buffet makes this clear. A good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year, or because it has shown growth in the past. It is only a good buy if it has value beyond a short-term horizon, and most importantly, IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT PRICE. If you had bought GE at its peak, a company that is invested in all aspects of life and won't ever disappear, you would be down nearly 75%. Why is this? Is GE a bad company, with bad products, or a shrinking customer base? No, you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable. \n\nThink of this scenario, you are the owner of a snack shop. Summer is coming up, so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream. After all, people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days, right? This can't possibly bad investment. So you go to your supplier, and he offers you a price of $100 per pint of ice-cream. What would you do? Would you buy just because ice-cream is guaranteed to sell in the future? No, not unless customers were willing to pay more than $100 per pint.\n\nConversely, your next-door competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate. This is ridiculous to you, who would buy hot chocolate in the summer? However, your neighbor buys in at $0.10 per cup of hot chocolate for his supply. Once summer is over, you sell out of your inventory, but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than $10 a pint. Then winter comes, and guess who profits more?\n\nThe point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one. If your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit, you did not believe in the price in the first place. If this scares you enough, you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise. There is nothing wrong with that, picking stocks is hard, and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top. \n\nMy two cents is this: lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd, and calling companies like Amazon and Microsoft \"growth\" stocks is disingenuous if you lump in Palantir and Tesla in that same category. The market right now is doing just that, however, in the sense that high-PE growth stocks like Tesla are dropping alongside with Apple. In my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount. \n\nKohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  Conversely, just because Tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a PE of 1000+ is a wise investment. Re-opening plays are just market chatter. Cruise lines have tremendous debt, banks are tied to risky-credit loans and government regulation, and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel. Just because they are outperforming now, does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the long-term.\n\nBuy into valuable companies (future growth, good price) at a discount, ignore short-term market sentiment, and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks.", "id": "lxo7om", "created_utc": 1614874457.0, "score": 2819, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 607, "comments": [{"body": "Warren buffets portfolio is a freighter.

I don't think being Warren Buffet is a viable investment strategy.  What works for Warren Buffet works for Warren Buffet because he has an insane information benefit on you and everyone else.

They made some mistakes over the years but with this giant information nexus they've consistently made better than average decisions.\n\nTake for example Pfizer.  You go anywhere else and people are raving about how this company is doing amazing and they had some bad research news in November but why sell in February?  Well, Warren Buffet had the inside edge.  His research time found that a large number of Pfizer patents are due to expire in June and they're selling to get ahead of the mad rush to dump the stock once it becomes unprofitable.\n\nYou couldn't make this decision unless you had a research team because there really aren't a lot of articles talking about Pfizer as a company's future (except for the ones telling you UNDERVALUED BUY BUY BUY!!!).  Pfizer might collapse from all of this and you might be left holding the bag for a long time before your investment pays out.  And Buffet could be totally wrong.  And maybe it is worth holding and it's real value is somewhere around $50/share.\n\nBut I'm not in an information position to make that kind of determination.  So when Pfizer spiked up, I sold.  And when it went back down, I bought.  I lost out on a dividend, but the sale was far more than the dividend payout.  I don't have to file my transactions with the SEC like Warren Buffet does, because I'm trading with $100K.... not $100B.

As an open community, WSB happily welcomes as many new people as we can get but I‚Äôm concerned about how that‚Äôs changed the dynamic of the subreddit. Before the rise of GME, WSB was a space where everyone was free to discuss various ideas, share DD and gains/loss porn, and post memes about ANY STOCK they liked or were interested in. Even when popular stocks like Tesla and Palantir came about, they never 100% CONSUMED the discussion diversity of the sub.\n\nNowadays, you come on the sub and literally ALL you see is content related to GME. I personally don‚Äôt mind all the GME banter, however, what I do mind is the fact that are tens of thousands of other stocks and opportunities yet many people on the sub act like GameStop is the only company that exists. Too many times have I seen a user on the sub post about some investment idea and get immediately shot down and called out for allegedly being a hedgie or shill trying to lift the focus off GME. \n\nAT THE END OF THE DAY THE GOAL OF INVESTING IS TO MAKE MONEY.

The underlying manager has the capacity to trade in bonds while you hold the same ETF, so its relative success versus the market depends on the activity of the manager. This depends on the riskiness and activity level of the Fund.

{"title": "DoorDash is going to CRATER next week", "selftext": "Just loaded up on $10k in puts from $115-135 3/12 on $DASH. Lockup period is expiring and the float will more than double.\n\nDoorDash‚Äôs strategy thus far has been to bleed money in order to come out as the market leader. This is not sustainable, especially after the pandemic, but people are buying the story inflating the stock. The industry faces serious regulatory headwinds and competition.\n\nAll of the insiders know this. Most of them got their equity for sub $5BB, so you KNOW they are itching to get out before the house of cards crumbles. Buy puts while they‚Äôre cheap!\n\ntl;dr $DASH to Earth's fucking core!!! #MagmaGang\n\n\\*Additional DD per comment request\n\n1. MULTIPLES: DoorDash is trading at a $50B market cap on $3B of revenue when Grubhub is trading at $5B on $2B of revenue. This makes NO sense and unjustifiable, but I will explain in point 2.\n2. SOFTBANK PUMP: \"But u/Mister_Twiggy look at their growth!!\" DoorDash is ridiculously high because it is a key investment of Softbank (also famed for it's investment in WeWork). Softbank's model is to pour money into companies and grow them at exponential rates, thus having \"economies of scale\" and elbowing out all competitors in winner-take-all markets. This would make sense in true natural monopolies, but food delivery is anything but. Softbank tells other investors that the growth is sustainable and once its companies reach the top, they will stay there. This growth is NOT sustainable. If anything, I think this growth has been deceptively negligent in order to boost their sales. What they're doing is effectively like Tesla selling cars for $15k in order to pump numbers, but hiding COGS is way easier for DD than it is for a manufacturing company. DD signed a contract with Jimmy John's, who is notoriously against 3rd party delivery services. Why would JJ sign with DD? Because DD offered to do the deal at a loss so they could artificially inflate their sales. When they're trading at 20x sales, I don't blame them, but I ain't biting. Once DoorDash is forced to turn a profit, they will need to increase prices, decrease driver pay, and decrease marketing which will force them to compete on an even playing field. This will drive any hope of maintaining high growth and higher market share out the window. The total market size will also decrease after the pandemic lifts. Their valuation will start looking a lot more like Grubhub's. Don't believe me? Look at their latest earnings where they missed EPS by $2 a share.\n3. REGULATION: Over the past year, there has been significant regulation\n   1. Order When You Arrive banned in California: This was a key practice that accounted for the majority of restaurants on DoorDash's platform. Other states will surely follow.\n   2. Capped Restaurant Commissions: Cities across the US are capping fees on what DoorDash can charge restaurants, this will surely continue to have an impact\n   3. Prop-22: While still a win over the alternative, the majority of this increased regulation over gig workers is costly and will surely eat at profitability as other states roll out\n   4. Italy mandating drivers be treated as employees: Internationally (where DD hopes to expand) governments are VERY anti-gig worker. This sentiment will surely expand.\n4. LOCK UP EXPIRY: The majority of stockholders have their shares locked up and they got them when the valuation was sub $5BB. Softbank and employees can't wait to dump their shares and leave institutional investors holding the bag. They are all fully aware of point #2 and it will be a race to the bottom once lock up expires on Monday. I suspect Softbank has been artificially propping up the price so they would be eligible to sell on Monday (needs to be trading above IPO for 10 days prior to be eligible). About 35.8% of shares outstanding will be eligible for sale, those will ALL be sold.

None of the current online storefront runners, like Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Valve, not Epic have any reason to give Gamestop a place in their ecosystems for no reason. Especially since for Microsoft and Sony, their ecosystem is how they make all the money back from selling consoles at a loss.\n\nLooking at the PC market for example, getting any sort of beachfront in the store market share is brutal. Epic games spent years spending outrageous amounts of money doing things like giving away free games and large discounts to attract users, and they still didn't make more than a scratch until Fortnite came along. Origin and Uplay are both seen as annoyances rather than desirable services.\n\nSo given all that, I don't see what gamestop has to offer in the digital marketplace. Forget drive or investment experience or even business sense for a second, because unfortunately those don't mean anything if your company doesn't have anything to offer.

Meanwhile, there's half a pandemic going on in the country because at least 14 states are planning to reopen. At the same time Congress wants to borrow a bloated $1.9 Trillion budget to splurge on hookers and blow.\n\nHappy times are here again...\n\nUnfortunately, the fundamentals of companies are starting to solidify and they don't need the easy money with the economy reopening. The economy has a government spending hangover and wants interest prices to increase before hyperinflation appears.\n\nHowever, Government promised a whole lotta freebies during the election and now people have turned up with pockets turned out waiting for their share.\n\nThe Fed decides it's not going to raise interest rates but fundamentals don't give a damn. Buyers don't want to buy worthless bonds and the government \"prints\" money by issuing bonds.\n\nA classic catch-22...\n\nCongress can't borrow $1.9 Trillion unless the Treasury issues more bonds. Investors won't buy the bonds unless the interest rate increases. If interest rates increase it becomes more expensive for everybody to borrow.\n\nBasically...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/0n9cfhbeg2l61.gif\n\nThe yield bonds are increasing on their own because of all the inflation stuffed into the market over the past year.

All their borrowed shares just got more expensive to hold and there's nothing they can do about it.\n\nMy hunch is today's sell off is a desperate money grab to try to keep the GME price down to keep their interest down. (At the time of writing this GME is rising)\n\nBefore they were slowly bleeding out money. Now they've nicked an artery it's gushing out.\n\nTL;DR Raising bond yields means hedge funds have to pay more in interest to borrow stocks and they're doing a fire sale to cover their bets.\n\nedit: I can't spell.\n\nedit 2: The treasury issues bonds, not the fed.

They're both \"someone has to buy, and the price gets driven up.\"\n\nGamma squeeze, it's if someone buys calls, then their call ends up in the money and get exercised, the option seller buys because they're contractually obligated to. Takes a large amount to have an effect- on 2/23 or 24, IIRC, someone bought 50,000 $50 calls, I think? which would be 5,000,000 shares if the option is exercised. Technically, the call option seller doesn't have to buy shares until it's exercised, but when a market maker sells options, they hedge, I think the term is to stay \"delta neutral\" not sure. Basically, depending on how likely the option is to be in the money/exercised, they buy a % of the stocks they'd need. So someone bought calls that caused the market maker to buy, say, 20% of the total stocks they might need, in order to hedge. That drives the price up, so now they have to buy more stocks to cover their risk before it gets to the point where they'd start losing money, since if you buy at $47 and it goes up to $52 and gets exercised, you didn't actually lose money since you bought low enough (under the strike price, so $50 here). They keep driving the price up on themselves and all the other option sellers, who scramble to buy in before they have to buy at a price that loses them money, and the squeeze is off to the races, and goes until supply and demand evens out. The first GME squeeze (where it spiked hard and fast to $3-400) had ALL of the previously purchased options in the money. That probably was a combo squeeze, hard to tell though. Currently there's a nutty number of $800 GME calls, so if it ever gets close to 800 before they expire, it ain't leveling off for a while.\n\nShort squeeze: someone with a lot of money and appetite for risk borrows a stock, sells it, and hopes to buy it back for less than they sold it. They pay interest (from less than 1% APY to double digits on crazy stuff like GME) on the ending value of the stock each day. There's no specific time they have to pay it back as long as they keep paying interest, with the exception of if the person they borrowed from recalls it, not sure when/ how that happens, or maybe some company wide rare events. So they just pay interest until it drops, but if it really spikes, they want to buy and cover to get out before the interest ruins them, and when they buy to get out, it goes up, compounding their and other shorters' problem, and then it really takes off. I think setting off a short squeeze would take sustained high prices or a big holder NEEDING to get out for liquidity or other reasons, but IDK.\n\nI'm just a noob who's down a couple grand the last 14 months while the market is up, (not all GME) so check my numbers and hit up [investopedia.com](https://investopedia.com) or something for actually competent definitions and explanations.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Bro this was an excellent explanation", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Theoretically yes", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "SO, Lambo?", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Other way around.

We're a debt based society, meaning that we're hoping the value of our economy grows faster rate than the interest rates on our debts. So the economy fundamentally relies on people pulling out more and more debt to keep our growth moving. The more people/governments pull out new loans, the larger our monetary base grows (a.k.a. money printing) becomes relative to our economic value (I guess related to GDP). From my understanding, the H.8 data, M1 and M2 data show the big picture of government/consumer spending (a.k.a. more loans = bigger money supply = inflation)\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WM2NS\n\nSo, who loans out money? Banks! Now, if you were had lots of money to lend out, would you be lending to normies right now? Nope, too much risk for defaults with super low interest rates. So, banks aren't lending until things get back to \"normal\". If you look at the H.8 under the consumer loans parts, you can see that less people are pulling out loans right now and are paying down debt (a.k.a. the money supply is flat or slightly decreasing). So if less people are pulling out loans for new cars, less cars will be built in the future and people lose jobs because of profit losses, etc...\nHere's our consumer loan growth. The spikes are when the banks tighten and loosen loan requirements:\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CONSUMER/\n\nSo, coming back to QE and stimulus, the government pulling out loans and giving the money to citizens (stimulus) to spur lending (kind of to get around bank lending restrictions for us). While the FED is taking treasuries and mortages back securities off the banks books in case people massively default and to ensure the banks have solid securities to lend against going forward. In turn, the FED is giving the banks cash for \"liquidity\", but eventually the FED will need its cash back in full, so the cash is locked within the banking system (this when the FED tried to pull out in 2018 and the market shit the bed). However, the FED is forcing the banks to buy treasury securities each month in order to keep the QE going. When banks buy bonds, the interest rates on bonds go down, which generally makes interest rates on loans go down (a.k.a. spur lending for businesses). The problem with all this is that the USD is tied to treasury securities and from my understanding, the more buying the FED does, the more it puts downward pressure on interest rates and sucks up dollars from the economy. \n\nSo, finally, when we come back to the M2 Velocity, you can see that the dollar only exchanges hands 1.13 times before it's destroyed (if it were 1.0 it means I pull out a loan and immediately pay it off without spending it). So that indicates people aren't spending money and are paying down debt (deflation) or sitting on cash right now (stagnation).\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V\n\nSo the TLDR: So, a good chunk of inflation and deflation actually comes down to when the banks decide to lend again. Banks lending = inflation, banks not lending = deflation. Currently banks have restrictive lending and people are sitting on cash or paying off debt if they can, which are both deflationary in a debt-based society.\n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/data/sloos/sloos-202101.htm\nhttps://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2020/03/bank-lending-standards-and-loan-growth/", "score": 110, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 52, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thank you for explaining everything", "score": 15, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "You don‚Äôt want to be in bad debt when we experience deflation.
