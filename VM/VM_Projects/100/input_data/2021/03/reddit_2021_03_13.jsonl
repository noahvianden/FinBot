I am still extremely confident in this trade. Even more confident than I was when I made the original post. If you look at CFTC website, Commodity Future Trading Commission at the commitment of traders you can look at the position on U.S. treasuries among asset managers, leveraged funds, and some other people.\n\n**I'm not the only one short treasuries. Leveraged funds are short treasuries to the tune of a couple trillion dollars (someone please tell me if I am mis-interpreting these position share numbers and the total amount short. i am multiplying the short share number by  face value of the contracts). Their position on the 2-year and 5-year is short 2:1.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33asisy960r61.png?width=1714&format=png&auto=webp&s=b191cb2a09b910bb7c27382e5541c00f3db380c7\n\n**This is only highlighting 2-year and 5-year and leveraged funds. You can go look through this yourself. Either way, there are 2 trillion dollars worth of 2-year and 5-year treasuries sold short. i saw this play before these leveraged players and i think it is safe to assume that they are smarter than me. I would not expect institutional and asset managers to have such speculative short positions because they are more concerned about % returns and portfolio balance than taking big gambles. Seems like funds backed off the 10-year short positions and they are net long on 10-yrs (at least asset managers and leveraged funds). imo, that real interest rates on 10y at 1.72% would still be less of a loss for funds than 2-yr and 5-yr bonds. these shorter bonds.**\n\n[https://www.cftc.gov/dea/options/financial\\_lof.htm](https://www.cftc.gov/dea/options/financial_lof.htm)\n\n[https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm)\n\nHere are my positions as of April 3 2021 (4/3/21)....4321. 1234?\n\nI have been trying to diversify my equity positions.

I sold my TLT put today in the money and got some pretty good gains on it. When I sold all the commodities that I could I bought a bunch of TBT calls for June that were close to the money (I spent \\~1600 on this). Im not sure what I want to do with the money I cashed into today with TLT put. Im going to wait until next week to decide where I re-invest it. Good chance I go back against bonds, but I like RFP, MT, CLF, and other commodity plays.\n\nThe volatile of some of my calls makes the amount of money and the line that tracks my account deceiving. Don't get anything I purchase if you don't know what your doing because i am an amateur.\n\nFUD is real and there are bear and bull thesis out there on the market and I have listened to so many people it casts doubt on my original thesis. However, the circumstances of todays market, especially the amount of speculation, make me confident in betting against bonds and I think until it is clear how the FED can get out of raising yields without causing inflation or financial crisis.\n\nThe main bull on bonds is Steve VanMetre: [https://t.co/obHyG6uw9v?amp=1](https://t.co/obHyG6uw9v?amp=1) ;[https://youtu.be/knthggCs\\_KQ](https://youtu.be/knthggCs_KQ) . He knows a lot about bonds than I do. Im just not sure that his US-centered interpretation of bonds/treasuries reflect the what the market will do because about half of our treasuries are owned by foreign investors.\n\nGreat blog I found who is a bear are on the entire market: [https://zensecondlife.blogspot.com/2021/03/peak-sugar-high.html](https://zensecondlife.blogspot.com/2021/03/peak-sugar-high.html)\n\nAlso listen to Peter Schiff, George Gammon, and David Hunter.\n\nSLR: change was lifted today and Steve VanMetre thinks that this will spark a bull run in bonds (meaning yields go down) because banks will have to go out and buy a whole bunch of treasuries to meet their SLR rule. This might be true and it could bring yields  down for a while, it could also be why David Hunter the contrarian thinks that yields will fall before they go up really high. I don't want to offer my speculation because I have nothing unique to offer than all of the people out there, but i am BEARISH on bonds.\n\nSo many experts out there but no consensus. We are in unprecedented times with treasuries at historic lows. To me it seems we are closer to 1929 then we ever have been. I am sticking with this play and ill post here with updates, losses or profits. I still think I win this trade in the end.\n\nMy positions as of market close today.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvhrotml42o61.png?width=2162&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e77225954bf589b95cd05fc9da777fa0b2dc2ab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tag2html42o61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ab3f82762a7702992d4954caed5cb30174f6f9\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------original post------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHey everyone,\n\nSo basically I think there is a good probability that we are at the edge of an economic downturn. I have been talking about the bond market, and looking into what is going on there and it is clear that the FED has their hands tied on this and our only path forwards are 1) hyperinflation or 2) failure in the bond market due to rising interest rates.\n\nIn 2019, the world economy was running hot AF. In just the span of time from 2018-2019 the us median income rose 2%, poverty dropped 2%, and it all seemed very good.\n\nThe FED saw that the economy was getting hot, and that their quantitative easing (QE) policy might be becoming less effective. They have some bank tools that are used to combat inflation and interest rates. These tools are IOER, SLR%, and YCC.\n\nIOER: Interest one excessive reserves. This is perhaps the most important tool because feds can manually change the interest rate on the M1 money stock. This is important because from this first money stock, every-time one passes hands there is an interest rate associated with it. So Interest rate on IOER affects the M1 money stock, M2 money stock, all banks, and almost all of the credit that we try to get, it also affects SLR%.\n\nSLR%: Supplementary leverage ratio %. This is basically how much loan loss reserves a banks and companies need to always keep on hand in order to meet the needs of their members. For example, the US fed can put a cap at 10% SLR% and that means that the bank can leverage 90% of its money out, while only keeping 10% on hand. This is influenced by IOER and this SLR% is the main reason we cannot raise interest rates using IOER.\n\nEdit 3/16/21: see full description at bottom. IOER and SLR% are two independent tools that the fed can use to influences rates on the money stock and for bank collateral.\n\nIn 2019 we tried raising IOER, which increased SLR. When we did that we moved the underbelly of a beast so massive we had no idea how big it could be. When we raised IOER many banks and companies have taken out so much debt that they literally COULD NOT STAY LIQUID with increases in interest rates.\n\n[https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w](https://youtu.be/URvok29rf-w)\n\nNot only did this raise in interest rates lead to a huge liquidity disaster, it also led to liquidity disasters IN OTHER COUNTRIES. That is really really really worrisome. We raise interest in the IOER and all the suddenly Turkey also is having a major fucking liquidity issue. I don't know each country but I do know that our 2019 actions were affecting Turkey and other countries.\n\nSo what did we do in response the the 2019 liquidity disasters? WE LOWERED INTEREST RATES AND PRINTED MORE MONEY. WE KEPT THE ZOMBIE GOING.\n\nthen the pandemic hit...\n\nThe pandemic hit and the FED already knew we were at a knives edge with the bond market. So their plan, although they say it was to help us, was to pump up the zombie economy with a huge monumental stimulus. Then we got two more after.\n\nI wanted this stimulus, we all wanted this stimulus, but by pumping the stimulus in the economy and pumping up these institutions that can't stay liquid if they had high interest rates has kind of put off the inevitable. A huge falling out of people who have too much debt.\n\nSo here we are in 2021. Government debt has not improved (it has got worse), credit ratings on many zombie companies that aren't turning a profit are going to get worse and worse credit ratings = high standards of SLR% to stay liquid. This is going to make it even MORE difficult for these companies to deal with high interest rates.\n\n**WHAT DOES THIS FIRST PART MEAN?**\n\nWe have tools to deal with inflation, the most important being raised interest rates using (IOER) which influences SLR% and capital requirements of institutions. However, we have so much debt, and so much of this debt belongs to companies that don't turn a significant profit. So we can't raise interest rates if we don't want a flat out crash in the bond market and wave of bankruptcies of major corporations and possibly financial institutions.\n\nso if controlling for inflation by raising IOER would lead to a liquidity crisis in the bond market, how do we control for and prevent hyper inflation?\n\nPeople have been talking about Yield Curve Control (YCC) as it is a tool to control for inflation. However it is not. YCC works by the FED going into the economy and buying up as many 10y and 30yr bonds as they can (this puts more money in economy), then selling a bunch of their short term expiring bonds. This buying on the long end and selling on the short end would help keep interest rates low for companies to stay liquid, BUT LOW INTEREST RATES LEADS US TO MORE INFLATION, so this plan will not work for very long.\n\n**THE FED IS BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE**\n\n**increase IOER to control inflation** = major liquidity issue and a fallout of our bond market\n\n**do YCC to avoid fall out of bond market** = more inflation!\n\n**print more money** i**nject it into the economy** = buy more time but put off inevitable.\n\nI have been thinking about this and I don't see that they have a way out. I have read into it and also heard people talk about this long before I got here. Below I leave some links so you can hear about this from someone else besides me.\n\n[https://youtu.be/CCmdmOr06pY](https://youtu.be/CCmdmOr06pY) (CNBC on bond market)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMoneyGPS](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMoneyGPS) (another person who actually looks at numbers and data)\n\n[https://youtu.be/28VXEocPnw4](https://youtu.be/28VXEocPnw4) (Peter Schiff has been saying this for a long time)\n\n[https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w](https://youtu.be/Y1OkOtQND8w) (former banker sees same pending disaster)\n\n**Commodities**\n\nI don't want to talk about the inflation we are seeing in commodities because we have talked about steel a shit ton here and all of us know that inflationary signs are all over the economy. CPI will literally be the last indicator that inflation is here SO PLEASE INGORE THE FED WHEN THEY SAY CPI IS LOW.\n\nWe see inflationary pressure all over the market. Especially in commodities, producer prices, import costs, housing prices, etc. The FED is only saving face with CPI cause they know controlling inflation means crashing the bond market.\n\n**My Plan**\n\n**Exposed myself to commodities**: I have invested in a handful of commodity tickers $RFP $MT $CLF $LPX $CTT $PCH $SXC, $ADM because even if we have the catalysts of a crazy economic recovery we also have inflation. So no matter what these stocks do, they HAVE to go up. I think in 2021 any commodity stock that can produce cash is a good one to have.\n\n**Expose myself to raising interest rates**: To ensure that I do not end up being a bag holder for the irresponsible lending and money printing that our government has engaged in for the last decade i am buying puts against the bond market. I have bought puts against $TLT $VGSH $HYG $VMBS $VGIT. I will keep buying them too.\n\n**interest rates stay low = more inflation = commodity stocks go up**\n\n**raise interest to control inflation = bond yields go up, prices of bonds go down. potential fallout of companies and institutions that can't meet SLR%**\n\nI took out positions on Monday and its like i touched a beast that just woke up. It should not be possible to be up $1500 in one day. the VGSH puts for october that I got for 10 dollars are now worth like 300.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrfa5jmh1vm61.png?width=2216&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cfecc64d7cf74f06be13f63d93ec170b739e634\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; If you want to protect yourself from inflation, buy commodities. If you want to protect yourself from the fucking house of cards that is the bond market, buy puts on bond ETF's against the bond market. This strategy might be VERY successful this year. Most of the puts i am buying are for the late fall or early next year.\n\nIf this country could handle higher interest rates I think we would be okay. But the 2019 disaster did not spur confidence that we we were in a position then, and now the house of cards has only expanded and our money printing has led to enormous amounts of speculation that this world has never seen. Cryptos, SPACs, NFT's, High valuations, Cathie Wood, Chamath, etc. etc. To make this wore we are already starting to see inflation pressures hit producers and commodities. EU and AU are doing MORE MONEY PRINTING and QE. Money hasn't even started moving through the economy too. We have not even opened up.\n\nI sincerely wish I could believe this administration that we are in for a great economic recovery. They are completely ignoring the huge fucking problem right under their nose.\n\nEdit 3/13/21: this guy seems to agree with me [https://youtu.be/\\_\\_eVeN8wmfQ](https://youtu.be/__eVeN8wmfQ)\n\nEdit 3/16/21: Heresy capital has a great interview with David Hunter that basically talks about the same thing I see in the financial system, it is overleveraged. [https://youtu.be/v8l3oeq4eE8](https://youtu.be/v8l3oeq4eE8). He has a lot of other great videos too. He seems to have genuine insight and a much deeper understanding of the financial system on youtube compared to MeetKevin, Ten Cents, and Tom Nash. These three youtubers offer some good insight but they are not really focused on macro.\n\nEdit 3/16/21: u/iHustling correctly pointed out that my interpretation of SLR and IOER was incorrect and he looked into it to clarify that these two tools are independent from each other. Below is his explanation of these measures. The misleading part about my interpretation of these two measures is that I assumed IOER also determined SLR%. This was a hasty assumption made by me because I could not see how the rates on the money supply could vary drastically than the SLR% on banks. Here is his explanation:\n\n\"IOER set by the Fed for sure. SLR just seems to be a regulation placed on the banks that the Fed can change, but hasn't changed to this date. The Fed exert enough control through IOER and open market activity. The IOER does allow them to basically change the repo rates and Fed funds rate.\n\nIf the Fed funds rate were lower then the IOER, banks would make a profit by borrowing from other banks and lending to the Fed and vice versa. Therefore the Fed fund rate and IOER are effectively the same rate.\n\nBy controlling the Fed fund rate through the IOER, they can also control the repo rate because the repo rate trails the Fed fund rate by a couple of basis points. The only difference between these two is one is backed by collateral and the other is not. The Fed fund rate is usually 25 basis points higher. This makes up for the lack of collateral.\n\nSo what does this mean for your post? It seems the beginning of it may be a little misleading if I am correct in what the SLR is and isn't.\"\n\nhere are all my positions\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c54ice9g1vm61.png?width=552&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a1bed8e2ed7e1151b8ef1d9347d811e4017fc54\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0du8uc9g1vm61.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=99adc2a783bbc1c4499d975034b2fee10e5e6e65\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kid15f9g1vm61.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=e785c1a2d5f063834c754fa73e2b36d857591e00", "id": "m4ffmx", "created_utc": 1615669571.0, "score": 549, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 329, "comments": [{"body": "So interesting.

This is defiantly something to keep in mind and look into.  As for me. I don't think this changes much in my eyes. I will wait a few weeks or months to buy because (as people have also said) it does seem pretty overvalued RIGHT NOW. With that said I still think this company has great potential and to me, most of the arguments being made against Coupang are arguments you can say about a lot of companies as well. Thanks again for the Feedback and the upvotes. Much appreciated!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**---------------------------------------------------------------DISCLAIMER--------------------------------------------------------------**\n\nThis is my first ever DD, with that being said please be nice, and let me know if anything is wrong and or if I didn't include anything important. Would love some **constructive** criticism, thanks. Also with that being said I don’t know anything about anything. I'm just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here. I can’t tell the future. I am NOT a financial advisor. I’m just an ape like all of you. PLEASE do your own research. Humans are known for being wrong and I’m no expectation. I’m bullish on this stock but it did JUST go public therefore there isn’t a ton of history for how the stock performs. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.\n\nWith that said. I hope you enjoy and learn something from this.\n\n**Coupang Inc DD**\n\n**Ticker - CPNG**\n\n**Initial bullish info (for the apes who can't stand to read more than 100 words)**\n\n* Talked about and known as the “Amazon of South Korea”\n* Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba\n* Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018\n* IPO jumped more than 70%\n* Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)\n* CEO’s a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)\n* Coupang has the highest market share of Korea's E-commerce business\n* Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year\n* Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow\n* Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea\n* Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services\n* Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)\n* Eco friendly packaging\n* Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)\n\nNow for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading\n\n**Quantitative:**\n\n* Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019\n* Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020\n* Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019\n* Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019\n* Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019\n\nRevenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018\n\n2018: -1.5B\n\n2019: -698M\n\n2020: -474M\n\nIn November 2018 Softbank's Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B\n\n**Use of Proceeds:**\n\n* Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.\n* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.\n* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.\n\nI really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don’t know anything.\n\n📷\n\n* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.\n\n**Opportunity:**\n\nKorea's GDP “gross domestic product” (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.\n\nThe total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)\n\nTotal spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.\n\n**Management:**\n\nRange of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46\n\n* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.\n* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?\n* \\*\\*Thuan Pham - (\\*\\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)\n\nOther members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.\n\n**Qualitative:**\n\nCompany Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: “How did I ever live without Coupang?”\n\n* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.\n* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)\n* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.\n* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. “People aren't the friendliest” “you're expected to work like a machine” “Work life balance can be hard” “needs more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.\n* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)\n\n**Services:**\n\n* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.\n* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.\n* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and “Bombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I’d name them but I don’t think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show “Your Honor” and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *“We are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.”*\n* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.\n* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *“pursue operational excellence and innovation”* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)\n\nPart of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don’t think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *“We believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.”*\n\n**Top Risks:**\n\n* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth\n* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)\n* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.\n\nI have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.\n\n**TDLR:**\n\nIn my OPINION, based on everything I’ve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.\n\nThanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should’ve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing. As you may have noticed I haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I’m waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don’t own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I’m buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn’t you want to get into Amazon in 2005?\n\nThanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/9/4/why-amazon-has-no-profits-and-why-it-works](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/9/4/why-amazon-has-no-profits-and-why-it-works)\n\n[https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Amazon-Reviews-E6036.htm](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Amazon-Reviews-E6036.htm)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001834584/000162828021004565/coupang-424b4.htm#i4773fe05195046f8b8cb330d78922a20\\_576](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001834584/000162828021004565/coupang-424b4.htm#i4773fe05195046f8b8cb330d78922a20_576)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/12/south-koreas-coupang-can-be-a-cash-flow-generating-machine.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/12/south-koreas-coupang-can-be-a-cash-flow-generating-machine.html)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/profile/bom-kim/?sh=6342a76227d6](https://www.forbes.com/profile/bom-kim/?sh=6342a76227d6)\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coupang-dives-into-video-streaming-with-launch-of-coupang-play-301198573.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coupang-dives-into-video-streaming-with-launch-of-coupang-play-301198573.html)\n\n[https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=262883](https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=262883)\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp)", "id": "m4c50z", "created_utc": 1615660115.0, "score": 211, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "I only read your DD, but I lived in Korea.

The USD's reserve currency status is in large part the result of the world's second biggest economy (China) pegging their currency to the dollar.)\n\nThe strength & adoption rate of the US dollar is not some magic property that derives from some intangible \"trust\" or \"adoption rate\".\n\nIt's the very tangible emergent property of a stable, prosperous economy with a large financial sector, combined with ~35% of that economy being paid in as taxes, in dollars, every single year.\n\nOnce we agree on that premise (you might not...), we can advance to the question of what anchors the value of Bitcoin.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I will lay out for you my precieved risks and some counter points to give you some insite into why I think Bitcoin is relatively low risk.\n\nI do look at government intervention as the biggest threat to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a better store of value than gold and it's much easier to transport, send, protect, and hide. Bitcoin is also more scarce than gold. Bitcoin is easier and cheaper to store, send, receive, protect, and hide. Gold mining and transporting gold are both far worse for the environment than mining bitcoin and transporting bitcoin. Gold mining emits far more co2 emissions than bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is more scarce than gold and bitcoin can also be used for payments and as currency and the lightning network allows an unlimited amount of people to send and receive bitcoin instantly for extremely low fees. [Click here](https://8marketcap.com/) to see a list of the top 100 assets by market cap. Gold is #1 with a market cap of $10.9 trillion and bitcoin is #8 with a market cap of $1.1 trillion right now. Almost all of that value sitting in gold being inefficiently stored and guarded in vaults can more easily and efficiently be stored on the bitcoin blockchain and more people will continue to realize this as bitcoin is continues to remain at the second stage of the evolution of money.\n\nMoney always evolves in the following four stages:\n\n1) Collectible: In the very first stage of its evolution, money will be demanded solely based on its peculiar properties, usually becoming a whimsy of its possessor. Shells, beads, and gold were all collectibles before later transitioning to the more familiar roles of money.\n\n2) Store of value: Once it is demanded by enough people for its peculiarities, money will be recognized as a means of keeping and storing value over time. As a good becomes more widely recognized as a suitable store of value, its purchasing power will rise as more people demand it for this purpose. The purchasing power of a store of value will eventually plateau when it is widely held and the influx of new people desiring it as a store of value dwindles.\n\n3) Medium of exchange: When money is fully established as a store of value, its purchasing power will stabilize. Having stabilized in purchasing power, the opportunity cost of using money to complete trades will diminish to a level where it is suitable for use as a medium of exchange. In the earliest days of Bitcoin, many people did not appreciate the huge opportunity cost of using bitcoins as a medium of exchange, rather than as an incipient store of value. The famous story of a man trading 10,000 bitcoins (worth approximately $94 million at the time of this article's writing) for two pizzas illustrates this confusion.\n\n4) Unit of account: When money is widely used as a medium of exchange, goods will be priced in terms of it. I.e., the exchange ratio against money will be available for most goods. It is a common misconception that bitcoin prices are available for many goods today. For example, while a cup of coffee might be available for purchase using bitcoins, the price listed is not a true bitcoin price; rather it is the dollar price desired by the merchant translated into bitcoin terms at the current USD/BTC market exchange rate. If the price of bitcoin were to drop in dollar terms, the number of bitcoins requested by the merchant would increase commensurately. Only when merchants are willing to accept bitcoins for payment without regard to the bitcoin exchange rate against fiat currencies can we truly think of Bitcoin as having become a unit of account.\n\nThis isn't the second millennium anymore and we have better technology now. Gold is just too inefficient and bad for the environment for people to be using as a store of value anymore and if we stopped doing that then the price would come down to it's true value and it would be extremely cheap for the minuscule amount that we do use in electronics, thus lowering the price of electronics. Gold is shiny and makes pretty jewelry and also makes great corrosion resistant semiconductors. It's difficult and expensive to transport and it requires equipment to reliably test it's authenticity. It's also difficult and expensive to adequately guard and protect. All of the value of gold could sit on the blockchain instead of sitting in a vault being guarded and then it wouldn't need to be transported in a jet in order to transfer it to someone.\n\n**This thread shouldn't even be in this subreddit and it was posted by someone that's been fooled into invested in joke based on a meme.**\n\nFurthermore, Elon just likes memes and enjoys being a meme lord and dogecoin is just a fun joke cryptocurrency that people can use to learn, mine, and send around because they are essentially worthless and not meant to have value. 1 single address holds 28.72% of all dogecoin. 13 single addresses own 50% of dogecoin. 97 addresses hold 68% of the coins. 609 addresses hold 78% of the coins.

Bitcoin is a scarce tokenized derivative of inflation and corruption that's kept honest and secure by it's own decentralized ledger of value that can't be forged or hacked.\n\nBitcoin is a new asset that's still currently being discovered by intelligent people around the globe. Every asset is volatile while being discovered and during price discovery. Day traders love the volatility of bitcoin and substantially increase the volatility by trading bitcoin options and futures with leverage.

Bitcoin will remain volatile until it's true value is discovered which I expect to be in the 7 digits of US currency and I'm also expecting that to happen before the end of 2033 because bitcoin is finite and 99% of it will be mined before the end 2032.\n\nMiners solve a block every 10 minutes on average. The block reward is currently 6.25 bitcoin and the next block reward halving will happen around April 2024 and then the block reward will be 3.125 bitcoin.

Like I said above, over 99% of bitcoin will be mined before the end of 2032 and the last satoshi will be mined by 2140. \n\nEach bitcoin transaction includes a miner fee and the miner fees will incentivize the miners to continue confirming transactions and securing the network and if some miners stop mining bitcoin when the block reward is so minuscule then the remaining miners get paid more bitcoin for their work because the difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks. Miners get turned off when it's no longer profitable mine. The hash rate drops when miners turn off. The mining difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks so the difficulty will drop and bitcoin will remain profitable to mine.

The electricity used to put transactions in blocks in 2032 will be substantially less than the electricity used to mine bitcoin right now. Most of that electricity will also come from renewable resources. Over 74% of electricity used to mine bitcoin already comes from renewable resources, making bitcoin mining more renewables-driven than almost every other large-scale industry in the entire world.\n\nOver 99% of bitcoins will be mined before 2033 and the hash rate and amount of electricity used by miners will go down a lot. So many miners are going to be turned off and the difficulty will adjust downwards very far. The miner fees will incentivize the miners to continue confirming transactions and securing the network. As the block reward decreases, so does the electricity expended because non-profitable miners get turned off, which causes the hash rate to drop and the difficulty to adjust downwards.\n\nBitcoin also has something called the lightning network which allows an unlimited amount of people to send and receive bitcoin instantly for minuscule feels. This is where the bulk of bitcoin transactions take place and these transactions aren't counted in your statistics. The lightning network can also process far more transactions than Visa. It can process hundreds of millions of transactions a second, possibly unlimited. It also uses negligible electricity. The main blockchain is used for large settlement transactions and the lightning network is where smaller transactions happen instantly for almost no cost.\n\nVisa isn't a store of value.

Geeze, the planet is warming **today**, and we want to *reduce* the reliance on fossil fuels, not increase it.\n\n> Once the block reward is so minuscule, most of those miners wont be in operation anymore.\n\nThere's several problems with that view.\n\nFirstly:\n\n- The current Bitcoin block reward mechanism is logarithmic, the block reward halves for every 210,000 bitcoins mined - about every 4 years with current trends. See: https://bitcoinvisuals.com/chain-block-reward\n- But the current estimated cost of mining Bitcoins is below $5,000/BTC today. At $60,000/BTC mining is still profitable even if the reward was halved ***another*** 2 times.\n- This means that we'll be wasting a stupendous amount of electricity for the next 3 years until the current reward halves, then another 4 years and another 4 years.\n- So at current price levels we are looking at Bitcoin mining equivalent to the **energy waste equivalent to all electricity use of Argentina for another 13 years** ...\n- If BTC goes even higher, which basically all supporters seem to expect, this could be extended by another 4 years. Then another 4 years ...\n\nSecondly, Bitcoin researchers are woefully naive about the kind of attacks Bitcoin could face in the future. Here's an example:\n\n- https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2020.565497/full\n- The statement: \"even if the attack was successful, the value of Bitcoin would collapse so rapidly that there would be little economic gain.\" This person never heard about put option contracts on Bitcoin futures and shorting... 🤦\n\nI.e. from a security point of view, the current proof of work mechanism is already not enough. Double spending is avoided not because it's designed out, but because the ones who can likely pull it off (the big mining rigs in China using coal powered electricity) would likely destroy their own economic value by doing so.\n\nBut with just 1.5% hashing power a viable double spending or competing network attack could be pulled off - which would sure crater BTC in the short run. With the securitization of BTC, this is actually a profitable venture, and because BTC is decentralized and not legislated, it would likely be legal as well, and could be justified as a hostile fork of the network ...\n\nEither they'll change it to proof of stake, like Ethereum 2.0 will likely do, or they'll have to *increase* the PoW required for new transactions ..\n\n>  They wont do it for free and the miner fees from the transactions wont be enough. The electricity used to put transactions in blocks in 2032 will be substantially less than the electricity used to mine bitcoin right now.\n\n\"Mining\" and \"putting new transactions into the blockchain\" are **one and the same thing**: the Bitcoin protocol defines a maximum block length of 2MB, which has space for ~8k transactions. (Note, I corrected my comments above.)\n\nCurrent average block length is 1.4MB, i.e. transactions have already used up ~70% of the transaction bandwidth enabled by mining:\n\n> https://www.blockchain.com/charts/avg-block-size\n\nI.e. the per transaction energy can at most improve by another 30% - so one Bitcoin transaction will use as much energy as ~750,000 Visa transactions, but ~525,000 Visa transactions - hard-coded in the protocol.\n\nA **huge** waste of energy.\n\n> Bitcoin also has something called the lightning network which allows an unlimited amount of people to send and receive bitcoin instantly for minuscule feels. \n\nIf you don't actually use the Bitcoin ledger as your transaction log, then the concentration of power inevitably happens - which we are seeing in real-world banking:\n\n> https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-lightning-network-is-growing-increasingly-centralized-researchers-find\n>\n> **Bitcoin’s Lightning Network Is Growing ‘Increasingly Centralized,’ Researchers Find**\n\nSo the solution to Bitcoin's design problems is an ... increasingly centralized transaction processing network. 🤦", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "In 2020, some bitcoin miners started operating in the Mongolian region of China and that region sources it's electricity from coal.

Might as well put aside the pretense and give those dominant, majority nodes a central signing authority as well, which they already de-facto have through their processing power?\n- With the marginal BTC mining cost at $5,000 any pretense of Bitcoin mining \"slowing down\" is a farcical argument: at $60,000/BTC it will take another 3 halving of the mining reward for BTC mining to become uneconomical - which won't happen for another ~13 years. Any further increase in the value of BTC would extend the economic timeline of mining the residual bitcoins. Plus miners dominate the integrity of the Bitcoin ledger and their decision to adapt new versions of the Bitcoin protocol gives them basically a cartel power over the future direction of Bitcoin. Do you really think miners will allow their mining rewards to become unprofitable? 🤔\n- Bitcoin still has no solution to fraud detection and fraud reversal.

If some people see the utility, then are going to spend on it. The same way we decide to congregate on a social media which again wastes power from the view point of kids in Africa.  \n\n\nAlso power consumption is not the issue, issue is source of power.

In other words, every change in x equates to a corresponding change in y.\n\n> Recall that OLS is estimating how much y (Market Cap) changes for a given change in x (SF). On a month-to-month basis in which the model is derived, the change in x is effectively 0. As a result, the OLS model is doing nothing more than estimating Bitcoin’s historical growth rate. This becomes quite obvious when one extends the model into the near future. By 2045, the model estimates each Bitcoin will be worth $235,000,000,000 before eventually converging to infinity as bitcoin’s flow approaches 0.\n\n> Using the estimated slope-intercept formula is making the most naive prediction possible, because bitcoin grew by X in the past, it will grow by X in the future. One should remember that past results are not representative of future returns.\n\nhttps://strixleviathan.com/blog/2020/6/29/a-chameleon-model-why-bitcoins-stock-to-flow-model-is-fatally-flawed", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not a good comparison to gold.

{"title": "QFIN - DD - Big Banana Play - Earnings on 3/15", "selftext": "EDIT3: **WOOOOOOOOO .  Not only did earnings beat, but they straightup said that regulations will not negatively impact them and, in some cases, will actually help them.  The anti-trust regs against tencent's fintech will open up more room for growth for QFIN.**\n\n“ On the regulatory front, we believe that the regulations brought out recently either has minimal impact to our business, or in some cases, even created favorable environment for top platforms like us. As you may already know, the new ruling from the Supreme People’s Court removed the more restrictive lending rate cap for our business. The new guideline on drug lending and micro-lending has a minimal impact on our business as our exposure to both is quite marginal. On the other hand, China’s antitrust and deleveraging push may squeeze some market share away from the industry giants, which will bring us spill over market opportunities” -CEO\n\nThis call and the earnings are even better than I was hoping.  Now we just need the market to realize it!  See you all on the moon.\n\nEDIT2: Stock dropped today (3/15) alongside the entire sector.  It isn't dropping on its own - all the chinese fintechs, including the ones that are exposed to microlending, are dropping today.  Good last minute chance to buy, especially since premarket it was actually up 7% haha.  If you're really worried about macroeconomic risk, a good play might be to buy a ITM PUT on a fintech that's exposed, and an ITM call on QFIN. A hedge, so to speak.  But personally i'm not doing that. This is a casino, after all. \n____________\n**EDIT: Many people have brought up concern that this stock has already tripled and might be played out. I strongly disagree - from a valuation standpoint it is still an amazing buy. It wasn’t the cash flow or loan quality keeping the price down - it was the regulatory risk. As that risk diminishes it will grow to reach it’s fair valuation, which is around 50 using even a conservative growth rate in a conservative FCFE. The real risk is new regulations, or a bigger impact of the current ones, hence why I spent most of this DD talking about them. Right now the market is pricing in regulations wiping out about half of their revenue sources, which I strongly disagree with.\n\nThe earnings call is Monday at 9PM EST, which is Tuesday morning for QFIN in China. The numbers will be interesting but the real catalyst will be management’s discussion of the impact of regulations. Make sure to place all bets by then!**\n______________\n\nI have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I’ve got good news for all ape-kind: I’ve found one. Here’s my DD (whatever that means). \n\nTicker: **QFIN**, AKA \"360 Digitech\". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. \n\n**Here's their business model:**\n\n*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.\n\n*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) \n\n*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. \n\n*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.\n\nThe business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.\n\n**But first, let’s talk numbers.** \n*(In RMB, 1 USD = 6.5 RMB / CNY)\n2017 Revenue: *175 million* \n2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* \n2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* \nTTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months, this is 4Q2019 to 3Q2020)\n\nObviously that’s insane growth. Most apes can’t even count that high. \n\nAnd yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That’s less than half the P/E of the S&P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** \n\nTo understand why the stock is still so cheap, let’s talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. \n\nFirstly, I assume most of you haven’t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit – it’s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low…. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what’s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.\n\nThis is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn’t that there’s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the “problems” are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood… so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. \n\n**First Reason for Doubt – Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. \n\nOne regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here’s a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*\n\n**Why it doesn’t matter:** According to QFIN’s CEO, Wu “Cock Slapper” Haisheng, *“Currently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.”* \n\nAnother new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem – QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. \n\n**Second Reason for Doubt – Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China’s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.\n\n**Why it doesn’t matter:** First of all, *sack up.* \n\nNow that we’ve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn’t a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? \n\n*Now consider this:* \n\nRemember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they’re receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They’re bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they’re bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren’t a bank. What’s even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN’s loans defaults to FINV’s, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f) \n\nIf you’re too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN’s historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. \n\nAnother facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, “Total operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency” – CFO Alex “Oh God Please No Not My Face” Xu \n\n**Third Reason for Doubt – uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**\n\nOK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It’s also the most nebulous. \n\nA few things to think about: \n\nThis is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I’m not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don’t think it’s that weird. \n\nSpeaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN’s loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving*. QFIN did the opposite – they devalued the loans by too much* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). “...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.” – Ethan “Prolapse King” Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.\n\n**What risks are there still?**\n\nFirst and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group – a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack “Actual Vampire” Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN’s stock got dragged down by the bears despite not really being exposed to microlending. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie’s red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.\n\n**Any big banana showers coming soon?** YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it’ll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. \n\nIf you still aren’t convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. \n\nTLDR: I like the stock. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 \n\n*This is obviously not financial advice.*\n\n*Positions: long 15 QFIN 3/19 calls 35 strike, and long 500 shares (cost basis $27.48)*\n\nEDIT: had to remove my source for the conference call quotes since it was SA and blocking posting.

You want the stock price to go up, obviously. If it reaches past the strike price, you can exercise the contract- and the contract allows you to buy the stock at a lower price than its currently traded price, so it's a good deal! Or, you can sell your call option contract at any time if the price of the stock has gone up and made your contract worth more (the contract also loses value based on stuff like time til expiration date.)\n\nOk, why is this important? Well, because the person writing you this contract is sweating balls, looking at how close the contract they just sold is to hitting the strike price. They have to be able to sell you 100 shares for whatever price you agreed upon. What if Ryan Cohen tweets another poop meme and the stock rockets past the strike price? The call writer's loses could be potentially unlimited in that case... *unless* they buy shares before the stock hits the strike price. They'll still lose money that way but not a ton, not enough to choke them out. So they have an equation that tells them how to properly hedge (cover their asses) when they sell a call. It factors in how close they are to the stock price, the time left til the call option expires, stock volatility, and some other things. Each one of these factors is assigned a greek letter (hence, why this type of feedback loop is called a gamma squeeze.)\n\nIf the option sold is very close to being ITM, the writer (if not a complete degenerate moron) will probably buy 90 shares just to be safe. I repeat, by buying calls already ITM or close to ITM, you are obliging another person to buy a lot of shares, way more than the money used for your premium could get you. *This* is why it's so powerful.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the explanation.

So I unplugged, and hung out with my family. I’m an Old  Ape. I’m an ape with wife ape, a child ape. I’m an ape that owns a few businesses, and properties. But most importantly - I’m an ape that is completely over the looseness of regulations in securities exchanges, and this ape isn’t fucking selling.Feeling recharged this morning, with a couple cups of coffee - I decided to jump into Option order flow from Cheddar Flow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used the following parameters:3/1 to 3/15 OrdersRemoved everything that has expired and decided to do what gives me comfort as a wrinkle brain ape and just look at the concrete data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Excel sheet I provided shows many things, is it accurate? No - probably not. This ape may have some wrinkles, but is too smooth calculate IV.The bulleted point of the sheet is this (NOT BANANA ADVICE, JUST WRINKLE BRAIN APE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS)\n\nThere are: 111,204 Volume picked up in options that have yet to expire - between calls & putsThere is: 538,434 Current option interest on the strikes in this sheet The Average strike price divided by the total number of contracts purchased is 18,665 (this accounts for puts as well as calls)\n\n.Because ape only has some wrinkles, not all the wrinkles I can’t account for IV - but I can account for a banana to banana value at volatility less cost. So ape decided to account for that, to give himself a bigger view of the overall picture.\n\nThere was: $24million in buys in deep ITM and slightly OOTM options picked up on 3/4 (ape things hedges for hedges (double fuck you scumbag funds if you’re reading this btw)\n\nOn a banana for banana basis ape determined total value of all options right now is 94,854,461 bananas.\n\nSo wrinkle brain ape took out the value of the puts, and hedges - and determined that the actual value is 140,017,514 Bananas in value.

Options aren't shorts\n2. Volume isn't open interest\n\nBecause of this the rest of it is moot.\n\nYou make statements like \n\n> There are currently 8.2 million more shares than outstanding (before apes and dfv of course).Short total should be around 28million shares.Meaning 36.437 million shares need to be bought in order to cover.\n\nBut you don't know that they haven't already hedged their positions.\n\nAgain, options is *not* stock shorting, this is the options market which I and many others participate in to generate wealth.  Just because somebody doesn't believe in the over-hype doesn't mean they're short.  I wouldn't be that hesitant to buy PUTS on GME because with the right expiration they will absolutely print money.  I assume since you've dug up option flow that you are knowledgeable enough to understand how MM's delta-hedge positions with the goal of ensuring that by the time the closing prices exceeds the strike for calls they've sold, that they own 100% of the shares required to cover.  Gamma is acceleration and if they are over-exposed during a market with poor liquidity gamma's impact on their delta's enters them into the infinite feedback loop that they need to escape to control their hedging risk - this is one of the reasons circuit-breakers exist, to allow the market makers to re-base and determine how to get ahead of gamma since it's their job to make the market they should at least be protected from chaos.\n\nThere is far more at play here than 99% of you seem to realize.  This play was identified by HNWI's in December and it was executed in January.  There is evidence that the investment banks offered the shorts an exit-strategy that didn't end up in a squeeze and the shorts refused to take it - then the stock squeezed.   I don't pretend to know what's going to happen next here but many of you are very disillusioned into thinking that you hold the HF's hostage.  They are protected.  They were protected when the brokers stopped allowing buying and their positions are protected now because they aren't just going to let that happen again.  These people aren't stupid, maybe greedy, but they understand how the market works and have access to information and liquidity that retail does not.

People buying-in at $265 with money that they can't afford to lose thinking that shares are going to $1000 is a sure thing is just poor risk management.  Maybe it will, I hope it does, but from my analysis if it doesn't happen this week I strongly doubt the trade will continue to be profitable from these entry-points.  \n\nThe problem is, and this is where I take issue with your analysis (and others as well) is there is no way to be accurate and such analysis propagates the belief that the hive wants to hear: HF's are short a % of float that isn't tenable and the squeeze is still on.  Just as much as I can't say that it is, I can't say that it isn't, I accept that, but I tend to be believe the results from S3 partners who does this for money and has clearly stated that the SI is below 20% at this point in time.

Everyone holding together does work, if nobody trades there will never be price movement, but the really scary part for me today is that almost nobody is buying.  It looks like a lot of HFT and day trader volume to me.  I don't think anyone is excited to get in at $220 after todays performance, so who is going to move the price up to $300+ to force some options ITM?  Also the options chain is probably hedged up to $350 at this point, so it is going to take some significant volume to move the price.   Per my previous points I feel like this is the last week.  I think that if HF's are actually overly short at this point they will probably wait it out.  The cost to borrow GME shares to short is 0.7%, that's a far cry from the 85% it was in January.  Enough volume has happened that the shorts could have rotated out and are short @ $280 and not $40.

The closer they are to neutral, the more money they make. \n\nWhen you sell a call, you need to hedge the downside risk (call ends up ITM) with an asset that will perfectly track the fluctuations in price of the underlying. In this case, why not just use the underlying? So they do. If delta is 0.1, for every $1 the stock moves, the option moves $0.10. so to get that same effect, you could buy 10 shares. \n\nWhen you sell a put, it is exactly the same in reverse. Your downside risk is that the price plummets and the put goes ITM. So how do you profit off an asset price falling? You either sell your existing shares, or you short sell new ones. Delta on the put is -0.1, then for every $1 the stock drops, the price of the put increases by $0.10. so the MM's need to make money on the price falling. To get the same effect, they can short sell 10 shares. \n\nFrom a MM perspective though, why would you buy shares that you are short? And why would you short sell shares that are sitting in your account? So they don't. They only hedge the difference between the open interest in the calls and puts. So if there were 10 calls open with 0.1 delta, and 9 puts open with -0.1 delta, they are going to buy only 10 shares and then they are delta neutral.\n\nEdit: gamma ramping only exists when there is a massive difference in open interest between calls and puts.

It always ends the same: my account is in disarray, I feel a sense of hopelessness, and everything in my life I'd worked toward to that point is eviscerated by terms like \"Stimulus Checks set to arrive...\"\n\nBut *this* time...this time it really could be different.  **The FOMC is coming up this week starting March 16th**.  [For the unitiated, this is an event where not much is often decided but much is bet on; the FED gives their guidance in matters including—but not limited to--Quantitive Easing, Interest Rate speculation, and Bond Yield Curve control.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/think.ing.com/amp/article/us-what-to-watch-at-the-march-fed-meeting/)  Market volatility precedes it, as the oracles all scramble to determine what poppa Pow might or might not say or do—if the man farted into the microphone and walked away, VXX would probably climb 15%...the tension is *palpable*.\n\n**This one couldn’t come at a more precarious time, as good news is now bad news**.  As reopening moves full steam ahead and we get a massive injection of economic stimulus, people are beginning to stop taking JPow at his word.  He promises a steady hand, he promises no interest rate increases, he says bond yield curve control is always on the table....and yet deep pockets flee en masse from stonks and into treasuries as the good times roll. \n\n**You see, the problem with the FED right now is no matter what they say, investors see the inevitable trend**.  They're betting there is only so long the FED can continue to artificially support the market--and only so long there will be reason to-- as indexes roar, the actual economy improves, and vaccine distribution is, for the most part, on track to return us to a world of pseudo-normalcy by summer.  It doesn't help that the FED stays verbally doveish while quietly doing things like declining to speak on Yield Curves definitively during speaking engagements, and [quietly ended the term repo m lending program](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/fed-ending-term-repos-reflects-liquidity-feast-for-dealers). \n\n**My choice here is between treasury-tickers and the VXX**-- last time I was making this choice I went with VXX on the DD, and that choice didn't pan out until the second week.  I said then, reflecting on that week’s losers, that I should have chosen treasuries...**so why didn’t I this time with the opportunity right here?**  *VXX is just absurdly low right now, trading under $14*.  I'm not saying the pop will happen Tuesday or Wednesday, but it may, and dollars to donuts if you hold a VXX 14 or 14.50c 4/1 you'll make some money at some point if you don't hold too long after it makes a run.  Also, if Jerome breathes a word about Yield Control they will plummett. \n\n**This intro is also my way of admitting my confidence level this week is low—there is too much potential for chop**.  Sure, I could be wrong and we go to the moon once stimmies start hitting people’s accounts, and that argument is fair as I see some of the new age commodities mooning to ATH over the wekend.  But, for the most part, I'd rather put on a jimmy hat this week and hope my safe picks don't come back burning me.\n\nBut anyway, **you didn’t come here for my half-baked philosophy on impending market volatility.

They’re great!**\n\n**Last week’s lovers**: **DKNG** absolutely crushed it. **Tier 2**, on a sustained measurement over the week, actually defeated Tier 1.  **OCGN SQ EBAY** all had magnificent moments in the sun aided by that crazy **4% NASDAQ Day**.\n\n**Mid-week Pivot**: The **F** call mid-week was clutch on the 13c, and now it's sitting above that price to end the week.  Also, I know y'all were feeling the heat on that **T** mid-week pivot call, but Friday brought us the glory. I was sweating though 😅 \n\n**Last week’s lesson**: **GE** and **DIS** were hotter than shit wrapped in tin foil coming out the gate on Monday, then they hit us with that nasty curve.  **News broke that GE was closing a huge deal on Sunday, which gave me continued optimism, and then they just demolished the call holders with that fucking reverse split**--if you say you saw that coming, you's a damn lie.  DIS got great news, but it was crossing a key 200 resistance number (is that TA?  I don't know man, I think so), and couldn't hold.  I **think the key here is it’s okay to take a pause on the pick if it’s hot fresh out the gate the week of the RAMBO.  There will be more picks.  The other lesson here is that when the event is big enough, it plays like an earnings rather than a pump**.  DKNG, for example, had pump written all over it.  It was more about future potential than earnings in the description. Conversely, the GE annual event had an ER feel, particularly in articles I read Tuesday.  **Meme stock pump event=good.  Boomer stock boring investor event=be wary.  Stock crossing a big round resistance number leading into an event=watch how it behaves, and if it dips catch it post-event.**\n\n**”Never lost, just ran out of time”**: Someone pointed out in a comment the M 3/26 20c i went with from two DD's ago is puh-rinting.  Should've held I guess.  Womp Womp.\n\n***\n\n**Tier 1**: Dice I'm Rolling with this Week (intriguing whale bets, with RAMBO (non-ER pumps), sectors or tickers I like) *disclaimer: this may be choppy as week enter positions on dips, long dates*\n\n[MA](https://i.imgur.com/ufR3TrB.jpg) ([3/23 B of A electronic payments symposium](https://investor.mastercard.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))\n\nWhen I said playing it safe I guess I meant it lol.  MA is going from your grandfather's favorite holding to an interesting FinTech play that is showing malleability in a fast-paced industry.\n[They're doing cool stuff like this merger with Payoneer](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/fintech-payoneer-partners-with-mastercard-ahead-of-3-billion-spac-.html) and, for better or worse, they've joined the growing list of companies linking their perceived fate to the commodity that shall not be mentioned.  \n\nI just generally like the stock, but I think this conference presentation will be a great catalyst as they have a chance to expose some of their new school thinking and get some nice quotes for FinTwit pumps.  Getting in early in case stimulus excitement waves can give a little push in banking and financial processors, but weary of entry because of FOMC.\n\n[NOK](https://i.imgur.com/EL3aSk8.jpg) ([Nokia Capital Markets Day 3/18](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news-and-events/events-calendar/investor-relations-events/capital-markets-day/))\n\n**Me two paragraphs ago**: I'm playing it safe this week.  **Also me**: Let's pick a failed meme that is a favorite of foreign bots.  \n\nSomeone in the comments on my last DD was pumping this, and I kinda didn't pay it to much attention at first.  But, they had some interesting things say about NOK, and convinced me that the foreign de-listing wasn't as big a deal as people were intimating. \n\nSometimes you gotta plug your nose--*hate the stonk, love the RAMBO*.  **The general consensus around this event is that this is moment NOK needs to do SOMETHING to please investors**.  NOK is also sticking to the messaging that this a strategy reset of sorts.  The key pump factor here is *whether or not they will set a definitive dividend policy*--that's what I'm watching for.  If we get the dividend announcement, the sky is the limit.  If we don't, well, bail out quickly, because this sinking ship may head for Davey Jones' Locker (I'm so corny bruh 😭 ).\n\n[Somebody did a solid DD write-up on NOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m33vsq/full_diligence_post_on_nokia_nok_ahead_of_capital/) pre-event at r/investing.  I'm sure the sub will be appalled that I'm mining their shit for options speculation lol.\n\n[VXX](https://i.imgur.com/CdGUT8U.jpg) (FOMC March 16-18th discussing potential yield curve control, etc)\n\nThe intro pretty much states where I'm at on this. **I like the 14c 4/1**--my plan is to wait for an assumed green open Monday, and see if I can pick up a nice premium price just before the classic fade.  **I’m going to hold until it pops, through the FOMC RAMBO**, and if the markets don't go red i'll probably trim some for a loss but keep holding for a level of general volatility.  If we open red Monday, I'll let action settle and push out to the 14.50c probably.  I dunno, I'm just a dog chasing cars.\n\n***\n\n**Tier 2**: Watching with great interest\n\n[AAPL](https://i.imgur.com/C40J4QR.jpg): [Rumored product launch event on 3/23](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.indiatoday.in/amp/technology/news/story/apple-may-launch-airpods-3-ipad-pro-update-and-more-products-at-march-23-event-1777186-2021-03-09).

I'm genuinely not excited about this week, not gonna lie.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nThis week could be choppy with FOMC, so I'm grabbing some **VXX**, playing a longer **MA** call for a spicy safe haven, and buying **NOK** leading into their capital markets day as a purely speculative play.\n\n**AAPL** has a rumored product launch coming on the 23rd, **CRSR** has an interesting conference, and **GPRO** continues to recieve bullish whale bets.\n\nInbox always open.

IF it goes up or down one of those will be in the money. Usually, the hope is that the stock moves enough that the gain on the direction it moves offsets the loss in the other direction.\n\nBut, if the overall idea on VIX is that there's going to be frantic movement after JPow speaks, then what major movement can do is increase implied volatility (IV). When IV increases, all options increase in value because the underlying is moving more so the market makers want you to pay more because they have greater risk due to the larger movement (look at how GME can move 150 points per day).\n\nSo if IV increases enough, then it's possible that both the call and put will increase in value due to the IV. Then you're making money on the direction it moves because of both the IV and price change, and you're making money on the other direction because of the IV increase.\n\nIt depends on how much the IV increases. Right now IV is \\~70% for ATM contracts. If there's a major move, and it jumps to \\~150%, then you're making money on both sides. (GME, as a contrast, has IV of \\~350 for ATM contracts, which is why you're paying $40+ for those contracts).\n\nThe straddle reduces the risk of betting wrong. But it loses money if the underlying bet is wrong. That is, because you're buying both directions you need a big move. If it stays relatively stable, then the theta decay from buying Monday selling Tuesday will kill any profit. And since it's an IV play, you probably don't want to bet on many days of increased IV, so you're probably not holding till Friday unless you sell the opposite direction quickly and hold the direction it moved for a bit assuming it keeps going that way.", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I have a fucking migraine and I wish I could understand this post FML 😭", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "When you say green open under the DD on the VXX portion do you mean green on the S&P500 (and thus VXX even lower) before the 500 tanks a few points later?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yep, I feel like the Monday big open are always followed by massive profit takes within the hour", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "This week I can finally sell palantir and rebuy at 20$\n\n\nThanks fed!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I will keep an eye on it.

{"title": "OIL Prices to the MOON!!!! $RIG", "selftext": "Historical:\n\nOil prices have rallied over 100% from last year, after the kremlin and Saudi Arabia got into a disagreement last years OPEC meeting, which resulted in a 30% decline in oil over the weekend. The major issue was over the depth and extend of the oil cuts. Russia didnt believe in cutting oil, as they kept losing market share to American Oil companies. Saudi Arabia wanted to keep the prices propped up and extend the oil production cut agreement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis resulted in oil prices dropping to negative prices with added stress of covid 19. However, the biggest challenge to high oil prices was President Donald J. Trump. Prior to Covid 19, oil prices recovered from the 2014 oil crash in which oil prices fell to $20 a barrel. Oil prices reached prices as high as $80 per barrel. However, every time oil prices passed $70 a barrel he would tweet about the high prices, or give Saudi Arabia a call. However, Donnie T is gone, and we have a President Biden running the show. It is clear, from the past month, that president Biden is not willing to interfere and calm the market.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrediction:\n\nAs a result of the economy opening back up, vaccine distribution coming along, higher airline numbers,  Donald Trump is gone, and general compliance by the  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries I expect the oil prices to move past 80 dollars in the coming months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlay:\n\nI will play this environment by buying oil offshore drillers. My target company is $RIG. Rig has trippled in price since the start of the pandemic. While it does have 8 billion in debt, I think it could easily refinance this. Offshore drillers get paid per day by oil exploration companies to extract oil. This is called the day rate. At the low of the oil crash offshore drillers such as RIG were getting paid 150k, but that rate has reached a high of 350k. This will continue to increase as oil increases. Exploration companies have drastically reduced their operating investments. As the economy opens up, the exploration companies are going to be caught off their foot and will not be able to keep up with the oil demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$RIG is one of the few strong remaining offshore explorers that has survived the oil downturn. I like the stock and expect it to reach a high of $13 from its current price of $4.50. It has a market cap of 2 billion, 8 billion in debt, and around 8 billion in offshore contracts.  It has a book value of $18, while its price hovers at $4.5. A .5 or even 1 price to book value ratio indicates 100% - 400% upside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition Disclaimer:\n\n20 position in\n\nStrike Price 7\n\nExpiration 08/20/2021", "id": "m4ht4i", "created_utc": 1615676494.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "Wait didn't biden literally say he is moving away from the oil industry to renewable energy?", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "He is more likely to allow prices to rise to strengthen his position against fossil fuels.
