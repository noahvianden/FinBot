It fell underneath the 200 MA until it bottomed out and then it eventually recovered.\n\nAs of today, we are sitting right at 4,000 on the S&P 500 and the 200 MA is currently at ~3,000.

Some analysts predict it will happen much sooner.\n\n\\- VW can exploit something Tesla doesn‚Äôt have much of yet: scale. Dozens of brands that fill every nook and cranny of the auto market‚Äîand sales last year of 9.3 million vehicles (compared to TSLA's 0.5 million).\n\n\\- By 2025, VW and its partners will have more than 35,000 public chargers around the world, and planning half a dozen battery factories in EU.\n\n\\- VW aims to sell 26 million EVs  in the next 10 years\n\n\\- Other legacy auto makers following suit (e.g. GM planning to phase out diesel cars by 2035, Hyundai planning almost two dozen new models, Renualt having a super hit in EU with model Zoe, Ford's Mustang Mach-E)\n\n\\- Chinese companies rolling out budget EV models\n\n\\- Tons of new companies/SPACs (Rivian, Lucid, etc)\n\n\\- Just like netflix that paved the way for streaming video is now facing great competition from \"legacy\" companies like disney, HBO, amazon, etc, TSLA will also face the same struggle with the EV market, specially when the giants like Apple, Amazon, Google have EV ambitions of themselves\n\n\\- (maybe positive for TSLA) the biggest automaker in the world Toyota, still not fully committed to EV, and some major automakers like BMW do not think \"only EV after year xxxx\" is a good strategy because there are like 160 countries/markets to consider\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOpinion:\n\n\\- would have been nice to get some analysis about the software/AI aspect, as that is one of the main thing that TSLA is way ahead of others and legacy car makers seem to be struggling with\n\n\\- Chinese companies barely mentioned (and also aspects such as the recent Chinese rule of not using TSLA cars in military sensitive areas due to the cameras, which may give acceleration to LADAR based cars rather than camera based Evs, and I doubt TSLA will shift to that one..)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI thin the EV pie is very big and there is room for many. TSLA will be dominant for at least the next few years (maybe until 2025) and then maybe others will catch up if they play their cards right and some politics (like China) plays in their favour.\n\nPS: I don't have a position in TSLA (wanted to get in when it dipped but was waiting for sub 550 which didn't happen). I have small position in VW and Nio.\n\nEDIT 1: Just for the heck of it, I just bought a couple of TSLA at 655.\n\nEDIT 2: added 2 more TSLA at 638. \n\n&#x200B;", "id": "mc11i8", "created_utc": 1616575837.0, "score": 391, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 472, "comments": [{"body": "Well I guess VW has massive capacities and experience in manufacturing cars.

Netflix w/ streaming and Tesla w/ EVs.\n\nBut that's where the similarities ends. Tesla in the EV space is the same as the other \"legacy\" companies in the streaming space that you mentioned such as Disney and Amazon.\n\nWhy? Because Tesla does NOT only do EVs, unlike Netflix where they seem to ONLY do streaming services.\n\nTesla is in many other spaces just like Disney and Amazon is as well. They do not only focus in only one space. In the auto business, the \"legacy\" ICE companies only focus on making vehicles just like Netflix only focus on their streaming service.\n\nWhat other services does Tesla provides that legacy ICE companies might not?\n\nSolar (Solar panels & solar roofs):\n\n- Tesla's solar business slowed down because of the Model 3, they had to get their solar workers to help build Model 3s instead of solar. But now they are starting to focus more on the solar business as well with the solar roof expanding into more regions. Once Tesla solar roofs is in every state, and there are many more roofing companies trained to install them, their price will slowly decrease and be much more appealing compared to installing solar panels over existing roofs. But even then if someone does want to do that, Tesla also has one of the best solar panels as well.\n\nBattery storage:\n\n- Texas showed us why we need solar and battery storage. Many businesses are buying huge Mega packs of batteries from Tesla. Residential homeowners are also buying Tesla powerwalls.\n\nInsurance:\n\n- Tesla has their own insurance now, but so far it seems to be only in California. That means their insirance business still has a huge room for growth as it expands to other states and countries where they sell Teslas.\n\nNo dealerships:\n\n- Consumer buys directly from Tesla, no middlemen needed to increase prices so they can make their own profits as well, in which every other legacy companies have to deal with and cut into their margins.\n\nNo advertisements:\n\n- Tesla spends $0 on advertising. They know that anyone buying an EV will be people who uses the internet. Basically anyone who uses the internet knows what Tesla is. https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-spent-0-ad-money-per-vehicle-sold-2019-vs-hyundai-2k-lincoln-1-9k-jaguar-1-5k This link shows that some Legacy auto maker spends $1.5-2k per car on advertising. Advertising, dealerships and probably having to license out software such as self driving from companies like Google will all greatly eat into their margins. When Tesla is making EVs at the same price as them, those extra costs that Legacy automakers have to do will allow for Tesla to have an edge on them for competitive pricing while most likely having larger margins.\n\nFactories designed for EVs:\n\n- Legacy auto makers will have to spend a lot of money to convert their ICE making factories into EV factories. Tesla already has 2 more giga factories being built to increase their production. And it seems that everything Tesla makes is getting sold out, so their problem right now is not enough factories.\n\nEV in every category:\n\n- By 2025 Tesla will most likely have their Semis, pick-up trucks and new roadster available. They might also have their cheap \"hatchback\" $25k model by then as well. So far there isn't any other company that has an EV in as much categories that Tesla does.\n\nSelf-driving:\n\n- Yes there are some companies working on self-driving as well, like Google Waymo. But they don't make cars, so big legacy companies that aren't working on self-driving will have to license that from other companies like Google or even from Tesla as well. This will eat into their costs, same as having to deal with dealerships.\n\nData:\n\n- Tesla has collected tons of data. They have many cars in beta FSD testing collecting even more data for them to keep enhancing their FSD.\n\nSuperchargers:\n\n- Tesla is basically selling EVs and also their own \"gas station\" as well with superchargers in many locations and only expanding.

Many Western countries have young people locked out of their housing markets, many of those would be home buyers will be looking for alternative investments (and possibly have more time to research investments if they're stuck at home), and there has been a rise in apps like sharesies that allows them to put the (relatively, for investing) tiny amounts of money they would usually spend on takeaways etc into shares, the overall effect of which has pushed prices up. A lot of investments related to \"trendy\" things like veganism, environmental stuff, Tesla, and that kind of thing have all experienced quite a bit of growth from what I've seen, though I will admit that I haven't looked too far into it, which fits with this idea as people usually invest in what they know. \n\nCombine this with younger people having notoriusly short attention spans these days and often poor ability to delay gratification, as well as often not being super financially stable and needing to draw from those investments to cover expenses - especially if they've lost their jobs in the later waves of lockdowns - and it's inevitable that they will start selling off what they've brought.

It's painful to watch and scary, but like Warren Buffett said, \"The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.\"  I have both GME and AMC and the last few days has been really shitty because unlike many here who may have bought in early, I am holding my shares at $274/share for GME and about $13 for AMC, so I have seen over half of my money evaporate in GME while waiting for the squeezes or hopefully the gamma squeeze.  I think that probably the most important thing that I have learned from everyone here is how to hold my shares and not panic when they suddenly drop like they did today.  Of course, it makes me hate the hedge funds even more and think very violent thoughts about what I'd like to do to the hedge fund manages who I view as criminals.  But, after spending many sleepless nights thinking and talking today with a good friend of mine who works in banking, I have come to the understanding that I hold my shares in a company for a reason.  The reason has to be more than simply thinking that my shares will be worth more tomorrow.  In order to be like Warren Buffett, in order to be a true investor, one must have conviction about the company or thing in which we are placing our hard earned money.  When I bought my first shares of GME in January, I had no conviction about the stock and it was the first stock that I had ever purchased.  I also bought it as it was crashing from it high just after the squeeze.  I really had no idea what I was getting myself into and I certainly wasn't aware of the risks.  Now, however, I have a  better understanding and I've done a lot of reading  and I'm thankful for the DD that gets posted here.  I do have some real hope for both GME and AMC now and I see them as companies that can be successful in the future because of recent events.  I also feel a camaraderie with my fellow ape brothers and sisters here on reddit, and I am committed to the cause of exposing the illegal actions of hedge firms and seeking some kind of punishments and justice for their crimes.  In terms of other stocks that I hold, even though I have seen them losing and some of them plummeting, I purchased them because I thought that the companies have serious potential for the future.  Maybe other investors or institutions don't see the potential now and are either shorting them or lowering their valuation another way, but it is my conviction that their future value will be undeniable.  So, looking at your stocks, some of which I own and many of which I would like to buy and hold, I think that, in my novice but educated opinion based on my research, you've made great choices and have fantastic companies, and they will perform well in the future.  The markets are bumpy now, but in 10 years it will only be a tiny blip.  This is only my smooth brained ape personal opinion.  In conclusion, if you buy a stock to hold long term, have a good conviction for wanting to own it and don't let others sway your beliefs. As for GME and AMC,  my desire is that we squeeze the hedge funds to death. Though I won't get rich from it, and honestly at this point I would be relieved to recover my losses and have my wife not so angry with me,  I will be happy for my fellow apes here who do become wealthy and do good things with their profits to help others.  I am proud to hodl with all of you here and I wish you all success in whatever you do.  Thank you for teaching me to have conviction and diamond hands!

I should have gotten out Feb 19 on options day but stupidly stuck in. Made back some losses with raising cash in rising weeks and entering into certain themes ( semi-equipment) and some day trading. Few points:\n\nMix the stock structure \n1. Any stock that has no revenues is a 5 year play.\n2. Those with no cash flow are 3 year play. \n3. Newly listed companies often down by half peak to trough in first year. Dip in, buy more later. \n3. Earnings - don't care because look at cash but dividends +ve, cash on balance sheet +ve, & insider buying (with own cash, not stock options) +ve \n4. Balance sheet critical - cash, debt, equity, .. many of the \"cyclicals\" have huge debt! And so many tech names have 0 debt (they instead do secondary equity offerings, I'm ok with that, but I hate debt). Tell me, when rates go up, which of the 2 will get their earnings crushed (unless their debt is decades out)? So why exactly is 0 debt tech getting crushed? Anyway, mix it and if in cyclical and industrials check their debt maturities.  \n\nMix financial structures\n1. Bad time for aggressive options trading for most of us .. set alerts and buy shares outright .. no leverage, no debt\n2. A lot has been said about how high the 10 year yield is now. Might come down Q2.. trading call options in tech in rising long yields difficult \n3. I missed the trade on oil futures ramping up 6% yesterday because I got too smart .. Suez has oil pipes down the canal to feed the oil off ships in case of a problem like yesterday (Javier blas, bloomberg). Rest of world forgot that part and oil shot up. But nothing for LNG as I can see .. I don't know yet how to play European lng (Henry hub, too much delay), probably too late now.\n4. Traded options on Bac, Wfc, .. until Jan. Now worried post SLR. If they get 20% cheaper, I'd be happier to enter.\n5. Airlines - I have Aaww for cargo.  I used to have Luv - good balance sheet, not intl / business travel dependent. if it gets cheap enough, will enter again. \n6. Energy's difficult. Trade in out xom, cvx and others with 7+% dividend yields but have had massive run up since summer already. Will wait for oil prices to go to low 50s first (were almost there 2 days ago) .. don't see 100 oil. \n7. Semiconductor & semi equipment - have traded (and still in some) Amat, asml, amd, nvda, lrcx, himx, amkr, cohu, plab, etc, there are so many more. Love this space. So many small ones with great balance sheets. Big ones more expensive but good tailwinds.\n\nLast .. follow ..\n1. Cnbc for themes but not names. And take themes to next derivative .. a) copper up - good for FCX, but GOLD is also 15-20% copper, whichever is cheaper. b) INTC announces boundary plans - good for semi-equip (Ps. Tom Lee on cnbc good on themes).\n2. Stanley Druckenmiller - GOAT - he doesn't lie, doesn't lecture, doesn't self-promote .. he warned us early Feb to \"buckle up\" for a \"wild ride\" this year.

As yields get tastier, institutions add bonds back in to get back to their holy 60/40 portfolio allocations.

{"title": "Description of ATM Offerings for confused GME apes", "selftext": "Per the title, I'm seeing a lot of confusion regarding what an at-the-market (\"ATM\") offering entails, and what the consequences of such an offering would be. Lots of GME apes are seeing the following language (from the 10-K) and are confused/scared:\n\n*In December 2020, we entered into the ATM Program. Sales of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Program may be made by means of transactions that are deemed to be an \"at the market offering\" as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act, including block transactions, sales made directly on the NYSE or sales made into any other existing trading markets of our shares of Class A Common Stock.*¬†\n\nApes are worried the share price will decline, etc., so I thought I'd do a (relatively) brief post to provide some info and hopefully calm some fears. **TLDR at the bottom.**\n\n**First, what is an ATM offering?**\n\nIn a sentence, an ATM offering is an offering where the Company issues securities over time directly into an existing trading market at the market price.\n\n**Why do Companies conduct ATM offerings?**\n\nFor $$$. Basically, it gives companies the opportunity to raise measured amounts of equity capital over time by allowing a company to tap into the existing secondary market for its shares on an as-and-when-needed basis.¬†\n\n**How are ATM offerings unique from traditional underwritten follow-on offerings?**\n\nIn contrast to traditional underwritten offerings, where a Company issues a fixed # of shares at a fixed price, all at once, in an ATM offering, the Company retains control over the timing and size of each sale.\n\nSales of the Company‚Äôs shares, which can be newly issued ‚Äúprimary‚Äù shares and/or ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù shares held by existing security holders, are made through one or more registered broker-dealers who act as agents on the issuer‚Äôs behalf.\n\n**What are the advantages of an ATM offering?**\n\n**Minimal market impact.**\n\nThis is likely the *MOST IMPORTANT* advantage for us apes\n\nBecause in an ATM offering program, the securities are sold in small batches over time, the Company can incrementally sell shares into the natural trading flow of the market, without having to market and/or announce the offering. As a result, shares are able to ‚Äútrickle‚Äù into the market, limiting the impact on the issuer‚Äôs stock price. Additionally, investors cannot short the issuer‚Äôs stock in advance of the offering since the timing of any particular sale is not known.\n\n**Flexibility.**\n\nThe timing and size of an ATM offering are at the Company‚Äôs discretion, which means the Company can match its capital structure to its ongoing needs. For example, the Company can implement a limit price below which sales will not occur and/or a percentage limitation on daily sales to reduce downward price pressure on its stock, as well as dilution.\n\n**Low Cost.**\n\nThe distribution costs for ATM offerings typically are less than for traditional follow-on offerings, and the absence of a company commitment to sell means that there will be no sales below acceptable share prices.\n\n**What are the disadvantages of an ATM offering?**\n\nThe main disadvantage is that because ATM offerings tend to be substantially smaller than traditional follow-on offerings, they aren‚Äôt as useful to companies trying to raise a large amount of capital.\n\nThis disadvantage doesn‚Äôt really impact GME nor does it impact us stockholders. In fact, we could read this as a positive in that GME isn‚Äôt trying to raise a ton of money right now because they don‚Äôt need it!\n\n**TLDR**: Don‚Äôt freak out over the fact that GME adopted an ATM program allowing the Company to issue more shares. An ATM Offering is a much more favorable alternative to a traditional underwritten offering and in reality doesn‚Äôt impact stock prices in any significant way. If anything, the fact that GME would choose an ATM offering over any other type could mean they‚Äôre thinking about us apes ;)\n\n**TLDR to TLDR**: HODL üíéüôå\n\n**Disclaimer**: This is a very scaled-down overview of how ATM offerings work. Do your own research if you‚Äôd like to learn more ‚Äì there are a lot of memos and articles out there with good information.  Also feel free to comment/PM me if you want to correct and/or supplement this post with more info.\n\n**Edit**: Thought I should post my position - holding 88 shares @ average of $97.29.\n\n**Edit 2**: Thought people would read the blurb above taken from the 10-K, which states that the company initiated the ATM offering program in **December 2020**, but it looks like they're not so I wanted to highlight that here. This means the option to have an ATM offering has been around since LAST YEAR. They didn't initiate when the stock price was rocketing up to $400+ and frankly, there's nothing to indicate that they plan on conducting an ATM offering any time soon. See below from the Liquidity & Capital Resources section of their 10-K to help calm your smooth brains some more:\n\n*Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.*", "id": "mbsicz", "created_utc": 1616544005.0, "score": 701, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 120, "comments": [{"body": "I also like the fact that this basically means that GME *can get* action on their own short squeeze.

CRSR has a market cap of $2.9B. In 2020 CRSR had total revenues of $1.7B, and 2021 revenue is  expected to match or exceed 2020‚Äôs 55% yearly growth year over year.  This means that Corsair's market cap trades at a modest 1.7x yearly revenue. For reference LOGI had twice the revenue of CRSR at $3.7B in 2021, but has a whopping 6.1x larger market cap $17.87B. Logitech is definitely not an overvalued ticker, and has a history of steady moderate growth. It is in fact Corsair that is drastically and exceedingly **UNDERVALUED**.\n\n[YOY Revenue](https://preview.redd.it/rp1rbc5ilwo61.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a0bb4a938136634ed788428f56b7254952c5d0d)\n\nAdd to this CorsairGaming Inc‚Äôs $160 million cash position and on financials alone it‚Äôs simple to see why this company is a prime  candidate for continued heavy accumulation. Due to inevitable  exponential growth of product market share and impending increase to appropriate company valuation from current levels, I sincerely believe it is just a matter of time before both institutional investors and opportunistic retail buyers swallow up the few **CRSR** shares available.\n\n[Positive Cash Flow Growth](https://preview.redd.it/988vkdkklwo61.jpg?width=1168&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fd1eb75814973221f5fae8eda2c3b28abbb8ebd)\n\nTo make it even more attractive factor in that CRSR products have a cult like following and are to the PC world the equivalent of what \"Jordans\" are to the sneaker market. *As a heads up I gladly want to share that I currently have holdings of CRSR common stock, this may or may not influence my bias and/or analysis; Anything  herein stated does not constitute nor is intended as professional  financial advice.*\n\n[Assets and Liabilities](https://preview.redd.it/rxdg97uolwo61.jpg?width=1169&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bc4e1b1d422168344518639fa02ece733f8e758)\n\nA large majority of the best builds on [r/battlestations](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlestations/) use CRSR products in one way or another. A quick search on Amazon for Corsair products and you can see that:\n\n1. They are very highly rated.\n2. They have a lot of reviews.\n3. They sell products at better margin than competition.\n\nCustomers are willing to pay a premium for certain products or brands, similar to AAPL or LULU buyers don't mind shelling out extra for the cream of the crop. Corsair can be described as a blue ocean millennial stock since  there is no comparable peer competitor that is publicly listed. While long term growth seems a given, there is also optimistic news in the near term.\n\n[CRSR Products](https://preview.redd.it/ki8oyd0ulwo61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=49e633fe5d01c0a06c802edae93bef2c086d6f97)\n\nIn the next couple of days Round 3 stimulus money is gonna post to Robinhood accounts and is expected to magnify the Reddit sweetheart stocks (NOK, PLTR, NIO, CRSR, AMD, AMC, BB, TSLA etc.). **CRSR** has a synergistic multiplier as a result of aforementioned stimulus  funds; Stimulus money will be used to purchase both Corsair Shares and Corsair products.\n\nI was excited about Corsair way before it was publicly traded, but extensive due diligence into the company's financials and knowledge of corresponding product market trends facilitates very **Bullish**  speculation. Based on both public facts and personal assumptions, now appears to be a favorable time to dedicate a sizeable long position into  CRSR.\n\n[CRSR High-End Rig](https://preview.redd.it/mhnnonpvlwo61.jpg?width=2850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=918d29a2419d4f8227d92f1a41f58d06a309b6cb)\n\n*Bearish Possibilities*: Unfavorable shift in product market trends, overall tech sector weakness, rapid IPO growth, and also that it's unknown to those not  familiar with the high-end PC markets.\n\nPositions: 1,000 shares bought @ $32.31, 113 contracts May 21 2021 35C\n\nWaiting on funds to clear so I can buy a couple more shares and ITM 4-16-21 calls.\n\n**TL;DR**: CRSR is the premium high-end PC component company, it is both a value play and a growth stock.

{"title": "SLV is a complete scam, its a scalp trade set up by banks to screw over investors. Avoid it at all costs. The silver market is and has been rigged for years", "selftext": " WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.\n\nThink about who reads weekend financial news. Old people. The last time silver had a real short squeeze was in the 70s, and these people are now in their 70s. Who clicks on ads? Basically only old people. Dealers of gold and silver love to advertise, and media likes to make money through click-through revenue. Of course they are going to post all these stories of small unit silver selling out at dealers, they will get higher click through and sales kickbacks from the targeted ads on these articles.\n\nIf you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong. **Purchasing SLV is the best way for an investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.**\n\nI have done some research on SLV and I have come to believe that it is essentially a vehicle for JPM and other banks to crush retail investors by manipulating the silver market.\n\nSo what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played?\n\n**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.**\n\nJeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,\n\n‚ÄúIn terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeff Currie of Goldman\n\nThis was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault. They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it‚Äôs the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself, so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX. Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all. So how is the ETF shorting silver?\n\nThey aren‚Äôt. The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs. Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors. He truly meant what he said.\n\nWhat is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF.\n\nBut no real open market purchases of silver are occurring. Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows. **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.** When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange. As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price. It‚Äôs a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits. Here‚Äôs a diagram to help you sort it out:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/ewkug02chwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=a424d1a61b93e9a37541cdf8ff19591a3df9fb88)\n\nAn even more clear admission that SLV doesn‚Äôt impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future. What does this even mean? Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn‚Äôt participate in the real silver market, that‚Äôs actually not the case. What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market. They will not purchase additional silver to accommodate inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to.\n\nThe real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn‚Äôt actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange. SLV doesn‚Äôt purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural.\n\nFor example, when millions of people buy GME stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise.\n\nWhen millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.\n\nBut when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker.\n\nSo how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows? Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‚Äòbank participation report‚Äô which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.\n\nThe chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF. The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market. The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021. I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks‚Äô net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vpm42uehwo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=5feb48c0ce3ce1a2a55280e7ec2f79b8b7f33c0a\n\nIt is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions. What‚Äôs also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze, just not by using SLV.\n\nOne other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It‚Äôs likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before a potential squeeze happens (having seen what happened with GME).\n\nFor further evidence of this theme of, ‚ÄúIf banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall‚Äù look no further than the deliveries data itself,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e6gnlo7ghwo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb6ff867907a4de54a27876835cad96ac00ad46e\n\nYou‚Äôll notice that as long as futures investors didn‚Äôt actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed an uptick, the price would begin to fall once again. This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery. Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need?\n\nBut just like the graph of the bank net short position, you‚Äôll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries. The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.\n\nAnd lest you think I‚Äôm reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwjolfmhhwo61.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1804172cace87c2fb285f1f13bad1d5dcef374\n\nFor JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.\n\nSLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets. Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?\n\nAnd let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8kbb08xihwo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7da347b06b44433082ab041d11f35d1563c8919a\n\nFurther exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn‚Äôt required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur. I‚Äôm not saying the silver isn‚Äôt there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence?\n\nSo what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?\n\nWell, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery). Further, PSLV buys its silver directly, it doesn‚Äôt have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace. And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.\n\nThis is what is starting to happen right now, a premium has developed among primary dealers, and deliveries on the COMEX have started to surge, while COMEX inventories have begun to decline. And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks (once the small contingent of silver squeezers realized SLV was a scam and started switching). Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.\n\nEven a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because **they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise**, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.\n\nAfter the original silver squeeze posts went viral on WSB on 1/27, silver rose massively over the first 3 trading days following it. But on 1/31 a post was made about citadel being long SLV which got 74k upvotes (compared to only 15k on the original silver post). This lead to a fizzling in the momentum for the silver squeeze movement on WSB. However, given what I've explained here about how SLV is a complete scam meant to screw over investors, is it really that much of a surprise?\n\nAdditionally, that post about citadel showed them with $130m in SLV. That's only 0.04% of Citadel's AUM. Do you really think they were pushing silver because 0.04% of their AUM was in SLV? This post also didn't detail the fact that citadel also had short positions on SLV. That's what a market maker does. They have long and short positions in just about everything.\n\nThere are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‚Äògreen‚Äô commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver.\n\nLets dig into the potential for a silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself.\n\nSilver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity. So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‚Äòroll‚Äô them over to a future date. Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn‚Äôt exist, then the market wouldn‚Äôt be a true market for silver. Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality.\n\nIndustrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don‚Äôt typically do it through the futures market. They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass. They only do it if they really have to. Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery. Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market.\n\nMost shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver. The COMEX has an inventory of ‚Äòregistered‚Äô silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight. But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers.\n\nSo how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently?\n\nLet‚Äôs take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u6vl4z3lhwo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=97d96e5ee4fcc5553bb267603f764a0378123dec\n\nAfter adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered. This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find.\n\nEven more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis (which I also showed earlier)\n\nNote: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4wjuwfmhwo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=03f45022e0f2d1702d5c3e0aaa2877a654ed884b\n\nAs you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic. While silver doesn‚Äôt need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze. The 2001-2011 rally didn‚Äôt involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‚Äòonly‚Äô caused silver to rise 10x. In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.\n\nIn fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9907dfnnhwo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d5859b4c8cd42a66118d62e6d1a97f2364d774\n\nAs you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‚Äòeligible‚Äô category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered. It is called ‚Äòeligible‚Äô because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven‚Äôt taken it out of the warehouse. It is technically eligible become ‚Äòregistered‚Äô if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell.\n\nThe current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort. And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American. If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX. That‚Äôs how tight this market is.\n\nRight now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check. If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher.\n\nAnd lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract‚Äôs open interest is trending at a record high level:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olei0ejphwo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53aa870cf012bdeff94fb0b9f4d07ab8127813f\n\nIt looks almost unreal. And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves. That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llu9bzoqhwo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd538ecd2ad375f52aa20ae9932d3b795832f322\n\n12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year‚Äôs February totals by a multiple of 4x. Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.\n\nApril‚Äôs open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces. 20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.\n\nHere‚Äôs what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n706c9yrhwo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=78c23017586291a4f7efc66a274c8f1c9a99b4f3\n\nSo just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)? Well let‚Äôs look at the next active delivery month of May:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppuloa0thwo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=680a8cfba0f920b008a6660f52f35d45d82557db\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fkh2bdfxhwo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=86c2bf46c9b547b8e0b0cfe109639ad283a832e7\n\nIf a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%. Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.\n\nNo long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‚Äòforce majeure‚Äô and defaults on its delivery obligations. This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won‚Äôt get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic. As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.\n\nOf course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough. Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.\n\nThere were always shares of GME available to purchase, it‚Äôs just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders. The GME short squeeze may indeed continue, because in this situation it‚Äôs millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can‚Äôt force them to sell.\n\nIn the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that‚Äôs exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, they actually forced them to sell. The difference this time is that it‚Äôs not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing a few ounces of silver each from around the globe. There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there‚Äôs no basis to stop the squeeze.\n\nIn the squeeze of 1979-1980, the regulators literally pulled a ‚ÄòGameStop‚Äô on the silver market. Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‚Äòsilver‚Äô. The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it‚Äôs not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it‚Äôs millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each. There is no cornering the market going on. This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them. They‚Äôve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion. Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors.\n\nBut what about beyond a short squeeze? Is there any logic to buying silver on a fundamentals basis?\n\nThere are two types of bull markets in silver. One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand. The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze. Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets.\n\nI believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.\n\nSmoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, and are signaling another generational bull market.\n\nSo what are these ‚Äòsmoke alarms‚Äô?\n\nI recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle.\n\nI ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‚Äòsmoke‚Äô.\n\nThe components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.\n\nLets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP. More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ltu4vgovhwo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=de4f9f2f0748ca3d86e8cf153175efa78901435d\n\nWhen this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply.\n\nOne thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at. Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‚Äòvaluation‚Äô level of silver.\n\nEnter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‚Äòsmoke alarm‚Äô that is the signal to start buying. In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.\n\nBelow, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP).\n\nMore specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))\n\nBelow you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5m8y7kzyhwo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=1073a6fa09e9b1151a162b79172d673af515fc93\n\nI want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.\n\nSince 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.\n\nThe first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high). Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater). Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested. Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation). This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.\n\nThe second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011. Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‚Äòlost decade‚Äô for equities. The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period. Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation). There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market.\n\nOver the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples. And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms. Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse. Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ir5gcfv0iwo61.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e02b95d63beea8de9b7e067cc40655d7a59da16\n\nI in no way think this is coming to the United States. I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse. Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn‚Äôt necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade.\n\nBack to SMOEC though:\n\nThe third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91. Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade‚Äôs massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs). Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021. Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver‚Äôs SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.\n\nRemember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver. Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations. (LN scale because silver is nature‚Äôs money, so it just felt right)\n\nThe yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/af5yjg13iwo61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34ac3ae181c742c4ab2dbf30f64ae82648d84ac\n\n**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out. And there‚Äôs really no reason it must stop there.**\n\nThe recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement modern monetary policy with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue. This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring. Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more). The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended. What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0e9ncqp4iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a08435c70609ca534ca672815cc2095358ef5a\n\nThis inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates. And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/esd1tzp5iwo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c26a1673a48f884c3e3cba23ef3d393cfc5eac9\n\nInflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant. They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed. As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don‚Äôt see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it‚Äôs rumored the upcoming ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.\n\nThis is the trap that the fed finds itself in. Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation‚Äôs debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high. So they won‚Äôt raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself. They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high). So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can‚Äôt raise rates at a time of expanding inflation? The value of the dollar. We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform).\n\nThe other problem with the fed‚Äôs policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment. In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies. Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation.\n\nRobotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job. The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years. At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years.\n\nThe business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now. This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too. Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well. There‚Äôs also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well. Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting. The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates.\n\nOn top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don‚Äôt need 2 accounting departments after all). How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable. Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well.\n\nThe fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors). **The fed‚Äôs solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they‚Äôll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.** And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need? And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver.\n\nAnd guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input? Silver. Silver‚Äôs industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable. So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further.\n\nOne might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It‚Äôs also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mnfd5gr7iwo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=34c7b3ddfc9808b29e08bd7619d47d1f51f840fc\n\nThe spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don‚Äôt worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn‚Äôt much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren‚Äôt going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon. The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation.\n\nDuring these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren‚Äôt necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer. I can guarantee most people don‚Äôt even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any. A move back into having even a small precious metals allocation is what drives silver up by 30x or more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: SLV is a scam, as are basically all of the silver ETFs.**\n\nIf you do want to buy silver you'll buy physical when premiums are low, or PSLV.\n\nDisclaimer: I am a random guy on the internet and this entire post should be regarded as my personal opinion", "id": "mbx510", "created_utc": 1616559034.0, "score": 24626, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 2484, "comments": [{"body": "Holy shit dude..had to make sure I was in the right sub when I realized you posted a doctoral thesis.", "score": 5428, "replies": [{"body": "After the first graph I was already fading.

Most demand is industrial, then you have things like jewelry and silverware.\n\nThese are rough numbers, but you end up with around 200 million ounces of demand left for physical / ETPs (investment demand).\n\nSo when people say the silver market is too big to influence, we don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù the entire silver market, we just need to add additional demand to what is already there.\n\n100 million ounces would be a 50% increase to the investment part of the demand. \n\nForget the squeeze and bringing down the bullion banks for a minute, just look at supply and demand and it‚Äôs inevitable the price of silver will rise with demand.\n\nOnce silver is broken free from the artificial price manipulation that has been keeping it down, the price will rise higher and at a greater rate than if this was just a simple supply and demand situation. \n\nMaybe everyone can‚Äôt afford 20 ounces of silver, maybe you can only buy once ounce or one share of PSLV (there are other products similar to PSLV if you are in a country where you can not buy PSLV or things like vaulting services), every little bit helps, many people have already and will buy much more than 20 ounces so it evens out. \n\nBe a part of something bigger.

I decided to look at 3rd party opinions (can find a lot of videos on YouTube) from the silver industry/miners, and it is amazing how similar GME and silver are. The biggest indicator is, 1 oz of Gold is worth \\~$1700, but 1 oz of silver is only \\~$25. But the demand for silver isn't just as money, but also as an industrial component. It is \\*\\*necessary\\*\\* for a lot of industries, including Tesla and other EVs. Huge demand and little supply shouldn't lead to $25. The manipulation around silver might be able to work for a while longer, but it seems like a lot of things are coming to a head soon.

But, unfortunately, it is exactly the same DD I have read since 2005. Keep in mind that the price of physical silver is important to industry and governments.

We need a disruptive event which either causes the industrial value to spike or a major manipulator fails and can no longer hold their positions.
