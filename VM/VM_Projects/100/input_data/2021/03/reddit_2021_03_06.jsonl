The automotive sector is dominated by extremely operationally efficient manufacturers and low margins. The industry was disrupted by the entrance of Japanese competition and consequently, it’s has literally defined modern supply chain and operational research. There is no coincidence that a lot of the manufacturing efficiency terms we use are Japanese - they came from Toyota. \n\nAlready Audi VW are gearing up their EV offerings across their fleets. Porsche is making waves with the taycan and is rapidly electrifying their fleet. VW has already beaten Tesla to the punch in the hatchback and super mini markets (which are huge in Europe but low margin). Mercedes/Daimler are launching their EVs now, which compete directly with the Tesla 3 and S (same for BMW). Renault, Kia and Honda are attacking the low margin cheap and cheerful end of the market. \n\nThink about it using your own logic. This market has enormous tailwinds due to environmental concerns and policy incentives. Do you think the incumbents are going to do nothing? Tesla don’t even compete for the vast majority of the demographics who make car purchasing decisions at the moment. They produce a luxury product that competes favourably with company fleet cars (because its heavily incentivised) and the executive market. \n\nNow for the “but the super charger network” - in Europe at least they are facing huge competition from ionity (among others). Similarly other big names are gearing up in this space which is driving a desire for more commonality between charging. There are already companies enabling cross platform billing in some markets for example. The super charger network is a source of competitive advantage at the moment, but it isn’t an insurmountable moat. \n\nOnce again I reiterate, I think Tesla is a great company. But I don’t think it’s growth trajectory isn’t without hurdles. Elon and his team have made something spectacular but that doesn’t mean Tesla is appropriately valued based on its fundamentals and the current market information we have available to us.\n\nSticking with your example - if they did return to 60% growth (which is a huge if and would require a 2x growth from last year) and get to $250bn annual revenue they would still be in an industry with poor margins. Let’s say Tesla become market leading and can achieve a profit margin of c. 8-10% that’s a $20bn annual net profit. That’s still a 40x valuation at $800bn - the sector average is typically between 5 and 30. Tesla is worth a premium so it’ll be at the top end of that range, but these are all super optimistic assumptions. It’s not exactly “cheap”. \n\nI can’t see Tesla justifying an $800bn valuation for a little while, but stranger things have happened.

If I am right, this will be a multi-trillion-dollar company within a few years. Every one million vehicles they build could add a trillion to their market cap. ($30,000 ride-hailing profit per vehicle annually with 35x PE ratio). That's $1 per mile (half UBER cost) x 60,000 miles annually (14 miles an hour for 12 hours a day) with a 50% profit margin (cost per mile $0.18 + $0.32 for operations).\n\nTesla plans to be building 20,000,000 cars a year in 2030. I think they will get there early. They are currently building out capacity for about 4.5 million cars between Freemont (500k), Shanghai(1mil), Austin(2 million), and Berlin (1 million). If these factories are completed by 2024, that would FAR outpace the 50% compounded delivery ramp they project to get to 20mil by 2030.\n\nAt some point, new entrants will compete in the ride-hailing business and drive the cost-per-mile down. If Tesla could do half of that profit amount for their vehicles in 2030 - that alone would add 15 trillion to their market cap in 2030. These numbers start to look so insane that they are hard to believe. But for them to be a $5-10+ trillion company in 2030 would not be a leap at all if you assume that what Tesla is promising is true. That's why I have been tracking and following Tesla for years, and you know what? Sometimes they are wrong.

{"title": "PSA: Why Treasury Rates matter for your Fundamental Equity Valuations", "selftext": "*FYI This is going to cover some very fundamental stuff that I'm sure a lot of you already know, however since there's plenty of casuals and new joiners, I figured it might be worthwhile to give a primer on.*\n\nHere's a simple question: **What is a stock worth right now and why?**\n\nThere's lots of ways to answer this question, many (revenue multiples, earnings multiples, etc) are short hand or simplified ways of describing the same thing.\n\nThe foundation of modern finance answers this with: **The Present Value of all Future Cash Flows**\n\nRegardless of whether you're talking about equity in a growth tech company, a value oriented utilities operator, or even a distressed oil company, the answer can be broken down further into two components or sets of assumptions:\n\n1. What are those future cash flows this company will produce for this equity share I'm buying?\n2. What discount do I give them to calculate their value today?\n\n# Future Cash Flows:\n\nThe first component I imagine everyone is conceptually super familiar with. Everyone see's headlines about revenue growth or earnings growth and some kind of % figure that gets them excited. So when it comes to the value of equity, which do we care about?\n\nThe answer here is less commonly thrown around. The cash flows we calculate into for an equity valuation are the **Free Cash Flow to Equity**, or **FCFE.**\n\nIn short, **FCFE** is how much cash is available to all shareholders **AFTER** all expenses, reinvestment, and debts have been paid. A comparison for personal income would be, this is like calculating how much you have left each month from your paycheck after you take out taxes, pay for groceries, pay that student loan bill, pay rent, and pay for that oil change on your car.\n\nSo how do you calculate a company's **FCFE**? Thankfully lots of companies do this already in their non-GAAP calculations, but if they don't it's relatively simple on your own.\n\n`FCFE = CFO - Capital Expenditures + Net Debt`\n\nThankfully CFO is a standard GAAP accounting figure you'll always have. Capital expenditures are generally straight forward but can be disguised. And net debt is the net change in debt balances, if you issue more debt, more cash is coming in the door, that's considered that higher cash flow to the shareholders.\n\nSo this gives you an idea of excess cash that theoretically is coming back into your pocket as an owner of the equity. But you can't do this for infinite years right? At some point you have to just create a final value at some point in the future. This is called our \"Terminal Value\" and it represents some generic assumptions about growth and costs of capital to give you an idea of what all the years beyond that are worth. The formula is pretty straight forward. If I want build a 5 year model, I will include my terminal value in year 5. The formula for figuring this out is as follows:\n\n`Terminal CF = yr 5 FCFE * (1+g) / (WACC - g)`\n\nNow there's a couple ways to think about this, but the easiest way is to simply view it as the value of all cash flows AFTER year 5 at an **assumed growth rate (g)** and assumed **cost of capital (WACC)**. This value is calculated as if you existed in year 5 already and assumed long run growth rate is also the same as the long run rate of growth in the economy. If you subscribe to Damodan's school of valuation (widely viewed as the authority on equity valuation modeling), there is an argument for g being the nominal gdp growth rate.\n\nNow that we've put together the string of cash flows, what is the actual value of what you're receiving?\n\n# Discount Rates:\n\nThis is the second component of the answer fewer people on here seem to incorporate when thinking about stocks. The idea here is that there is some inherent discount you need to apply to something you're going to receive in the future. It's a little bit longer but stick with me.\n\nLet's take a step back and think about what that means. If I say I'm going to give you $100 tomorrow, generally you're pretty safe in assuming that's the same as having $100 today right? Cool that's fairly easy. Now what if I tell you I'll give you $50 in 10 years and $50 in 20 years. Are you going to value that the same as scenario 1? No right? Because if you get $100 tomorrow there's still 10+ years of time to do more productive things with that money than you would have in scenario 2 (i.e. invest it etc).\n\nSo how does this apply to valuations? Think of all those cash flows we talked about before. The value of \"buying the thing that gives you those cash flows\" is basically all of them summed up right? **Wrong**. Remember those cash flows are in the future... And things in the future are intrinsically worth less than they are today.\n\nSo how do we figure out what they worth today? Well that brings us to one of the most fundamental formulas in all of finance:\n\n`FV = PV (1+r)^t`\n\nThat is, for a **given rate of growth (r)** and a **given amount of time (t)**, we can figure out what the future value of any amount will be.  If we know our future values, but not our present, then we can just flip this around and solve it the other way:\n\n`PV = FV / (1+r)^t`\n\nWe already know FV is just the cash flows we talked about above already. So what is the 1/(1+r)\\^t? That's what we call our discount factor and this is where we are finally getting to the topic of this post's title. t is super easy, years are years unless you're some sort of time traveler. The real question here is **\"HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT RATE TO USE?\"**. The answer in finance to discount your cash flows by the company's **Weighted Average Cost of Capital** or **WACC**. The concept here is that cost of capital comes in two broad components, cost of debt, and cost of equity. Cost of debt is sort of self explanatory. You have some debt, you owe interest on it each year, there's some marginal tax benefit by interest payments lowering your tax obligations, etc. But let's ignore this for a second and pretend we're looking at a company with zero debt.\n\nWhat the fuck is \"**cost of equity**\" and what does it mean? It's far less tangible of a concept because there are no explicit interest payments that you can point to as \"costs\" like there are for debt. Instead some nobel prize winning financial economists (Jack Treynor \\[mentor of Fischer Black\\], William Sharpe \\[known for the Sharpe Ratio\\], and Merton Miller \\[known for Modigliani-Miller Theory\\]) captured essence of determining an equity share's \"cost\" through a theory called the **Capital Asset Pricing Model** or **CAPM** for short. This was a formula designed to determine what \"cost\" should be assigned to an asset based on a risk free rate of return, a market rate of return, and the inherent correlation of your asset with that market. You can see where I'm going with this. The formula is as follows:\n\n`R(E) = Rrfr + B*(ERP)`\n\nR(E) here represents the expected return of an asset. This can also be called your expected return on an equity or to the company issuing this equity it is the \"cost\" to them that's expected in return for the investor buying their equity.\n\nRrfr is just shorthand for the expected return on a risk free asset. You wouldn't ever buy into an equity share with the expectation that it gives you less than what the most risk free asset is right? Cool. So in the broad scheme of things there's a couple of things you could use for this, but one of the most common is the 10 year US Treasury yield (or some other duration US Treasury note/bill/bond). The US Government is widely believed to be the most risk free counterparty in the world. It's the nature of being a reserve currency.\n\nB is your assets beta to the market. There's a lot we can unpack with this but for an oversimplification, let's think of it as for every 1% the broad market changes, how much does your equity change by?\n\nAnd finally, ERP. This is the Equity Risk Premium. There's several ways to approach this but the simplest is to think of it as the general expectation of investors as to how much the broad market should outperform risk free assets. People purchase equity shares with the expectation of higher returns than safer assets? Seems reasonable.\n\nLet's try this out with the broad market. Let's assume beta (B) is 1.0, the risk free rate is 1.0% and the ERP (expected spread between risk free and market) is 8%.\n\n`R(E) = 1.5% + 1.0*(8%) = 9.5%`\n\nThat's a fairly reasonable rate. The sanity check here is comparing it to cost of debt. Because equities are lower in the capital structure, their cost should explicitly always be higher than the cost of debt. In the broad market companies are borrowing at less than 9.5% so that rough eyeball test checks out. If you invest in the broad equity market, your expectation is for companies to deliver 9.5% in value to you each year.\n\nThis finally brings us back to the topic of this post. You can see, wayyyy down in the granular details of a valuation, the equity markets fundamental valuation are inherently baselined on risk free rates. Now let's combine this with what we talked about above and see why such small changes in that tiny rate can have such large outcomes in valuations.\n\n# Case Study: QuantumScape Corporation (NYSE: $QS)\n\nI'll be honest, the reason I chose this is largely because it's one of the extreme examples that demonstrates how such small changes can make disproportionate impact. Also it seems to be a fan favorite whenever I see it mentioned.\n\nFor a case study I want to do a super rudimentary valuation. For disclosure, this is not a robust valuation or financial advice. I'm going to eliminate as many factors as possible and try to keep it just to what we talked about and help illustrate things. I'm not putting this here as DD or an opinion on this stock.\n\nFirst things first, lets get some cash flows. For this we're not going to do anything fancy. When they were acquired by the \\[insert s word thing that shall not be named\\] they gave management forecasts and we're just going to take them at face value and extrapolate. Their projected first revenues will come in 2024 but it's nothing really material (14m FY24, 39m FY25, 260m FY26) until we get to FY27 (3.2bn). But remember, we don't care about revenues because as equity holders that's not what we receive. Looking at management's forecast, their Free Cash Flow doesn't turn positive until FY28 when it makes up \\~8.5% of revenues. So lets use this and use some really wild assumptions. I'm going to say revenues go up by 75% each year after that and FCF margins stay the same at 10% (pretty insane growth assumptions given such a capital intensive manufacturing company).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||2028|2029|2030|2031|2032|2033|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenues ($m)|6500|11,375|19,906|34,836|60,963|106,685|\n|Free Cash Flow ($m)|565|1,138|1,991|3,484|6,096|10,669|\n\nNow we need to find our terminal value as if it is at the end of 2033 looking forward. Let's assume a relatively high steady state growth of 5% (3% real growth and 2% inflation). So our figure in year 5 is 106\\*(1.05)/(.19-.05) = $133.3 billion\n\nAt first glance impressions are easy to be \"holy fuck, they're going to have $100 billion in revenue? they're generating cash flows of $150 billion?!? they're only at $15 billion market cap?? sign me the fuck up! buy buy buy!\". But let's take this all the way with step 2 of answering our \"What is this worth today?\" question.\n\nSo for this part we need to make a lot of assumptions. And this is important because equity analysts express their views often the most through not assumptions on how a company's cash flows look, but how to think about those cash flow value in present dollars.\n\nContinuing our simplification, let's keep assuming no debt involvement here (mainly bc this post is fucking long) and let's jump back to using CAPM. Let's use the below values:\n\nRrfr: 1.0%\n\nBeta: 2.0\n\nERP: 10%\n\nUsing these we can see this stock's cost of equity is \\~21.0%. It seems high, but this is expected from something with such fantastic growth being priced in to have such a high beta. TSLA for example has a beta of 2.0 and realistically a stock growing at 75% yoy in an economy growing at 3% nominally would likely have a beta much higher than that.\n\nSo using our formula's above we can now now solve for our discount factors (the 1/(1+r)\\^t numbers to multiply our cash flows by).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|\n|WACC|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|21.0%|\n|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.21)^(8)|= 1 / (1.21)^(9)|= 1 / (1.21)^(10)|= 1 / (1.21)^(11)|= 1 / (1.21)^(12)|= 1 / (1.21)^(13)|\n|(DF)|0.22|0.18|0.15|0.12|0.10|0.08|\n|PV CF ($m)|141|205|296|428|619|10,686|\n\nThe sum of all the PV CF should give us what we think this stock is worth today (since no debt, this would be same as market cap, ignoring any cash balances they currently have). So we get $12.4bn. Compared to a current $15 billion market cap that's another 20% drop WITH some pretty damn rosy assumptions (and low yields). Fuck.\n\nBut that's not all.\n\nNow let's dial in new more realistic assumptions. Let's think of pre-covid life and what the norms back then were. 10 year interest rates were between 2-3% in 2018/2019 and inflation was tipping on the hot side of 2% going into end of year 2019, so a 10 year treasury at 2.5% seems a realistic norm and with a higher vol/growth stock like this we can be more realistically at a beta of 2.25. And finally let's keep our ERP and g (macro assumptions) the same.\n\nOur cost of equity is now 25% which makes our discount table look like this:\n\n|Year|FY2028|FY2029|FY2030|FY2031|FY2032|FY2033|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|t|8|9|10|11|12|13|\n|WACC|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|25.0%|\n|Discount Factor|= 1 / (1.25)^(8)|= 1 / (1.25)^(9)|= 1 / (1.25)^(10)|= 1 / (1.25)^(11)|= 1 / (1.25)^(12)|= 1 / (1.25)^(13)|\n|(DF)|0.17|0.13|0.11|0.09|0.07|0.05|\n|PV CF ($m)|109|153|214|299|419|5,718|\n\nWith just a slight change in treasury yields and a slightly more realistic shift in beta, we're now talking about a market cap of $6.9bn or a 55% FURTHER DROP from current prices. Start shifting those 75%/yoy growth assumptions towards something that decelerates (a more complicated n-stage DCF that's too much to get into here) and you drop even further. A 10% deceleration yoy would bring this present value more in the $4 billion range.\n\nI'm sorry for being so long winded here, but I felt it was important to explain.

There are multiple articles referencing Ford's cutting into Tesla's market share. They plan to sell 30,000 evs this next year. These numbers are similar to most other manufacturers. Tesla plans to sell 500,000 targeting 50% growth year on year. With 50-60% brand loyalty in car sales, Tesla is likely eating into other vehicles market share and not the other way around. Tesla's margins are low now but they are on a near exponential 📈 ramp for production which is expected in growth phase. But their operating cost with v direct to consumer vs dealer model reduces costs to consumer and will likely result in higher margins at lower costs then other car makers. Tesla is also able to capture a consumer willing to pay more for their product, very similar to Apple. The average consumer is price conscious but high end consumers will ignore price for a quality, niche product. Betting against a company that more high end consumers are willing to pay more for their product and leave their previous high end brand  despite high consumer loyalty seems like bad logic to me. This doesn't really equate to short term market share and stock price but references the emotions of buying this stock. Tesla doesn't just sell cars but their cars validate their electric brand and ecosystem. Long-term they have software as a service potential for every vehicle sold with car based app store that will sell video games, car security services (ring doorbell in car notifications), and self-driving (monthly prescription or daily). They are rumored to be interested in launching a ride hailing and car sharing service app. I think they will be the first and maybe the only manufacture to generate revenue in this form. Their home better packs will also become cheaper and more popular over time.  They are far from a car company and the margins on software is what makes them a risk to NOT invest in.

{"title": "“We are not in a bubble” – Cathie Wood", "selftext": "The following is my summary of Cathie Wood’s thoughts on recent market volatility, as presented in her latest video on the Ark Invest YouTube channel (\\~42 min) – I strongly recommend you check it out.\n\nThe minimum expected rate of return for a stock to enter an ark portfolio is 15% CAGR. Cathie contends that she sees the recent volatility as a gift to gain alpha over the intended 15% return in many of her high conviction names.\n\nShe mentions that at Ark, they have a five year time horizon, and it is counter productive to compare its performance with a benchmark (like the s&p) over a shorter period. She further adds that many stocks in traditional indices today are a potential value trap, and that ark etfs “are a good hedge against broad based benchmarks.”\n\nShe reiterates that “we are not in a bubble” – and that the seeds of their 5 innovation platforms were planted in the dot com bubble, and are now ready for prime time, in a period of reality. Fear of a bubble likely stems from benchmark sensitivity and backward looking institutional investors. Furthermore, intuitions should be worried about their own strategies as “creative disruption will impact nearly 50% of the s&p500”.\n\nTo Cathie, interest rates going up suggest that ‘real growth is going to pick up’ – and that she understands the concern over her own stock picks potentially underperforming as a result. However, she believes that that the market has assumed that interest rates will stabilize at a 4 to 5% range - which inversed (1/4 or 1/5) gives a normalized p/e of 20 or 25; so markets didn’t actually misprice assets to begin with. She thinks that nominal growth however, will not be at 4 to 5%, but instead around 2-3%, which can lead to greater valuation support for companies that can grow more rapidly.\n\nRotation from growth to value was also expected on her part. She repeats that value will face massive headwinds going forward. Energy and financial stocks have done amazing in the past month - which is a good thing as the bull market is broadening out unlike the dot com bubble, where ‘too much capital chased too few opportunities, too soon’. Energy and financial sectors booming will likely be short lived as they are both ripe for massive disruption.", "id": "lz03ye", "created_utc": 1615031766.0, "score": 787, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 696, "comments": [{"body": "People say buy the dip and then shake in the corner crying when the dip actually happens.

My take:\n\n- Some of it went into commodities - but not nearly enough, the bond selloff was massive.\n- Some of it rotated into US30-ish 'value' equities - but not nearly all, as both US30 fell somewhat, and tech corrected big.\n- A lot of funds came back from sovereign debt & non-USD equities to an USD base - EUR/USD dropped to 1.19, suggesting significant inflows from that direction as well.\n\nSo there's IMO a lot of cash on the sidelines right now, which wants to find an USD denominated home.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your analysis.

These people either don't care about or fully understand Tesla's/Elon's long term vision and plan for the company, and only see as far as the next ER.

The discounts to get to the terminal values the next 10/15 years I used are as follows:\n\n|Year|DC|SP|PE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2021|**1.26**|$1360|272|\n|2022|**1.23**|$1714|171|\n|2023|**1.21**|$2108|124|\n|2024|**1.19**|$2551|88|\n|2025|**1.17**|$3036|55|\n|2026|**1.15**|$3552|39|\n|2027|**1.15**|$4085|34|\n|2028|**1.12**|||\n|2029|**1.10**|||\n\nAnd of course a terminal discount from 2030 and beyond of 1.09. The earnings I am predicting are $250B in 2030 and $325B in 2035, which sounds insane but that is what we're looking at here. The terminal values at these years would be $6.56T and $8.54T and the discounted value today using the table would be $1360 at the end of '21 averaging the two, although the difference between the two values is only $100 so it's pretty consistent.\n\nThe share price may do whatever it likes but I added the fair values that I'd be willing to buy at considering the fundamentals follow my projections. They may accelerate or they may be delayed, you can change the discounts to any year you'd like to account for increased risk.\n\nIf my earnings projections are correct it won't be 3 years before market has no chance but to accept the valuations, but who knows.

Think of a Coca Cola, they're just gonna grow a bit each year and the company will be worth a multiple of their earnings. In this case I determined the terminal value to be a ~26x multiple of their cash flow. \n\nThe prices each year are what I think is fair value and up to which you should be buying, and if it jumps significantly above this you should probably be selling. They are determined by discounting the terminal value each year up to the present. If you were guaranteed a bag of cash of $1000 in 2030 and you could put an option on it and you wanted 10% returns per year, you'd be paying $385 for it right now. \n\nThese are, to the best of my model, fair value prices. This is when I think the risk is sufficiently rewarded. It does not mean the market is gonna give a single fuck or that it'll be a nice S-curve up till 2035. The more earnings kick in the higher the chance the market is forced to recognize the value.

{"title": "Is Someone Recreating VW w/GME?", "selftext": "Or really, does someone 'hope' they're recreating VW?\n\nCrazy conspiracy theory time!\n\nTo be clear: I work as a historian, not in finance. Please tell me in the comments why I’m horribly wrong! Also, I understand many might be tired of GameStop. But with the depressing news in the rest of the market, I thought this might be a bit of fun.\n\nEveryone keeps referring to the Volkswagen short squeeze without talking about the larger event, so here’s a quick reminder. On October 26th 2008, Porsche had a surprise for the stock market. They announced they’d secretly been buying VW, up to where they owned 74% of the shares. Before October, they’d had less than 30%. The 44% difference was a total shock to the world. The thing is, apart from Porsche, other investors closely held 25% (which also wasn’t available) of VW.\n\nSo? When Porsche announced it’d secretly bought all these shares, everyone realized there was actually only 1% of VW shares available. To emphasize: the short interest in VW wasn’t that high, it was at 12.8%. The announcement caused a massive panic and a huge short squeeze, where VW’s share price briefly vaulted from around 200 to 1000. Porsche got over $10 billion from this whole thing. They also successfully took over VW, but that's another story.\n\nWhich brings us to today. The media’s been talking about GameStop like it’s a David v. Goliath story, but for awhile now the amount of volume makes it more likely that it’s Goliath v. Goliath. Retail investors hyped this thing up, but it seems that hedge funds really solidified the run-up in January and they're now the ones who’re holding most of the shares. I get it, no one on Reddit (especially WSB) wants to hear that. But it's actually a good thing if institutional money is in the retail investors' corner. At any rate, this could explain the extreme anomaly that’s been happening the past few weeks.\n\nThe larger stock market’s seen a pull-back, where the majority of growth or speculative stocks have been thoroughly in the red. But at the exact same time, GME’s stayed in the 100s range from Feb. 25th until now (March 6th), slowly rising. This came after a dramatic upswing from the share price being in the 40s (which happened after the collapse in early February). What could explain this continued trading range at a somewhat stable (high) price?\n\nI think a hedge fund or whale is trying to recreate the Porsche/Volkswagen event. They’ve been ‘secretly’ buying up shares and simply holding them, making them unavailable. This would explain the crazy last few weeks.\n\nFor some actual numbers:\n\nTotal amount of GME shares available (as of Dec. 1, 2020): 69.75 million\n\nTop holders of GME (EDIT: these holdings are from around December/January so are outdated):\n- Fidelity Management: 13.3%\n- Ryan Cohen (RC Ventures): 12.91%\n- BlackRock: 12.17%\n- The Vanguard Group: 7.4%\n- Senvest Management: 7.24%\n- Maverick Capital: 6.68%\n- Dimensional Fund Advisors: 5.64%\n- Morgan Stanley: 4.54%\n- D.E. Shaw & Co: 4.07%\n- Susquehanna International Group: 3.57%\n\nTotal of top GME holders: 77.52%\n\nSo there’s roughly 22.48% of shares ‘available’, that we know of (again, as of a few months ago, though the exact numbers don't matter). Let’s say retail investors own at least 5% of this (5-10%, but I’m being conservative). So that’s around 17.48% shares with a big question mark by them. On top of that, GME still has a short interest of around 41.22%.\n\nLet’s say a hedge fund was ‘pulling a Porsche’. If I were them, I’d announce out of the blue that they’ve bought a significant proportion of the shares, and there’s actually far less available than anyone had realized. If this occurred, those 41% of shorts would spontaneously panic and have a new urgency to cover. I'm saying that this could be a massive catalyst. I don’t even want to try to predict a ceiling; it could be a blip, a MOASS, or anything in between.\n\nStill, who could be doing this? Any hedge fund big enough. Maybe one who hasn’t said a peep about GME. But I do have an odd theory. This last part is even more speculative than the rest and I have nothing to back it up. In fact, it’s insanely speculative and almost positively wrong! Still, it’s fun to think about.\n\nDr. Michael Burry started much of the GME craze, though he hasn't been broadcasting his position. From SEC filings, he had 5.3% of GME shares in 2018, then sold it (apparently for a loss) in Q2 of 2019. THEN Burry bought 3,000,000 GME shares in Q3 of 2020. He once again sold all of it in Q4 of 2020 (for a very nice profit), missing the insane January run. What if, during the dip of 400 to 40, Burry rebought shares yet again? If Porsche could do it secretly, Burry’s hedge fund (or a different one) likely could.\n\nSo, if my crazy theory’s correct? Sometime in the next few weeks, Michael Burry of ‘The Big Short’ fame will go on CNBC and announce that he’s been secretly buying up a significant stake in GME. He’d make it clear that he isn’t selling. Overnight, everyone will realize that there isn’t 17.48% of GME shares available — there’s only 1%. ...or 5%, or whatever. The precise number doesn't matter. It's about having a jolting catalyst.\n\nAgain, I’m half-joking with this entire post. But I’d love if it was proven true.\n\ntldr: The GME anomaly could be because some hedge fund thinks they're Porsche, and could be 'secretly' buying up GME. I'm not betting on this theory, but I do think it'd be interesting if it was the case.\n\n~~~~~\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the comments! As ra246 pointed out, Porsche becoming the majority shareholder was what made it so the shorts had to be covered. And lock2sender mentioned other various great theories of what could be happening. I completely agree with them that this anomaly is likely being caused by naked short shares or the like. But as I hadn't heard anyone say this nutty alternative theory, I figured I might as well make a post about it.\n\n~~~~~\n\nEDIT 2: Hi everyone! To be clear: many of these numbers are a few months old, as the range of the current numbers I'm seeing is insane (in that institutional ownership of GME might be far less than the 77% like I wrote, or somehow all the way up to 130%). It's outdated, I know, I can't help it. The other numbers are also approximate. That's what you get for a post written at midnight.\n\nI'm not AT ALL saying that the VW and GME situations are the same! They're extremely different, seeing as how VW was motivated by Porsche wanting to take over the company, while GME occurred due to its insane 140% short interest in Dec/Jan 2020. My silly theory is that someone (or multiple someones) out there got an idea from VW and are 'paying homage' to it, for lack of a better phrase. I'm not even saying it'd work and would produce a short squeeze (that's my main doubt about this whole thing). I think a hedge fund(s) WANTS that to occur.\n\nAs for whether or not this would be legal? Frankly, it depends. Porsche got around the laws, but those were mainly German or EU financial regulations. People affiliated with GME (like Ryan Cohen) would have to give notice about any massive buying or selling of shares. But for everyone else, the laws seem to be iffier. At any rate, as this is just a wild theory, I'll go the whole way. If there was a million dollar fine for doing this, would a hedge fund risk it to make billions? Eh...\n\nI'm also not saying to buy GameStop at this price! Personally, I'm not. I bought shares back in December and early January and am still holding some, but it's too much of a gamble at this entry point for me to add to my position.

Please READ", "selftext": "I just re-edited to be less inflammatory.[Better Link to SEC Document](https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-000518/)\n\nThis Friday 03/05/21 at 7:30 PM, I was surprised to see the B/A for AMC at  300/29000. So, for the first time since getting on this “rocket” on January 27th, and entering the market in December, I went to Edgar.  AND, It just so happened, that today, AMC had filed a notice for their shareholders meeting, at which a proposal to dramatically increase the shares of issued stock, will be voted on.\n\nHere is a link to see the document: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000104746921000518/a2243000zpre14a.htm#da47801\\_proxy\\_summary](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000104746921000518/a2243000zpre14a.htm#da47801_proxy_summary)\n\n[From EDGAR ](https://preview.redd.it/fdtwzenascl61.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d1eece2449a4f92a87cec51e6c154f3cb212d4d)\n\nHere's a simplified gist of the summary:\n\n1. **On January 27, 2021**, the AMC Board approved a Proposal to Amend their Certificate of Incorporation to increase the total number of shares of Common Stock they are authorized to issue an additional 500,000,000 shares to total 1,024,173,073 shares of Common Stock.\n2. **On February 24, 2021**, they filed with the State of Delaware to *retire their class B common stock,* creating the current article of incorporation which authorizes them to issue up to  500,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock.\n3. **On March 5, 2021**,  an invitation to a shareholder meeting for **May 4, 2021** was filed with the SEC, whereupon the proposal, will be voted on.\n4. The summary contains the following accounting ***as of close of business day, March 3, 2021***:  450,156,186  Shares of Common Stock, issued and outstanding\\*\\*.\\*\\* **Shares Reserved** ***that may or may not be*** **released prior to the EIP:**  **10,920,763** shares of Common  Stock,  **63,096,124** shares (*premium 50,000,000* \\-  and *3,732,625 treasury*)\n5. *So, for the next 8 weeks,*  then the RESERVED SHARES  are what may or may not be released, I guess.\n6. On May 4, 2021 (assuming this is approved)  an additional 500,000,000  can be issued that would then total 1,024,173,073 shares.  The company may use these for private placement, public offerings, IPO's, stock splits, employee incentives, etc.\n\nCan anyone enlighten me and/or assuage my concern? My concern being contained herein the potential Adverse Effects of Certificate of Amendment:\n\n“Adoption of the Certificate of Amendment will have no immediate dilutive effect on the proportionate voting power or other rights of the Company's existing stockholders. However, any future issuance of additional authorized shares of our Common Stock, at the future direction of the Board (and generally without the requirement of stockholder approval, unless specifically required by applicable law or NYSE regulation) may, ***among other things, dilute the earnings per share of Common Stock and the equity and voting rights of those holding Common Stock at the time such additional shares are issued.”***\n\nONE MORE THING -- WE CAN VOTE.

The term naked shorting and counterfeit shares gets thrown a lot without a clear explanation of what it actually means. \n\nIn simple terms, think of a PS5 as a share of AMC. Sony's calling a vote and says \"hey, only people who own PS5's can vote\" - the first important thing to understand is that there isn't much confusion as to how many PS5s are there - Sony made them and keeps a running list of how many are issued. \n\nA person who short sells AMC borrows a PS5 from someone and sells it to someone else, and promises they'll give the PS5 back to the original owner at later date. At the time of the vote, only the person who is physically holding onto the PS5 gets to vote. \n\nA naked short is like a PS5 scalper. He goes to Ebay, sells the PS5 (even though he doesn't have one on hand), with the promise he'll give you the PS5 at a later date by purchasing it at Walmart. It's an IOU, and in stock trading, is illegal. \n\nYou're basically saying Sony calling a vote fucks over the illegal PS5 scalpers. It makes very little sense once you digest it.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Same goes to you, and I appreciate your willingness to have a conversation on it. With all the bots and shills around it's second nature to start off hostile towards anyone with a different opinion, but I have respect for someone who has a different opinion and instead of saying things without any backing, or simply attacking the other person, actually tries to form a case for their side. Kudos for that. \n\nNaked shorting is \"when investors sell shorts associated with shares that they do not possess and have not confirmed their ability to possess.\" That means it doesn't change what the purchaser of the naked short receives compared to a regular short. They receive what is the equivalent of a regular share, just one that has been fraudulently generated. I get where your thinking is at with your analogy, but I think there is a disconnect in the situation with what and when the scalper/purchaser is buying and receiving: \n\nInstead of an IOU paper, you gotta think of the naked short as a fake console that looks the same, performs the same, etc. which is to be replaced once the legitimate one is acquired. Essentially the same as an IOU, but with the buyer not knowing it's an IOU (it has immediate use and rights once purchased). So as soon as the buyer purchases it, they are receiving a fake console in their hands that can do everything (same voting rights) as a real one. In your example, when someone buys a pre-ordered PS5 from a scalper, they don't get the benefits of the console until it is acquired by the scalper and in their hands. \n\nSony realizes this is all happening and doesn't like that a third party is illegally increasing the amount their product out there. So to catch them, they call a vote to see if they should build a new factory that has the ability to produce 5,000,000 PS5's in 2 months, and say that anyone with a PS5 can have a vote. To make sure the number of voters will equal the official number of PS5's released out there, they will have to do a recount of all the PS5's. Not knowing what they are holding is a fake PS5 instead of a real one, they are counted in as well. But when they do, Sony as expected realizes that there are more PS5's than there are supposed to be. They investigate and when they come across the fraudulent PS5's, they track them back to the seller and those sellers get in major trouble for creating a counterfeit product that they claim has the same rights as a real one. They can't create PS5's that hold the same rights as a PS5 because they are not Sony, even though they were eventually planning on taking them out and replacing them with an official one once they thought they could get their hands on it cheap. So it's either buy at market price to replace the fakes, or get caught distributing fakes and get in big shit - that's how Sony will fuck over the scalpers. If these scalpers know that this vote is coming, they will need to acquire legitimate PS5's to replace their fake ones before the count happens to avoid being caught, no matter the cost at the time of the real PS5. This is why some are predicting that these naked shorts are going to have to cover prior to the vote to avoid being exposed. \n\nObviously a simplified version, and in the real version the scalpers are very smart, albeit very arrogant, people.

{"title": "The TSLA bubble has finally popped", "selftext": "Good morning fellow Daddy Musk fans, it's time we talk about what's  happening with TSLA and why it's happening.\n\nAs many of you are by now  aware TSLA has been in free fall for the past month blasting through  multiple \"support levels\" and leaving a **trail of loss porn** behind. Now you may be wondering why your OTM weekly calls are  going to zero week after week and I'm here to tell you it's not going to  get better.\n\nLet's take a journey aboard the modern day EV Titanic known as TSLA.\n\n**Disclaimer: This is fan fiction I write at night after I drop off my wife at her boyfriends place, not financial advice.**\n\nBefore you blast my ass how TSLA shorts have been fucked every single time during the past years I'll explain to you why **this time it's different**. I'll start with a late 2019 quote from our autistic uncle Dr. Michael Burry.\n\n*\"Passive investing has removed price discovery from the equity markets.\"*\n\nWhat  does this mean? Well, the quote applies to the overall market but in  the case of TSLA it means actively managed mutual funds with TSLA long  positions have been replaced by passive index funds and ETFs. Passive  funds have overtaken active mutual funds market share in the past 2  years. How the fuck does this relate to price discovery? It means for  the past 2 years retards and degenerates like us have been piling money  onto ETFs like Mommy Cathie's ARKK without actually doing any DD on what  turds the ETF is actually holding. I know, the gains have been  impressive with CNBC and Bloomberg praising Cathie's ETFs to the fucking  moon. Fair enough, however let's take our lips off **Cathie's tits** for a second and look at what ARKK is actually holding.\n\nHere's the punch line (taken from a random tweet yesterday):\n\n**Top  10 ARKK companies have a combined market cap of $1200B with revenues of $76B and  earnings of $2.5B. If it was a single company it would be trading at  480x earnings, 16x sales with a profit margin of 3,3%.**\n\nLet that shit sink in before we move on.\n\nNow back to the situation at hand. ARKK is down 25% in the past month and so are the other **simp funds** trying to ride **Mommy Cathie's ass**  to the moon. Outflows from the ETF have accelerated in the recent  month, which will cause Cathie to sell off her overvalued babies and dump  them onto the street with TSLA being the biggest and most overvalued  stock she's holding with a weight of 9,99% of ARKK. The outflows may  cause overall liquidity issues for her fund, [/u/seldomsage](https://www.reddit.com/u/seldomsage/) wrote a great post about this shit on [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) . Go read that shit to understand what's about to happen.\n\nLet's leave the **certified GILF** alone and jump into a hot tub time machine back to December 2020. Our **gay uncle Burry**  came out of the closet early December last year and stated he's  shorting TSLA. Why? Well he recognized active players on TSLA had gotten  out and short interest was extremely low (limiting any short squeeze  risks, I believe it was around 5% of float). I believe after reading the  🌈🐻 erotica uncle Burry has been tweeting for the past months, the **cocaine nosed HF suits**  on Wall Street started to pile onto his TSLA short. You can clearly see  this in TSLA options chain, the put/call ratio and spiking short  volume. It seems right now everyone and their retarded cousin is  shorting TSLA. This will lead to a cycle where TSLA goes down, ETFs  holding TSLA will go down, outflows from ETFs will continue and TSLA  will go down even more. Thus, there's a chance TSLA will drag down the  overall market with it.\n\nIn addition here's a list of smooth brained arguments why I think TSLA is still going down.\n\n1. The **P/E is still 938**. No fund manager with an IQ above 80 will touch this stock at these prices.\n2. The stock is at **$597 a piece**. Most of us work at Wendy's and don't have the cash to buy a single share.\n3. Call options are **expensive as fuck**, again, Wendy's.\n4. TSLA stopped taking orders for entry level Model Y. Together Model 3 and Model Y account for **90% of TSLA sales**.\n5. **Lithium shortage**, probably related to point 4.\n6. Ford and Volkswagen. Particularly **Ford Mustang Mach-E**, which started eating away TSLA market share.\n7. The  jig is up. Selling flamethrowers and tweeting memes wont make TSLA  profitable any time soon, eventually the market will go back to the  fundamentals and realize that TSLA is actually just a car company with **low profit margins**.\n\nLastly I'm not saying TSLA is a bad company or that the products are bad. In fact I think they're making **great products**, the company is just **BIGLY** overvalued at this point.\n\nRelated positions:\n\n🌈🐻 TSLA puts ranging from $300P to $20P.\n\nHave a great weekend and good luck next week!", "id": "lyzcxu", "created_utc": 1615028578.0, "score": 493, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 393, "comments": [{"body": "20p?

Laws and regulations for self driving cars and major infrastructure changes to support EV will likely be difficult. By that time the R&D from their competitors will have had time to catch up.

These means they're opened up to a new risk because \"short swing\" profits (profits gained if you sell your shares within 6 months) can legally have to be returned to the company if you sell. This is sometimes done at very unfavourable rates (which may actually make you lose money).

I don't think the same gap between European manufacturers and what Tesla offered existed as between Tesla and American manufacturers. Really, until the last few years if you'd asked me about EVs I probably would've talked about VW.

The Brits are much more pro-USA, but the continent generally prefers it's own products. Plus, domestic production. Supporting local jobs. Etc.\n\nThe other issue simply is public transport is way, way more widespread here than in the US. My partner is American, she lived in a major city and the public transport system appears to be dogshit. I never learned to drive due to a leg injury, and I've literally never had an issue travelling in the UK. I can get a rail ticket to basically anywhere, and where I can't get to by rail I can get to by bus. I dated a Swiss/German/French girl who testified to the general efficiency of all three railway systems. I don't know the rest of Europe. Which just means that the requirements are different, EVs in Europe aren't always playing to the same standard as the US. Sure Tesla has all those competitive advantages in distance and what not, but if I'm simply not having to drive that far that often then I can afford to prioritise other values in consumption.\n\nI am absoutely rat arsed atm so if there's anything I've been unclear it's Guinesses fault.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "dude thats a point of view no one is talking about at all.

Hell, massive chunks of Manchester nowadays are totally pedestrianised. On street parking is less prolific, you've got to have a smaller car just to fit. Otherwise, you'll be forced to use really expensive car parking (seriously, pay for a car parking space for a day out in London and you will literally want to gouge your eyes out when you see the price).\n\n\"Doesn't that mean that Europe has a generally smaller vehicle market top though?

People focus on the euro market but seems like at some point much sooner than other countries ev saturation is going to stablize meaning the growth is capped.\"\n\nIt probably means the average EV purchaser is older in Europe than it is elsewhere. So I looked at some random potentially bullshit googled statistics, apparently vehicle per capita in the US is around 830/1000 whereas Germany is like 560/1000, France is around 580/1000 and the UK is at 470/1000 roughly, which basically illustrates your point. It still means that it's a valuable market, when the people your marketing too are a bit older they're more likely to buy a more luxury, less convenient option (like an EV)\n\nThe issue with developing markets is that lifespan is a huge, huge issue. I have a Colombian friend from Bogota and he spends a fair amount of time in the countryside and wandering around South America in general - apparently the old WW2 jeeps are pretty ubiquitous out there. They can deal with the poor roads, jungle encroachment, mountainous terrain etc. Plus, they're easy to repair and they've got a Perseus's Ship thing going on where they're effectively no longer the same jeeps because all the parts have been replaced, but they're always cheap and easy to fix. A lot of the developing world is really similar; they rely on cheap, reliable, repairable cars and I'm not sure that Tesla's (or really any EV) product is going to be able to break into those kinds of markets. Sure, you have the infrastructure developing in Mumbai and Delhi, but they're a tiny, tiny slice of the market. \n\n\"nteresting that you consider tesla an \"american\" company, i know they are but americans in general tend to treat tesla like a foreign company.

Why do you keep fucking that up and how do you fix it?", "selftext": "Buy low, sell high.\n\nIt’s an easy principle but many of us have found ourselves, yet again, needing to dump stock at low prices to avoid negative buying power and then needing green candles for a long time before being able to buy in again, at which point the stocks turns out to be at a high. Then another “correction” happens and we curse our retardation and possibly even get out of the market by:\n\n1. **choice**\n2. **liquidation**\n3. **BASE jumping without a parachute**\n\n**Please do not do #3**. We’ve all had that feeling, sick to your stomach and dreading having to tell your kids, parents, wife, her boyfriend etc. that you fucked up and will be living behind Wendy’s for a while. It will get better if you actually learn from your mistake.\n\nFirst things first. When stocks are dipping or crashing, all the experienced gamblers here are telling you to BUY! BUY! BUY! It does make sense since prices are (subjectively) low. But you can’t because the drop in the market left you with **NO BUYING POWER**! In fact, you’re having to sell off. Why? Let’s go back to how this all started \\[*record screeching, rewind button effect*\\]\n\nGreen candles as far as you can see. You are in a land of plenty. So much cash you can afford even the exotic crayon colors – robin egg blue, razzmatazz, neon carrot etc. Money is free for the taking, so it makes sense to take profits by the fistful and **ram it up the markets poop chute**.\n\nSorry to tell you, but *you’ve already fuckt up*! It took me time after time after time to learn this lesson. **WHEN THE MARKET IS AWESOME, SELL, HEDGE AND KEEP CASH ON HAND**! It turns out it is very difficult for your retarded ape brain to save bananas when the trees are full of them. But you must. Resist the urge to buy more and more bananas because know this for a fact… **this upside WILL END** and you will repeat the sins of the past.\n\n**SELL**: Don’t wait to shoot the moon on every stock. When you’re showing a moderate profit and you’re not using the derivative for covered calls, etc, sell it. **Take your profit like the big boys**. You see it over and over. Huge green candles are followed by a pull back. If not, oh well. Could’ve had more. Grow the fuck up and be happy you got something. If you’re investing, that’s another story for another sub (*I don’t EVER touch my IRAs and keep them mostly in SPY, QQQ, DIA to great effect over the last two decades*).\n\n**HEDGE**: For downside protection there are two main ways -- buy puts for the main index funds, DIA, SPY, QQQ, and, if you sell puts, for fuck’s sake **buy a lower strike put** to protect yourself from a crash. That saved my ass the last days on NIO. If you need more info on how to properly hedge just ask. This community may be retarded, but they are smart retards. As you advance, you can learn about sQQQ etc. Baby steps first, though.\n\n*Did you keep a stash from your profits when things were good*? *And you protected yourself so your buying power didn’t go into the red when dips, corrections or crashes happen*? Good. **Guess what**?\n\n**You’re a big boy now** and after a major sell off, you can buy in on those cheap stocks.\n\n***You bought low and sold high and made the silverbacks proud!***\n\n\nEdit: Don't buy index fund puts for proper downside protection.

{"title": "AMC next week’s OMG momentum", "selftext": "REPOST - Hey all, 2900 ITM Holding. Not Your Financial Advisor. \n\nThis coming week 8th-12th is set up to be huge. I’ll tell you why in 20 important seconds. But first...\n\nNo May 4th’s shareholder vote on 500M Class A stocks being created does not affect the squeeze. \n- Class A are not traded on the open market. They are designed to provide the holder greater voting power (each share is worth more than 1 vote portion) keeping control in the hands of the company and not a institutional buyer looking to have too much power.  These also hold dividend priority and liquidity preference, not what has been shorted. The notice comments that this will not have any immediate affect of dilution. \n- Class A are largely used to help position a favoured potential parent company in such a way that the merger or acquisition is certain to occur. This could be a indicator of a possible Amazon or other takeover. \n- These shares won’t hit the market until months after the squeeze is squoze (not sure if that’s a word). May 4 is vote, takes time to ratify vote, board has to vote when they do want to add shares and by how many, SEC filings, private offering... historically 4-6 months if they wanted to put them out right away... but they use language suggesting no urgency. \n\n📄[SEC Filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001047469-21-000518/)for those that want to fall asleep or otherwise don’t believe me. \n\n\nOk, so now that your heart rate has dropped a little and you are HOLDING and a good little 🦍, let’s discuss this coming week.\n\nMarch 8 - Market closed above $8 again Friday so there are more options ITM to be purchased. This adds about 11M to the existing 14M (less since purchased) shares to be bought. We saw a nice spike the other day when one of the firms had to involuntarily settle some positions. Once a few positions have to be settled at the same time we’ll see a huge steep incline which will put the hedges into a musical chairs situation. No a steep incline won’t be a steep decline as well (so why don’t they just wait) because we apes won’t be selling for a few $ profit when we can sell for many $$$$ profit. \n\nMarch 9 - FINRA Full Short Interest Report released. This will confirm the heavily shorted position on this stock which will fuel speculations of scarcity which could prompt the hedges to settle some (not all) positions. \n\nMarch 10 - AMC Q4 2020 and Annual Report (after hours). There is no surprise that they will have to report losses but they are forecasted to report fewer losses than expected which is technically gaining ground. The CEO was on yesterday (Friday) on a few shows and handled himself wonderfully including not being trapped into condemning us apes.  Not his words; 🦍 = Loyal Supporters. He also confirmed the Wanda situation was an agreement and not any confidence shake up.  Remember that almost every company sees a lot of selling on earnings day, it’s just not good investing to hold a heavy position in something on earnings. We will see some dips before and after the reporting but not as much since most shares are owned by us apes and institutional buyers which are required to hold for 90 days (most were purchased less than 30 days ago). \n\nMarch 11 - Expect a lot of business savvy 🦍s to be buying up the dip as well as a lot of position settling to occur as they hope to take advantage of what is likely to be the floor price (not lowest yet) moving forward. This date represents a stock price that will have all new information factored into it. There isn’t another earnings report due for 3 more months and by then the theatres are back at 100% and the hedges have long since paid us. \n\nMarch 12 - Expect by this date the Short Borrow Fee rate to rival that of your MasterCard. We close the week up at 11.6%. This is up from 4.3% market open at the beginning of the week. For reference, GME popped around 20% and Tesla’s 4x moment was at 18% a while back. \n\n💎 🙌 HOLD Folks. I appreciate you reading this far and I can’t stress enough that you need to do your own confirmation research on anything you don’t know to be correct already. Yes we are being targeted in an effort to force us to sell... just HOLD. If you take your profits at $20 it won’t hit $200 or beyond. We control the stock. We know this because they have done everything they can and their efforts should have knocked the stock down to $2-$3.

{"title": "$BB 🍇", "selftext": "BB DD on news and speculative figures that don't allow for the proper analytical price targets on this undervalued stock.\n\nFirst of all BlackBerry has been through quite a number of deals within the last two years. Let's list some of these key partners and deals that have been made with said companies.\n\n1. Baidu\n2. Amazon\n3. Facebook\n4. Huawei\n5. Google\n6. Nearly every tier 1 automotive manufacturer (research brands yourself)\n7. Motional\n8. Nvidia\n9.

I specifically want to point out why you can't put a logical price target on BB today.\n\nThree deals in particular.\n\n1. The Huawei deal containing the sale of 90 phone patents not only shows a key pivotal point for BB going all in on software and successfully selling overhanging assets, but also this deal remains undisclosed giving us no solid analysis but instead are left with speculation on the price of this deal with a company that has very deep pockets.🚀\n2. The Facebook lawsuit is one that I have monitored since the filling. Not only was BlackBerry looking for payment for damages from the loss of their BBM platform to Messenger using it's stolen IP. But they also were never looking for a cash payout but instead they were seeking royalties. This deal remains undisclosed leaving us with no real idea of the possibilities within this deal except that once again Facebook is massive and so was the adoption of FB messenger.🚀\n3. Last but not least the deal with Amazon. This deal has a lot of speculation ranging from BlackBerry's already created asset management tracking devices as well as the possibilities of it's QNX operating system. They could leverage the asset tracker as well as the QNX platform for driverless delivery services and also drone delivery services because it will likely be required to run on a mission critical platform. Once again this deal is undisclosed.🚀\n\nTL;DR: DD about why the price targets are not positioned correctly for this company.

Review of last week and lessons learned.**\n \n**Last Week’s Multibagger (s)**: [EPD was a 300% play with entries and exits timed right](https://i.imgur.com/Aw4DhDW.jpg), **DOCU** RAMBO was a day 1 hit if you sold after the event pop  \n\n**Last Week’s Mid-week multi-bagger**: began pumping **OPEC+ & XOM RAMBO** in the updates mid-week.  That flow was correct, and boy oh boy was oil a gusher. XOM COP etc printed. \n\n**Last Week’s Duds**: Literally everything else that was in tech.  Just brutal. I failed there thinking the tech dump was over and got tricked by the Monday dead cat. \n\nThe real meat is in the losses, so let’s see what we learned in the tech breadline and how we’ll apply it this week. \n\n**Key Lesson Learned 1**: In volatile times when the trend is against the sector, **we want to stick with RAMBO and UOA that is company-specific (Investor/Analyst Day) rather than chasing conferences and meetings**.  If tech is dumping its brains out, for example, the CFO of CRM giving a speech at a random conference has the efficacy of tears in the rain.  Very tough but very useful lesson, and sorry to those who got completely rinsed on those lesser tech RAMBOs.  \n\n**Key Lesson Learned 2**: When it comes to sectors, the **trend is your friend**.  The news predictions coming out regarding OPEC+ were doomsday, [but I kept seeing large bets placed on oil giants from Monday to Wednesday](https://imgur.com/a/6HIWA7X/).  I decided to trust where the money was going, not what the news was predicting.  This, coupled with my basic research knowledge from last month that the Saudi’s have truly embraced the pump, was enough to zig when the news zagged.  **There are a million reasons why news leaks could lead you to go one way, but around here we ALWAYS watch where the money, not where the manipulated headlines go.**\n\n**PLEASE NOTE THE DATES**. Don’t buy calls Monday for an event listed Friday then hit me with the surprised Pikachu face if it’s red through Tuesday lol \n\nWith another week under our belt and those lessons learned in mind, let’s get to work.  \n\n****  \n  \n**CONFIDENCE SYSTEM**: I’m going to split this week’s picks up into high confidence near term plays, and further out plays.    \n\n**Plays that have U.O.A.

On March 3rd, [DKNG announced an investor day being held this coming Tuesday, the 9th](https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/events/event-details/draftkings-investor-day/)\n\nRemember, we identifed this pattern as being consistent with **news saved from ER, presented a few weeks later as insurance against the current volatile earnings environment**.\n\nGuess what else happened on March 3rd?  [A whale bet came through for 85c 3/19](https://i.imgur.com/J5YqFz0.jpg) while the underlying was a mere 66.68 🤔 \n\n[GE](https://i.imgur.com/mf4PS3O.jpg)🚀  🚀 🚀\n\nThe boomers are back!  GE has been on a little run, and tucked between last ER at the end of January, and their upcoming ER in May, [I spy a \"2021 GE Investor Outlook\" coming this Wednesday](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/2n7ucb9j), March 10th.  Wow, what a weird way to spell \"Scheduled Pump\".\n\nThe whale betting has begun.  [On Wednesday somebody put in a 4/16 16c order, and on Thursday somebody went with a 3/12 15c](https://imgur.com/a/Ep5noQR/).\n\nThe event is at **8:00 AM EST time on Wednesday, so grab your lottery ticket at the close on Tuesday if you’re playing this**.  Looks like another early-ass morning here in California for yours truly.\n\n[DIS](https://i.imgur.com/Z5tJcXA.jpg) 🚀 🚀 🚀 (but worth a hedge)\n\nMouse in the house. Disney plus Disney plus blah blah blah. If i hear one more thing about stellar DIS+ numbers I'm going to hurl, so looks like I'm going to hurl on [Tuesday because the mouse has their 2021 Annual Meeting of the Shareholders coming](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-companys-2021-annual-meeting-of-shareholders/).\n\nCould explain why [this 222.5c was put through THIS Wednesday, 3/3](https://i.imgur.com/T7TndP2.jpg).  I have seen some bearish put hedges sneak through, too, so maybe sell a call/buy a poot against the position or play the strike tight, in case they give an insanely bleak outlook related to theme parks that the news runs with.\n\n*Note: Being that I live in Los Angeles, I will personally drive over to their Burbank studios and punch mouse in the face if this doesn’t play out.*\n\n****\n\n**Tier 2: Meeting and conference presentations the next two weeks with intriguing UOA**\n\n[SQ](https://i.imgur.com/RgAE1hG.jpg)🚀 🚀 \n\nOTM call activity and speaking at the Wolfe FinTech Forum on 3/9. https://investors.squareup.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Wolfe-FinTech-Forum/default.aspx\n\nTier 2 because it's not SQ's event, but instead a conference.  I **almost snuk this into Tier 1 against the rules, and here’s why**: [SQ quietly created an in-house bank this week](https://kvia.com/news/business-technology/2021/03/02/square-launches-an-in-house-bank-as-fintech-competition-heats-up/) in ADDITION to their acquisition of TIDAL.\n\nYes, **it is a FinTech conference where SQ will be speaking RIGHT AFTER making a humongous FinTech move**.  Between SQ and TWTR, Jack is absolutely dripping in pump rn and I think the party keeps going here. \n\nPS- I've had Tidal ever since it was a free one year offering on my cell phone plan.  Everyone hates on it but it's legit!\n\n[EBAY](https://i.imgur.com/xyyHFHU.jpg)🚀 🚀 \n\nSpeaking at the [Bank of America Consumer and Retail Conference on Tuesday](https://investors.ebayinc.com/events/default.aspx)\n\nTier 2 as it's not their specific event.  Sounds like an absolute snoozefest, BUT we've got intriguing call buys, with [not only a May expiration placed thursday, but a 3/12 OTM call placed on Friday.](https://i.imgur.com/Soipwy9.jpg)\n\nEBAY bout to be YEETBAY.  I'm curious to see what comes out on this one, and cut it quick if nothing pops off.\n\n[OCGN](https://i.imgur.com/TbdPZfi.jpg)🚀 🚀 \n\nBreaking my own rules and sneaking this later dated play into T2.  [On March 16th, they are presenting at Oppenheimer Annual Healthcare Conference (big boy shit)](https://ir.ocugen.com/events/event-details/oppenheimer-annual-healthcare-conference).\n\n[Somebody placed a 3/19 15c bet on it](https://i.imgur.com/0XnvtYu.jpg).  The underlying was 11 dollars at the time.  Seems pretty...pretty good.\n\n****\n\n**Grab bag: Intriguing opportunities we are still waiting for UOA confirmation on ⌛️ **\n\n**SONOS** with an [Investor Day including Q & A on March 9th](https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2021/Sonos-to-Host-Virtual-Investor-Event-on-March-9-2021/default.aspx)\n\n**ETSY** post-ER with a [smattering of conference and meetings pumps on the 10th, 11th, 26th, and 24th](https://investors.etsy.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx)\n\n**AZN** has [multiple pumps scheduled each of the next two months](https://www.astrazeneca.com/investor-relations/events.html) and is the busiest events calendar I've seen thus far.  \n\n[Interesting that the two recent whale bets were both for 5/21](https://i.imgur.com/Qw8UtFT.jpg)\n\n**CRSR** with [one conference on the 11th and two on the 16th](https://ir.corsair.com/events-presentations) \n\n**CP** got a very intruiging tip on their recent performance.  JP Morgan industrial conference, presenting March 15th.\n\n****\n\n🐻 **A quick market note on the great being the enemy of the good**:\n\nLooks like stimmy is passing.  In 2020 this would be a SPY pump, but **recent treasuries activity indicates that the market seems to be reacting to good news by trying to see into the future**.  As more and more bullish news for the actual ECONOMY rather than the MARKET comes out, it has the potential to be bearish, as MMs move money in anticipation of rising interest rates, yields, and the eventual Fed rates increase and Quantitative Easing tapering )even though Powell swears not to.)\n\nSo, ya know, be careful out there. **Wait for index direction to sort in the morning before diving all in**. I would say grab some VXX but it’s a manipulated piece of shit that I hate right now. \n\n****\n\n**TLDR**\n\n**GE DIS and DKNG** have very interesting pump events coming with the UOA to indicate somebody out there is betting it will pay off. 🚀 🚀 🚀 \n\n**SQ EBAY and OCGN** have interesting speaking engagements with intriguing UOA, but they are not company-specific events (conferences, meetings) 🚀 🚀 \n\nThere are several interesting plays in the coming weeks. ⌛️ \n\n***\n\n*Inbox always open.

{"title": "🚀 PLTR, Palantir WILL moon 🚀", "selftext": "I will just tell you why. also the friday news of Palantir with AWH is a $SNOW killer, bye snowflake and boomer buffett\n\n1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defence sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.\n\nA real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.\n\n2) Just last friday, there were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN  to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.\n\n3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesnt make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.\n\n4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realise and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.\n\n5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, dont forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.\n\n6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet.She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.\n\n7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.\n\n8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?\n\n9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.\n\n10) Dont forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the 4Q earnings\n\n11)  If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, i see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)\n\n12) It's ok that the some retards dont join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.\n\nPLTR, a baby of Cathie Wood & Alex Karp.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀TLDR: PLTR  🚀 , buy PLTR.", "id": "lz9iwc", "created_utc": 1615060089.0, "score": 821, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 287, "comments": [{"body": "Is anyone else here retarded enough to have a 33 cost basis and 80K sunk into this???

Ulrich Kranz -  The CEO built the BMW Z3, x5 and the Mini and led BMW's \"project I\" and is balls deep in the automotive world.  They are advising Hyundai on their EV vehicles and creating their own with a subscriber model.  Their main addition to this crowded space is the \"Skateboard\" style drive train that you can build on top of... Fly by wire functionality allows designing all sorts of awesome things.... Oh and the \"You will own nothing and be happy about it\" car subscription which is like leasing but probably even worse...\n\n**The Myth** \\- **Apple car**... Probably not happening... But they talked to CANOO!@#@! Canoo and Hyundai/Kia are in bed together... they gotta be part of it. I Saw nothing but money $$ bills and convinced some of my friends that absolutely there would be an apple car ad for the superbowl. I didn't even care about the game... I couldn't wait.... When that failed to drop I told myself... \"They were totally acting like an apple partner, not tweeting, its smart... be silent, they are going to drop news any day now... Apple Rumors bro...

I troll on Stocktwits.. I enjoy the suffering... I owned the world, the streets were full of blood and I was their king...\n\nSo while many of you were crying I went shopping in the trashcan last Friday and took a sarcastic look at $GOEV again...\n\n**What I found was beautiful.**\n\nI felt something stir... was it hope?

Canoo promised a manufacturing partnership announcement Q1...

The revaluation of a manufacturing partnership is significant enough to cause the sp to get into a zone which will cause a squeeze. I believe news about this dropped after market close.
