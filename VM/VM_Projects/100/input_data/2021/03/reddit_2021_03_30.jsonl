But that also means you don't actually understand where the risk *is*. A simple example: You are holding SPY, it's $400, it loses 12% in a day, so you've lost 48 per share so 4,800.00 per lot of 100. Your CC I promise you did not cover even 10% of that and that's pretty much ATM and when you gear up to sell your next CC you're basically going to not cover anything again.

That conclusion should have been obvious on the front. \n\n>All investments are bad if they go down, I'm saying some are better than others.\n\nWell let's play this out.\n\nSPY. Same scenario, it was down 12%, and I am on the other side of your CC. You collected from me $300 let's say, great, and I paid $300, okay, you are now down $4800 - 300 = $4,500.00 and I am ... actually just fine. I see that it went down and said to myself, \"wow, that sucks\" and find something else with my money so I've not only not paid for the stock itself but I am not holding a bag and I couldn't care less what happens from then on to this thing. \n\nInverse scenario with puts, it's still down 12%, you sold my a promise that you'd buy it if it fell as little as 3%, this cost me $400 but it fell as I was worried it would do and you will be paying me $388.00 per share, catching the falling knives at $352.00. Well, golly, thanks! I will take my loss of $1,600 ( 12/share + 400 put ) over your loss of $3200, ( (388 - 352)*100 - 400  ) any day. \n\nYou know what though? Most weeks you take my money. That's absolutely true; it seems like a no brainer to be on the selling side of insurance but the problem is that when things go wrong and insurance is invoked it's usually catastrophic enough to wipe out weeks of gains. I mean I think a few people who do insurance (Acutaries? Accountants?) hang around here so find one and ask them why the copulas matter and how come you pay so freakin' much for insurance.\n\nSelling options is nothing more than playing to high tail risk; lots of risk of loss for usually menial levels of gain.\n\nE: Just in case you missed it the long call scenario carries no risk.

First, you don't lose your entire portfolio if you exercise that put, it just converts away from SPY into cash. Very, very different than actually losing the portfolio and blowing up. \n\nOn the other hand if you are holding this bag and it was traded as normal within rational parameters you're not 9% OTM, you're maybe 2% otm, so you just got a really heavy bag to hold that obviously you couldn't foresee how it would play out. And it didn't \"get better\" right after the 16th. The fact that it ended up with that liquidation and dropping that much meant that it was rough for a while there.\n\nWorse yet if you were there on February 14th or so you'd be in pretty much the same situation, the SPY rarely drops even more than 3% in a day so one way or the other you'd find yourself holding a bag that, for about a month and a half, would get really, really heavy. Hopefully you're not long any other risky assets because you're going to get margined. Now of course because this is historically accurate and not make-believe this happened to a lot of people and a lot of firms. You can look up any number of cases where going under was a real problem because almost everything fell at the same time and solvency and the ability to meet margin on any underlying bets pretty much failed.\n\n>You're talking about how massively risky selling options are and saying you'd be fine losing your entire investment, it's facetious and makes no sense.\n\nYou've said four incorrect things thus far while also stating that the inverse would be irrational and it makes me think you're *extremely* new. You didn't even seem to know how far and how jagged the fall for SPY was last year. I'm not saying you don't have a right to an opinion but I don't think your opinion is informed just based on what you're saying.\n\n>E: selling puts and selling covered calls is in no way \"infinite risk\". It's completely defined..\n\nThat is 100% incorrect. A lot of people mistake the ability to cover an event as a definition of that event, it's incorrect, if you sold a CSP on SPY and got assigned during a downfall you're stuck with the daggers in your chest; your portfolio is officially red, period, because that's what you decided to catch. You won't be caught with a margin call but that doesn't actually make this any less risky; you have no idea how far the daggers can actually fall. You can sell a CSP on a security that's 5% OTM and it can fall 50% EOD on Friday and you get assigned. And of course we have the wisdom to close all of these early *but* that's exactly why those wise points exist; this stuff does happen. And when it does you're stuck.\n\nOn the same front CCs seem like the play of the week because they are fancy limit orders so you can't possibly lose money in them but it's the same scenario in reverse; if you're holding the risky asset (the stock) setting limit orders doesn't do you any good against falling prices *and* what you don't know is when or how much something can rise rapidly and suddenly. The inverse to this is that you bought something at a top (oh, you know, SPY on Feb 13th or thereabouts) and it falls incredibly fast, faster than you can really react and definitely in a way that isn't obviously knowable how deep it can go, and with your plan on fire you're selling CCs at the highest premium you can tolerate to get out of the hole. Reality? You will, unfortunately, you will far too early; if you did this on SPY after the month and a half decline even at 5% each week you'd have been caught taking a loss.\n\nAnd again this is history. This is not make-believe. The whole notion that the risk is truly understood here and defined is just bad; this is why traders blow up and why even those who run the wheel can implode; they take a strategy and misplace the risk. You don't want to be the one holding the bag whether you're selling CCs or CSPs at all, it does you absolutely no good, and so while you can define the *profit* your risk is absolutely undefined on both of these deals both in upside and downside.

Risk is 100% defined for a csp, I‚Äôm not sure how you can argue with that, probably because you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. You need to work on clarity and sentence structure, use less words.\n\nI sold csps and ccs all last year through the crash and made a lot of money holding long shares and collecting a shit load of premium from people like you overpaying for contracts. This isn‚Äôt weird or new, it‚Äôs basic options trading people have been doing for years. Perhaps expand on what you think you know. The fact that you don‚Äôt think risk is defined holding 100 shares and selling puts and calls tells me a lot. We are talking about SPY here, not high vol meme stocks.

The **risk** is not. You don't actually know how far down the stock will go, you only know how much you have to pay if assigned, and it's the stock, the underlying, that carries the risk in options sales. I mean this is basic level information. \n\nIt's so simple it's hard even imagine explaining this a third time. Forget SPY. XYZ trades at 110. You sell a cash-secured put for $100. You know your cost is 100 x 100 or 10,000 of insurance. What you didn't know is that there was a scandal with XYZ and the price would drop 50% and you'd be assigned. The risk of that you figured was low (which is why you *sold* the insurance plan against it) and so you pay $10,000.00 for something worth $5,500. \n\nThe risk isn't in option because the option itself for you, as a seller, doesn't contain anything but the contract of insurance; the risk is in the thing *insured*. \n\nWhy is this hard for you?

I thought these hedgefunds can do anything to the price so I stopped thinking about it and thought gme could only go to the moon if people weren't selling which didn't happen so I thought we have a problem here with the jail dilemma thing. I thought it was just a pump and dump and these cultist people are just a bunch of idiots that want \"quick money\" which is never possible ever in this world. \n\nI tried to invest in the stock market like every other boomer and it worked a bit with bitcoin. Also put some money in REAL pump and dump shit like weed and RKT. Lost just a bit cause I was scared since I had no experience. 1 month later GME  \"magically\" went back up from 40 to 180 after market closed. Then I was thinking: \"wait these retards were REALLY onto something\". This wasnt just a pump and dump this is really a fight against RICH vs POOR. I felt really bad cause I did trust these apes. I thought I got brainwashed by the community and my brother and I just wanted to invest in the stock market and get slowly rich you know. But something about this stock/event feels different. The rich keep getting richer and its time for them to finally pay. \n\nThis was all just feeling and I was like fuck it and fomo'd everything in at 130$.

Yeah it might go to the moon, and Ryan Cohen might save it, but then again I might also be dead by the time any of that happens. \n\n(I was holding all 4 of these at one point)\n\nOther hypothetical examples:\nARKK? Pass. If I had bought in 12 months ago, great play.   But right now?  It's not something I'm sure I want to be holding, and definitely don't want to be buying at this price.  Cathy Wood did great, but her God talk is wonky to me and anyone who was heavy in tech had a great year, not just her.  I don't know if I trust her abilities going forward. \n\nARKX? Pass, for same reasons plus I don't understand why she picked the stocks she did at all.  Wonky.  God talk, etc. \n\nTSLA? Pass.  Way too expensive right now even if future earnings might (keyword *might*)  justify this P/E ratio. Too volatile, too. \n\nXXII? Pass.  You probably haven't heard of this one, but someone recommended them to me because they might be the future of smoking with their \"zero nicotine cigarettes\".

It‚Äôs being seen by many people and companies as a real asset/hedge against inflation. It has always been volatile and uncertain, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped it from going from a penny for multiple bitcoin to 60,000$ for a bitcoin. Most people don‚Äôt feel comfortable buying in because it‚Äôs too volatile, but the fact is it‚Äôs literally the best investment of the past decade, and so far even the best investment of this decade. The way I look at it is a hedge against basically everything. Everyone should put in 1‚Äì5% of their stock portfolio in bitcoin, not only would it increase its value if everyone did so, but it would lessen the volatility in the long run. Not only that, but what‚Äôs a few % of your portfolio? You should be making a decent return, probably a very minimum of 5%(just to beat inflation) in your portfolio, so if you put 5% of bitcoin in your portfolio you‚Äôre losing out on one year of gains by putting 5% into bitcoin, and that‚Äôs saying that it goes to 0$, which will never happen. \n\nI‚Äôm assuming you live in the USA, but it holds true no matter where you live, but if the USA has an collapse of its massive debt, things could get really bad here, our dollar could become worthless. For me, 5% of my money in bitcoin is a hedge against that securing my future, knowing I will be able to be independent from the government if it does happen. I‚Äôd put the probability at maybe 5% or more of a total/major collapse in my lifetime, and that‚Äôs just piece of mind. I‚Äôd put the probability that bitcoin becomes a stable/seen as a legitimate currency in the next 10-20 years at 90%. 5% that it completely fails. For me, those are good odds.

{"title": "Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV Platform", "selftext": "Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.\n\nThe Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told \"the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.\"\n\nToyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.\n\nWhen the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla \"will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.\n\nI think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What's in it for Toyota?**\n\nToyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology. Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates (Over The Air) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's benefit is the gain in ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010, and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system. However, due to various reasons such as poor sales, the alliance between the Toyota and Tesla ended in 2017. Yet, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla's Fremont Factory is an automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, operated by Tesla. But the facility opened as the General Motors Fremont Assembly in 1962, and was later operated by NUMMI, a former GM‚ÄìToyota joint venture. Tesla took ownership in 2010.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast year, Toyota sold 9.35 million vehicles, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022. In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th of March that ‚Äúthe likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%.‚Äù Although the context is not clear, it was also written ‚Äúprobably within a few months,‚Äù an expression that can be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market capitalization is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of the world's largest market capitalization company, Apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year. Tesla, in particular, has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 vehicles sold as of last year. If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.\n\n[Source](https://www.torquenews.com/1/tesla-and-toyota-are-considering-jointly-developing-small-electric-suv-platform)", "id": "mg91ws", "created_utc": 1617083224.0, "score": 4547, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 303, "comments": [{"body": "It seems fairly odd that only a Korean reporter finds out this.

They have stated they're happy to sell their skateboard when they have spare capacity (ie production capability exceeds demand), but they've also made it very clear that their primary focus in the car space is the \"machine that builds the machine\" (in Musk's words) - that is they're focussed on developing their ability to build their gigafactories and the optimisation of the build cycle (the single piece casting of entire subframes etc \"giga press\" as they call it) and FSD. Trying to get a partner up to speed on their software platforms is going to divert a lot of resources away from their core goals and isn't in line with the way Musk has behaved for the last 5 years across all his companies.\n\nIf Tesla were looking for a Japanese partner to crack into that space, wouldn't a smaller player like Honda or Subaru be a more logical choice than a company that has been very negative about their previous experience with them ?", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "I think Toyota is the perfect partner for Tesla.

Some of the new companies probably also get roped into popular ETFs and whatnot for exactly that reason. Problem is, as so many new, potentially meteoric growth companies enter the market, only so many of them could ever possibly last very long, at least by competition alone.

In its latest brief, Goldman makes an interesting argument: Investors shouldn‚Äôt rely on statements such as ‚Äúhonesty is at the heart of our business‚Äù or ‚Äúour clients‚Äô interests always come first‚Äù that appear in S.E.C. filings and annual reports.\n\n**The case is a test of shareholders‚Äô ability to sue over claims of investment fraud.** The pension funds have sought to sue as a class over Goldman‚Äôs statements, saying that they believed the claims of honesty. Goldman has argued in its latest brief that the investors are resorting to ‚Äúguerrilla warfare‚Äù and aren‚Äôt providing ‚Äúserious legal arguments.‚Äù The bank says that an investor victory would lead to a barrage of future lawsuits over ‚Äúgeneral and aspirational statements‚Äù of the kind made by ‚Äúvirtually every public company in America.‚Äù\n\n- The Biden administration isn‚Äôt taking sides but will say today that ‚Äúmeritorious private securities-fraud suits‚Äù are ‚Äúan essential complement‚Äù to enforcing securities laws.\n\n**How a former S.E.C. commissioner thinks the court will respond to Goldman‚Äôs arguments:** ‚ÄúI expect the court to be troubled by the claim that companies cannot be held accountable for saying that clients come first and then acting otherwise,‚Äù Robert Jackson Jr., who served on the commission from 2018 to 2020 and is now an N.Y.U. law professor, told DealBook. (The justices probably won‚Äôt agree with the claim that making a company ‚Äúmean what it says‚Äù will lead to a tsunami of meritless lawsuits, he added.)

I like Tesla, but Im also realistic. First, this year, the European manufacturers won't need the CO2 pooling, so that's a huge chunk of revenues going away. \n\nPlus as an EV driver, I follow the market closely. There is a chunk of great EVs coming out that are frankly as good or better. Take Hyundai/Kia - they have the Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 as well as a Genesis one. Lots of room, cool designs, efficient and charges back to ,80% in 20 minutes. Tesla is limited by 400 V architecture, while they have 800V, which means they will be able to charge faster and with less wear on the battery. And best of all, they cost less. \n\nSimilarly Volkswagen, while not making as good EVs as Hyundai or Tesla, are producing massive amounts of EVs that seem to suit the average taste in Europe, he most important market. Tesla has an edge in China but there are domestic competitors plus you are always at the mercy of this totalitarian government. \n\nWhen it comes to charging infrastructure, Tesla has an edge in the US and in parts of Europe. But not in some big EV markets in Europe (Norway, Germany etc.). Similarly the open Hyper Charging networks are expanding rapidly.\n\nLastly, it's not only Tesla enthusiasts buying Teslas anymore, but Tesla still hasn't gotten the QC issues fixed. Which leads in a lot of disappointment. Case in point was the beta testing fo LFP batteries on customers in Europe. The batteries weren't calibrated, the charging speeds limited to snail pace. Tesla enthusiasts might be forgiving, but not the average Joe who spent 40000 on a car and then it's a lottery whether you get the crappy LFP battery or a functioning one. \n\nSo these are my thoughts.

Let's just wait patiently until the technicals tells us to enter.\n\n**MIDDAY 12:00-15:00**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/88priavp06q61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ffa27aa5b2950f90bbd91369ff900b002465bf0\n\nMichael spamming the group again with his nonsense, I'm just going to ignore him and open a chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u0hy7nat06q61.jpg?width=1641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1870c9155e18f2b195b5be6d9073fec3237f46e0\n\nUsing my favorite indicators of support/resistance, MACD, VWAP and MA cross we can see that this is a clear indicator for a downward move in VIAC according to the technicals, I open a short position here.\n\n2 hours later...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pc771x6u06q61.jpg?width=1643&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a78ccd799c49944de9ec2e02960e800253fb79c7\n\nlook at that, the TA predicted the exact moment VIAC will drop.

Michael is considering a sex change operation and it looks like he has just announced a mysterious donor that is about to make a big donation to his üçÜ chopping support group. This is not related to trading in anyway, but it's kinda fun hearing about Michael progressive activism.

TA absolutely nailed it once again.\n\nAs Ken Griffith once said, advances in technology have enabled real time information and advanced charting techniques to be available to the retail investor, levelling the playing field with institutions.
