{"title": "Expected moves for this week. Tesla, SPY, CRWD, NKE, FDX and more.", "selftext": "**Market Volatility**\n\nLast week the major indices rallied to new highs. Options were pricing in about a 2% move last week and the SPY climbed by nearly 3%. With that, option volatility, as measured by the VIX settled near 20 to close the week.\n\nAt the close on Friday, **SPY** options were pricing in about a **1.5%** move in either direction for the upcoming week. That corresponds to about $388 to the downside and $400 on the upside. Here's how that 1.5% expected move compares to this week's expected moves in QQQ and IWM:\n\n**QQQ 2.6%IWM 2.4%**\n\nAs I mentioned, the VIX closed lower on the week, near 20 Friday. Again, that wasn't due to a lack of stock movement. If one is trading pure IV out a month or more being short vol would have worked, but if one was trading a week or two out, it's all about the expected move... the VIX or individual stock IV is less important if the stock makes a large one-way move higher.\n\n**Tesla** **(TSLA)** made a big move higher, helping to take the indices to new highs. Tesla (TSLA) was higher on the week by nearly $100. With the stock now just below $700, Tesla (TSLA) options are pricing in an expected move of about 7% for this week, down slightly from last week. Options are pricing in a roughly 15% move for the next month (to April 16th), also slightly less than last week. In other words, following last week's rally, Tesla options are pricing in less of an expected move now than they were a week ago:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1oxa2v3ui1n61.gif\n\n**GameStop (GME).** After a wild week of moves, and the stock now near $270, options are pricing about a 30% move in either direction for this week, corresponding to roughly $185 on the downside and $350 to the upside:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Earnings This Week**\n\nExpected moves for some of the companies reporting earnings this week, including CrowdStrike, Nike and FedEx. Each entry shows prior earnings moves for comparison. A larger searchable list can be found on the  [Options AI Earnings Calendar](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings-calendar/this-week).

Think of it like a point spread in a game. Those short premium need the under, those long premium are looking for the over. Before choosing strikes and positioning know that that is essentially what you are doing versus the crowd. (that disclaimer is for the inevitable comment \"so you're saying it could go up or down\".

I've been looking at NIO which seems to have the volatility for decent premiums, and also a decent outlook for the longer stretch.\n\nI know the premiums change from month-to-month, but what range should I be looking for with stocks in the $40-$50 range?\n\nWould it be better with that budget to diversify into two less expensive stocks?\n\nThanks! Any tips/wisdom for a CC newbie would be appreciated.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "For CC what you are looking for is a neutral to slightly bullish stock. If you are very bullish then CC is not the right play and instead you would be buying call spreads or buying simple calls (warning, purchasing calls is extremely risky!)\n\nWith that said, CC are really an excellent investment strategy with a very nice risk profile. I as well also really like NIO and almost feel it has too much upside to be the perfect CC candidate (it's moving too quickly).\n\nTo play that one I would build a position to 100 shares over time and look to buy more on slumps. I'd enter initially with 20-30 shares and again buy 20-30 more shares whenever there is a down day. You may miss the train if NIO runs away, but that is investment, you need a good price more than you need a good stock.\n\nWhat you really want to avoid is a stock that you feel is going to slump. For example, let's say you buy GE at 12.50 and sell a covered call for 0.20. Your effective buy price is now 12.30. Later, let's say that GE goes down to 10.00. Any calls sold at lower than 12.30 (plus the call premium) will be a net loss for you. From $10, the $12.00 call option is going to be worth so little it won't be worth it. You are then effectively stuck waiting for the stock to return to the $12 range, however long that takes (or worse, it drops further). While waiting your capitol is tied up in a stock when instead it could have been put into a winner (like NIO :grin:)\n\nIf you think there is a risk of such a slump, but you still like the stock, then ideally have money set aside to buy 100 or 200 more shares. In this case, with the above example, you would buy 200 more shares at $10 and then start selling 3 covered calls at 11. If the stock hits $11, you will earn $50 (loss of -150 and gain of +200) net on the stock itself plus all the the premiums of the calls you sold. Lesson here is to average down and generally assume the price will dip after you purchase (no matter when you purchase, leave money on the side so you can average down).\n\nMy 2 cents, I'd go with NIO unless you find and feel another stock at a cheaper price is just way more solid. One vs two stocks is not necessarily that much diversification. IMO the diversification play would be to keep cash on the side so you can improve a position if it goes south on you.\n\nDisclaimer: I am very likely to enter a long position in NIO in the next 7 days, but currently hold no NIO.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Hey SeaDan, thanks for this! Very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time!\n\nOne thing I don't understand in your 4th paragraph: if I buy 100 GE at 12.50, why would I write a CC ITM? Wouldn't I write it at a strike like 13 or 14 at least? If I sell a CC at $14, then I make the premium as a (small) hedge against the drop to $10 in your illustration. So once that contract expires worthless, I'd just use the same stock to write another CC at say $12. \n\nMy other question: I know premiums range all over the place, but what would you say is a good target range for premiums in contracts one month out? Vega obviously plays a big roll in this but I'm new so I'm not sure what to shop for. I've heard that baseline your premium should be at least 2% of the stock price...\n\nThanks SeaDan!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You would typically write a OTM CC. So yes, buying at 12.50 you would likely sell a CC with strike at 13 or 14. You are correct about and also that does hedge (some) against a drop to $10. Though, it does not hedge you by very much in this example.\n\nTo illustrate you buy at $12.50 and sell a $13 strike CC for $0.20. Your effective buy price becomes $12.30. Let's say now we have a drop to $10 and also at that time the $12 strike call then sells for only $0.10. If you sell that call contract, your effective buy price drops again by $0.10 to $12.20, but you are holding a contract to sell at $12.00. Your effective buy price is $12.20, and your shares could be called away at $12.00, a $0.20 per share loss!\n\nLets say you instead try to sell the $13.00 strike, it is far OTM at this point and could easily be worth $0.02, simply not worth selling. In such a case, either you will sell and take a loss so you can free up the money or would an indeterminate amount of time for the stock to recover so you can once again start selling profitable covered calls.\n\n\nThe premium question depends on quite a bit. When selling CC you are selling your upside potential. How much profit do you think you might lose out on and how much are you willing to lose out on? If you think that for exmample in our hypothentical the stock will go to $14 but not $15, then the $14 covered call is a good one to sell. The fact that the $14 strike yields maybe 1% vs the $13 strike yielding 4% is immaterial, you'll make more money from the stock going to $14 than you will the premium received. To emphasize, if you think a stock is going up, you'll make more from the underlying stock than the covered call contract.  This is why CC are weakly bullish plays, if you think the stock is going up by a lot, then selling calls is not what you want to do (better to just hold the stock!). Stocks that move a lot will pay higher premiums, so you're taking on more risk by doing so.\n\nAs another example 'CAN' a chinese bitcoin mining machine maker, very volatile and recently at $20 was swinging by $2-4 per day and was selling $25 calls for $4. At $20, that was a 20% return! It turns out CAN is going gang-busters, but the stock very well easily could have gone back to $5 where it was just a couple months ago.\n\nSo, it's hard to answer the premium question, it's a matter of how much upside you think there is in the underlying stock and how much risk you are willing to take on (the risk being your money tied up and at a loss if the stock drops and hoping the stock recovers).", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Generally covered call writers sell the calls out of the money. \n\nThat way, they gain on the stock, if the stock rises, and it is called away.   \n\nGenerally, traders choose about 20 to 30 delta, out of the money, for picking a strike price on covered calls, more or less 30 days to expiration.

I am scared. \n\nNobody would, so relax. Even if SPY is 398.01 at expiration and you get assigned, it's not a disaster. The value of the 396 long call will have increased, probably enough to cover the cost of the assignment. If you get assigned or even suspect you will be assigned (because SPY was well over 398 an hour before close on Friday), just sell to close the long call. You might even make a profit on the deal.\n\nRemember, when a short call is assigned, you **receive cash** and deliver shares. So you add the proceeds from closing the long call to the cash received on assignment, and that will be more than enough to cover the short shares of SPY you'll be stuck with from assignment.

You'll lose so much money to the inefficiency of the spread and expirations that the trade has an uphill battle being profitable.\n\n**Trading underlyings worth less than $10**\n\nThis is super common due to budget constraints of new traders, but super risky. Penny stocks are either distressed companies with a high probability of going bankrupt (but that doesn't justify bear/short trades) or young companies that have yet to prove they are a viable business. A better way to stay in a small budget is to use vertical spreads on high volume underlyings, like SPY or NFLX.\n\n**Trading options with greater than 100% IV**\n\nThe higher IV is, the less of a connection there is between the price movement of the underlying and the value of the call or put. We get so many questions/complaints/paniks about someone with a call that loses money even when the stock goes up, or a put that loses money when the stock goes down. This is due to paying an excessive amount of premium at open due to high IV. If a $5 put on a $6 stock is going for $23, it's insane to take that bet. The stock can't fall more than $6, so why would you pay $23 for a $5 put?\n\n**Covered calls on highly volatile underlyings**\n\nCovered calls are super expensive in up-front capital, so you want to be sure you have a high probability of profit to make them successful trades. However, because of the narrative around \"share ownership to beat the hedge funds\" with meme stocks like GME and AMC, there's this myth going around that share ownership and CCs are the best way to play volatile stocks. Nothing could be further from the truth. The higher the volatility, the *lower* you want your initial capital outlay to be, to play the probabilities and risk/reward. High risk/high reward is okay if you limit the risk by limiting the capital you pay up front.\n\n**Any kind of structurally unlimited risk short strategy**\n\nNaked calls, naked puts/CSPs, short straddles and short strangles are all unlimited risk with respect to how they are structured. Naked puts/CSPs actually do have a limit, in that a stock can't fall below $0, but there is nothing in the structure of the trade that limits the risk, compared to something like a put credit spread.\n\n**Lack of consideration for days to expiration vs. delta**\n\nI see so many trades that are opened in less than 30 days to expiration and with deltas that are either too low (for OTM debit trades) or too high (for ITM credit trades). \"I wrote a covered call for XYZ $25 strike on 3/15 expiring on 3/19,\" when the stock price is $24 or, \"I bought an XYZ $25 strike call on 3/15 expiration on 3/19\" when the stock price is $4, are trades I see posted all the time.

I buy a 62.00 strike option for 1.60 that pays a dividend tomorrow. If I exercise, my effective buy price is 63.60, and I received a dividend of 0.25, lowering my effective buy price to 63.35.

Unfortunately our markets are hopelessly ill-liquid when it comes to next month contracts. And we have weekly contracts only on the index. I was able to find one contract in the entire market of May expiry and I bought it. Now I am selling weekly against it. For first 3 weeks I made profits and reduce the cost basis. Yesterday (we have Thursday expiry) my short puts went ITM. Now I have absorbed my loss and rolled over + down instead of booking profits on the May put because I may not get it back. Also imo we are still at the tip of the iceberg and the sea floor is far below - at least 20% correction is what I am expecting. Fortunately for me this is index based option and hence there is no physical underlying to be assigned etc The contract is cash settled. Worst thing is I bleed little every week while accumulating massive notional profits on my May puts and then when towards end April-start of May I am supposed to book profits on my May PUT the market turns on me. Our markets move like mercury. Imagine Dow or NASDAQ moving like GME! A swift 10% up-move  in a couple of hours move will result in the notional profits turn in to losses.  Hopefully at that point of time there will be enough liquidity for me to get in and out of the contract at small bid-ask spreads but I may not be fast enough or simply a gap up opening will kill me.

Granted, it's not a large loss and you may comfort yourself with the premium you collected, but why even give away $0.05/share?

However, most options traders never actually exercise their option to get the actual shares and they simply close out their positions for a gain or loss. From my understanding buying an option and then closing the option if it goes in the money, would be equivalent to buying 100 shares of the underlying and then selling it for profit (not accounting for other overhead fees). Options just eliminate the intermediary step of buying to sell immediately for a profit. Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\nIf I buy 1 contract at X strike price and it goes in the money, I can close out my position for a profit by selling that contract to someone else who wants to get in and thinks they can make money off this contract. I simply bought something at a lower price and I'm selling it for a higher price. But what is actually happening here? Was all that I gave away the ability to buy 100 shares of a stock at X strike price and because of that, I gain money?\n\nMy concern here is accidentally selling a naked call. I plan on trading options and not investing, so I do not plan on holding any positions overnight. I am afraid of the implications behind selling a naked call and then having an obligation rather than an option. Because I hold an **obligation** to give someone else 100 shares of a stock at a \"discounted\" price, am I still able to close out my position anytime like the example shown in the second paragraph? If I exited the trade and there is no one else that sold a call at this strike price, where will this buyer get his \"discounted\" shares from should he choose to exercise his contract (assuming it goes in the money)? Intuitively it does not make sense that I should be able to exit because I hold an obligation to him, so why would I be able to close out the position at my convenience. \n\n However, I have been playing with selling calls or having negative amount of contracts on paper trading, and I am able to simply buy to close and bring me back to 0 amount of contracts. When I buy to close, am I simply buying the **ability** to buy 100 shares of a stock at X strike price, but because I already **owed** someone else 100 shares shares, it cancels out? \n\n**TLDR: This is already super long and I am doubtful someone will read this, but to summarize my main concern is selling a naked call that goes in the money and the guy decides to exercise his contract instead of selling his contract. What actually happens then? I couldn't just go and buy the same contract at X strike price to close out my position right? I would have to go and buy 100 shares of the security at market price and then sell it to him for an even cheaper price? I ask this because I feel like buying a contract that cost more than the premium I received is cheaper in terms of net loss than actually buying 100 shares of a stock at market and then selling all of them at X strike price, but I can see how this is related to how option are priced related to the underlying security which I do not understand much of at this moment.**", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your counter-party is the entire pool of long holders.  \n\nAfter exercise and matching to your option, it is too late to close the position: the option has been acted upon, and your account becomes short 100 shares. \n\nYou buy 100 shares to close the short stock position.  \n\nPlease read the **Getting Started** links at top of this weekly thread.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But I can close any naked call position by buying to close at any time as long as it hasn’t been exercised? \n\nIs it possible for an option to become exercised when it’s out the money?

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.\n\n# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.\n*****\n> Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.\n*****\n> The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.\n*****\n> The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.\n*****\n> The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.\n*****\n> # Fed ahead\n> “The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. “I think the message is going to be consistent.”\n*****\n> He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.\n*****\n> Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.\n*****\n> That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.\n*****\n> Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% — its highest level in more than a year.\n*****\n> It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.\n*****\n> “The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year — deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,” said Peters of PGIM.\n*****\n> “It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,” he said. “So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there’s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.”\n*****\n> Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.\n*****\n> # Growth vs. cyclicals\n> Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.\n*****\n> Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.\n*****\n> “When rates are very low, valuations don’t matter to people,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.\n*****\n> “If rates are low, there’s no penalty,” he said. “If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that’s what we’ve seen here.”\n*****\n> Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he’s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.\n*****\n> “The names that I’m in — Visa, GM, Ford, Macy’s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,” he said. “It’s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.”\n*****\n> The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.\n*****\n> “Rate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,” Redler said. “Last week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‘Was that it?’”\n*****\n> “Next Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,” he said. “Rates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday’s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.”\n*****\n> Apple’s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market’s gains last year.\n*****\n> “Watch Apple because it’s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,” Redler said.\n*****\n> # Bond volatility\n> There is some important data in the coming week, including February’s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.\n*****\n> The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.\n*****\n> The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank’s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.\n*****\n> The program expires March 31.\n*****\n> “This is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,” Peters of PGIM said.\n*****\n> “The markets are kind of divided on what’s going to happen,” he said. “I think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.”\n*****\n> Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.\n*****\n> “I think you’re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,” he said. “I think you’re going to see these whippy moves.”\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/fkwT5RT.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/MuJ7SlC.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lQiMjAN.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/hvH8uj8.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/AUV1ojJ.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ojOPNgp.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OtOIN5B.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AUXbpnZ.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/sptpE1X.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hb2eNGo.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/YPDtJd7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/XOhfVX4.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13\n\n> Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader’s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.\n\n> March’s option expiration week performance is second only to December’s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ’s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. S&P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March’s quarterly options expiration.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/6ef1d4cbdd86a8efa09b8c2942d48517/32ed3896b2fe9623-1a/s500x750/f4254e1e0edf858dbfd4e67344757c69c48d30b6.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81d51a4dd39b5941b831de20b28314c7/32ed3896b2fe9623-0e/s500x750/3ef3515466260a5660a9ec6eadb8a91cd697cf96.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/92b861530dfd9673b236fb0cd7af89c0/32ed3896b2fe9623-3c/s500x750/23c07978c0f660d7070cc8e2dd6c81aa392a92b7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Signs of Life in Europe?\n\n> Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.\n\n> Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> While we don’t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. “We remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.”\n\n> For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.\n\n*****\n\n> # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&P 500 & Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March\n\n> We’ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market’s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior – and likely to do so for some time to come.\n\n> There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.\n\n> The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today’s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week’s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.\n\n> This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.\n\n> However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/264401d95b5a55c592a6f8f10df22c5e/24ec511e4e033f88-38/s500x750/fe7be5042338b6e7e7b428a0f8fd5208691e48d7.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Versatile Outperformers\n\n> There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**\n\n> Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308a-768x515.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308b-768x509.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308c-768x253.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1a03fHd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QfVfqx2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/Is3mMmC.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/k2c0t0O.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 3.15.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/VKvrx46.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  3.16.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/eoFBwOW.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.16.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ujRMr7q.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/myM4TrG.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.17.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/jVQLr1k.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.18.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/AWKlUdJ.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.18.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SWuSo8l.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.19.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VyDOWFI.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.19.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # FedEx Corp. $270.20\n**FedEx Corp.

{"title": "My Take on Semiconductors - TSMC DD", "selftext": "Reports of the [semiconductor shortage](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/538474-biden-to-sign-executive-order-addressing-chip-supply-chain-shortage) in early February had me take deeper look into the industry. Wanted to share my thoughts with the sub!\n\nThe market is essentially split into two parts. Companies like AMD, NVIDIA, and QCOM design chips. Companies like TSM, UMC, and Samsung produce them. The shortage here is exclusively on the production side. We can't make chips fast enough and many industries (car makers in particular) are complaining really loudly about the shortage. Some of this is self-inflicted and short-term. Automakers cut back production forecasts because of COVID and rely heavily on just-in-time production supply chains to cut back on costs. This means that they were largely caught with their pants down when demand started to pick back up. \n\nThere are strong longer-term trends driving the shortage here too. Cars are getting more complicated and EVs need more/better hardware/chips. Right now, auto-makers are generally looking at 14nm chips ([Tesla's MCU2](https://onlyusedtesla.com/teslas-media-control-unit-mcu1-vs-mcu2/) is based on the Intel AtomE8000). This is an older process node, Intel was [releasing 14nm chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors#Skylake_microarchitecture_(6th_generation)) in 2015. I think ultimately, car production is going to have to be cut back, prices are going to go up, automakers are going to rush to lock in future supply, and producers (not designers) are going to benefit.\n\nThe producer market is really interesting. It takes a LONG time to spin up a new factory (fab). Generally speaking, it's 3-4 years before a factory goes from planning to production. We can't really throw money at this problem to fix this in the short-term. The producer market is also very clearly split into two parts: those who can make 10nm chips and below and those who can't. This [chart](https://s3.i-micronews.com/uploads/2021/03/ILLUS_HIGH-PERFORMANCE-PACKAGING_Overview_SemiconIndustry_YOLE_March2021.jpg) breaks it down at a high level. There are only three companies that can make chips that we'll want in the next 5 years (Intel, Samsung, TSMC), and one of them can't really do it. Intel has gotten 10nm reasonably figured [out but can't break 7.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations) They've given up the production race and [plan on outsourcing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production) their future designs to TSMC and Samsung. \n\nBetween Samsung and TSM, TSM is investing much more aggressively for the future. They've already planning on building out a 5nm production line in Arizona for [\\~20K wafers](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/tsmc-increasing-spending-arizona-chip-factory-35b-2021-03-09/) which should increase their global production by 20%. There are [rumors](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-arizona-fab-potential-expansion) that they are expanding production to 100K wafers which would double their global 5nm capacity. Samsung is still figuring out [where they want to build](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16483/samsung-in-the-usa-a-17-billion-usd-fab-by-late-2023). It also looks like [TSM](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmc-3nm-2021-apple-chips/) is going to beat [Samsung](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/samsung-beginning-3nm-chip-mass-production-2022-2020-11-19/) to 3nm by almost a full year. \n\nThat said, the stock is not cheap. It's got a PE ratio of 53. But the steep technological moat, aggressive investment in future production, and long-term demand increases (cars/computers/phones aren't getting any simpler or less popular) makes me confident they'll grow into their price. \n\nTLDR: We need more chips.

{"title": "SPY $400. Technical analysis for the week ahead for \"beginners\".", "selftext": "Not a trading advise.\n\nFollowing on my comment earlier today, I asked if there was any interest in some bullshit TA for next week since the entire WSB front page is full of legit DD including all kind of mammal pictures. \n\nI’m going to keep it as clean and simple as I can using area charts instead of candles. I believe support and resistances are better visible this way. It should help beginners see these levels at first sight. \n\n**Part I - Bull cases:**\n\n**SPY**\n\nPeaked through resistance and held. Common thought was resistance at 394.xx ATH while I drew my resistance line at 392.50 earlier last week. It held above 392.50 Thursday, resistance became support and whaddaya know a sharp bounce at 392.50 Friday intraday, turning green. Opened a new position on that support confirmation. 3/19 400c. If you're interested in learning charts, I recommend taking an actual look at the chart below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aim6y6vuzwm61.jpg?width=1548&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f63851b772f2bbf8cc7fd3a5cccd38d4d6f9c95f\n\n**Bull Scenario A:**\n\nSPY opens red and tests 392.50-393 Monday again, holds and closes above 396. If this plays out, we’re likely see the 400 breach Tuesday intraday. I won’t be spooked by the Monday dip. Might actually add. \n\n**Bull Scenario B:**\n\nNo repetitive back test. Face ripping rally above 400. \n\nWho would think folks will get their stimmy this weekend and the forbidden digital asset will trade above $60K? Honestly guys, this was kinda obvious. Not saying retail is single-handedly causing this. In my opinion, institutions anticipating this move is behind the $60K breach. I bet if we look at today’s buying blocks next week, we will see double digit unit purchases dominating fraction buys. This will be the confirmation of institution involvement, bringing retail inside.\n\nAnyway,\n\n$60K+, VIX potential $20 break down, QQQ short term bottom(?) and current market momentum pointing SPY 400 Monday. Many more detailed indicators (Bullish MACD cross overs, call/put ratios, percentage of tickers above 200 moving average inside SPY etc.) supporting this but explaining them without a video is not practical. \n\nContinuing on scenario B...Test 402 Monday intraday, rejection, test 404 (actual resistance) Tuesday and a sharp rejection. This is where I’m hoping to exit my 400c position and go short term 🌈🐻. Monday closing above 400 (or not) will be the deciding factor. \n\n**VIX**\n\nFellas this part is important. Spend some time on the chart below. VIX is very close to the infamous $20 support. Last time that support was tested, bears raped EVERYONE. They took no prisoners. I’d like to point out that last time it was under 20 was **more than a year ago.** Rules apply. VIX goes up, stocks goes down and vice versa. AKA fear indicator. If VIX goes below 20, which is a big event, **Bull Scenario B** will apply 100%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e7kms0qy2xm61.jpg?width=1550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=743d02ae122887214dbfcf976d2ffbb2a7f4aa0b\n\n**QQQ**\n\nI think we’ve all learned the last 3 weeks that portfolio diversification is a real thing 🙃 \n\nWhile QQQ is still sitting at a bear territory, it showed signs of a likely short term bottom. Mighty 323 resistance (double top) and 311 is the VERY important support. I believe it’s going to follow the rest of the crowd, breaking key resistances at 318 and 323. I will be on the look out for 318+ Monday premarket for confirmation. If so, above **Bull Scenario A or B** likely apply, thus giving bears little to no early hope.\n\n**TSLA**\n\nWhile 700 resistance is obvious, i believe 720 is much more important. \n\nIn above Bull Scenario A, TSLA tests 688 support, bounces and close above 705. Tuesday tests 720 for real for real and hard rejection.\n\nIn above Bull Scenario B, pre-market 700+ straight up, taking advantage of pre-market low volume (I believe it did this at 800 as well) and blasts through 720. This level is where I’m hoping to exit my 3/19 700 calls. \n\n**TNX 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD**\n\nI want to cover this part in another post under bear cases. I think bears gonna love mid next week. I will be shorting financials and oil. \n\nIf this was informative, let me know and I’ll continue tomorrow holding a big ass bear flag for Part II.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the love guys. So far so good.

Movement in the 1 as channel is expected and noice. Breaking and closing above or below the 1sd is not noise and indicative of further movement in that direction \n\nIf you look back to the weakness a few weeks ago you’ll notice we sold past but never closed below the 1sd channel. Technically you need 2 days closing below in order to confirm trend\n\nSo, there are 2 second order derivatives that are very important: vanna and charm. These provide support in what is know as a “bullish window” which exists every month before monthly\nVIX expired AND ALSO before monthly OPEX\n\nAfter those 2 expirations, vanna and charm have minimal effect on the market and a bearish window appears. Macro events heavily influence market movement during this window \n\nThat said, this week is fed week. The market ignored the rise last week because:\n\n1) vanna / charm are working overtime \n\n2) who knows what the fed will say/do and HOPIUM is kinda huge right now\n\nThe biggest tell next week is the following \n\n1) monthly vix expires 3/17, the day of FOMC\n\n2) if we can not breach new ATHs AND CLOSE THERE by 3/17, look out below \n\n3) if we DO breach ATH and close at the highs by 3/17, the bearish window will be very short lived and that gives us the pass to 4200-4300 range\n\nSo, sit back and enjoy!

{"title": "$RIDE with me: DD, Lordstown", "selftext": "\n\nQuick recap last week Hindenburg yes we all know them and if you don't do some of your own DD made a short report on Lordstown motors $RIDE\nThis made the stock fall to $15 per share which is down 50% from ATH\nLordstown is one of the most legitimate EV companies out there. A major partnership with multiple companies like camping world and GM. This is one of the worst-hit pieces I've seen.\n\nFirst off fuck short sellers. Lordstown motors is a truck company that is bringing much-needed manufacturing jobs to the Midwest US FUCKING A This is an American company hiring people in a struggling city so anyone who shorts this stock is simply anti-America. Seriously fuck you for profiting from the losses in small American manufacturing city's. Even if you don't think Lordstown is a good investment is is outrageously toxic to make money on the failure of fellow Americans.\n\nThis hit claimed multiple things that I will now assess \n\nEdit*: for all you retards that can't read in the comments find me an OEM EV company that has binding pre-orders I dare you.\n\n1) there is no demand.\nClaiming there is no demand for an electric EV truck is insane. EV is the future and trucks are part of that by claiming there is no demand makes no sense and it's as simple as that. the tesla cybertruck has 400k preorders and I am sorry tesla retards but your local plumber, an energy company, and farmer jack arent buying a cybertruck. The real bros of silicon valley will buy the shit out of cybertucks so they can use them to live in because they can't afford rent but ain't no real truck work is getting done in a cybertruck.\n\n3) the truck doesn't work\nThere are many videos of working prototypes not rolling downhill that can be easily found with a basic Google search these guys are probably using internet explore and bing search engine to do their DD or they're just blind. The Endurance truck is entered into a 250-mile rally in April and will be competing. Why the hell would you enter a race if your truck doesn't even work no one could be that dumb. The truck did have some issues as one of the prototypes caught on fire but the keyword is a prototype. Yes, no way I didn't know that experimental prototypes fail a lot of that's the whole reason prototyping exists.\n\n5) preorders are fake\nNo, they aren't they are not binding pre-orders that is true but name one EV company with binding pre-orders even teslas cyber tuck can be \"pre-ordered\" with a non-binding $100 check so don't try and argue this is any different no one in their right mind would lock into a binding contract with any new EV company and no one has.\n\nThis report has caused RIDE short interest to shoot straight up and if a prefect candidate for WSBs good olde fashioned short squeeze to the moon.\n\nThe bull case. I grew the biggest testies and doubled down on this bad boy during the dip last Friday. my position 350 shares 5 long 2022 $30 calls. Mostly all bought on Friday\n\n1) All pre-orders are for commercial use, the 100k preorders are from companies to use as fleet vehicles and they do plan to work into the consumer market after they ramp production more.\n\n2) They own and will produce in the Lordstown plant previously owned by GM which already has a 500k car per year capacity\n\n3) I agree with your take on autonomy I think it is vital to an EV company and this is very speculative GM who has the cruise Autonomous driving system is a pretty big investor in Lordstown and the CEO of Lordstown says they have a great relationship and want to expand their relationship with GM. So I would assume sometime down the road this could mean the integration of the cruise system in Lordstown trucks.\n\n4) The Price, in your video you said you think rivan and Lordstown are kind of competing, I think this is a bit of a mistake, first rivan is a consumer-first company where Lordstown is mostly in the commercial space (right now) and Rivan vehicles will cost much more than Lordstown. I grew up and still do live in the city of Detroit and follow the automotive sector. I know a lot about rivian being that they have an office here in Plymouth Michigan. Their cars and trucks have a more premium price and the Lordstown truck is only going to cost about 50k which is pretty good considering normal gas truck prices. The rivan will be more in the 70k range.\n\n5) This is an obvious Biden play Made in the US in the midwest (Ohio) a state that democrats barely lost, this would be a great PR political move to hype this company up just to get more Democratic support in the state and the midwest all together\n\nFinally\n\n6) partnership with RV world, they recently partnered with RV world to act as a place to service their vehicles, as we know when Tesla first came out and still to this day have issues servicing the cars. This partnership means that the day the first endurance truck rolls off the line there will be hundreds of locations around the US where technicians are already trained to work and fix these trucks, not to mention that both CEOs mentioned in their joint press conference that there is a goal to electrify 5th wheel trailers to help increase EV trucks long road trip range and build EV RVs.\n\nThanks for reading my ted talk I typed this on my phone so fuck you if there are any typos I'm not fixing that shit.\n\n$RIDE TO THE MOON THEN MARS THEN PLUTO", "id": "m4vmzg", "created_utc": 1615730769.0, "score": 245, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 212, "comments": [{"body": "Been long RIDE since day 3 of its SPAC.

After their report, I think the understanding here is more apparent to investors. Further, I think as people look deeper into this and pursue them for answers they will not be satisfied making the company fall even further. So I a more confident now in these puts then I would have been, buying earlier (would have been really nice though).\n3. Lordstown Motors has a market cap of about $2.5B, whereas I think they have about $300M in assets. Assuming for the chance they are on to something a few hundred million gets added to their value, a market cap of $500M - $1B seems a distinct possibility. That would be a stock price of between $3.75 - $7.5. Given the high IV on the puts, bought the $5 ones which I think are quiet risky. I think the $10 ones have a decent chance of paying out (but they are pricey).\n\nBasically, my original plan was to wait for the price to go up to some crazy number on idiotic euphoria and then go heavy in on puts.

Maybe for a motorcycle or other light vehicle this can work, but I am at that point where the challenges it creates are far more of a pain then the little extra weight of having an axle.\n\nSometimes unique ideas can be used to appeal to investors who really don't make the effort to think it through. I have a similar issue with GOEV and the steer by wire. My understanding is, most places make it illegal for a vehicle to not have a direct linkage, meaning those investing in GOEV are essentially banking on a start-up getting jurisdictions to change what is considered a safety law. And GOEV/Canoo makes no mention of this issue or challenge.\n\nWhen you step away from the grand visions these companies put out and consider the issues critically you have to wonder if these are people simply jumping on the EV bandwagon as an easy way to make money with any wild idea, regardless of whether they can actually produce on it.\n\nBy contrast, I think Rivian and Lucid are much more serious companies. Not saying whether they will be successful or not here (they have plenty of challenges, such as being able to scale up production, keep costs down, remain competitive in the luxury segment, generate positive cash-flow, and so on...), but at least they are not saying they are doing things that don't really make sense. I get it, if the things that don't make sense work out, you might have a real winner on your hand, but usually the things that don't make sense, don't make sense.

Electric trucks are the future due to their superior torque capability and flexibility of chassis. The only thing holding EVs back is the charging infrastructure and battery technology. \n\n**\"There are many videos of working prototypes not rolling downhill... The Endurance truck is entered into a 250-mile rally in April and will be competing.** \n\nFor a company with the size and funding of Lordstown, making a single functioning electric truck prototype is not that difficult at all. (ie: Tesla Roadster concept got announced in 2017 and was supposed to come out this year, there's been zero news on that car since) and the fact that Lordstown is entering into a race should not convince you that they have the capability to make a production truck. \n\n**\"No, they aren't they are not binding pre-orders that is true but name one EV company with binding pre-orders even teslas cyber tuck can be \"pre-ordered\" \"**\n\nThe orders are fake, read the Hindenburg report. Hell, read fucking Jalopnik if you want a TLDR. Thousands of orders were made by shell companies with fake addresses and questionable origins. \n\nAlso, there are plenty of EV companies that have binding preorders with companies, namely their main competitor: Rivian\n\n**\"All pre-orders are for commercial use\"**\n\nAs stated earlier, the orders are bullshit. \n\n **\"GM who has the cruise Autonomous driving system is a pretty big investor in Lordstown\"**\n\nGM has largely been doing their own thing with EVs after their whole relationship with Nikola trucks fell through. GM has been doing alot in the EV sector (just look at their 2021 CES presentation) but I don't think Lordstown is going to be a key player in this shift to EVs as they weren't even mentioned at CES. In fact, GM has their own electric truck coming with the GMC Hummer, so I wouldn't count on this GM relationship taking $RIDE to the moon seeing as how other EV companies have bigger investments from other companies. (IE Rivian has about $1 billion total from Amazon and Ford alone) \n\nAlso, in the context of this scenario, autonomous driving doesnt mean shit. \n\n**\"They own and will produce in the Lordstown plant previously owned by GM which already has a 500k car per year capacity\"**\n\nThis is one of, if not the only point that Lordstown has any credibility for, and frankly I think it's bullshit. There is still millions of dollars that has to go into retooling the factories, retraining the employees, and working out the production issues. I think this saves them alot of money in the short term, but doesn't matter in the long term if you expect Lordstown to be a real competitor. \n\n**\"Lordstown truck is only going to cost about 50k. The rivan will be more in the 70k range\"**\n\nhahahahahhahahahaha... It's funny that you think Lordstown can keep this promise. Electric trucks are new, the first generation of electric trucks is going to be expensive. Rivian knows this, GM knows this, which is why the Rivian is priced at $70k and the GMC Hummer is expected to start at around $90k. Not to mention that these companies are much closer to production than Lordstown. \n\nJust look at the Tesla model 3, that was supposed to be a $35k electric car, but if you want to buy one today youre probably paying in the mid 40s to mid 50s. If Lordstown gets to the same point as Rivian or GM, I guarantee you they're gonna be raising the price. \n\n**\"This is an obvious Biden play Made in the US in the midwest (Ohio) a state that democrats barely lost, this would be a great PR political move to hype this company up just to get more Democratic support in the state and the midwest all together\"**\n\nThis is actually the dumbest shit I've ever heard. \n\nAnd that about wraps it up, Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.\n\n**TLDR: I don't think Lordstown is a good buy.**", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

[This article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk/index.html) doesn't have sources, but it points out how global GME went. There's many more articles like it, for plenty of countries. Europe, India, Asia are several places I saw people trying to get in on the action. \"China’s approximately 200 million retail investors trade more often than any other investors on Earth—81 percent said they trade at least once a month\" [From this article](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/09/three-charts-explaining-chinas-strange-stock-market.html)\n\n*Let me remind you that a stock like GME as of today has estimated between 27m-40m shares in the float, and a market cap of 18.4B at today's price.* **Retail has no control my ass**. Lets take a look at this:\n\nA graph of apple users versus apple price from robinhood's API in 2020, going up to 8/6/2020. They stopped offering this information via API at this date.  We can ignore apple price here, we're looking just at ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: Robintrack.net](https://preview.redd.it/1xji566rn1n61.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=202fbbb95234ba5a1a6ae13453c992879805b25e)\n\nThe above shows on 8/6, 730k RH users owned Apple. That's 5.6% of users at the time using their 13m users number, which the total user number I would speculate is a bit lower at that time, as they grew from 10 to 13m users in 2020. RH stopped their API showing this info, so 8/6 is the most recent you can get on any company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGME was the most popular stock on RH, so I find it reasonable to believe at least 5% owned it, most likely WAY WAY more considering the global exposure this got. Once again, RH average account size is $5k. Please do the math here of how Jan may have looked. **This is ONLY on Robinhood**. Of course this is speculation here, but I feel that it's pretty reasonable. It's speculation based on prior data. & if users really are 23m, that's even crazier. Here's math below about what GME could have looked like. This is based on 13m users. Then, **add all of the other brokers**. This chart is only robinhood. You get the idea. Realistically, *other* brokers ownership percentage probably isn't *as* high, but it's still going to be way up there, especially during the GME phenomenon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|If average # of shares per person is|% of RH users that owned the most popular stock|Total shares owned on RH|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|5|730k shares|\n|1|10|1.46m shares|\n|5|5|3.65m shares|\n|5|10|7.3m shares|\n|10|5|7.3m shares|\n|10|10|14.6m shares|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, moving back to the more broad discussion and no longer focusing on GME.\n\n\"The **total market capitalization** of the **U.S. stock market** is $50,808,508.7 million(over complicated way of saying $50.8T (12/31/2020)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/www.nasdaq.com\\/articles\\/who-counts-as-a-retail-investor-2020-12-17](https://preview.redd.it/ludljsdtn1n61.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cd3e4113641f443d002de2dde95913532440a47)\n\nIt appears our estimates line up pretty closely with other data. *Notice how mutual funds are SEPERATE here.*\n\nSo why does retail \"not control the market\" ?\n\nPersonally, I disagree with this statement. Retail does control the market. **Then why is there a narrative that retail doesn't control the market?** Two main reasons in my opinion. Yes, this is speculation based on data. Form your own conclusions. Here's insight into mine.\n\n1. Retail isn't coordinated. Even though we collectively own over 1/3 of the market, we can't coordinate things like the elite can. We can't dump 1 million shares all at the exact same time to tank a stock price. We can't control the media narrative because we don't own/aren't in bed with the media, so we lose some influence here. Retail doesn't control the day to day action on a stock, but retail controls it from a broader sense. *One raindrop cannot cause a flood, but continuous raindrops over an extended period of time do*.\n2. Information **IS** becoming a commodity, there's just so much shit and misinformation to sift through right now, it's difficult for most people. Retail gains more and more control every day through decentralization and increased freedom of information on the internet. *They ARE terrified of retail*. The potential for \"power\" to shift back to the people out of the elites hands is higher than ever with the advancements of tech. I could write a whole paper on this concept. I believe decentralization is the future for everything. Information, politics, money, stocks, etc. It is imperative for the elite to keep this knowledge away from the people. Knowledge is power. Poverty and education are linked significantly. Keeping people in the dark and unaware of their capabilities is an extremely powerful tool that has been used to suppress people since civilization began.\n\nI know above points might sound a little bit over the top, but these are my opinions based on data. I'd be happy to engage in talks around any of these points. There may be data that is just plain wrong, or that I misinterpreted. Please poke holes in anything.\n\nEdit: /u/alice_oe made this data point “I use the European broker eToro, they have 20 million users and their app currently shows that 9.49% of them holds GME.
