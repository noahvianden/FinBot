The basic reason is that your gains are capped and your losses are not.    Assuming options are fairly priced you will not come out ahead over the long-term.   This is mathematically provable.\n\nI know some people will disagree but all of the successful strategy for selling covered calls over the long-term requires a certain level of  \"management\" of the strategy, e.g. it is not strictly mechanical and those subjective decisions are the only reason it would have better returns than just B&H\n\nSo, for instance, if you decide not to sell a covered call one week because you believe the stock is about to rise and you are right then you avoid a call being exercised.    But the only reason that worked is because you made a market prediction that was right - you could have just as easily done something else to profit from that prediction without involving covered calls, meaning if you are good at predicting market moves you should do better than the average market return regardless of what strategy you use.\n\nIf you leave out the subjective stuff, selling covered calls is not going to give better results than just buy and hold.\n\nThat being said, I do dabble in myself with my long term holdings when I \"feel\" like a stock has had a good run up and I don't see it going up further.   Again I want to stress that is because I am making a prediction, if the stock continues to rise and it gets called away then I gave up some profit.\n\nIt certainly is fun to sell a covered call and then watch all the time value decay and it expire OTM", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting.

It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab\n\n**What is it?**\n\nLenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered® anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID – patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).\n\n**How does it work?**\n\nGM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don’t matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here’s a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What’s also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn’t target the virus – it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\\\#variantagnostic)\n\nFrom the article: “GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.”…  “Our findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds”\n\nHere’s another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)\n\nFrom the article: \"Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‐CSF might be a key feature of SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytokine storm in COVID‐19 patients\"\n\n**Does it work?**\n\nWe will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I’ve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more\n\n1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \\--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)\n2. An interim analysis of HGEN’s Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results – with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).\n3. Otilimab – a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF – recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab’s chance of success\n4. Here’s a recent bullish letter to the editor from \\[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\\]:  “Aware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement”\n5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)\n\nFunded and selected by the NIH – this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab’s efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial\n\n**Competition**\n\n\\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It’s all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted\n\n**COVID – getting worse**\n\nAs many of you might’ve heard, COVID isn’t going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it’s new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.\n\nHow deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it’s looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here’s a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6x\n\nGoogle cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here’s an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab\n\n**Partnerships**\n\n1.

Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \\[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\\]\n\n**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**\n\n**The Market**\n\nHere’s a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:\n\n1. Stockpiling – US and ex-US\n2. US market\n3. Outside the US market\n\nUS market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking\n\nOutside the US market:\n\n1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe\n2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))\n\n**Price forecasting:**\n\nConservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn’t include any non-US sales or stockpiling.\n\nWith positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN’s market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.\n\n**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST**\n\n$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock’s low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships\n\n**BONUS BONUS – CAR-T implications and more**\n\nLenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don’t have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID\n\n**Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don’t want to downplay this, I think it’s very promising and I’m very bullish on it, but I’m admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There’s 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well. \n\nLenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.\n\n$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1\n\n**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**\n\nImo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.\n\nPOSITION: 1250 @ $16.30", "id": "mdfswd", "created_utc": 1616729630.0, "score": 160, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 163, "comments": [{"body": "Holy fuck someone actually talking about hgen.

First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                \n \nNext is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about \"other \" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  \n\nNext is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           \n\nNext is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           \n\nNext is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. \n\nNext is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. \n\nNow I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               \n \nNext is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. \n\nLastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask.

Market never priced in any tax hike/new regulations. This P/E ratio is justified with the current tax rate and deregulations from Trump administration. If reversed the drop could be very big, VT is certainly much better than vti. Also international stock market returns had not been great which means they will likely push out economic growth/tax cut  policies which could favor their local stock market a lot more than the past decade. That will boost their stock market and keep a lot more companies to IPO on their home country rather than going to the US stock market.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the explanation!", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "And exactly which foreign markets are going to outperform the US? Regulations are tighter in the EU, China’s markets are suffering right now and Biden’s admin is launching reinvestments aimed at growing US innovation. China’s consumer class is nowhere near as broad or powerful as American consumers in most segments, and their country isn’t exactly friendly to foreign direct investment.\n\nIndia? Brazil?\n\nThere’s a reason why VTI outperforms VT. So long as the US maintains a healthy immigration pipeline, its very reasonable to assume that we continue to defer mature economy status and maintain a growth economy. I’ve now worked for three transnational consumer goods manufacturers, and sales in the US dwarf overseas sales.\n\nI think the US economy will absorb changes, rebalance on stability, and continue to grow. The market has absolutely priced in tax hikes and new regulations. Biden was on the campaign trail in mid 2020 telling dinner-plate fundraisers that he was going to raise their taxes.\n\nVT isn’t “certainly much better” than VTI, and it’s pure speculation to assume it is. VTI is up over 70% in the last year, VT around 50. VT has never long-term outperformed it. Over the last 3 months, VTI is up about 7%. VT is at under 5.5%.\n\nYour entire post is pure speculation but you submit it very confidently. VT is great to have in a portfolio as a minority holding, and it’s possible that emerging markets pick up steam over the coming decades, but there’s no evidence that they outperform the US.

Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                \n \nNext is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about \"other \" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  \n\nNext is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           \n\nNext is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           \n\nNext is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. \n\nNext is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. \n\nNow I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               \n \nNext is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. \n\nLastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask.

However, demand returned much faster than they expected, so they put in those semiconductor orders again - only to find themselves put at the back of a long queue.

Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                \n \nNext is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about \"other \" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  \n\nNext is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           \n\nNext is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           \n\nNext is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. \n\nNext is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. \n\nNow I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               \n \nNext is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. \n\nLastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask.

The term refers to an energy storage device that can also bear weight as part of a structure—like if the studs in your home were all batteries, or if an electric fence also held up a wall.\n\n>In the new paper, researchers from Chalmers University of Technology and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden reveal how their “massless” structural battery works.\n\n>The main use case is for electric cars, where a literally massive amount of batteries take up a ton of room and don’t contribute to the actual structure of the car. In fact, these cars must be specially designed to carry the mass of the batteries. But what if the frame of the car could hold energy? “Due to their multifunctionality, structural battery composites are often referred to as ‘massless energy storage’ and have the potential to revolutionize the future design of electric vehicles and devices,” the researchers explain.\n\n>To make the new structural battery, the scientists layered a buffer glass “fabric” between a positive and negative electrode, then packed it with a space-age polymer electrolyte and cured it in the oven. What results is a tough, flat battery cell that conducts well and holds up to tensile tests in all directions.\n\n>The battery’s combined qualities (or “multifunctionality”) make it 10 times better than any previous massless battery—a project scientists have worked on since 2007.\n\n**Their takeaway:**\n\n“The battery **has an energy density of 24 Wh/kg**, meaning approximately 20 percent capacity compared to comparable lithium-ion batteries currently available. But since the weight of the vehicles can be greatly reduced, less energy will be required to drive an electric car, for example, and lower energy density also results in increased safety. And with a stiffness of 25 GPa, the structural battery can really compete with many other commonly used construction materials.”\n\n\n\n\nBWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">**24 Wh/kg**, meaning approximately 20 percent capacity\n\nWait, isn't that more like ~~10%~~ 8% capacity\n\nI recall Tesla will be at 400 Wh/kg in 3 or 4 years", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "*cutting edge research*\n\n\nTesla laughs from the shadows", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, it's true...  but being cutting edge and commercially useful are orthogonal traits.\n\nYou could develop cutting edge methods for chipping obsidian into arrowheads, after all.

{"title": "OG's don't hate $GME, just a chunk of the people trading it: Stop being cultish it's cringey and annoying -- let's clear some shit up and dispel some $GME myths", "selftext": "**TLDR: You don't know you're in a cult until you know you're in a cult.** Let the downvotes flow, I really am not doing this for karma. I'm doing this so some of you change your behavior and because the sub matters to me.\n\nDisclaimer: I have puts on $GME, sold my $80s and $100s on the rip down yesterday, and twice had shares/calls, and will perhaps have shares and calls again if it ever goes back down a long ways because I'm here to make money.\n\n**My background:** Been trading this sub's ideas since 2016 silently, my prop firm friends turned me onto this place (they do listen/watch this sub). I used to post DD for the week from my personal notebook each week back in 2019, I had thousands of people waiting each Sunday for those DD posts. Someone contacted my wife/tried to doxx me on the street, it freaked me out, I deleted the old account (SoRefreshing). I'm not a shill, or a bear, or any of that shit. I work for myself and trade at home now. I'll start my DD up again when the GME shit dies down, I can't do the posts because: I would instantly get labeled a shill or distraction or a hedgie or some stupid other fucking shit which is the reason for this post.\n\n**In short:** The people here that have been around pre-GME or especially pre 2019 probably share the same sentiment that they're sick of $GME. It's not because of the quality/length of time this has been a phenomenon here, or even the trade itself, we love when stocks do what it is doing because many of us play both sides and make money in both directions, but we hate it **because of the absolutely cultish and ridiculous behavior of some of the people trading it.**\n\nPersonally, I think it should be an instantly temp-bannable offense to do some of the shit in this thread so that we can start cleaning up the ridiculous cultish behavior but whatever, you apes do you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Right Reasons To Be In $GME:\n\n1. **You like the turnaround story, and are willing to hold years to see it come to fruition.** This would be considered an investment, something almost nobody around here has experience with.\n2. **You are simply gambling to gamble, and like the stock.** Sure, buy it up, you're going to have some juicy loss porn if you never sell (and if you're retarded enough to not sell at $500+ and again at $300+ honestly you deserve it)\n3. **You like to not be left out.** I get it, everybody is buying it, so you bought some. Whatever, we've all done it. This is a stupid reason but exponentially better than the shit the new normies spread around the daily Financial Jonestown thread (stolen from another WSBer, credit for the person that claims it idk who it was)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Wrong Reasons To Be in GME:\n\n1. **You think a squeeze is coming to $10,000.** It isn't. People should literally get instabanned for saying this shit because there are people stupid enough to believe it. Granted, that's their bad for being so stupid, but this won't happen (I expand on that below) mostly because the system CANNOT let it happen. You're playing a rigged game, get over it.\n2. **You think you're bankrupting hedge funds.** You're not. They'll get a bailout if you do, or another one of their buddies will step in and cannibalize them. Stop being silly.\n3. **You have any personal vendetta or motive.** It's stupid to trade on emotions. Do it if you want, keep telling people you're holding but stop attacking people that sell or have a contrarian idea. Believe it or not: **Not selling at $300+ or $250 and having it crash back down to $40 with the heavy ass bags you have isn't badass, it's ridiculous. We're here to make money.** Even if you believe the turnaround -- it's stupid. I love some of my holdings but if they gain a pile in a short time, I take some profit off the table because I want to be a boyfriend and not a cuck some day.\n4. **If you think every drop is a \"short ladder\" or \"short attack\".** Some people just sell their shares. Some people need the money and they shouldn't be investing in $GME if so but, that's life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRanting and explanations of some of the points:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **There's no massive squeeze coming, ever. The best you can hope for is to crush individual shorts into adding volume when they buy back,** but the hedge funds aren't the ones you're beating up on. Citadel will win the war in the end because they can stay liquid longer than all of the holdings in $GME combined. **More importantly, if they're still in, they're hedged, you can guarantee it. Gabe almost got the fund torched,** but he got a bailout from his buddies. Listen, they won't let it happen, it WILL NOT HAPPEN. If you are playing this for a squeeze, then you are in it for the WRONG REASONS. If the first run up to $500+ didn't get shorts out, then they re-shorted at $500 and covered lower. You can be guaranteed shorts that didn't are operational shorts (to hedge put contracts, hedge fund, **hedge**) and play into the price almost not at all. In the impending run up to $300+ recently, the shorts likely cycled again, people covering, and re-shorting. This will lead to compoundingly low highs as people are more likely to cover to not get caught under a squeeze. Each time it happens, it will gain less momentum, what you're seeing is weeks of consolidation into a price range driven by algos and the apes here with money. **$100,000 or even $1,500 a share** from a squeeze is a **COMPLETE meme.** If it hits those price levels, it's for sure massive whales playing games against each other, not because you're bankrupting hedge funds. To double from $500 to $1,000 takes another DOUBLE of the market cap. Today, at around $185 the cap sits at $13B give or take. To double to $370 would require $13B of inflows. Each time it goes up, it exponentially gets harder for retail to have impact on the price but also for it to continue going up. Institutions - because of their fiduciary responsibility - aren't buying this to put in client portfolios. More importantly, the higher it goes up, the more likely a fund has to rebalance the fund's holdings (IE: liquidate literally millions of shares) since one stock would then provide too much risk and they have a responsibility to take profits. The entire system is designed to work against squeezes like the VW one (which is awesome to talk about, but a completely different time, and different situation than we face now.) It's just not happening.\n2. **The second time it ran from $40 up to $100+ was not retail volume.** This easily could have been a massive short from $500+ closing it out and riding up call contracts during their closeout. It could have just been a complete bait. There's a reason it floated around back at $40 when the algos turned off. Some days when you watch the price action the volume is dead, the price isn't jumping up and down rapidly, this is a sign there's less machines trading it. HFT firms likely jumped back on board when it got super volatile because that's when they make the most money, by scalping the spread. You could literally just be at the mercy of machines fighting each other right now, this could be some retail volume but the slow bleed from $330 to $180 then the crash after earnings leads me to believe it's far less retail and more algos playing the momentum. Sure, some of you are buying shares, but I think you are really over-estimating the amount of shares people have and the impact we have on this.\n3. **There is no fucking movement.** This is the biggest one I think. You aren't in this together with anyone and you should stop with the \"hold HOLD!\" shit to other people. You're in this alone, either you're in it to make money, or you're in it for the wrong reasons. You're not putting a real dent into hedge funds, stop being fucking ignorant if you aren't doing it just for the dank memes. I know a guy that killed himself over money in the market, someone telling him to \"HOLD\" on a play, and he lost it all. Tell people you're holding, tell people you think it's stupid to sell, but knock off the shit with massively downvoting people that sell or telling people that sold to fuck off, etc. This is what annoys people from this sub that built the culture the most. Chances are 80% of the people playing this are doing so with money they can't afford to lose - if they choose to share their loss porn then they deserve the needle and should be prepared to accept it, if not, then you're in this ALONE.\n4. **There's no fucking shills.** Not everyone that is contrarian to your confirmation bias is a shill. CNBC isn't in cahoots to spread FUD, there is a lot of veterans on Wall Street that have seen exactly what is going on before, multiple times. Just because they say the valuation is ridiculous doesn't mean they're missing anything. Real statistics showing 20% short interest instead of 100%+ aren't shills, they're just telling you the truth. It already squeezed. We just know this is a fucking pump and dump of gigantic proportions. It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but this mother fucker is coming piling back down (for a second time) and some of you are going to hold some very, very heavy bags. There's no way around it.\n5. **You guys are just playing a big game of chicken with each other.** If you're willing to do that, fine, but this is just a $13B pump and dump. Some unnamed institution may be buying up shares to push the price up, especially today, since they have a vested interest in the at the market offering sale in order to raise capital for GameStop and generate revenue for themselves. I won't name the name because you can go hunt it down if you want to know.\n6. **The turnaround is priced in.** Believe it or not, when a company goes from a <$1B market cap to $13B if it holds these price levels, the turnaround is completely priced in an you could buy leap puts and it's printing money, who knows what amount, but it's printing money. Also: turnarounds like the one Cohen is executing take YEARS, not weeks, not months. You won't see appreciable movement in the numbers (which matter, whether you believe it or not) for years. Plus they're massively restructuring, and the chance GameStop still fails is a lot higher than people here give credit to. They need to drastically shift their business, and I believe they will, but it's not even 50/50. It's probably 70/30 that the business still fails completely, regardless how long you HODL your stock.\n\nYeah that's all I have. I'm just tired of the cultish shit coming from $GME people. A lot of us who say that shit or tease you in the $GME daily thread are just doing so because we hate the way this sub is transforming into some ridiculous GME sized version of the \"LET ME INNN\" meme.\n\nAt some point, it's just too much. I know others have hit their point, and I hit mine, so I made this post. Stop giving advice or doing DD posts if you have no fucking clue because you're not doing yourself a favor just by getting upvotes for confirmation bias. I just saw a guy point at declining volume on a DD post as proof that people are shorting downticks. Like what, the, fuck.\n\nJust because you've been here a couple months and lost/made 100k doesn't make you a market expert.

If we focus on the initial shut down and look for effects on the market at that point we might get a good hint of what could happen if this drags on for a while.\n\nEdit: I'm going to add to this comment as I read up on it.\n\nSomething to note is that due to the 67-75 closure the nature of oil shipping was changed so while we might see some impact on oil prices it probably won't be very dramatic\n\n> A report by investment management company Winton detailed how this closure, coming on top of the 1950s closure, forever changed oil trading patterns. If tankers couldn’t transit the Suez Canal, they could be bigger and take advantage of economies of scale. So, by the time the canal reopened in 1975, “the majority of oil tankers were simply too large to fit,” noted Winton. “The Suez Canal’s former status as the preeminent thoroughfare for crude was never regained.”\n\n> Very large crude carriers (VLCCs), tankers that carry 2 million barrels of oil, cannot transit the canal fully laden. The water is too shallow. Consequently, VLCCs bring Middle East crude to Ain Sokhna, at the northeast end of the Red Sea. There, cargoes are unloaded and put into the SUMED pipeline for transport or into storage tanks. Crude is then unloaded (or placed in storage) at Sidi Kerir, the discharge port for the SUMED pipeline on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nfrom https://www.freightwaves.com/news/what-the-suez-canal-accident-means-to-the-tanker-business\n\nThere's also a bit in that article about how Aristotle Onassis made bank on an earlier crisis in the 50s when he had a bunch of tankers without routes which he was able to throw into action when the canal was shut down for 6 months.\n\nHere's a table that shows trade weighted increase in distance caused by the Suez Closure in 67\nhttps://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/image/feyrer%20tbl%201.JPG\n\nfrom this article https://voxeu.org/article/1967-75-suez-canal-closure-lessons-trade\n\nwhich talks about a reduction in trade caused by the closure.\n\nI posted this in a reply to another comment about a more recent closure in 2004\n\n> That one only lasted 3 days, Nov 6 to Nov 9. I think they were able to unstick it because it was carrying oil which they could pump off the ship to lighten the load and cause the ship to float higher in the water\n\n> \"the Tropic Brilliance was finally refloated after around 25,000 tonnes of oil, more than a quarter of its cargo, was pumped out.\"\n\n> https://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-11-09/suez-canal-opens-after-tanker-freed/582532\n\n> The Ever Given is a contain ship, you can't unload containers without big ass cranes. We should be looking at a timeline of longer than a few days for sure. They do have one of those vacuum dredging ships there trying to dig it out but some images I've seen show that the bow of the ship is probably pretty deeply buried in the bank.\n\nI'm thinking we should be looking at countries that will be either negatively affected by the longer shipping times or positively affected by the new shipping route around Africa.\n\nWe should also keep in mind that this means longer transit time for other types of ocean going vessels such as those in the US Navy. The Eisenhower CSG is in the Mediterranean at the moment and Makin Island ARG is in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nhttps://news.usni.org/category/fleet-tracker\n\nApparently the Suez can handle larger container ships than the Panama canal. So according to [this](https://www.winton.com/longer-view/the-six-day-wars-impact-on-trade) article, even though it takes 2 days less to go from Shanghai to New York via Panama, the larger ships have no choice but to use Suez. \n\nLooking at this article, it seems like shipments from Asia to Northern Europe would be most affected by this https://geopoliticalfutures.com/top-container-ship-trade-routes/", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Thinking this will slow down transit of Semiconductors and worsen the shortage?

It's not just the impact to supply and delays to get oil to refineries, it is also an increase in consumption of diesel and fuel oil by those ships routing around Africa. \n\nA trip from Shanghai to the UK via the Suez is about 11800 miles, the same trip going around the entire continent of Africa is almost 17,000 miles. That extra mileage adds about 11 days and a shit ton of fuel. The newer and most fuel efficient  Suezmax ships burn 60 tons of fuel per day at slow steaming. Older ships coupled with the need to steam faster will likely burn closer to 110 tons of fuel per day.  The cost of shipping will obviously go up dramatically due to the cost of fuel, staffing and time. But the cost of fuel itself will also likely go up. Figure Diesel is roughly 750 barrels per ton.

{"title": "I’ve lost everything because of the Suez Canal fiasco on the Egyptian/ European Easter bunny future run up", "selftext": "I spent $50,000 on surefire Egyptian bunny rabbit futures. This was money that was supposed to be saved for buying a new house and was mainly accrued from dumping pay checks into SPY over the years. \n\nOn the 27th of February , I got tipped off from a buddy that works in the bunny breeding industry. He said that due to the pandemic, Europeans were buying pets like crazy, and one animal in particular... bunny rabbits. \n\nNow this made me look into Egyptian bunny futures as they produce the most bunnies in the world. The premiums were amazing, this was like buying fucking apple at IPO. On top of all of this, Easter was just a couple months around the corner and a massive shipment of bunnies was meant to leave Egypt and make its way to a port in France. I’m talking a fucking boat load of carrot munching, sex hungry, “what’s up doc” mother fuckers, not just a container. \n\nSo I placed my bet, expiring the week of Easter, for when the shipment would come. Since there were barely any bunnies in France/ all of Europe, there was no supply to meet demand. However, I had it on good authority that prices would barely drop since so many Europeans wanted the little fluffy fucks. \n\nAll was going well, my money was going up and it was the most euphoric feeling ever...\n\nUntil on Wednesday at 10am, I wake up to check how many unrealized tendies I have. To my horror I was down 48%. I frantically called my aforementioned buddy in the industry and he tells me to look up the Suez canal. \n\nIt turns out the shipment was delayed by a day out of Egypt and right after they left port, some big fucking ship decided to block the whole canal. Since Egypt shipped out essentially every last bunny in the damn country, they didn’t need any more bunny food. So every single one of them is going to run out of food over the next week and die on that ship (no point in bringing them back to port cause there’s no food to feed them). Once they arrive in France they will dump the dead bunnies, pick up the next shipment and move on. \n\nIdk how I’m going to tell my wife this, probably gonna need some protection from her boyfriend for a while too. \n\nWish me luck", "id": "mdpi46", "created_utc": 1616767847.0, "score": 20426, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 1544, "comments": [{"body": "I looked it up.

{"title": "$ROOT - Massive Value and Squeeze Potential? - Here is my Rookie DD", "selftext": "**TLDR:** Root is a Car Insurtech Company. Compared to its peers it has deep value in my opinion. It's also the stock with the highest short interest % right now. It has MASSIVE squeeze potential and the momentum has just picked up for the squeeze to get squozen. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀\n\n# What's $ROOT?\n\nRoot, Inc. describes itself as \"a technology company revolutionizing personal insurance with a pricing model based upon fairness and a modern customer experience.\n\nWhether it's relying on credit scores, education history, or occupation, the variables used in pricing auto insurance today unfairly impact those who can least afford insurance. Root is tackling these issues using disruptive technology.\n\n# What Technology?\n\n* Root believes that it can be disruptive in the auto insurance industry through building its own technological full stack. In telematics, this differentiates Root from most U.S. insurers who partner with third-party providers like CMT and TrueMotion. Root claims its approach gives it unique access to the full set of data, instead of the meta data available through partners, and in turn enables models with superior predictive power.\n* Root has been very vocal about its #Dropthescore campaign. If a state bans a specific rating factor (like credit score), the insurance companies will look to alternative data sources to increase granularity / provide competitive quotes for their consumers. There are over 100 different insurance carriers in the West that write auto insurance, many of which are significantly smaller than the big boys.  In order to stay competitive, Root can serve as a necessary SaaS for the smaller insurance carriers to stay relevant / competitive.\n* Root launched its proprietary loss cost model (or pricing algorithm), UBI 3.0+, which has provided considerable loss ratio improvements. Version 4.0 is expected to be commercialized later in 2021.\n* Root believes it can use its proprietary data and machine learning to end the reliance on credit scores, education history, or occupation to determine insurance premiums.\n* Root has a mobile-first strategy where more than 75% of customers are acquired through the mobile app. The app can also be used to manage the policy and claims. This separates it from larger players in the space who still rely on a network of agents to handle most of customer acquisitions and claims.\n* Root offers discounts for Tesla Autosteer mode making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a semi autonomous vehicle. \\[[Source](https://www.newswire.com/news/root-insurance-becomes-the-first-insurance-company-to-offer-discounts-5940408)\\]\n\n# Where is the Value?\n\n**Comparison with Similar Insurtech Companies**\n\n|*Metric*|*Root*|*MetroMile*|*Lemonade*|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020 DEP ($mm)|605.2|100.2|158.7|\n|Revenue ($mm)|346.8|\\*|94.4|\n|Cash on Hand ($mm)|1100|?|571.4|\n|2021 DEP Guidance Midpoint ($mm)|700|140.6|272.5|\n|Market Cap ($Billions)|3.2|1.6|5.6|\n\n\\*2019 Revenue of $52.8m with DEP (Direct Earned Premium) of $102.2m\n\nSome numbers from MetroMile were hard to find because they decided to go the SPAC route recently. It's easy to see the discrepancy in valuation between Root and the rest of the Insurtech Companies. *Root is valued at \\~$3 Billion with $1.1Billion cash on hand.*\n\n**More Data Points**\n\nI also wanted to include Hippo Home insurance but could not find detailed financial information about the company. Hippo Home Insurance is also going public through the SPAC route in a transaction which represents an Enterprise Value of $5.0 Billion for Hippo \\[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210304005356/en/Hippo-to-Go-Public-in-Merger-with-Reinvent-Technology-Partners-Z-Company-is-Transforming-the-Home-Insurance-Industry)\\]. This would represent a market cap of up to $6.2 Billion for Hippo.\n\nIn September 2019, Root Raised $350 million in Series E funding which implied a valuation of $3.65 billion \\[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190909005247/en/Root-Insurance-Raises-350-Million-in-Series-E-Funding-Led-by-Coatue-and-DST-Global)\\]. A year later, $ROOT began trading on NASDAQ on Oct 28, 2020 at $27 a share ($6.7b valuation). It currently sits at a $3 billion valuation. Did Root improve its technology stack, brand awareness, presence in more states, and financial standing enough in 2020 to be in a better position than where it was in Sept 2019? In my opinion, it did.\n\n# Massive Squeeze Potential?\n\nRoot is the company (over $1b valuation) with the highest short interest % right now. As of 02/26/2021 43.7% of the public float was shorted \\[[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)\\]. More recent data shows that the short interest has risen to 76.6% of float \\[[Source](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1370422261774233601?s=20)\\]. Recent short interest data indicates that root is leading other companies by a big margin \\[[Source](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1369999038326706177?s=20)\\].\n\nDue to its recent IPO, insider trading for Root is restricted until the lock up period ends on April 26th, 2021. Due to this restriction, the public float for Root is 25 million shares. At $13 per share, this represents a public float of \\~ $325 million available for trading compared to a market cap of $3 billion. For comparison the headphone company has a public float of $68 million even though its market cap is only $212 million.\n\nThe momentum has started to reverse but not enough for a squeeze. But for a company of this size, because the actual public float is small, there is not much fuel needed for this to rocket. Low liquidity and high short interest could fuel a massive rocket.\n\n# The Bear Case 🌈\n\n* If you are considering this as a squeeze play, it's important to know that the IPO lockup period expires on April 26,2021 \\[[Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/ipos/lockup-expirations/)\\].

I'm here to help guide you back to the light and hopefully get you to buy back your shares before we close today.\n\nI want to start off by saying a lot of people have been freaking out over the past few weeks because Tesla's market cap is higher than other car manufacturers COMBINED. A lot of people think Tesla is overvalued, but I want to dispel this anti-Tesla heresy by making an analogy:\n\n**Tesla is making the iPod and other manufacturers are still making the SONY Walkman.** \n\nIt is true that as far as a \"cars made\" Tesla has produced fewer \"cars,\" but the product Tesla is making is superior. These types of arguments are illusory because they don't compare apples to apples - they're just trying to put an idea in your head.\n\nInstead of selling your shares - you should be buying more right now. I am not a Tesla cultist in anyway. I'm just point out that the people who are taking a dump on Tesla are intentionally misrepresenting arguments in order to persuade you into agreeing with them. A lot of big money sold Tesla before this move down and I guarantee you they're short the company. They want you to sell and then cover only to buy when it dips into the 500s again.\n\n**How to exit a stock without letting your emotions guide you:**\n\nIn all honesty the best piece of advice I can give is to have a check list when you sell any stock. I know a lot of you are like, WhAt'S aN ExiT StrAtEGy? I know a lot of you hate charts so I won't even try to talk about a moving average. But what I will say is this:\n\n1. Ask yourself if you still like the stock.  If it's yes then go to 2. if no, then sell. I don't care why you like a stock, just have an honest conversation with yourself.\n2. Ask yourself: Do I need to liquidate these shares because of an emergency? If yes, then liquidate. If no, then hold. \n3. Has GME gone under $100? If yes, then sell all TSLA shares and buy GME. This is obvious, but I thought it needed to be mentioned. I'm joking of course. You should never sell GME shares.\n\n**Closing thoughts:**\n\nGood luck to everyone. Remember, you can buy back in.

VW has been involved in electric vehicle research and small scale manufacture since the 1970s, they never did was Tesla did for lack of money or will. What they were counting on was second mover advantage, a historically successful strategy if you look at how Japan took on global manufacturing. Tesla has created the market that VW is waiting for, and now VW is coming for it's 20-30% market share. \n\n\"You severely underestimate the power of Tesla's brand, their huge investments in charging stations, and their added focus on selfless driving.\"\n\nNo I don't, Tesla has a great brand. That will successfully allow it to survive and maintain substantial market share however it will never have the type of global dominance that it's current market valuation requires. Meanwhile, VW is trading at a discount. \n\nThe point on charging stations and self-driving is just moot. VW has it's own research on self-driving cars and will have built 18,000 charging stations in the next 4 years and there's already 224,538 charging stations in the EU alone. So that's not a competitive advantage which is going to transfer to Tesla in the European market. This entire situation isn't about whether Tesla's a good company, or whether it'll survive. It's about whether it's market valuation can be sustained and whether other companies are comparatively undervalued. \n\n\"When people in China are buying EVs, they don't have VW on their mind\"\n\nAgain, VW has just invested a huge amount in Chinese production capacity last year and are planning on rolling out this year. Plus, they're already a household name in China through their various subsidiaries and historically have had a huge market share in the ICE cars market (sold 2.6m cars in China in 2020). There's a McKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights report (2019) which shows that 70% of Chinese consumers prefer German automobile companies to other brands. There's a strong  preference there for German cars, and it'll translate once VW enters the market with gusto this and next year. \n\n\"Neither do most EV buyers because Tesla is the face and rightly so. You only got upvoted because you're just throwing numbers and links at the end when your whole argument is garbage.\"\n\nThen debunk my argument.

The other selling point is the ADAS capability, but other OEMs are just skipping level 2/3 until they can go balls to the wall with level 4 (when laws allow). \n\nIdk where I'm going with this, but unless Tesla can sort out their build quality, I fear they will be overtaken by traditional OEMs very quickly.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "My $43k Toyota Tundra has horrific gaps on both sides on the front panels.

{"title": "The AMD Boom is Still Coming, Here's Why", "selftext": "See my previous AMD posts here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79506/amd\\_to\\_jump\\_50\\_soon\\_to\\_120\\_and\\_heres\\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m79506/amd_to_jump_50_soon_to_120_and_heres_why/)And here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3ns7b/i\\_turned\\_1k\\_into\\_87k\\_with\\_logi\\_using\\_sell\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3ns7b/i_turned_1k_into_87k_with_logi_using_sell_and/)\n\nu/crage88 asked \" Someone update this and tell me the boom is still coming \" ok. It's still coming.\n\nIn my previous posts I said that I think it would be sometime within the next 3 months. That's still true. So if you're buying weekly calls for April, I mean, that's not 3 months, that's 1 month. So maybe it'll happen before then, maybe not. I'm pretty confident for the stock to have turned around by June/July and be roaring into the fall.\n\nThe stock is still trading with the NASDAQ, meaning money managers, hedge funds, and algorithms are not trading AMD directly, they're trading the entire NASDAQ. And right now the emphasis is on re-opening stocks and traditional stocks, that means money going into reopening stocks needs to come from somewhere, so they're taking it from tech. And they're not being picky, they're just taking it from ALL of tech, AMD included. At some point they're going to realize that AMD is going to 100 and get on board for the rally, at that point the algorithms will catch a ride followed by dumb individual investors who like to buy high and sell low. When is that going to happen? Before June is my guess.\n\nTHE MARKET IS AS SMART AS A 5 YEAR OLD. AMD fell recently because Intel announced plans to build a new fab plant in the US and make chips for other companies. This should have triggered the opposite reaction but the market is stupid and thinks \"if Intel good, then AMD bad.\" What's going on here is Intel is trying to cash in on the chip shortage that has been so profitable for TSMC and Samsung. This is a great business plan for Intel, especially with Biden giving out money to help make it happen. But what it means is Intel is more focused on becoming a competitor in the fab space than on working really hard to take market share back from AMD. This also means that TSMC will not want to sell fab allocations to Intel if they can avoid it, since Intel is now becoming a direct competitor, meaning more chips for AMD. AMD should have shot up on this news but it fell because the market is dumb.\n\nI'm not the only one that realized this. Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard upgraded AMD’s stock to outperform (buy) for the same reasons.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-could-benefit-from-intel-faux-pas-analyst-says-in-upgrade-11616677895](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-could-benefit-from-intel-faux-pas-analyst-says-in-upgrade-11616677895)\n\nMore and more analysts are starting to beat the Buy drum on AMD. When this happens, it's important to pay attention to the price and what the CEO says in interviews. If the stock is high and the CEO plays it down, it's a signal to sell. But in this case, the stock is cheap and the CEO is constantly touting 37% growth this year and $3 future EPS. I say buy the dip, if it goes down to 70, buy some more.\n\nI hold 550 shares of AMD and have about 40 calls spread out with expirations between April 2021 and June 2022.\n\nBut this is not financial advice, I just like the stock.", "id": "mdwvby", "created_utc": 1616788285.0, "score": 284, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 123, "comments": [{"body": "AMD Bag Holder here CB 89", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "Im right behind you at $88", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "I'm right behind you at $87.

I've done business strategy for tech titans for years (first at McKinsey and later internally at a number of places) and I was a bit flabbergasted at Intel's announcement last week.\n\nI kept thinking to myself, \"what is the strategic advantage of making that announcement publicly?\"  Usually, major strategy changes come with a ton of secrecy as they take time to execute.  Announcing publicly like that \"seemed\" like just something to placate shareholders.  But maybe there is a good reason I just haven't thought of or heard about yet.  Maybe signaling to the U.S. government to \"help us become great with funding and tax breaks\"?  That's the best I could think of.\n\nNet net, it's all a very curious situation and I too am interested in the strategic ramifications (e.g., TSMC isn't stupid enough to announce, but they very well may start prioritizing AMD, as the article mentions).

They're not leading edge now. TSMC and to a lesser extent Samsung are safer bets. Intel doesn't even have a foundry that's capable of meeting their own GPU requirements, Xe GPUs are being made at TSMC.\n\nThey're pitching some of their strategy on \"national security\" hoping people conveniently ignore that they have 4 facilities in China. They're little safer in terms of being compromised than TSMC is in reality. Both could have facilities and IP seized if the party decides that's what it wants.\n\nIt's also cheap for them to say \"trust us, we're switching to a US+Europe production model\" because 1) it potentially gets them semiconductor funding under legislation^1 the administration is talking up and 2) they already have most of their fabs in those places. It costs them nothing. Meanwhile TSMC is already building a fab in Arizona.\n\nAs for TSMC prioritising AMD, AMD doesn't really need it. I'm sure the value and potential of AMD isn't lost on them so they're likely not going to kill the golden goose in the womb, but AMD's actually set really well right now. Not being on a leading edge node is a good thing for them. It allows Apple to pay for yield improvements and development and then they come in a year or so later and reap the rewards as the price is lower so their margins are higher. AMD's well set for a price war if it comes to that later, but in the meantime they're paying off debt and acquiring Xilinx, which could yet be a game changer. \n\nWhile Intel's management has floundered AMD's is amazing.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Great info, thanks for post!
