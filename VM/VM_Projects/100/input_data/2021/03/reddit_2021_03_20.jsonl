{"title": "Iron condors with the same day expiration", "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time poster.\n\nRecently I started experimenting with trading options with the same day or +1 expiration. I try to stay away from crazy volatile stock and focus on the ones that are more stable.\n\nI have couple of basic rules:\n\n* pick non-volatile stock\n* one that has decent volume (I broke that today and almost paid for it)\n* if stock is a bit jumpy, settle for any profits over 10%\n* usually I use iron condor with a bit wider wing spread (even if it exposes me to higher loses, but it gives me higher range)\n\nI use Tinkorswim to trade and OptionStrat to look for ideas usually a day before. My base investment varies, but it‚Äôs usually around $100k give or take.\n\nToday I made three these trades:\n\n* $DE - was a mistake. The volume is so low on this stock (and options) that it was all over place. At one point I was down to $13k and up to $11k. I won‚Äôt touch it again\n* $DGX - worked out fabulously. I had long spread so gave myself enough space and it closed right in the middle\n* $DIS - almost cost me money. It looked fine in the morning and jumped quite high before closing but then it dropped almost $3 by the end. Fortunately I was already out\n\nHere are the results\n\n$DE & $DGX\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lt9sovspb4o61.jpg?width=2153&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=186fbc52b2e08fc9986a87b5562ff1103f408a26\n\n$DIS (I have another long term position open there so it skews the data.

I wait over an hour in the early morning to avoid any major jumps.

My rule of thumb for the wing size is that if I don‚Äôt gain at least $1 in premium, then it‚Äôs not worth it.  On butterflies there is better premium. On condors there is better chance. I oscillate between them depends on the situation.

I'd stop following TSLA WEEKLY.  They're clueless.  As a growth company, TSLA's fair market value has been pegged between 15x - 20x previous annual revenue.  TSLA's revenue last year was 31.5B.  Q1 this year was 10B, so if they just stayed flat, they'd be at 40B for the year, but you know they're growing 50% year over year -- exponentially.  So, the current stock price of $654 puts their market cap pretty much spot on the money.\n\n2. That consolidation?  My thesis is that was sparked by Citadel and other hedge funds.  Everyone is just scared shitless that the stimulus will cause inflation, and they took advantage of that fear.  It's actually a brilliant plan:\n\n- Short the shit out of the bond market, drive the yields up a hundred basis points. That cost a penny, but the rewards will make that small change.\n- CNBC ratchets this up to 11 as a sign of inflation.\n- Citadel and others all have our orderflow data, know exactly where our limit sell orders and stop losses are, and they short the shit out of tech and innovation.  They know just how hard to push to hit the averages for stoploss triggers.  And when the capitulation happens, it's a brush fire liquidating retail by the billions.  There were a few periods where obviously someone stepped in with support buying to prevent it from getting out of hand\n- Wait for the smoke to clear after a day or two, and you've got a fire sale on TSLA, PLTR, etc.  30% off.\n\n3. We absolutely do not have the conditions for stagflation, or inflation of goods and services that would hurt the poorest -- the kind that would make the fed raise rates.  And we won't while we have global trade with China, Mexico, Vietnam, Central / South America, etc.  All of our consumer goods, and much of our food comes from economies that have fractional cost of living indexes compared to ours, and most of them have their currencies pegged to the dollar.  No matter what happens to the dollar, the price of their goods stays relatively the same.\n\nIn evidence, look at the M2 supply compared to inflation over time:\n\nhttps://www.longtermtrends.net/m2-money-supply-vs-inflation/\n\nBefore 1980, we didn't have international trade as we do today, and the chart above shows how the relationship with inflation becomes decoupled from M2. The seeds of that trade were planted by Nixon when he went to China in the early 70's, but didn't take off until the mid 80's.\n\nStill think the amount of money we pump into the economy has an impact with our current setup?  Look at the price of a burger in 1970 vs today:\n\n- 1970: $0.19\n- 2018: $2.64\n\nThat's basically a 10x in price, while the money supply has gone up 100x.\n\nSo what caused stagflation?  It wasn't the currency supply, even though our economy was much more sensitive to it than now.  But we only doubled it over the entire decade of the 70's.\n\nIt was energy.  Specifically, the Saudis wanted Israel out of disputed territory that they won after the 6 Day War, and they banded OPEC together to apply pressure on the US to force Israel's hand.\n\nCarter didn't think much of the Saudi Royal Family, and he certainly wasn't the kind of character to easily bow to that kind of extortion.  The embargo lasted two entire years.  We went from lining up at the gas station to leaving our cars behind because we couldn't get gas.  We all saw what the loss of just Lehman did to the global financial system.  Imagine two entire years without a reliable source of oil at a time when we were supremely dependent on it.  Two. Years.\n\nThis created shockwaves in the economy that lasted years.  And what did the Fed do to rising prices due to energy? They treated it like it was an issue of currency surplus and raised rates, and further put the economy underwater.  \n\nIt's just unfathomable.  It's almost like the Fed was trying to sabotage the economy.  Maybe the Fed governors were tired of paying 70% tax rates, and wanted Carter to look bad in order to get Reagan in, who promptly slashed personal taxes down to 38%.\n\nEnergy is cheaper than ever now.  Solar's price per kWh is dropping exponentially.  Batteries are also dropping exponentially in price per kWh storage.  So, while oil / natgas may spike periodically, each time it does only accelerates the transition away from fossil sources.\n\n4.  Protip: don't use technicals on growth stocks, those that are growing 50% yoy.  Technicals are backward looking, and they assume a linear performance.  I've done nothing but read report after report of scalpers and those attempting to time the ebb and flow of TSLA using technicals getting absolutely wrecked. That's because TSLA is far too volatile, and it's movement isn't driven by nice SMA lines governed by past performance.  It's movement is the result of people seeing exponential growth and getting the religion and buying in and holding it, while the rest of the world that doesn't get it tries to short the shit out of it.\n\nThat's it.

I'll be the bear here.  You can downvote me later.  I'll try to be as mean and as bearish as possible.\n\nDisclaimer: I like Tesla.  I respect Musk for innovating in areas where everyone else scoffed at and dismissed.  I respect that.  It's improving society and the world.\n\nBear Case:\n\nThis is all just getting ridiculous and too much.  Investing needs to return to reality.  It will be better for everyone.\n\nHow do you even begin to value a software, car, insurance, battery, ride-hail service company?  What margins do you use?  What revenues?  Do you take the high margins from software and combine them with the massive revenues of automotive?\n\nIt's like a forecast of the Frankenstein monster company; stitched together with the best pieces of each sector.  Should we also add in dividend projections from the utility sector for Tesla's solar farm business?\n\nAll of this is just getting too crazy and makes less practical sense each day.  A company like this has never existed in human history!  But this time is different?  Why?  Because a fund manager who is hemorrhaging money (and - for great emphasis - not projected to hemorrhage money in the *future* \\- but, is hemorrhaging money *today*) needs it to be true?  Because she is trying to save face before her whale clients pack up and leave?\n\nAlso, I thought they forecasted self driving to be live and in use across society by 2018.   And that failed.  I thought they were re-projecting a minimum of 10+ more years to solve the harder problems of dealing with visual impairments like snow and rain?  It's why most of the testing is stuck in the blue sky of Nevada and Arizona.  I think all the easy AI problems got solved 10 years ago - only the super hard ones are left.\n\nAnd why do they believe Tesla is the most probable company to deliver this technology?  I don't know; I like Tesla and all, but, are they really going to beat Google, Amazon, and Apple in an AI tech race?  That seems highly improbable actually - not probable.\n\nAnd then, there's this argument that Tesla is so far ahead of the other auto manufacturers; which is a true and factual statement.  However, it is not the complete picture.  The other auto manufacturers are always behind in technology.  They choose to be this way.  When the new inventions and technologies mature and arrive, they work out deals with the patent holders for the rights to put the tech in their cars.  They've always done this.  They are essentially outsourcing large portions of R&D.\n\nSo, what happens if just about any other company in the world discovers and patents important EV and self driving technologies other than Tesla?\n\nIn addition, another more prudent question is: Is Tesla beating Google and other silicon valley start-ups in AI and EV?  I don't think the answer to that question is obvious at all.  I think Tesla might actually be behind Google!  Waymo looks pretty promising.  And this goes back to the Frankenstein company dilemma.  You are rating the tech strength in Tesla to the tech strength in an auto company - which everyone already knows is weighted in favor of Tesla.  But, you are not punishing the Tesla valuation for its small revenues when compared to a true, auto giant.\n\n(And, again, I really like Tesla - but I think the current share price is much, much risker than a lot of people realize.

There's also a lot more to self driving than neural nets and computer vision. From what I've heard Tesla does some really top notch stuff with how they train, maintain, and deploy their models.

Sometimes a business bites off more than it can chew, especially one run by Musk. Various public comments by Musk demonstrate to me he doesn't really have a clue how ML works. I've personally been in situations where the business believes that ML can be a silver bullet. Sometimes SotA is just not there yet and more fundamental research is needed before a solution can be attempted for a problem.\n\nRegarding the cost of LIDAR, I don't think Waymo/Cruise needs to beat Tesla on cost. If Tesla can't deliver FSD capabilities, then LIDAR only needs to be cost competitive with a human driver, amortized over the lifetime of the vehicle(something I think it is already or will be possible soon). My suspicion is that LIDAR was never really an option for Tesla because Musk wanted to be able to sell cars with FSD hardware from the get-go. Tesla is in the business of selling cars to consumers, so raising costs to put in LIDAR is not viable for them. Raising costs minimally by adding sensors similar to what modern luxury vehicles have while promising FSD later down the line helps market and sell the car(especially if you can charge customers extra for the promise of FSD).

{"title": "Uranium, the cycle has turned and the next phase is on the horizon", "selftext": "I wanted to bring you all another post on the uranium sector after the massive run up we have seen in equity prices over the past few weeks. A lot of people have been worried about this run being unsustainable, because of a lack of movement in spot price. Others have pointed to it being blind speculation that will come to an end soon. Neither of those things are necessarily true in my view and these will be addressed in this post, together with a host of other things.\n\nRecently an interview came out by Smithweekly on YT where he spoke to perhaps the two brightest minds in the uranium investing space, Mike Alkin and Timothy Chilleri, in a two hour long gem of information on the uranium sector. After watching the video and talking about it with a lot of different investors, several of them found it to be relatively hard to follow and take in because of the duration of the video and technical terms in it. Because of this, I have written a summary of this interview that is found below, which is a lot less than 2 hours and hopefully it can help people pick out the most important aspects of it. I would most definitely advise you to watch the entire video even after reading this though, as it can be a great help in such an opaque market. Without further ado, here is the summary:\n\n**First and foremost, fears of the financial markets today:**\n\nIt‚Äôs a very interesting time. The view on the market is the case for a potentially weaker dollar, which would square with where we are in terms of commodity prices. The prices are moving up, but the valuation between the two asset classes is stretched, with equities being extremely high. Play in the things you are comfortable with, the markets might feel ‚Äòtoppy‚Äô right now due to all the tech fueled growth, it might continue but no one knows. Sometimes it is better to be in the parts of the market with less eyeballs on it and where things are less priced in. Timothy, who likes his coffee the same as Mike (and Andrew, important detail), focuses on cyclical industries/commodities currently. Things like gold miners who are now paying back debt and have a lot of free cash flow, again, with less eyeballs on it. If you go to plays where others won‚Äôt be, it is easier to have an informational edge and gain value, because the moment other retail investors and especially institutions come in, a lot of the potential upside won‚Äôt be there anymore.\n\n**The view of a long runway in the bulk of the commodities:**\n\nThis is certainly the case. Uranium doesn‚Äôt have real price discovery on a regular basis. There is a terrible futures market that is out there, which is so small it is insignificant. You have a cohort of buyers, which is the electric utilities, and there are \\~60 of them around the world. Lastly you have a few traders who trade some pounds back and forth, which don‚Äôt really influence the market. Right now, nuclear is catching an ESG feel to it, the fact that we are more focused on fighting climate change and we need nuclear power for that. Uranium mining gets swept up in that as well. Some people also look back and watch the commodities, especially with a weaker dollar. Once they have their eyes on the market, those people will likely see the opportunity so many of the people already investing into uranium have. Although this is all attractive, it doesn‚Äôt play a part in the base thesis of Mike and Tim. In their view, in terms of the best performance profile, there is nothing that comes close to uranium. Should we see a March like crash? It will be a like a gift. Having said that, the commodities market as a whole is very interesting. We need all the basic resources and after years of underinvestment, these cyclical commodities are coming back into favor. Markets will prove to be cyclical, as they have always been.\n\n**Let‚Äôs talk uranium:**\n\nFirst off, the supply side risk. Certainly one year ago, late January 2020, all focus was on the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. Because of that we saw several C&M decisions to go down, both from Cameco as well as closures in other jurisdictions and the pause of wellfield development in Kazakhstan. Very few people expected it to ‚Äòdrag on and drag on‚Äô, but today with Cigar Lake on care and maintenance, the risks remain out there. This has been highlighted for a few years now. It might not be fires and floods that take a mine offline this time, but who knows what might happen tomorrow. There are also mines closing permanently, like Ranger and COMINAK this year after some 50 years of mining (taking approximately 7 million pounds off of the market). This is already factored into the market, but those are still real pounds coming off of the market that will need to be replaced and with Olympic Dam not expanding for now, it is not clear where those might come from.\n\nThese pounds will need to be replaced. Why? Because demand is inelastic and there is no substitute. These utilities need uranium. In the last bull market these utilities had drawn down their inventories and if you look back to that period of time, you had much higher supplier and producer inventories, with lower utility inventories. These are, when all put together, lower today than they were back then. You can‚Äôt exclusively look at utility inventories and come to a conclusion purely based on that. The prevailing sentiment at that time, was that buyers didn‚Äôt believe there was a need to buy, they had been burned before and wouldn‚Äôt move based on merely the promise of the market improving. The ingredients for a massive bull run were in place: low inventories and underinvestment by suppliers. Exactly what we see today, but the difference is that we have a better demand story now and no new mine supply coming online.\n\nThis supply deficit can be seen when one would try to buy pounds off of the spot market in any given month several years ago. You would probably be able to find 15 million pounds, but today if you want to find more than 1 million free flowing pounds, you would drive the price up. Traders know this as well, the fact they can‚Äôt secure a large amount of pounds. Talks for security of supply are happening right now. The stage is set for a tug of war. Producers are not blinking and it is all part of the cat and mouse game, but this can‚Äôt go on. If utilities don‚Äôt start contracting like yesterday, they are hosed. They are going to be paying prices significantly higher than they need to be paying. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long it takes, supply is low, demand has improved and no new mine supply is coming online. Since 2013, on average 35% of supply was contracted and they are sitting there with enormous uncovered needs over the next couple of years. Don‚Äôt pay attention to day-to-day fluctuations, do the math, the opportunity is there and the horse has left the barn because utilities overplayed their hand. Some are playing it smart, like the smaller more nimble utilities, but the bigger ones are taking their time and will need to wake up soon. When one or two do so, it will likely be a stampede.\n\nYou know what is not going to make a difference? US producers tagging an extra million on maximum production capacity or Brazil opening a 4 million pounds a year uranium mine is not going to make a difference. We need more price discovery and if we don‚Äôt go to 50-60 dollars a pound, those mines won‚Äôt come and those pounds won‚Äôt be available.\n\n**View from inside the industry:**\n\nWhat does one see after 20,000 hours of research? Consensus is inconsistent. Most buy and sell side models are not up to date, causing inconsistencies in the views of the market. What also doesn‚Äôt help utilities get ‚Äòahead of the curve‚Äô, is that the fuel buyers in question don‚Äôt have any financial incentive to go ahead and lock in supply at certain prices. They don‚Äôt get anything extra for timing the bottom perfectly, nor do they participate in the financial upside. With no rewards for saving a fortune, you often see that most fuel buyers follow a herd like mentality. They won‚Äôt get penalized if they pay more than what they could have, as long as the peers are doing it. They won‚Äôt get fired for paying more to secure pounds, they might just get fired if they fail to secure any security of pounds for the utilities.\n\nOne of the big mistakes people make in this sector. Is being so focused on ‚Äòuranium‚Äô, U3O8, without really understanding conversion, enrichment and the broad fuel cycle. There are bottlenecks in this fuel cycle and we are finally coming to a point where we can move into the U3O8 market, because all this stuff further down the fuel cycle has been sucked out. Activity is going to pick up and this will result in a reaction in the prices of U3O8. Being well passed peak underfeeding, the next stage is coming over the next 6/12/18 months.\n\nWhat about mobile inventory? Something so many are worried about? At the moment, bottlenecks in the conversion market are still being solved. Questions like: Is there available UF6 stock? Can I convert my U3O8?, are common and these bottlenecks will need to be worked through. U3O8 is the last place they will go, but underneath the surface a lot of things are happening. Don‚Äôt keep staring at the price, the fundamentals are there, stop worrying about day to day noises in a broken, dysfunctional and inefficient physical uranium market and trying to make sense of it. If we really had all this excess supply, prices would be dropping like a rock.\n\n**China‚Äôs role in the thesis:**\n\nThey do not have a lot of indigenous uranium production, which is why they search for it elsewhere and make investments to secure supply for all the reactors they need to construct in order to meet the carbon neutral goals by 2060. They think in terms of decades and all these inventories that they have will never see the light of day. They are strategic and necessary for them. They are playing the long game and want security for every single reactor and a 400 million pounds stockpile, over the long term, is not a lot for them in the grand scheme of things. They are buying up all sorts of commodities and this should not be underestimated, so don‚Äôt stand on the sidelines looking in while the commodities macro thesis is playing out in front of everyone.\n\n**Mistakes and unexpected events:**\n\nIt is hard to realize how reliant the sector is on third party consultants. Having to spend so much time analyzing other people‚Äôs work, is an area that wasn‚Äôt really forecast. As facts change, consensus numbers change as well. But this doesn‚Äôt necessarily happen in this sector and it wasn‚Äôt until a deep dive into the sector, that a ‚Äòwow‚Äô moment came. The math is extremely compelling and it cannot be outrun. When will this happen? Could be tomorrow, but it also could be the end of this year. Point is that the math is in place and human nature doesn‚Äôt change in these cyclical industries, they will chase the price when it starts moving.\n\nWhen Converdyn went down back in 2017/2018 and they were out securing conversion, to do that they would go and buy UF6. Converdyn would have U3O8 laying around and the amount of U3O8 equivalent in that UF6 is returned to the seller. Some of the people that took this U3O8 back in, don‚Äôt need it, so they blow it into the market. In this period there was more supply and it was just a ‚Äòricochet event‚Äô in the form of people getting U3O8 to lock in conversion and blowing it back into the market, which brought some supply. It was never forecasted, but we have worked through those inventories and now we are on the other side of this. Headwinds are turning into tailwinds.\n\nDon‚Äôt make the mistake holding on to your shares too long. It‚Äôs part math and part art. You will see a lot of things happen, including crazy multiples and FOMO. Keep your eyes on the goal and keep evaluating and re-evaluating your investment thesis and put the puzzle together when situations change that might alter the outlook. There will be a time to sell, as you will always see with cyclical industries.\n\n**Proper analysis and projections:**\n\nLet‚Äôs talk about the difference sort of companies in the sector, the exploration, development and production companies. Exploration is hard, the success rate is not great, but there are possibilities to be had there. There can be monster returns to be made here, but it is a lot more risky, so keep that in mind as it can be a tricky part of the market. This is however not what has priority, the priority is in finding the mismatch in the macro. This is where you can look at some of the producers who can get back into production and will have cash flow, which can attract new investors to these companies. Then there are some development companies with world class assets where the market will probably just pay a premium when the cycle turns, because the asset is just too good.\n\nFor projects to come online, a lot of things have to go very well in the macro market. When this happens, the stocks of the underlying equities will probably have already re-rated and the current opportunities that are available today, are likely not going to be the same risk/reward proposition at that point. It pays to be early.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThat marks the end of the summary of this great interview. I wholeheartedly agree with Mike, Tim and Andrew on this one. The math is in place and the thesis looks to be playing out just like it was expected. It is still relatively early in this bull run so for those worried about missing the entire run up, we have not been anywhere near a top in this market in my view. Can we see a correction after such a massive run up? Of course, but in my opinion these corrections and dips are useful buying opportunities. Make sure to do your own research and build conviction.

Solar can only be produced during the day and depends on the weather.  Wind is fairly consistent, but still somewhat weather-dependant and storms and high winds can force turbines to park to avoid damage, cutting power.  Hydro is consistent, but the locations hydro can be built are limited.\n\nSo I've heard a lot of people say that Nuclear is going to replace coal as the stable, consistent energy supplier with reliability other renewables can't reach.\n\nOnly problem I have with this idea is that nuclear fuel is expensive.  With coal, if demand is low because of cheap renewables they can just burn less coal and save on costs.  But nuclear fuel is kind of *always* \"burning\".

Other OEMs catching up so that Tesla is less differentiated in a few years on technology. Tesla will still have the lead in a number of areas, but we will have fewer people saying that the only EV that made sense for them was a Tesla (because of the range and charging network). \n2. Early adopters with money have already purchased or will do so in the next year or two. After that, there are still millions who would love to buy a Tesla, but they are teens or 20-somethings who don't have the disposable income. So, the addressable market will be comprised mostly of those in their 40s-60s who aren't necessarily looking for the coolest thing, but want something reliable, and brand loyalties will show themselves more. \n3. Don't discount that there will be a plethora of other EV models to cater to every taste and niche. Lots of people don't like the design of the Y and X, for example, and so in the SUV market (which is huge), Tesla will lose many sales due to aesthetic (and functional) preferences. That's why the big OEMs make 20+ different models. Tesla can't aim to be Porsche, but VW. Not Lexus but Toyota. Even Ford has multiple brands underneath it and many, many models.\n4. People don't want to drive what all their neighbors are driving. More so people who buy new cars than those who buy used, but new cars are what we are talking about. There are already places in the US where Tesla is ubiquitous and some people want something else just to stand out and not feel like a drone (Silicon Valley). This ubiquity affect is even more pronounced because the models look so similar. \n5. Nations will defend their homegrown manufacturers. Tesla will often find itself just outside the price range for EV consumer rebates/credits. National pride matters in purchasing (just look at how many of the \"haters\" in this sub are outside the US, particularly in Germany whose car industry is most threatened by Tesla).\n\nEven the largest manufacturers in the world are only at 10% of the global market today.

It's the kind of turn that I'd often prefer to take a right and make a u-turn at a light, especially if there's heavy traffic. This is something that we've seen almost no data on from any other autonomous vehicle testing from any company. Tesla is the only company that's letting anyone public test these kinds of turns, and while it's far from perfect, it certainly seems like it's almost there, even for something difficult like this.\n\nThe left across three lanes of traffic I expect will be solved fairly quickly, it's probably just a situation that needs more data to refine. The cameras have great views in that situation and modeling the driving path is pretty straightforward. Making a left merging in to traffic is much more difficult, and that might require more time to get right consistently. But it's also a problem that can just be solved by taking a right instead.

{"title": "Why I'm buying puts on AAL the next week", "selftext": "**Preamble**\n\nI'm as close to being retarded as one can be. You're almost guaranteed to profit by betting against me and as such, neither is financial advise. The following is my observations.\n\nGenerally speaking I genuinely believe that immunity and the progress of vaccination  is oversold and that the broader market is hyped on fugazi. The facts remain:\n\nThe projected immunity of the US population (stated that 70-90% being fully vaccinated) is around Oct-Nov^(1).\n\nThe US awaits the Trial of AstraZeneca before FDA approval (I'll return to why I estimate this approval won't change much).\n\n\"Only\" 12.x% of the US is currently 2-dose vaccinated.\n\nAAL is nearing in on the stock price around $30 prior to Covid-19 restrictions and the market fall in March 2020 - and that's even with their own projections of Q1 capacity being down 45%^(2).\n\nThe projection^(1) estimates \\~50% being 2-dose vaccinated during the summer months (June-August).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why FDA approval of AstraZeneca won't change the projections imo**\n\nCVST is the short answer. I know fuck-shit about medice or the likes however, I do follow the vaccine status of the EU where I'm residing and the increased number of reports of Blood Clots in the brain (the ones being smooth on you) post AstraZeneca Jabs (*I'm not myself saying they are directly linked, others are indicating this though*). As of writing there has been:\n\n* 2 Deaths in Denmark\n* 1 Death in Norway\n* 1 Death in Spain\n* 1 Death in Austria\n\nThat *may* have been linked to the injection of AstraZeneca. The EMA had a conclusion on their hearing the 18th that stated \"The benefint (READ: Herd immunity) outweighs the risk\"^(3). Norwegian researches came to the conclusion that it was linked to the Astra vaccine^(4).\n\nAnd in the context of the US we'll need to look at **risk factors** for CVST, where one in adults is Obesity^(5). According to CDC above 40% was Obese through 2017-2018^(6) (too lazy to find newer numbers).\n\nAll the above nonsense is fine, what matters is **public perception**. Choose between Pfizer/Moderna or a Vaccine that in the media is portrayed as only \\~60% effective^(7) and has resulted in blood clots. *I know which one I'd prefer.*\n\nOh yeah, Ursula von der Leyen threatens to halt export of Astra jabs until the EU has had their promised deliveries, which are delayed and pose a risk to the EU herd immunity progress. (*Tinfoil-hat on* which may be why the EMA and WHO really needs to calm the tits down of the general public surrounding the vaccine? *Tinfoil-hat off*).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, back to AAL**\n\nHow will this affect AAL leading into the summer you ask. Less travel. Less travel than anticipated at least.\n\nBut, what about easing the travel restrictions?\n\nWell, there may be *domestically*, idk about internal US policy but from my point of view, jamming many people together in a metal tube for hours while still not immune in the herd might be just about as dumb as buying these puts.\n\nInternationally, I highly doubt we'll see travel unless the vaccination pasport is introduced, which projection wise only half of the US population would be able to supply at that time. Iceland already did this.\n\nWe're seeing more and more evidence for a third wave in Europe with Paris going in lockdown^(8).\n\nOh, right, the negative impact 2020 had and Covid overall on flying, cruises and the likes is also underplayed imo. I think we'll see some time go by before we're back to anything remotely close to pre-covid, if we ever get there..\n\nAnother observation is that the reported passengers while increasing in to double and nearly tripple from Q2 to Q3 and Q4 respectively, there isn't much upside to be seen in the Qx reportings that yield -2.07B, -2.4B and -2.18B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Confirmation Bias**\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr6ckb/if\\_youve\\_never\\_bought\\_puts\\_heres\\_a\\_free\\_one/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr6ckb/if_youve_never_bought_puts_heres_a_free_one/)\n\n[**https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m29sc7/aal\\_huge\\_debt\\_relief\\_and\\_why\\_it\\_is\\_time\\_to\\_sell/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m29sc7/aal_huge_debt_relief_and_why_it_is_time_to_sell/)\n\nI've excluded all the posts that goes against but you can do a quick search yourself: [https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=aal](https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=aal)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What am I looking at buying**\n\nPUTS. Puts around a strike price of $24 since I'm too scared to go hardcore short via CFDs (which we Europoors can). I also need to keep up my trackrecord of shorting via Puts which is 100% loss üòé\n\nI'll be attempting to gather Put options with strike $24, Expiry  20th of August and hopefully a premium of 2.0-3.0 which seems about adequate for my pessimistic perception of the aviation sector going into Q2-Q3 2021.\n\nIm poor af so may only be able to get 2 contracts at this premium. We'll see. I'll update when (if i get the premium i want) the options.\n\nAs always, *not financial advise.*\n\n\\---\n\n**References**\n\n^(1) [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/20/us/us-herd-immunity-covid.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/02/20/us/us-herd-immunity-covid.html) & [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html) states that it's safer to use the vaccinated than previously affected to get herd immunity.\n\n^(2) [https://americanairlines.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-airlines-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020](https://americanairlines.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-airlines-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020)\n\n^(3) [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots)\n\n^(4) [https://sciencenorway.no/covid19/norwegian-experts-say-deadly-blood-clots-were-caused-by-the-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine/1830510](https://sciencenorway.no/covid19/norwegian-experts-say-deadly-blood-clots-were-caused-by-the-astrazeneca-covid-vaccine/1830510)\n\n^(5) [https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/cerebral-venous-sinus-thrombosis)\n\n^(6) [https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html](https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html)\n\n^(7) [https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know)\n\n^(8) [https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nEdit:\n\nBought 2 puts since I'm a poor fuck that can't afford more.

{"title": "Disproving claims published in CNBC using data on WSB discussion", "selftext": "Yesterday, CNBC and Market Watch published [articles](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/stimulus-checks-unlikely-to-spur-another-gamestop-mania-says-bofa.html) on research concluding that we shouldn't expect people to use stimulus money to buy GameStop stock. One of the main justifications they gave for this conclusion was that ‚Äúthe number of recent conversations \\[on Reddit\\] including both GME and stimulus is low.‚Äù\n\nAs some of you know, I‚Äôve been collecting data on WSB discussion for quite a while now, and can quantitatively show that to be false.\n\nI'll try to keep this brief, as I know attention spans here are short. Please don't hesitate to ask questions below, and [here's a longer write-up](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/m8ogb0/the_stimmy_effect/) I did on the \"stimmy effect\" recently.\n\nTo start with, here is a graph of the total number of comments in my data mentioning \"stimulus\" or \"stimmy\" over time:\n\n[Stimulus Comments](https://preview.redd.it/68304hkrr6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=89e506d66c60fcfdb2c7f615e53cf952fa4dd522)\n\nHere is a graph of the number of comments in my data that mention BOTH stimulus & GME over time:\n\n[WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/f5ubk3hhq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b50e38cb0eafa490bcfeba1bda3b6e023409ce)\n\nThe drop off at the end reflects the fact that it was 3:00pm as I am writing this and the day is only partially completed. One could argue that these numbers should be normalized based on the total of number of comments per day and, while I'd disagree, I'll include that graph below as well:\n\n[Normalized WSB comments discussing stimulus & GME](https://preview.redd.it/003y7k0mq6o61.png?width=1730&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4b0762cf396708bdef53f795ce84ad7e0c4847)\n\nFrom both of these graphs I see no indication of the number of recent conversations including both GME and stimulus being low, as a matter of fact it has hit all time highs over the last few days Here's a chart of the top 5 days in which stimulus was mentioned the most in my data of WSB daily discussion.\n\n|**Day**|**Stimulus & GME mention count**|\n|:-|:-|\n|3/15/21|124|\n|3/14/21|103|\n|3/16/21|74|\n|3/13/21|69|\n|1/14/21|67|\n\nTo take it a step further, we can look at what % of comments mentioning different stocks also mention stimulus, as I did recently in the graphic below. A larger proportion of comments mentioning $GME on WSB also mention stimulus than for any other major meme stocks, save for $TSLA.\n\n[Most-discussed stocks in 2021 w\\/ \\\\\"stimmy ratio\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/d6gj9vj7r6o61.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7f1e3d99059a70494a08da9ea571f2832a2359)\n\nI don't know how the conclusion was reached that the number of recent conversations on reddit including GME and stimulus is low. Assuming that this is an honest mistake, I'd encourage BofA, Market Watch, CNBC, or any of the other parties involved to get better data. There are a lot of people out there who have started collecting data on WSB, but not many who do it well and with good intentions. I've been doing it for a while now, and I like to think I fit both those criteria which is why I feel qualified to write this post.\n\nNote:  I don‚Äôt have stake in $GME and don‚Äôt actively trade a portfolio, in order to avoid perceptions of bias in my analysis.

Marcus Lemonis isn‚Äôt an idiot. In fact, I‚Äôd wager he‚Äôs smarter than most of us. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs done his due diligence. More than anyone of us.

All you have to do is wait for the proof by the end of this month. Take your chance and wait, or buy in now and enjoy the catalyst.\n\n4) They already secured a dealers license for the state of California. They will sell direct to consumer.\n\n5) They are using proven battery tech from LG Chem. I don‚Äôt think LG Chem is a bunch of morons who put money into a sinking ship. A contract has to be made and money has to be guaranteed.\n\n6) GM is on the board of $RIDE. Yes, they struck out with Nikola, but everyone seems to have forgotten how fast they ditched Nikola when the report came out. GM hasn‚Äôt budged. Easy money follows smart money.\n\n6B) GM is a partner and investor in $RIDE. They were since day 1 when they handed them a present for a factory. Let‚Äôs not forget of the possible buyout once $RIDE gets all of its free money for government loans and grants.\n\n7) They have officially entered into a race. Why would $RIDE set themselves up for disaster on a public stage if they are unsure of their product? Or if one didn‚Äôt exist?\n\n8) People keep complaining about a lack of product. Shut the fuck up. It‚Äôs a pre revenue company, you dip shits. Product = revenue.\n\n9) The brilliant analyst at MS, Adam ‚Äúwhat the fuck is a hub motor‚Äù Jonas thought the hub motors were part of the wheel assembly and thought each truck needed 5 motors. They don‚Äôt. The hub motors are (gasp) part of the axle.\n\n9B) The Endurance can run on a single hub motor. Consider the equivalent of losing one cylinder in an ICE vehicle. Endurance > ICE.

{"title": "Siren Song of the Marketpocalypse", "selftext": "As you know, WSB posts around timing market corrections and crashes have a‚Ä¶ notorious history. Some have made us millions; some have destroyed portfolios. But I just CAN‚ÄôT resist hammering out this DD. Maybe I was born with bear blood.\n\nI present to you my thesis as to why the market is looking vulnerable to a correction in the next months, and why the new challenger‚Äîbonds‚Äîpresents a significant downside risk.\n\n\\--\n\n**Exhibit A: Enormous market inflow of new, paper-handed money**\n\nLast week we saw a record $56.8 billion flow into equities. That amount is staggering, and much of it is no doubt due to the Biden Bucks landing in bank accounts. That new money to the market with terrible cost basis is weakly positioned and notoriously paper-handed.\n\n**Exhibit B: A new challenger enters the ring: Bonds.**\n\nI can hear you retards whining about it now. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt give a shit about bonds, why are they even relevant?‚Äù Yes, these are your grandparents‚Äô bonds. They also make up a significant portion of 401ks, pensions, and endowments. This is BIG money. These funds go through a quarterly rebalancing where they sell-off what is high and buy what is low. I expect a massive amount of profit-taking in tech and overvalued industrials as those funds seek to lower risk, rebalance, and take advantage of the juicy higher yields.\n\n**Exhibit C: We are again at historic P/E multiples**\n\nBack in the old days, the value of a company was a factor of its earnings and future earnings potential over the next several years. It‚Äôs no secret that stocks have completely left regard for fundamentals long ago and are instead priced as speculative instruments. Take TSLA for example. To make its valuation make sense they would need to have a 100% market share. Maybe they will be selling forty-thousand-dollar cars to millions of kids in Africa next year, and I just missed that at the shareholder meeting.\n\nCurrent P/E rates on the S&P are touching 40 on average. In 2000 we briefly touched 44.\n\n**Exhibit D: The bond market likes to get cute and crash stock markets.**\n\nMany crashes have been proceeded by a rapid rise in bond yields. Now, I hear what you‚Äôre saying, JPOW announced the FED won‚Äôt let them get too rowdy. I absolutely do believe that, and I don‚Äôt think we are going to see another black Monday when an overvalued equities market was met with a sudden spike in bond yields. Again in 2018, we saw another decent correction driven by an increase in bond yields.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm not fighting the FED on this one. I do however think we are overripe for a juicy correction, and this is the perfect catalyst to set it off. As we get into 2-2.5% yields on the 10-year-note, quite possibly in the next month or so, we are going to see some money moving. There‚Äôs just no way around that, and we already see it happening with the high-flying tech and the QQQs. A lot of that money found shelter in value stocks, which are now rising parabolically like growth stocks. You can see where I‚Äôm going here.\n\n**My play:**\n\nAs I‚Äôve been burned trying to time these things in the past, I‚Äôm loaded up on longer-dated puts on SPY and QQQ. If we see a parabolic spike in SPY this week (as we did with ALL the corrections on the run-up this past year) I‚Äôll look to be adding to these positions. Also keeping plenty of dry powder for buying opportunities when the correction ensues.\n\nPositions:\n\nQQQ 5/21 270P\n\nSPY 5/21 380P\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Added puts on FB, CCL, AAL, GM, GPRO today", "id": "m9f8zz", "created_utc": 1616271425.0, "score": 275, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "Bears are gay but you‚Äôre not wrong here.

What I expect to happen when earnings start in 3-4 weeks is that a lot of companies guide up (the banks will recapture last year's loan loss reserves as earnings as an example) and companies like KO and restaurants that haven't provided guidance will start to talk about forward visibility with travel/live entertainment opening back up fully.\n\nIn addition, don't forget all the stimulus that never got spent.

In the short term we'll see a spike in yields and another sell off in the bonds but this will reach an equilibrium at some point.\n\nWe also have another problem, that is inflation.

{"title": "Enough with the techno mumbo jumbo A Fundamentalist Analysis of UWMC - Why I'm doubling Down", "selftext": "Right, I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of doom and gloom regarding UWMC and a lot of techno analysis mumbo jumbo regarding technical analysis. Now, I do not know too much about technical analysis‚Ä¶ I analyze things from a fundamental perspective, and those of you who are dooming and glooming like your pants have caught fire need to stop and take a breath.\n\nI am not going to lie, and state I was not laughing when I was seeing some stuff like ‚ÄúIt might go down below 7.5,‚Äù or ‚ÄúCould it head to six or five?‚Äù Well, the tangible price to book value of UWMC is 7.65. The price-to-tangible book value ratio measures a company‚Äôs market price in relation to its tangible book value. The ratio denotes how much investors are paying for each dollar of physical assets. In short, if you liquidated everything, you would get 7.65 dollars per share. As it stands that is a tangible price to tangible book value ratio of 1.169. The CEO has already confirmed that the first quarter of 2021 is going to be gangbusters, and surpass the last quarter of Q4 2020 which was‚Ä¶ You guessed it, gangbusters. So why is everyone screaming at the top of their lungs, and acting like this bad boy is going to nosedive worse than CDProjectRed‚Äôs reputation after Cyberpunk came out? This despite the tangible book to value ratio easily, easily, going above $8 dollars a share after Q1 2021. I will try to answer that in a bit but let me go ahead and go through some other valuation metrics.\n\nA value stock refers to shares of a company that appears to trade at a lower price relative to its fundamentals, such as dividends, earnings, or sales, making it appealing to value investors. Common characteristics of value stocks include high dividend yield, low P/B ratio, and a low P/E ratio. As a generalized rule of thumb P/E ratios for value stocks are meant to sit anywhere between 11 to 15.\n\nThe 4th Quarter of 2020 was very good for UWMC as they got a net income of $1.37B and for the full year it was a net income of $3.38B. There was also a total gain margin of 305 bps in 4Q20 (3.05%) compared to 110BPS in 4Q19. It is important to note that for Q4 2020, this is pre-tax and so the net income is $1.0925 Billion. Starting from Q1 2020, it will be post tax for net income. Total assets at the close of Q4 2020 was $11,493,283 (Spread across cash and cash equivalents, mortgage loans at fair value, and mortgage servicing rights).\n\nUWMC maintained an average application to clear to close time of approximately **18** days in Q4 2020. This is while the industry average (in management‚Äôs estimate of the industry) grew to -52- days (This is due to the mortgage and refinance boom). This was 10 days higher than the nine-month average off 42 days. For the month of December, the days to close was 16 days, while management‚Äôs estimate grew to 54 days. Furthermore, the delinquency and forbearance rates are well below industry averages.\n\nEmployees grew from 4,907 on December 31, 2019 to 7,475 on December 31, 2020. This represents an increase of 52 percent in employees and is a bullish indicator of the mortgage market in 2021 and beyond. A part of this is likely because they intend to restart their jumbo offerings which are expected to go live in March 2021 and which management expects to materially increase purchase volume during the remainder of 2021. The wholesale channel, which is where UWM is #1 and which is their sole focus, continues to be viewed as the growth channel of the residential mortgage industry. It represented only 17.2% of the total mortgage market for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Of that 17.2%, UWM had grown its market share to 34.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Finally, the non-funding debt to equity is .49 which is important for later.\n\nManagement is projecting Q1 2021 closed loan volume between $52 Billion and $57 Billion, which would represent an increase of 22.6% and 34.4% from Q1 2020. The total gain margin of 2-2.35% is an increase of 110.5%-142.1% compared to .95% in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nYes, yes, but what does that mean? Well, we know that they beat Q4 2020 EPS by a staggering 30 cents and reported a .62 Earnings Per Share. We also know that it will be even better, for Q1 2020, but that analysts are expecting .40 for this quarter, and a FY of 1.27 EPS (which is ludicrously low). So, let us look at the future P/E ratio in a normal scenario, and in an analyst scenario (analyst scenario being the worst-case scenario). For the normal scenario we use Q4 2020 EPS so .62\\*4= 2.48 in earnings per share for the FY EPS (I am projecting higher Q1 and Q2 revenues, to account for the slowdown in winter). This would make for a future P/E ratio in 2021 of 3.608 if the price stuck to 8.95. A P/E ratio of 11 would mean that the stock would hold a price of 27.28. Let us look at the analyst average now. A current P/E ratio of 7.04 to the current price point of 8.95 would apply **right now** if the consensus analyst average were met. For a P/E ratio of 11 the price point of UWM would have to be 15.62. Alright. Undervalued. Gotcha. But let us see if it meets the other metrics. Even after Rocket‚Äôs massive sell off, the price to earnings ratio for Rocket is 13.56, and they hold a market cap of 49.55B. Please remember that the tangible book value of UWMC is over $11 Billion, and as such that is over 20 percent of the market cap of RKT which is a diversified company but also is in the Wholesale Mortgage Market and holds the title of 2nd largest wholesale mortgager while also having a private broker channel with higher margin.\n\nAt .40 in dividends per year, the yield at $8 is 5%, and at $9 it is 4%. This is deep value, as the stock made a profit margin of $3.38 Billion. As the market cap of the company is currently sitting at 13.4 Billion‚Ä¶ This represents a profit margin to market cap of 23.5% rounded up. The tangible book to value ratio also means that the company could conceivably pay the current dividend with no profits for over a decade. As such, the dividend yield is safe and is in fact due for a raise. Q1 2021 is expected to be quite profitable as well, and I expect management to beat their projections, but we will discuss why later. It is also important to note that the balance sheet is a fortress to weather downturns.\n\nBut, HB, that is not what we are scared about. We are scared about 2023, and 2024! Well, before I begin, let me make one thing clear. The mortgage market is here to stay, and it will be continuously growing. The only question is at what rate. I seriously hope you are not betting against the mortgage market, because the only thing that will kill it is WWIII, or depopulation. However, I will entertain your doom and gloom fanfiction because I am nice like that. There are currently around 75 mortgage companies operating in the United States in a highly fragmented market. UWMC engages mostly in the provisioning of home purchases, while Rocket is more geared toward refinancing. Let us get one thing out of the way first, before I continue. The notion that refinancing was all pushed forward and that the mortgage industry just had its income all front loaded is absurd. Before Covid the Federal Reserve was hiking rates up, and it is only because of Covid and the Fed‚Äôs resultant dovish policy that the interest rates crashed below 3 percent for the first time ever. Rates would have otherwise gone up. This has helped mortgage companies because they conducted refinances that would have otherwise never occurred. Furthermore, at least in earlier quarters, the interest rate was effectively above 3% because of the sheer demand which allowed companies to charge above a 3% rate. Furthermore, WFH has allowed home prices to increase across the spectrum from rural homes to exurban and suburban homes due to increased demand. In the case of a mass market crash, UWM‚Äôs dominant position in the wholesale mortgage industry will allow it to gobble up market share from struggling other mortgagers, while it is fortress of a balance sheet will allow it to reduce profit margin to be more competitive and effectively aid itself in squeezing out competitors. Finally, it can just flat out weather the storm due to its balance sheet, while keeping its dividend. This will happen regardless, but a crash would accelerate this.\n\nNow, for the more likely scenario. Demand is booming, but inventory is scarce, and it takes time for supply to be made to meet demand. Let us look at the current demand, however. To look at this, we need to look at the stock of home builders. Therefore, let us look at Lennar. Lennar‚Äôs quarterly earnings per share were up 60.63% over the past year to 2.04 which beat the estimate of $1.71. It has a P/E ratio of 9.67 however, and a fair market value that would have it a little above that. More generally, the estimate is that it will take 5 years for home builders to get inventory equivalent to demand as homebuilding takes time. What does that mean exactly? A metric fuck ton of buyers, but only so many homes. In that sense, perhaps interest rates are not the boogie man that people think they are. Why? Well, I‚Äôll put supply and demand in banana speak‚Ä¶ Just for you. You are all apes, and you live in trees, but you need to buy the tree you sleep in with banana‚Äôs. The trees cost too much for you, so you need to take out a mortgage to buy the tree with your bananas. However, the bananas per month expected of you is rising because of higher interest rates that those pesky humans are demanding. So, less apes want to buy trees, and as a result, the price to buy a tree drops to meet demand until demand equals supply‚Ä¶ Except supply is so low that demand will always beat supply even with higher interest rates!\n\nTo account for all this lack of homes, people are deciding to do cash out refinances in 2021 as a means of getting cash out of their home so that they can upgrade their starter homes to fit their growing families. Furthermore, sales of new homes were up 19% on an annual basis according to a MarketWatch Economic Report on February 24, 2021 even though the cost of new homes were rising due to increased lumber costs. That was a stunning 4.3% above the already upwardly revised pace of 885,000 in December. Furthermore, inventory dropped slightly to a four-month supply. A six-month supply of homes is generally considered indicative of a balanced market. What does that mean? Simple, demand outstrips supply for newly built homes. Hard. Finally, millennials are in their peak home buying years. Finally, a new survey from Zillow found that 70% of homeowners said they would feel comfortable moving to a new home if there were widespread vaccine distribution, compared with just 52% who feel that way as things stand now. What that means, is that demand is expected to increase as Covid 19 moves further and further into our rear-view mirror. It has gotten to the point where there are affordability concerns. Demand has gone so off the charts that a record 26.4% of new homes on the market do not even exist yet. Of the 307,000 homes that were on the market at the end of January, just 42,000 of them had been completed. At 13.7% that was the lowest on record.\n\nI will briefly address the ultimatum Ishbka made. It is smart, and while it might cap the ceiling a bit, it substantially raises the floor and protects the wholesale market. There will still be growth in market share. He is basically doing a solid for his clientele because he does not want what Zillow did to real estates to happen to his customers. It will also stunt top line growth for Fairway and Rocket.  Furthermore, the Rocket 8-K for more financing, is also a bullish catalyst for UWMC.\n\nSo, let us look at some positive catalysts for UWMC:\n\n¬∑ Infrastructure Package to bring more growth, and perhaps even increase productivity. It is a more general positive catalyst, but it is good for UWMC as well.\n\n¬∑ Minimum Wage increase. Whether it be Mitt Romney who wants 10-10.5 and indexed to inflation, or Bernie Sanders 15-dollar minimum wage.\n\n¬∑ Jim Cramer‚Äôs interview with the CEO of UWMC.\n\n¬∑ The Q1 Earnings Call and 8Q. I expect a dividend raise, a share buyback, a special dividend, or a combination of all three.\n\n¬∑ HUD‚Äôs confirmation of Marcia Fudge as HUD Secretary who is focused on racial equity because minorities (Especially latino‚Äôs and African American‚Äôs) lag far behind white American‚Äôs in home ownership. Fudge has stated in her press interview on March 18th that there is an immediate housing concern in the increasing price of home ownership. The average price of homes is higher in her words, and the ‚Äúinventory is much less‚Äù than hoped. A major problem she noted, is that ‚ÄúCredit is not available and accessible for people who do actually qualify.‚Äù She stated that since FHA is in her purview, they would work with issues of ‚Äúrestructuring,‚Äù ‚Äúaccess to credit,‚Äù and the ‚Äúdown payment‚Äù as part of the solution for this solution. Finally, she stated that she was going to make sure people who qualify have access to credit, and she shares the same vision as President Biden to include in this plan policies aimed at closing the racial wealth gap. As UWMC handles FHA loans, this is a boon to them.\n\n¬∑ Meeting the growth targets in 2021 and coming back to full employment by the end of 2021.\n\n¬∑ I will mention interest rates, but I do not think it really matters as demand is so over supply that it has stopped mattering. It is also very important to note that rates remain very low by historical standards, and even though they have trended up their still well below pre-pandemic levels. The average interest rate on a new 30-year mortgage loan was above 3.50% in Jan 2020, and those who obtained loans to buy home sin 2019 or prior likely had loan rates close to or even above 4%. Meanwhile refinance rates always tend to be a little higher than rates for new home loans are hovering in the low 3% range.\n\n¬∑ Continuing demand in 2021, and onward.\n\nSo, what does this mean? Well, let us look at where I am right now. I hold 200 shares at 8.66, and 7 options contracts. UWMC $9 Calls for 4.16 with a breakeven at $10.39, and $7.5 Calls for 5/21 for a break-even price of 10.15. I intend to purchase more shares if it climbs lower, and even purchase more options to average down my cost basis in them (I didn‚Äôt buy them at the top, or at the bottom). I will likely roll my April calls to May closer to the expiration date, and I will very likely exercise these shares if they are between the strike price and the premium. I may just exercise them period, so that I can go on to sell covered calls at a price point above what I bought them at. Likely $11-14. This would decrease my cost basis. To exercise these options would cost me 6,000, which I am alright with doing. I also have almost $1,800 in shares, and I intend to raise my share count in this manner. 1) Buy tentatively at 8.95, 2) buy moderately at $8.50, 3) Buy aggressively at $8 and below, and 4) Should It legitimately go below 8 dollars. I may legitimately start liquidating most of my other assets except AMD and a few other select holdings to purchase a massive number of shares in UWMC. Then, I intend to sell covered calls at a share price I would be comfortable selling at, but I do not believe will be met with the strike plus premium and will therefore not be called. The dollar value of my shares should likely reach 2500 on Monday, unless the drop is precipitous, in which case it may rise to 5,000. If it reaches 8 dollars, I will raise it to 10,000. If it goes below the current tangible book value of 7.65, I will likely have an aneurysm at the idiocy, but I will raise my stake to my entire portfolio, excluding my 110 shares of AMD. This will likely be around $24,000 dollars, including my exercised options as my portfolio ranges from $31,000 to $32,000 at current.\n\nAt the end of the day, I am not in the market to lose money or gamble, but to make it. 25,000 at a five percent dividend yield is 1,250. And I expect the dividend to be raised more and more. The company has a fortress of a balance sheet, competitive and technological advantages over its competitors, and the largest market share in a highly fragmented field where it can take even more. It is also increasing its profit margin YoY. I do like Rocket too, and that is why I have 50 shares in it, but its P/E ratio is far above UWMC‚Äôs and is equivalent to a value stock. While I do think it is going to go higher, I think that UWMC is the correct play at current.\n\nIf a 7-10 percent increase in the share price due to Russel inclusion where the share price would have increased 62 cents to 89 cents is the metric which you would have bought and held this company, then you are a swing trader and while it is unfortunate it is ultimately small potatoes. I would heavily, heavily, urge you to reconsider selling because the potential upside is much higher than the downside. The stock going below 8 means that the price to book value in May will be less than 1, and by a not insignificant degree. Patience.\n\nThis has honestly been such a long write up I‚Äôm not even going into the Total Fertility Rate for generational population growth (and thus demand/inventory over the next 1-3 generations), because I think this is enough.\n\nI do expect, despite this report I‚Äôve compiled, that there will be a significant amount of paper handling, and I‚Äôm okay with that because I believe in the fundamentals of this company and I can wait. Lowering cost averages is what I do. I expect a runup in late April to earnings, and some juicy announcements come Q1 2020 Earnings. I‚Äôll also tune in to Jim Cramer‚Äôs interview with the CEO when it happens.\n\nThanks for reading. I shall go ahead and state that this is not financial advice, but the thought process that I am going through with this on a forward moving basis. I have some thoughts on GE, and was compiling a report for that too, but I‚Äôll shelve it in favor of this for now. GE isn‚Äôt going anywhere.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay fine TLDR: UWMC is a steal, even with higher interest rates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome References:\n\n[New home sales rise as buyers remain hamstrung by the lack of property listings - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-home-sales-rise-as-buyers-remain-hamstrung-by-the-lack-of-property-listings-11614180009)\n\n[26.4%: How builders are coping with low inventories - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/builders-are-selling-lots-of-houses-that-havent-been-built-yet-11614195857)\n\n[New home sales rise slightly, even as buyers see more affordability contraints - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-home-sales-rise-slightly-even-as-buyers-see-more-affordability-contraints-11611847410)\n\n[It‚Äôs time buy these home builder stocks as part of the millennial-driven housing boom, analyst says - MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-time-buy-these-home-builder-stocks-as-part-of-the-millennial-driven-housing-boom-analyst-says-11605881301)\n\n[Mortgage Rates Are Rising.

If I sell cash covered puts, which means I have to sell other shares that I might not want to do otherwise. I also do not really think it will go down that much. However, I have margin. I have more than one portfolio (Brokerage), but I do my options on only one of them and I intermingle it with stock purchases.\n\nHowever, i don't really fuck with margin, because of the chances of losses, so when I'm playing with margin I want to be /really/ careful. Margin Maintenance for me is 4,875.55 on this brokerage. I have $15,209.60 in this brokerage tied up in stocks, and $91.56 in cash. Of the 15,209.60 tied in stocks, 14,238.6 are tied in shares, and 971 are tied in call options. Of my options, 5 are 9 dollar calls. The premium, however, wasn't the best as i was tied in GE short term at the time and when i got around to buying it was doing its little run (though I didn't buy at the top). The April 16 calls will matter later.\n\nI have around 350-550 that I have yet to deploy from my bank account. While I was going to put them in my other brokerage, they can be cash deployed anywhere at current.\n\nI obviously want to be extremely safe from margin maintenance, so I will take the value of my total brokerage in this account, and then deduct the options (due to theta and volatility). This gives me 14,330 to work with in shares and cash. I'm not going to include cash deployable for now. Minus the margin amount and the sum total becomes $9,454.45 to play with, with margin safely. As stocks go up and down, I want to deduct a further 35% in case of a flash crash bearmageddon. That new number that I am willing to play with on margin is $6,145.39. Finally, when deducting, I want to deduct the amount of shares I have in UWMC. This leaves me with $4355.39 if I am playing ultra-safe. I also have 55 dollars coming in from my RKT special dividend which turns it into $4,410.39.\n\nHowever, this doesn't take into account selling the cash covered puts and selling covered calls. We'll use EOD Friday as our baseline for purposes of calculating for now. I'm going to be selling 14 dollar covered calls, and they have a premium of .28, of which I will be pocketing .25. I have 2 covered calls I will be selling and so that gives me an additional $50. The idea is that with my cost basis of 8.61 I will be making a 39.6% profit if they are exercised, and for holding these shares for less than 1 month I would be ecstatic for these returns, especially since I had already sold another covered call. I also have call options purchased at 7.5 in May, and 9 in April. I'm more than happy. Selling 7.5 April 16 Put Options would net me .40 in profit per cash covered put options after three cents are taken off. In order for the put buyer to make money, the stock would have to go below $7.07. As each contract would cost me 750 if exercised, with the margin I have allowed myself to use, i am able to purchase 5.80 cash covered puts. 5 cash covered puts would net me $200 dollars, which would give me $250 dollars in cash in sum total if you count the covered call. This premium would actually put my allowable sum for margin at $4,660, which means that I am comfortably able to purchase 6 cash covered put options with a bit of money left over.\n\nThe yield on the puts would be 5.3% if exercised at 7.5, and I would get a dividend yield of 5.3 percent on annum. The yield on my cash covered calls would be 2.9% based off my cost basis of $8.61.  If both were combined- .65/8.61. The yield on my basis at current would be 7.5% if both expire worthless.\n\nIf I get assigned on the higher leg, I'm ecstatic. If I get assigned on the lower leg, I will get exercised with a cost basis of exactly 7 dollars almost. I'm ecstatic too, because that is a 5.7% dividend yield per option purchase, and I know the stock will bounce back.\n\nTo be clear i expect the put option premium to be higher tomorrow, while the covered call option premiums will be lower.

{"title": "GME - Possible Tesla Like Short Squeeze? - DD", "selftext": "In the comments of [yesterday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8racu/bloomberg_terminal_gme_data_as_of_eod_0319/) by u/yodisc I saw some commenters mentioning that this is looking similar to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze, so I did some digging and I'm here to share what I found with everyone today. \n&#x200b;  \n#GME Graph and Shorts  \nFirst, let's look at the graph of GME. According to sources such as S3 Partners, Ortex, Fintel, Yahoo! Finance, and a few others, most short interest estimates I have found range from 20%-80% of the float, not accounting for shorts through ETFs. This is down from estimates of about 140%-150% during the first squeeze, if this information is to be correct, it is clear that the first squeeze had numerous shorts covering, but not all shorts were covered. This leaves us with the current range of 20%-80% interest, which is still quite high.  \n&#x200b;  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/BSpHXlu.jpg  \n&#x200b;  \nNow, based on Fintel information, we can see that institutional put/call ratio is 2.81, meaning there is still a large portion of shorts compared to long positions. We can also see that for the past 10 trading days ~23% of trading volume has been short sales, which could provide support for the theory of the price being shorted so it doesn't go up too much.    \n&#x200b;  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/Mp5cJXD.jpg    \n&#x200b;  \n#TSLA Graph  \nNow, if we look at Tesla's graph from 2020 to now, we can see the process of a slow short squeeze along with catalysts and improving value for the company. (Namely Model 3 sales)     \n&#x200b;  \nTowards the beginning of 2020 Tesla short interest was estimated to be ~20%, ending now at ~5%.  \n&#x200b;  \nTesla seemed to follow a similar pattern to what we are seeing starting now, where it has a bit of a squeeze, corrects, more squeeze, corrects, rinse and repeat.     \n&#x200b;  \nhttps://i.imgur.com/KB4hKRu.jpg    \n&#x200b;  \n#Is This Similar?\nBased on the numbers available and the patterns available, it appears this could be a similar squeeze to the 2020 Tesla short squeeze. However, this scenario is also different, we are dealing with a situation with a lot more press and larger short volume, not to mention an almost war like scenario, David and Goliath style.   \n&#x200b;  \nIt is also worth noting, company catalysts fueled the Tesla squeeze, similarly we can see the recent squeeze from $40 to $200 was because of digital transformation plans, but for this to follow the same pattern catalysts would need to continue coming.  \n&#x200b;  \n#Unknowns\nNow, a few things I wanted to briefly go over while I have my little stage here. First, there's no way to tell how earnings will affect the stock, if it will. Earnings could come out surprisingly well or have good guidance, and it could be a catalyst. Shorts could use the opportunity to push the price down more, after all markets tend to react negatively to earnings, it would be a good way to hide it. It may entice some of you to sell prior to earnings and buy again at a lower price, however because of the strange nature of this stock, if you want to be here for a potential squeeze it would be better to just HODL.   \n&#x200b;  \nI would also like to note, there's no way for us to accurately see who is currently still short GME, such as if Citadel or Melvin still hold the same positions they were in before. Melvin reported they owned 60,000 puts on GME with no calls to hedge as of 12/31/2020, you can see this in their [most recent 13F filing, which was filed 2/26/21.](https://sec.report/Document/0000905718-21-000248/)  \n&#x200b;  \nIf you would like to see the most recent info on institutional ownership, take a visit to [holdings channel, which gives a good view based on the most recent information from filings.](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=gme)    \n&#x200b;     \nFrom this we can see that Citadel and Melvin are (unsurprisingly) some of the largest short positions, however Melvin has no hedging but Citadel also owns a large amount of calls, which I would assume is to hedge.      \n&#x200b;  \nThat's all I have for you apes today, thanks for reading, and I feel as though this is required;      \nNot financial advice.", "id": "m9i1at", "created_utc": 1616279915.0, "score": 829, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 210, "comments": [{"body": "Did you really print the graph and then took a pic of it?
