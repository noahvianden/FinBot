So given two alternatives, my first question is always going to be which has the best liquidity? Then my second question is which one costs less?\n\nMissing from your stats of the two alternatives is the bid/ask spread and the volume on that contract. Those are the best indicators for liquidity. Narrow bid/ask is better liquidity. Higher volume is better liquidity. \n\nAssuming liquidity is good on both alternatives, which one costs less? All else being equal, it almost always works out best if you start with the lowest cost alternative. Most of the time, the lower cost alternative also has the lower reward, those things go hand-in-hand. But that may be an acceptable trade-off if the reward you give up translates into a reduction in costs, like it makes your holding time lower and thus a lower opportunity cost, or an increase in win rate. I'd rather win a little money most of the time than a lot of money a few times.\n\nBecause opportunity cost and theta decay are real costs, I also tend to pick the shortest holding time. That means I tend to go no further out than 60 days to expiration on any one position.\n\nSo in a situation like yours where the payoff date is uncertain but there is a good support level on value, I'd use a cheap 45 to 60 DTE call that is a good balance of risk/reward (could be anything from 55 to 30 delta) and just keep rolling it every 30 days, profit or loss. The idea is to catch the rally and you may have to pay to play by rolling for small losses until it happens.

Equity LEAPS generally have their expiration in January, so if it isn't January, it's probably not a LEAPS.\n\nOptions that expire in 6 to 9 months are most likely going to be quarterly expirations, though you may hit a monthly by coincidence. Generally, monthly expirations include the current month and the next 3 months, so anything from 0 to 3 months out is easy to get on most option chains. Between 3 and 12 months you'll only find quarterlies. For example, ignoring weeklies, the NFLX expirations are Apr, May, Jun, Jul and then a gap until the quarterly in Sep and then another gap until the LEAPS in January.\n\nGoing that far out increases up front costs, which increases your risk.\n\nSo the adjustment I would make is to use monthly expirations and stay within 3 months.

I sell a covered call at $105 strike and get a $3  premium. That means on the other side their break even price is $108.\n\nQuestion  1: Lets say the price reaches $110 before the expiration date. If the  buyer decides to exercise his right to buy the shares, does this mean  the contract is \"completed\" and it will go away and I will have given up  the 100 shares before the expiration date? Or is it that when the buyer  exercises his right he still has to wait til the expiration date to  claim the 100 shares?\n\n\\- I'm  guessing the answer to the question above is that he will have to wait  til expiration to exercise because by the expiration date it could be  OTM and the seller would keep the shares.\n\nQuestion  2: Lets say the price reaches $106. He hasn't broke even yet, and since  its almost the expiration date, it would make more sense for him to  sell a call (?) against the one he bought from me.  In order to do this  he would have to sell at the same $105 strike, but because of time decay  and some weird stuff about greeks, the premium he can get from selling a  call is $1 premium. He would lose $2 (or $200 total) -- but this would  be better than exercising and losing $200 plus extrinsic value (?). In  this scenario, because he just wanted to exit out of his call option,  would I still keep my 100 shares? (because he did not exercise, rather  just sold a call to exit his position).\n\nQuestion  3: Kinda a follow up to the above: It almost seems like unless the  buyer of the call option reaches the break even, that chances of shares  being exercised (called away) are very slim? Like if the price reached  106 or 107 it doesn't make sense to exercise until after 108.\n\nQuestion  4: Let's say im bullish on the stock. The price reaches $104 at 0 DTE. I  don't want it to reach 105 by the end of the day and get assigned. So  can I cancel out my position by buying a 105 call, wait for the day to  end, and rather than net $300, I can just net $200 profit on premiums,  but this also protects me from having my shares called away because i  cancelled out my position (just need to wait til end of the day for this  to actually happen at 0 DTE?). Then the next day I can start selling a  $110 strike for a new expiration date?\n\nQuestion 5: Why are you so awesome for answering my questions?\n\nI  guess my questions are all based on what I would have learned if I  actually traded covered calls, but I'm just trying to learn the theory  right now. Thanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What you need to understand is that there is, for all practical purposes, no buyer on the other end of your trades.\n\nThe way to think of it is like this: when you buy a call option, what you are really doing is making a deal with the OCC (the Options Clearing Corporation.)  You are paying them money (the premium,) and in exchange, they put your name on a list of people who have the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price by the expiration date.\n\nSimilarly, when you sell a call, you are really in effect receiving a payment in exchange for agreeing to have the OCC put you on the list of people who are willing to sell 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price by the expiration date.\n\nThen, when a long holder (a person on the long list) chooses to exercise, they pick a name from the short list at random and assign them.\n\nOf course, this is a gross oversimplification; there are market makers, exchanges, and brokerages, but thinking of it this way will help you to understand why certain things may or may not happen.  As a short seller you are not somehow linked to any particular long buyer.  You could get assigned at any time for any reason, and you have no idea what the particular position of the person out there in the world who is exercising is.  You need to count on getting assigned on any short options that are even 1 cent ITM at expiration.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "> Question  1\n\nIf the buyer exercised, you will be assigned on the same day and your shares called away before 11:59pm on that day. Expiration is the deadline by which the buyer has to make that decision. They don't have to wait for expiration to get their shares if they exercised 2 weeks before.\n\nNow, all that said, nearly all buyers *wait until expiration to exercise* because exercising early throws away any gains on the time value of the contract. There's essentially an early exercise cash penalty, and that penalty is 100% of the premium for OTM options. Example, when XYZ was $100 buyer bought a $120 call for $1. Two weeks before expiration XYZ is now at $119.95 and the call is worth $2. They exercise and pay $120/share to get the shares, but they lose all of the $2 value of the call also. So net net, they end up paying $122/share for shares that are only worth $119.95, a $2.05 loss per share.\n\n\n\n> Question 2: Lets say the price reaches $106. He hasn't broke even yet\n\nHow would you know if he broke-even or not? You have no idea how much that buyer paid for the contract. You trade with a market maker and then the market maker trades with someone else. If the market maker bought your contract for $3, you can bet the MM sold it to someone else for more than $3. And then that someone else might sell it back to the MM for less and then they sell it for a lot more, and around and around. The contract could have traded hands 20 times before it gets exercised, for prices ranging from $.01 to $6, and you have no idea which price ultimately was paid before exercise.\n\nThere is no point in trying to guess what the other end of the trade is going to do. It doesn't matter.\n\n> Question 3\n\nThe chances of *early* exercise are slim before expiration, because of the penalty for early exercise described above. If it is the day before or the day of expiration, chances are much higher, and if the contract is ITM after expiration, the chances are very close to 100% that the contract will be exercised.\n\n> Question 4\n\nNo, you can't \"cancel out\" your **winning CC** that way. Why would you want to? Your trade is winning! If the stock goes over 105, you should celebrate, you got the profit you selected yourself when you opened the CC and you keep all of the premium.

In order to generate $2K/month, you would need about $422k of capital. If you have $120k of capital, you can reasonably shoot for $570/month of income.

Have you watched shark tank? That’s basically the concept. Take the materials the company puts forward, decide if they sound compelling, poke holes in their bullshit, and then negotiate a price. Remember that it’s the company’s job to convince you. Don’t treat it like you have decided to invest and want to back into enough sound bites that back you up.\n\nStep 1: Go to their investor relations page and find their most recent 10-k. If the company is affected by covid you might also want to get last years 10-k and read them front to back (if they are several quarters old look at recent 10q as well). Read the business or overview section to learn about their total operations. Read their balance sheet to screen for high/low levels of cash and debt that concern you. The income statement is really important for understanding how much they make, how fast that has been increasing, and try to understand how those values compare to the discussion. It’s very important to look at their gross margins as well as their net margins after expenses. This is a measure of how hard it is to earn a dollar of profit.\n\nStep 2: Look at their investor presentations and their conference calls. The 10ks are regulated and companies can’t be too loose in what they say. But in presentations they can be more optimistic. You need to marry what the company says they hope to achieve vs what they can concretely report. If there’s a big gap, you need to determine the discount you will apply for the probability of failure.\n\nStep 3: Read the discussion and try to find the bear case. Find the Kevin in the shark tank. Maybe the company is doing everything right but their success hinges on some external factor (like Nvidias ARM acquisition getting approved). Or maybe the business arm that is well known to consumers is only 1/3 of the revenue base. Or maybe they have stopped buybacks and started diluting. There has to be a bear case and you need to hear it to decide.\n\nStep 4: Determine your desired price entry and consider where you would sell or buy more.

It includes CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, BET, CBS All Access, Pluto TV and Simon & Schuster and some others I've never heard from. Their biggest revenue comes from capable network and paid streaming services. Literally a quarter of this company is dominating the children's media market.\n\n**Why the selloff?**\n\nThis is because all of a sudden firms like Goldman Sachs and The Wall Street Bank start force selling huge chunks of stocks in block trades before the market opened on Friday. This obviously led to huge volume trading in $VIAC of 211 million, it's normal rates are at about 35 million. Now as this hot fire ball starts tumbling down the the drain it starts busting any kind of stop loss on it's way, further lowering prices. Now this shows that the selling was not driven by a technical or fundamental reason, as seen on some financial front pages. For me this suggests that the company isn't broken - only the stock.\n\nWhy the hedgies sold? Some fund managers believe the fire sales indicate that a big hedge fund or family office was in trouble.\n\n\"Maeve DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment.

Which in stock comparisons means that $VIAC should trade at around 80 and not 48.2.\n\nI also think that this is a good long term investment as its platforms like Nickelodeon and Comedy Central who are dominating the children's media market, and I don't see why this should stop anytime soon. \n\n**TLDR: Im comparisons to one of its highs on 22. march at 100.16, it went down to brutal 48.09 and its therefore completely undervalued.

The Fed is responsible for inflation in the markets since before 2010. They print into the market raising prices while controlling the CPI inflation at 2%, artificially creating wealth through the market. In fact, the rising prevalence of retail traders and the mania in the market is an effect of the policy, along with the COVID relief, both the stimulus and the aid given to companies and banks through lax Fed policies.    \n\nEdit:    \nActually, this is quite similar to the situation in Japan. However, Japan has better tax policies in order to prevent the resulting inequality in addition to cultural differences that frown upon lavish displays of wealth. The US, however, is an independent, individualistic culture, meaning everyone strives for their own wealth... Meaning that equality will come from individuals being industrious and shifting to the market of their own volition in order to capitalize on the opportunity. However, that will see the inflation that's been happening in the market, the inflation the Fed controls and ensures is disconnected from the CPI, flowing into the CPI as retail trading gains more traction.    \n\nIn general, the USD is backed by the GDP of the US as opposed to gold and other hard currencies. Which means that every cent is worth a portion of what is produced in the United States, whether it be services (employees) or food made in a diner or exports like crops. Because the United States produces a shit-ton, the USD has become the reserve currency so it his intrinsic value as a means of trade as well. Well, when more money is issued the value of other money is diluted. Though, this can be controlled by various monetary policies that control who gets the money, etc., and generally a healthy rate of inflation (meaning that a part of the GDP, the CPI) of 2% is the target to meet. How does the Fed print and dilute the value of money without inflating the price of bread to thousands of times? They put it into the market instead of giving it to consumers, who would start buying things as they get more money, increasing demand and therefore cost. The market digests the money and ensures that consumers only get enough to keep inflation in check... trickle down economics (filtered down economics). The money goes into growing companies, the wealthy, and perhaps a bit back to the government. Then, the companies try to ensure maximum profit by increasing (or controlling) production to meet demand, ensuring that their work-force is of capable quality and quantity, and growth (which is reflected in the markets).", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

{"title": "Palantir (PLTR) is a low bottom company and has become too important to fail. Here is why.", "selftext": "First of all, let's take a look at  the commercial side of its business. Currently BP and Airbus contracts are responsible for 20 percent of the PLTR's revenue and some analyst think that such high-concentration is bad. However, they said the same think about PLTR's government work when the stock debuted. In short, they said that it is very worrying that PLTR generates such a high-percentage of its revenue from the U.S government and tried to convince investors to value PLTR not as a soft company, but as a defence contractor. I am glad that I did not listen to them at that time and bought the stock at 10 dollars, cuz my thinking was that if the fcking U.S government values the PLTR's software so highly it is extremely likely that commercial businesess will do the same. Do you get where I am going? If Airbus and BP are paying the company more than 100 million dollars combined per year, then that means that PLTR's software is extremely efficient and if used right, could potentially safe customers hundreds of millions dollars of expenses or lost revenue. If you want more confirmation about how important the software could be for the business, have in mind that when partnering with the U.S agency of disease protection, there are rumours that as early as January 2020 Palantir was able to build confidential  models  that showed the potential for a rapidly rising outbreak. Palantir then rushed in mid-February to recall staff from abroad and order them into a four-week quarantine. Now imagine if you knew about this as early as PLTR. March puts for the win.\n\nEven forgetting about the software and PlTR's growing revenue, let's take a look at some other factors that can't be measured by financial modelling. Currently PLTR is the only company in the world that is in talks to receive Impact Level 6 certification from the DoD. That means that PLTR will have access to classified information. Yeah, that is the kind of information that if you share with unauthorised personnel you go to prison for commiting treason against the state. Furthermore, the marine that participated in the operation of killing Bin Laden said in his book that PLTR soft. was instrumental in the sucess of the mission. To top it off , PlTR lobbyist include figures like retired Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Terry Pau and ex- US State Secretary  Condoleezza Rais and the new Director of national intelligence in the Biden admin- Avril  Haines a former employee. Well, I think that we can say with great certainty that PLTR has become extremely important for the U.S government operations. If history has taught us anything, if the U.S government values something , it will not shy away from spending millions of taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat. But it as not only the U.S government. PLTR has won numerous contracts with government agencies of other countries like the British NHS and PlTR's head of operation in Israel- Hamutal Meridor, served as senior director of Verint, with deep ties to Unit 8200.   Unit 8200 also called Shin Bet is an Israeli Intelligence Corps *unit* of the Israel Defense Forces responsible for collecting signal intelligence (SIGINT) and code decryption. \n\nIf you are still not sure about PLTR's importance maybe you would like to know more about who is behind the company. Peter Thiel is a cofounder and the current largest shareholder. Yeah, that is right-Peter fucking Thiel. This guy  was a business associate with Elon Musk in Paypal, he was the first investor in Facebook and a mentor of Zuckerberg and is a close friend of Chamath. He also bankrupted Gawker, cuz they had the audacity to leak the news that he is homosexual. Many people believe that he is one of the most well-connected men in the world and it comes at no surprise that he is a member of The Bilderberg group ( conspiracy theorists believe that these guys control the world) . I forgot to mention that his nickname is King Midas, cuz everything that he touches turns to gold. \n\nPalantir's other cofounder and current Ceo- Alex Karp is also a pretty interesting guy to say the least.

Furthermore, as electric vehicles take off, more major structural networks (power grid, for example) are going to rise in importance and potential profitability.

{"title": "National Security risks of hedge fund over-leveraging", "selftext": "This is brushing up against politics a bit, so we'll see if it survives mod attention.\n\nWith two recent high profile incidents of hedge funds becoming irresponsibly overleveraged in the market (Melvin Capital and Archegos) and causing market wide effects, it seems worth exploring the national security implications of continued poor oversight of institutional leverage in equities markets, and the potential economic effects. \n\nWith numerous countries with adversarial relationships to the US and NATO powers having a much more managed approach to their citizens business ventures and economic output, it is not far fetched to consider that overleveraging can become a tactic of economic warfare, and a way of winning or setting advantageous conditions for wars without firing a shot. \n\nChina is the classic and most probable candidate for this, so we'll start with them as an example. Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).\n\nThe utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country's defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.\n\nThis type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict.

I’d like to share some unorthodox ideas I’ve come across this last year that have helped me to enjoy life. I’m a retard. This is literally not financial advice. I apologize to WSB for filibustering. I have a TLDR at the end, peace.\n\nHeidegger talks of this idea of “throwness” and not choosing birth. On the other hand, we are free to define ourselves because of this.\n\nNietzsche admired the Ancient Greek god Dionysus, since he was twice born and twice killed but lived passionately regardless. Nietzsche believed suffering and joy alike were meant to be embraced, that the thrill and passion of life held meaning above these. He claimed a human would rather will itself to nothingness than surrender his will entirely. Life only needed to be affirmed by the living for a single moment for the whole experience to be affirmed. He seemed to think we could just “choose to live” even if we don’t choose to be born. Some interpret Nietzsche to mean reality may ultimately be power (in an abstract, creative sense). Any experience we have empowers us and reality. Reality and our own existence is thereby endlessly empowering and generative in some way or another. We experience this power as energy, as our senses, as our abstract thoughts, and so on. ‘Tis everywhere and is everything. The greatest humans love humanity and the world for this reason: it is mutually empowering.\n\nIn the films of Stanley Kubrick, he juxtaposes birth and death frequently. In between these bookends is life, which is erotically linked to sex. The abyss of nihilism is ultimately positive: a void for endless potentials, a womb. A being should engage with this void as a phallus does a vulva. A lesson from him I take is that we should expect suffering and joy alike, but ultimately they both empower us to live intimately and live more.\n\nTLDR\nHell, read/watch/listen to any philosophical, artistic, theological work. I’d argue they all arrive at the intimate and powerful connection of the human experience to reality. It is unconditional. You only need to be conscious to enjoy that connection. Even long after you die you always will have been. What was once you becomes other things.\n\nHope you find some peace.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "As a follow up, if you have some kind of ambition to change the world for the betterment of humanity and yourself, that’s awesome.

Maybe he would have been a musician today now that music is recorded. \n\nI personally think that he “foresees” the developments that lead to the 20th century orgy of violence and hypocrisy in the name of ideologies (communism, democracy, fascism). He warns of the oncoming age of nihilism. To these ideologies millions sacrifice their own humanity and reality. They fight bloody wars. They think they are in the end of history. I think he makes a point of addressing the individual to look to art (creation) as inspiration and not subsume oneself into an ideology. \n\nNietzsche would look upon Nazism as the very worse form of “slave morality” (how the oppressed learn to want to escape reality, ultimately through its very destruction).\n\nIf Nietzsche were to favor an ideology I suppose it would be one that genuinely emphasizes growth and development. I like to think he would favor modern futurism and humanism.
