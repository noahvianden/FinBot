Played around with investing in 2020 and made big returns. I had no real idea how fragile my entire approach was until these past three weeks. Moved huge portions of my portfolio from AMZN to ARKK early January. Took out margin equal to 50+% of my NLV to buy the “dip” a few days into this cycle and in hindsight I effectively doubled down on those positions at nearly their ATH. Everybody says it’s a long game, hold it and forget it. And god I’m trying. But now I have to hold margin for all that time? That seems like fixing a terrible move with another terrible move. And ARKK isn’t just tech, it’s one of the riskiest tech ETFs out there. Why did I do that? God I feel stupid.\n\nThis is too much for someone with existing mental health problems. I have an appointment with a financial advisor later today but it’s going to take weeks/months to emotionally recover and a year/years to financially recover, best case scenario.

You'll have to buy higher leveraged puts, or just more puts to offset your losses, depending on how hard your bullish stocks will be hit during a correction. Growth stocks for example get hit much harder than bluechips.\n\nExample: If your holding shares of a bunch of small growth stocks and a market corrections occurs, S&P500 may pull back 20% and your growth stocks may pull back 70% in that same time frame. You'll have to manage your leverage and risk accordingly. You'll need to get more out of your S&P500 puts to offset your growth stock losses. This all depends on what you have in your portfolio.\n\nSomething else to think about is how to minimize your loss on your insurance puts. The plan is to have those puts incase of a market crash, and most of the time they'll expire worthless. By buying specific puts, instead of letting them expire worthless, you can sell them before expiration and re-coup some of the value, to buy another round of puts with. Of course the intention is to lose money on these puts, and just have them there incase of bad times, but you also want to lose the least amount of money on them, and still have them be able to serve the purpose they are there for, if needed.

But the issue is when the stock goes down that you are invested in because it won’t affect the Margin money, only your money. So here is an example of how it can fk you really bad. You take your $2k, and your margin $2k and buy Tesla with it. So you have $4k in Tesla. Half the money is yours, half is margin, and all the gains belong to you. When Tesla goes down, your margin always stays at $2k, so if it goes down 25%, your $2k takes the full 25% of $4k hit. So 25% of $4k is $1000, your $2k loses $1000, and margin does not lose anything. So in reality your money took a 50% hit. Hope I didn’t lose you. Now it’s possible for you to go in the negative and owe Robinhood money because of that.\n\nEdit: if I use margin, I use it in a large cap stock, that won’t swing much with the market volatility because of how big the market cap is, or I’ll use it on an option that is like a year away.

I worked 90 hours a week, got addicted to prescription amphetamines, had no life but work. \n\nI had a decent salary for the first time in my life, after starting literally from a janitor, working my way to director of operations in the span of 4 months. I was dedicated, hard working, and to be honest, I had only taken the job in the first place to avoid starving on the street.\n\nI was never given much of an opportunity in society’s workplace, because in all honesty I am a convicted felon for distribution of cocaine in my younger years, which was what I felt I had to do at the time to get out of the poverty I was born into, my goal was to be a successful investor in stocks and real estate, and attempt to live a cleaner life that I could accept and not be deeply depressed about.\n\nI started investing, chunks at a time, and made a lot of little mistakes, or had just a bit of unlucky timing that I really couldn’t avoid, and sometimes because I didn’t have the knowledge I wish I had at the time when I made many.... many life choices that have left me with nothing, over and over again. But I am still investing, and I didn’t give up, I hit my face off the pavement so many times, but kept faith in myself and my goals in life.\n\nYou learn, with trial and error and with practice. You will always make mistakes, but without them you can’t gain knowledge that you need to improve.\n\nI got in right before a big market adjustment, saw my entire life’s savings drop 80%. I bought those “dips,” thinking I could at least average down, but then it dips and dips and dips again, and you are stuck thinking about how you wish you would have waited til that next dip, or the next one... damn. How crazy that one day, or in some cases waiting an hour or missing an opportunity because this time you decide to wait, and it was the wrong move... fuck!!! Fuck!!!!\n\nHere is the thing though. Every great investor has had to survive a crash, several actually. Every great investor has failed, has had regrets, and has analyzed every decision they did make as well as all of the scenarios they could have chosen. \n\nYou can dwell on that shit, or roll with it. And with this game, there is no time to dwell. Sometimes you just have to suck it up and hold til it comes around.. and sometimes that takes longer than we would like, probably most of the time. But if you look at the market, and you zoom out on the chart a bit, you’ll see that stock has went up and down before, and unless you picked a dead beat company on a whim with no DD and research, you should be hopeful that it will come back around. It always has. Look at powerhouse companies like Apple, or Tesla right now as it has sank tremendously from the all time highs of not so long ago. But, Apple, Tesla, hell even GameStop came back around from next to nothing. You will come back from it too. If you are out of funds, set some limits that you would be happily to sell at and go figure out other things in life that bring you happiness.\n\nThe days are long if you watch the ticker every second, and it’s hard not to when you are down big, believe me. But have faith in your choices if you made them with confidence originally. ARKK getting hit heavy right now from the tech sell off... and because it is based on innovation and the success of new technologies and ideas, there will be some volatility... but don’t hate yourself because you got in at a bad time. 6 months earlier, you’d be fat and happy on a pile of tendies from ARKK, and this conversation with yourself probably wouldn’t have happened. But what’s to say if you had done that, you wouldn’t have gotten over confident, and pissed it away on something else? Things happen, for reasons, or maybe just because, but when they happen you better be willing to learn, and accept it for what it is, because it ain’t gonna change after it’s done. \n\nThis is a test of your resolve, and I feel that if you have enough awareness to understand what you could have done better, and what you have done wrong... and wanting to improve, well, that is a fantastic start. \n\nIt’s hard to hold and forget, impossible to me. Because I am thinking about how I can improve for the next time I get an opportunity, and in my life, opportunities are rare and when you fuck one up it is the worst. So I’m not saying forget it, I’m saying, understand that all you may be able to do right now is wait it out, but that provides you an opportunity to evaluate what you want to do next, in the market and in life, and i am feeling bullish that you will be able to overcome this, probably multiple times, and likely will have some great advise to give the next generation of investors. That is gain. That is gain in life, which is far more valuable than any stock. So stay strong my friend. Get excited about your next attempt while you wait, and try to spend a little more time working on other parts of yourself that you have the time for while you are waiting to get your money right again. Don’t give up. Don’t forget, but grow. You can always gain every day, regardless if your stocks mirror that. That is your choice, and I repeat, I am bullish for your future.\n\nBe proud of yourself for the attempt. Taking some losses on an ETF is a lot better investment than YOLOing on drugs and going to prison. You are smarter than you probably think, and to reach out shows wisdom, not weakness. Be proud of that, and keep your chin up. Things can literally always be worse, and in a year or two, you’ll be saying yeah, I made a bad call back in early 21, but i turned it into a lesson and from that, became a better investor, who gets better and better at realizing what, when, where, and why to make certain moves. \n\n\nI’d imagine you’ll be comforting some kid who just lost on a reasonable ETF from unfortunate timing, telling him or her the story about how you went from panicked, depressed, and uncertain to become a much better investor, and you’ll have the gains to prove it. \n\nJust hold and forget it you’ll be saying, with a chuckle, remembering back to how those words were so hard to hear at the time.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you.

Please and thank you.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Powell can buy bonds to keep the yield low, which increases the value of equities. We saw the 10yr yield spike suddenly up to 1.6% a few weeks ago, which made investors scared that Powell had 'lost control'--basically, that the market had decided that inflation would happen and that yields would increase, no matter what Powell did. This is particularly important because 1.6% is above the S&P dividend yield, which triggers mutual funds to start selling equities and start buying bonds. A gradual increase in the yield is fine, and we've been hovering at around 3% for a few years now--but a sudden spike is 'scary'. In particular, a sudden increase in inflation is even worse, because that can lead to hyperinflation, which can destroy a modern economy. As long as the yield increases slowly, investors will settle down and equities will grow at a more healthy, slow pace. \n\nAs Powell has said many times, though, the real concern is deflation. The whole reason for keeping yields low for the last several years was because the inflation rate was below the 2% target--meaning we had too much deflation. This is due to technological innovation, which tends to decrease the prices of goods (leading to less spending, as people know prices will be lower in the future). Deflation can get even worse during a crisis, as spending slows, and stores drop prices to encourage buying. So I personally think that we \\*need\\* to overcompensate with inflation, get it to about 3% or so, before the Fed backs off, because otherwise we could have a stalled economy moving forward (less spending means stores hire fewer people, which leads to lower employment, which is the Fed's real focus).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the response. I assume bond yield here is interest payment / bond price? Or simply the coupon rate?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It effectively means the bond price. For US bonds, the coupon payment is essentially 'fixed', and the price you pay for it determines the effective yield. Just like in stocks, paying too much hurts your effective yield. My understanding is that in Europe, it's reversed--they fix the price of the bonds and just try to sell as many as possible in a given auction, rather than let the price float.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "OK, so if bond yield increases, then that means bond prices are dropping (from sell off). I'm puzzled how would that have an effect on tech stocks sell off, though? Thanks for being patient with me, I'm just trying to piece everything together.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Oh no worry, it's complicated, and the logic isn't perfect (which is why the market is quite volatile right now). The reasoning is as follows: with any stock, you're paying a price for the right to a share of the future earnings. To determine the fair price of the stock, you compare the future earnings of the company you expect to the return you could get in a 'safer' place, like a US Treasury bond. You anticipate a higher return from stocks, in 'compensation' for the higher risk, but you still need to determine a fair price which compares the expected returns from the two asset classes. There are various formulas you can use to determine this fair price. \n\nIf the yield from the 'safer' investment increases, it makes the value of the future earnings of the company less valuable. For example, let's say I offered you $100 ten years from now, if you give me $50 now. To know if that's a good deal or not, you'd need to know how much that $50 would be worth in some other (safer) investment. If you had a savings account that offered 10%/yr, you'd get $130 after 10 years, so you wouldn't take my offer. But if that savings account only offered 5%, suddenly my offer seems more attractive. \n\nSo a rising yield will generally hit all stocks, but it will really hit stocks whose worth is mostly in the 'future'; i.e. companies whose current earnings are small compared to their estimated future earnings. This tends to be 'tech' stocks, which often have low or negative earnings while they expand, and tend to grow much faster than other types of companies. So that's why rising yields will hit tech stocks hardest. \n\nThere are several other factors that complicate this--the fact that tech stocks were already quite high before the yield increased, the fact that many of the alternatives to tech stocks have their own problems, the fact that companies' earnings will also tend to increase with inflation, and the fact that yields will not increase forever (as yields increase, more people will buy bonds, eventually creating an equilibrium).

The bond market is huge, twice as large as the stock market. He can buy a lot, and keep putting pressure to reduce yields, but there need to be some other buyers to keep the yields really low. In a perfect world, there would be so many buyers of bonds that the yields would stay low without needing the Fed at all. \n\nWell...actually, in a perfect world the yields would be very high, and we could all just buy risk-free bonds without ever having to deal with the stock market...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "OK, so when Powell buys up the bonds that would increase the price of bonds (due to higher demand - econ 101), and thus that would reduce the bond yields.

While the market may have not dropped all too much. I know a few of my favorite swing trades were down \\~50% or more, which would have been terrible for anyone holding all the way down. Furthermore many of the people trading today are new to this (assumption since a great many started trading since the lockdowns started) and have not yet developed hedging strategies. Or they get scared by the news, and as you mention it's circulated frequently, so they start selling everything -not understanding you only need to dump the risky positions. \n\nIt also takes time and exposure to markets to understand that no matter the market condition, the people in office, fed policy, etc. -there is always an opportunity to make gains somewhere -even if that means just enough to minimize losses on other positions. And it takes experience to truly understand that markets do fluctuate. Sure, everyone knows this. But I don't think many people truly **understand** how frequent this occurrence is. I watched stock markets for years (news is religion) before I started trading. Even having known that fluctuations happen, and experiencing them in hypothetical Excel portfolios, it was difficult going through them the first few times when real money became involved. Or experiencing the first big loss on a bad investment... it really stings at first. Personally I think many of the newcomers who enjoy markets will learn to tolerate this and grow to become good investors/traders.\n\nI should note that I also think many people forget to leave cash aside. Anyone paying attention to sectors outside tech would have seen great opportunities to hedge against losses. BP, Marathon, Murphy Oil, Diamondback, Devon Energy, Halliburton... take your pick, but any one of them would have covered most of this weeks losses. Even without cash laying aside, this was the perfect  time to reduce exposure to tech and shift to oil. MRO calls were ridiculously cheap and just printing money. Similarly SQQQ calls are extremely cheap and an amazing choice for minimizing losses when you expect to have many red days (got puts against it for next week now).\n\nBut I made a few mistakes myself. For one I held ARK funds about -15% from peak. Should have dumped them at -10% because of all the negative news and bought back sometime this week. I also let Sunrun bring me down thinking I would hold one of the tickers that helped build my portfolio (had a little emotional attachment there and it hurt my overall progress, but luckily I dumped it before it got too bad). But it was among my more risky plays and I should have swapped it for one of my safe plays sooner. \n\nAll in all, I'm not too disappointed bc my tech heavy portfolio is used to this madness. I ended going down from +176% to +90% ALMOST HALF MY GAINS (it shouldn't have been so bad, but I made a terrible day trade on the wrong day last week... whoops). But this is also my favorite part of my progress graph, after each retraction the bounce back back is like a slingshot. I always correct more than the NASDAQ because of certain tech exposure, but recover much faster and so much more significantly. And in the little over 2 years I've been trading I'm still far outperforming NASDAQ, more than 2x the performance of S&P, and more than 3x the DOW. I think newcomers will start to pay attention more to long term progress once they establish a lengthy track record. Except the ones who just like to YOLO their accounts...

I Have been investing since I was 16, so 30 years!  Been through a lot of crash's and made a lot of quick bad decisions. \n\nI lost a lot of money in Worldcom in 2000, problem there:  \n\nI held to the end and had too much invested there.\n\n had 70,000 shares of NVDA in 2012 I bought for about 10$ and sold out at 11 after a scary dip.  My problem there\n\nhad 10,000 shares of apple and sold those early. \n\nI would have been a multimilionaire just by letting either of these ride for 10 years but I sold because I was scared when it tanked and needed the money, so I could not afford to loose it. (wish I would have just left it alone)!  who knew!\n\n=All eggs invested in one basket will  freak you out on declines and lead to panic, (wish I would have just left it alone)!  who knew!\n\nTwo of the best lessons:  \n\n1.  Only invest waht you can afford to keep invested and, if you have a winning trade and want to let it ride, take out your profits and leave your original investment in to ride.  If you use margin, only margin up 20% and for short periods of time, days-a couple of weeks at most.\n2. DIVERSIFY: The stock market is the biggest financial market in the world.  There is not just one stock that will work.   I constantly invested everying into one stock and, naturally, when it went down, it was painful.  GME was a great trade but, if you constantly play the get rich on one stock game, your are apt to loose.  Even with 10K or 1K you can diversity like funds to with 5.10% allocated to different stocks, with mix of high-low beta. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe worst is to be over extended at any time, because that's when you can't resist to sell.  As several guys pointed out, even Buffett, market always comes back over time.  Now, if you are in for a trade, don't get too greedy.   I was up 400% form last march on 100K up to 10 days ago.  Now I am up 200% but I am heavily diversified into tech, energy and commodity stocks.  All my investments, even the tech one's have what I would call, instinsic value, real earning and real P\\\\E's, (not to popular) and dvidends.  \n\nMade money shorting hospitality and long on consumer staples like Beer & wine from march to June last year.   I then started loosing money because I did not believe in this market, realised I was fighting the trend and switched to long strategy and been happy thus far. \n\nTrading takes a toll, remember the woolf of wall street!  It's stressful and can destabilize you quickly.  You need an iron stomach to be down 100 or 200K or 1K, whatever you size is, and remain firm.  \n\nSENTIMENT:  This is what drives the market in the short-medium term.  When goog news and bad news is good news, don't fight the market.  When it starts to change, you will perceive it.   WHen that happens, you need to get more conservative, not get out completly.  If you are trading, you will never win on every trade, the goal is to have a 60% batting average and keep batting.\n\nThe market may correct more, it will certainly be choppy, not going back up in a straight line but, I suspect, we will reach new highs this year.  Remember, when they talk about the bubble of 2000-2001, they were saying it was overvalued in 1997 and it took 3 years to pop.

For certain securities, I made several separate trades and ultimately closed my position at an overall net loss, but the wash sales accrued along the way exceeded this total loss. So, RH added that wash sale amount to the security's net gain/loss, which brought the total to a profit (because the wash sale loss was greater than the realized loss), even though I didn't make profit on any single trade.\n\nI was at an overall net loss for the year, so I can see that the amount of total wash sale losses were deducted from my overall loss, bringing it to a much lower amount, but still a loss. I'm a bit concerned for the 2021 tax return, because I expect to be at a net gain, but I will have accrued a ton of wash sales because I wasn't aware of them until a few weeks ago. Let's say I'm at a $1k net gain for the year, but I accrued $8k of wash sales. Based on how RH calculates and reports wash sales, does that mean the wash sale loss will be reported as profit, and I will be taxed against $9K vs. $1k?\n\nI thought wash sales could only be applied when there's an overall loss, not calculated as actual gains for each security, which are then added together for the taxable net gain/loss. Since moving to other broker accounts (that provide more transparency with purchase history and violations such as wash sales), it looks like they don't calculate wash sales in the same way RH does, e.g. I accidentally did a wash sale in Fidelity earlier this week, and Fidelity automatically adjusted my cost average basis to account for the wash sale.\n\nHas anyone else using RH looked into this with tax returns/wash sales? I'm just trying to determine if there's an issue with RH's calculation method or if I'm just an idiot that doesn't understand wash sales.\n\nEdit to add: I just realized too that RH duplicates the wash losses reported. The total net gain/loss for each security is added up to reflect the overall net gain/loss that’s taxed. RH then applies the total wash loss sales to this overall net gain/loss, even though that total is already based on amounts that have the wash sales applied. What am I missing here?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Each wash sale is an independent event. Wash sales are not \"added together\" at all. The loss is just carried forward to the cost basis of the replacement shares.\n\nThe only effect a wash sale has is that it postpones your ability to claim the loss until the year you sell the replacement shares. It does this by not counting the loss at all (the reason you see the wash sales deducted from your total loss) and then adding the per-share loss to the cost basis of your replacement shares.\n\nFor example... Suppose I have 100 shares of XYZ bought at $10. At some later date, I buy 100 more at $15. A week later, the stock price drops to $5 and I sell 100 shares. Assuming FIFO, my original 100 shares were sold at a loss of $5/share and the new shares I bought become replacement shares. The $5/share loss on the first lot is disallowed and added to the cost basis of the replacement shares, giving them a $20/share cost basis. Now the price rises to $10 and I close my position entirely. Since my adjusted cost basis was $20, I can claim a $10/share loss on those shares. Now suppose I FOMO back in a week later at $15. That $10/share loss gets disallowed and added to the cost basis of the new replacement shares, so they have a cost basis of $25/share. If I later sell them at $20, I still have a $5/share loss. If I later sell them at $30, I'd have a $5/share gain.\n\nSince you say you closed all your positions in 2020, the total gain/loss should be correct. Add up the total proceeds from share sales and subtract the total amount you spent to buy the shares to check if you like.\n\nEdit to add: You asked about \"adding together\" the wash sale losses, but I forgot to address that part. It's correct. Suppose you had a wash sale loss of $1000, then another wash sale loss of $500, then another for $2000. Your disallowable losses are $3500, but since all of those are disallowed (transferred to the new cost basis), you'll see them deducted from your total losses. Total losses, disallowed losses, and allowable losses should all be shown on your 1099B.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Yes this is exactly how I thought it worked, but it is not how RH goes about reporting and calculating wash sales, so I’m kind of at a loss here.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't use Robinhood, but if they're reporting it differently, they're not in compliance with IRS regs.

My take as a new investor is that is not the best idea. Now you have probably heard that stocks only go up. Which is mostly a meme with WSB but ultimately long term it is true. It depends on how you want to trade. If you want some mid term or short term money(6-12 months) maybe you are a more active trader but if not you can invest certain amounts each month into safe slow growing funds or indexes that will generate around 8-10% percent a year varying. Don’t make stocks your life either. Don’t be checking every hour because it can become very mentally taxing. Don’t check every hour but make sure to do good research on stocks before you buy into them. Make sure the company is stable and has good potential.

I’m sure this is common knowledge to many, but for me, this is the type of thing I only learn by diving in. \n\n**Right up front TL;DR:** ***If you sell at a loss, and purchase back at a similar price, the taxable loss will be rolled back into the cost basis of your shares as a “wash adjustment” and will permanently raise the price per share of the shares you purchased. Be aware of this.*** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recently panic sold some of my long-position shares at the beginning of this downturn. My rationale was this: If the price of these shares is going to drop below my original entry point (cost basis) anyways, I may as well sell for some small profits before it drops below, then I will buy back in at a similar/lower price and not only realize gains, but strengthen my position. I still feel good about my logic. \n\nHowever, I did not have all of the educations needed to make a good decision. I hope to help others to not make the same mistake. \n\nMy prediction was right. I sold for some small profits (around 1k, after being up much more than that) and the next day the cost dropped almost 20% lower than my original entry point several months earlier. \n\nSo, I bought back in with small increments along the dip (not all at once) and acquired lots of shares slightly above, at, and below my original entry point. I felt quite proud of my decision and trusting my intuition an research / charting. \n\nI did this to find, however, that after purchasing these lots, they price of my shares was automatically adjuster to a higher cost basis, displaying a small ‘W’ icon that read “wash sale adjustment’. \n\nI now know that due to an IRS regulation, if you sell a company at a loss, and the buy it again within 30 days, the amount of the loss is rolled back in to the cost of the shares when you re-purchase, thereby automatically increasing your cost per share. \n\nSo, in short, I sold thousands of shares between $3.50 and $3.60 for some profits on my original positions, however, some were at a loss. I had lots ranging from $3.11 to $4.00 per share. My total cost average was $3.49/share.\n\nWhen I purchased the shares back from $3.60 down to the floor of $3.19, the shares I purchased that were similar to those that I took a loss on were automatically adjusted up to over $4.00 per share. Now I’m holding thousands of shares at over $4.00 when I bought them at $3.50 and lower due to this IRS rule.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "yeah, but if your cost per share is increased, it reduces the capital gain in the future.\n\nso let's say you bought a stock at $3, but wash sale rules tack on $1, making your cost $4.\n\nif you sell the stock at $4.50 in the future, your capital gain would just be $0.50, no?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.

The daily emails and announcements from Ark Invest are just a marketing gimmick.", "score": -5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "**Don't get attached to a stock. And don't be afraid to sell for a loss. There is no such thing as** ***locking in*** **a loss.**\n\nThis is why you need to have an opinion and a theory of the case if you're going to be trading. If you want your money to just grow and grow overtime, by all means, invest it, delete the app and don't look for 30 years or whatever.\n\nBut this notion about **locking in a loss** is bullshit. This idea of averaging down is bullshit. You should have a theory about the market and act accordingly -- otherwise, what are you even doing playing the market?\n\nIf a stock you're invested in goes down, do you have an opinion why it went down? If you think it's a general market freak out and it's likely to rebound quickly, then don't do anything. You'll make your money back soon and you're more likely to lose money if you try and time things.\n\nIs your stock going down because of a reason you can actually articulate? Bad news? Was it overpriced where you bought it? **Don't be afraid to sell for a loss.** The money is already gone. I know it feels more *real* if you sell when it's down but that's just mental bullshit. Your current position in reality, is no different then if you'd just bought that stock right now. The previous price doesn't matter -- especially in the current market. Ask yourself, would you buy the stock now, at this price, given what you know? If the answer is no -- then sell.\n\nLet's look at **ARKK** as an example. Say you bought in at the recent high, $159, for 100 shares. Total investment, $15,900 on Feb. 16. Then, a few days later, after a week of sliding, you see the video about Cathie Wood getting her stock picks from Jesus and get freaked about the stock.  But -- you don't want to sell because now it's at $138 and you've lost $2100 already.\n\nIn this example, the question you should be asking yourself here is, would you buy in at this price, with what you know. Do you have some expectation that the stock is going to climb at a rate faster than other investments you could be making? If you sold, you'd have taken a $2100 loss. If you held, your investment would be today worth $11,700 -- down $4200 from your original buy in.\n\nSay you did sell. And now you think the stock is fairly priced at $117 and expect to rally in the days ahead. You can buy back in -- improving your position, because now you can buy 117 shares.\n\nIn this situation, ARKK still needs to climb back up from $117 to $159 for you to get your money back. Do you have a reason to think that's going to happen? Do you have an idea of what a good target price for the stock is? Do you think ARKK is the best place to put for $11,700 to increase it's value? The answer for ARKK may be yes to all these questions, don't get hung up on this particular example. It's just something you should be looking at and considering for everything you're holding. \n\nPeople act like there is a cost to getting in and out of a position these days.  There isn't.

The bond yield spike wasn't even likely caused by inflation worries but rather unwinding of massive hedge positions bought during the pandemic bond boom. Problem was the rate at which those positions were unwound caused a liquidity squeeze in the bond market which set of a whole chain reaction that people are interpreting as inflationary concerns. The bond sell-off became a momentum trade, magnifying the original spike into a huge rout that -still- has no basis in reality.\n\nI'm fully expecting yields to decline a little here as people accept that real inflation is going to remain below targets and real yields are going to remain negative until things change drastically.

Why? Because the goal is to stimulate the economy and increase inflation to 2% (even a bit higher would be acceptable).\n\nThe backdrop of this is the Covid pandemic. When and if it becomes controlled, you'll get the bust following the boom that is now being actively fueled. \n\nI'm not being a doomsday prophet when I say inflation is coming.

I think we will actually see transitory inflation prints of up to 4% in the strongest months of the coming boom. However I actually think we will struggle to keep inflation over 2% as there is another whole swath of changes happening under the covers of the job market and economy that are inherently deflationary.\n\nFirst of which is wage growth and how that relates to technological and other changes brought on by the pandemic. Remote work has fueled an exodus out of high cost of living areas and has created a temporary net increase in spending power for those fortunate enough to make these moves without taking a pay cut. Unfortunately the long term effect of this is companies will likely lean into this and see if they can hire more folk from lower cost of living areas or even lower cost countries at an increasing rate. This will depress wage growth and act as a powerful deflationary force.\n\nThe remote work aspect also forces another set of important changes in digitisation of workplaces that is likely to further increase efficiencies and drive down costs. This has already been happening for a long time and has been the largest contributor to the very low inflationary environment. However I see it accelerating at a rate never seen before. If you take a look at the forecasted numbers for IT spending into 2024 (this is what is driving up ORCL, HPE, CSCO, etc) it should become clear just how drastic this change is going to be.\n\nSo while I agree there will be some inflation I also think it's a) good and b) very short term.

Compare it to the original roadster. Do you think the other car companies are full of idiot engineers?

Can't speak on behalf of Tesla obviously, but I believe they're focused a bit more on the technology side of things and they may see that fixing EV related components can be easily done vs getting technology right.\n\nIn terms of what i believe they're far ahead in, it's mainly autonomous. And that's largely in part to what they have planned in the next decade (or more, when it comes to fruition), to create an autonomous taxi network. At least for urban cities such as NYC, imagine you no longer had to even own a car, and instead you could hail an autonomous cab to go to work or anywhere really, for a small fraction of what it costs to own a car. Kind of like uber, but much, much cheaper since they won't require a driver. However, to create this autonomous taxi network, they HAVE to get it right. And the key to doing this is collecting as much data on autonomous driven miles as possible so that their AI can figure out how to best navigate a car on autopilot in every situation possible and lower the risk of a serious accident. Think about all the different scenarios on the road. Picture yourself on the highway, you want to switch lanes, but what if some asshole 100m+ behind, in the lane that you want to merge onto, is speeding at, idk 150 miles an hour? If Tesla decided to merge onto that lane without it detecting that asshole, boom serious accident. Their cars only have a certain radius right now but there are just so many situations on the road that the only way to lower the risk is to put the car through every situation possible (and yes, even accidents unfortunately) so that the AI learns about it. Now again - Tesla is already at over 2 billion miles of autonomous data collected, no one else even comes close. Tesla's pretty much 10 laps ahead of second place, and that's where they'll continue to dominate. \n\n>What I find fascinating is that everyone talks about the holy grail of machine learning and AI.

They're a huge key to building our future and will most definitely be relevant. \n\nHaving said all this though, a lot of Tesla's valuation is riding on their potential, not where they are currently. Is that hurting futures? Yea, maybe. But Tesla is most definitely a leader not only in EVs themselves, but a global shift to clean energy. In other words, some change-the-world type shit that deserves a high, high premium. Now, the stock is definitely a bit overvalued if you're talking about the present, which is why we're seeing huge correction in tech sector right now with the whole sector being traded on ridiculous P/E and valuations, but Tesla is just too important to our future that it's pretty unsurprising why some, like Cathie Wood placed such a high PT on it a few years back.

(Which can be a powerful force too, no doubt about it.)\n\nAnd if you insist on going out 5-10 years (most analysts only go 2-4 years to determine price targets) there's another discounting factor: the very high beta (volatility) of TSLA will return to the mean, which is a benefit to the DCF discount rate.\n\nOn the flip side there's possibly some negative DCF factor from TSLA's recent volatility - i.e. if quant models discount-value some growth equities based on their observed historic volatility then TSLA got even worse in that metric LOL.\n\n> And Teslas positive cash-flows are years away,\n\nThat's factually wrong: in 2020 Tesla generated **$5.94B** cash from operations.

The hard part of building EV's profitably at scale is the EV technology, IE the batteries, charging, efficiency, and the software. Don't sweat the little stuff (much of which Tesla can address with a mobile service visit or OTA updates) and focus on what really matters for mass producing EV's at a scale of millions per year. In that area, no one is even close to Tesla yet and it doesn't seem like any of them will catch up for at least 3-5 years, by which point Tesla will be one of the major automakers. They'll have achieved that, it should be mentioned, by never making a single gas car and in only a 20 year timespan. No automaker has ever grown this fast and none except Tesla have ever made or sold half a million or more pure EV's in a year.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The best response.  Thank you!

I believe all or most of those are covered under warranty. Tesla can always improve and do better on these details before leaving the factory so instances like this become fewer, but it's important to zoom out and look at the bigger picture and history when comparing to legacy companies overall.\n\nThe way Tesla approaches being an automaker is quite a bit different. Much of what they do is in-house and a novel approach in the industry compared to legacy competitors. If Toyota or Chevy wants to do adaptive cruise, lane keeping, auto high beams or wipers, or even seats, they buy off the shelf components from suppliers and bolt them on. These different features may work pretty well, but there's little or no integration between them and no way to fix or improve them without expensive service for parts and labor. Since franchise dealerships make most of their money from service and legacy automakers make most of their profit selling parts to their out of warranty ICE fleet, they seem to like their longstanding status quo. Changing away from their legacy model is going to be a long, painful process and some may not survive the transition. Big, legacy companies don't often pivot easily or well. \n\nTesla is all about designing and building hardware and software from the ground up in-house to solve old and new problems and make a future-proofed product. They integrate hardware and software throughout the car and throughout the company, from manufacturing to service, at a level no other automaker is set up to do currently. They don't even buy enterprise software for things like ERP, they write their own. Because Tesla does things that way, they can push out software updates to improve features and reduce service needs over time. They take the camera and radar and sonar data from around the car and do everything from wiping the windshield to changing lanes to stopping at lights and more. They put in quality electronics that are built to last, particularly the driving computer and high voltage systems. Their service is highly integrated into their manufacturing, so found problems can be addressed quickly at the factories. Their mantra is the best service is no service, of course meaning they'd rather make sure you don't need service to begin with. \n\nI would say 2003-2011 was crawl, 2012-2019 was walk, and now they are up and running full speed this decade.

If you took half of the theater and turned it into a quarter for private rooms for streamers, and a quarter for Esports arenas, I would say okay this might have some growth. Speculatively gaming is a $60 billion market in the USA and over $200 billion world wide. I am not sure what movie you saw recently that you really enjoyed but I can say it's been a long time for me. It seems as if every movie I have seen recently is a revamp of an older movie. Meanwhile I have played several games I thoroughly enjoyed recently. CyberPunk 2077 (yes many glitches, storyline was great though), RDR2, Doom Eternal, Ghost of Tsushima just to name a few and that is just what I enjoyed. Sure some of those games are revamps but at least I feel engaged. I think we are phasing into a new era of media. When I see movie stars being featured in video games it confirms my bias. I think older generations struggle with this concept (29 year old software engineer btw). It also does not help that direct to streaming is cutting out the need to go to the theater. So if there is a movie I do particularly want to see I will get the best seat in the house, my house. And the cheapest best snacks, because they're mine and I bought them cheap at the store of my choosing.

J-Pow is saying fuck your Calls.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/03/04/not-at-all-likely-us-will-reach-maximum-employment-this-year-fed-chair-powell/?sh=5efd5836342c](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2021/03/04/not-at-all-likely-us-will-reach-maximum-employment-this-year-fed-chair-powell/?sh=5efd5836342c)\n\n\" Asked about the risks that inflation and overheating pose to the larger economy, Powell doubled down on previous statements and reiterated that the Fed does not plan to adjust its policy until it sees significant evidence of maximum employment in the labor market, among other conditions. \"It’ll take some time to get there,” he said, noting that inflation is also running well below the Fed’s 2% target\"\n\n**Section 1: \"HyPeR-iNfLaTiOn Is CoMiNg!\"**\n\nLet's go back to some basics. Thanks to our current banking system, we live in a debt-based society where our goal is to pull out a loan for 5% interest and make 420.69% gains. Now everyone wants to be a chad with an infinite money glitch trying to compete for the same slices of pie, so now we have a problem. For example, I have 100 tendies and you have 100 bananas and we decide a 1:1 tendie to banana rate is nice and life is good. All of a sudden, fucking Chad McDonkeyKong says he has 200 bananas and he wants to trade with me. So now we have 300 bananas in circulation and only 100 tendies. I now agree that the exchange rate is 1:3 tendies to bananas and now you're down 66% on your banana trade. Fucking Chad...\n\nThat's inflation for you. More money is added into circulation, and therefore you need **more** of it to buy the same goods.\n\nNow let's say your girlfriend gets pissed at Chad McDickFace for putting too many bananas in the banana market (why would she? LOL), so he pulls out 100 bananas. Now with 200 bananas in circulation and 100 tendies, the exchange rate is 1:2 tendies to bananas. Guess who just made tendies? Fuck ya you did! Now you're only down 50% from when Chad entered the market.\n\nThat's deflation for you. Money is removed from circulation and there you need **less** of it to buy the same goods.\n\nYa, I know that already, retard! Get to the point!\n\nIf we look at the US's monetary base (blue) and the Fed's balance sheet (red) you can clearly see there's a lot more bananas in circulation. INFLATION!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ https:\\/\\/fred.stlouisfed.org\\/graph\\/fredgraph.png?g=BD97 ](https://preview.redd.it/byg73jfjq5l61.png?width=1172&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cdc3a23e2d2d93e3ff67cf9d6e002a692c01ab8)\n\nNot quite... Economists use CPI (consumer price index) to collect information about pricing on goods, services and loans in the economy. It's got some flaws, but it's been reliable enough to account for inflation for the last few hundreds of years, so we'll stick with this as our metric.\n\n📷\n\n[https:\\/\\/fred.stlouisfed.org\\/series\\/CPIAUCSL ](https://preview.redd.it/70x1uc5mq5l61.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1709cc0c82bca3175bdf7005a4eede84bcc4546)\n\nSee that majestic Big Black ~~Dick~~ Arrow? We call that steady inflation and the Fed like's this around 2% Year over Year (YoY) for \"optimal market and economic growth and stability\". I recall hearing 2 - 3% is about the average that most growing societies experienced as well, so it seems like a sweet spot for us humans to operate. So what does it mean? In order to stay ahead of all the new Chads pulling out loans and YOLO'ing you need to increase your net worth by **at least** this amount per year. Real returns are when you factor in taxes on assets/gains and this tend to lower it.\n\nAnyhow, let's see what the data says about inflation and QE:\n\n[ https:\\/\\/fred.stlouisfed.org\\/graph\\/?g=BDaG ](https://preview.redd.it/79fs8lgoq5l61.png?width=1169&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a566069f3ccb24f657d776c885b679d4c740fc2)\n\nWe're just special, what about China!?\n\n[https:\\/\\/fred.stlouisfed.org\\/series\\/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#0 ](https://preview.redd.it/jlnijwdrq5l61.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=13fe8840c575abf538f8562df8a684d393d97a05)\n\nNot great, Japan?\n\n[https:\\/\\/fred.stlouisfed.org\\/series\\/JPNCPIALLMINMEI ](https://preview.redd.it/vs7ergfuq5l61.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&s=78ed3799faad9b03c3116fd3d9f8125b58a9d5d2)\n\nEuropoors!?\n\n📷\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.investing.com\\/economic-calendar\\/core-cpi-317 ](https://preview.redd.it/sznbwvcyq5l61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=346a935d4fe4b0f59527850719d1d655e15f3989)\n\nMeh...?\n\n**Section 2: ThIs TiMe Is DiFfErEnT**\n\nOkay, so what the fuck?? We're on 4 rounds of QE and no hyper inflation... I thought the FED was an infinite money glitch? So how does this QE, infinite money pinata work?\n\nFirst of all, **QE IS A SUM ZERO EXCHANGE.** It's primary objective is to drive interest rates on treasury securities to 0% and thereby decrease interest rates the bank can loan at (home loans, credit card loans, etc...). So how does it work?\n\nIt's something like this. Primary dealer (bank?) goes to the bond market, looking for some tendies. Normally they would only buy $10 worth of tendies, but Papa JPow is mother fucking huuuungray, so they buy $60 worth of tendies each time they go shopping. This is fine if the bond market had infinitely supply, but it doesn't (the US will only be issue so much debt), so each time the supply gets shrunk a little bit. So over time, we'll start to see a supply shortage (remember, bonds are retarded, so **when the price goes up, interest rates and yields go down.** Fucking magic). JPow is trying to forcing a MOTHER FUCKING SUPPLY SHORTAGE in bond market.\n\nSo what's JPow doing with these gay bonds? See, daddy JPow is worried that these little bitch ass banks (JPM, WFC, etc...) are going to go full retard again, like in 2008, so he's shoving all these bonds in safes and locking that shit up until we're back to normal. In exchange for the $50 tendies, he's giving these ass hats $50 cash so they can keep jerking each other off, as long as they don't YOLO it into the markets and economy, life is good. Daddy JPow also knows he can keep doing this QE trick until bond prices go to infinity, but negative interest rates are kind of a pain to deal with...\n\nNow, at the same time these smaller banks aren't as retarded as we think they are, and they also don't want to fail like in 2008 and they've learned a thing or two. Sure Papa JPow can throw money at them again, but he already locked up some of their fun money and he was pretty pissed last time. So, the easiest thing to do right now is buy these dumb ass bond for cheap and sell them to daddy JPow for some easy gains. They also know many of us are fucked without jobs, so why even risk lending right now?\n\nSo banks are buying bonds, JPOW has a safe, and banks aren't lending... Nothing new here...\n\nWell, the take away here is that all that money JPow is printing is STUCK in the banks and the banks don't want to lend it out. A good way to show this is the M2 Velocity, which shows how many times money changes hands before money is destroyed. It's like this: Monkey A borrows banana from Chad McShittyAss. Monkey A buys tendies off Monkey B. Monkey B gives banana back to Chad. In this case, the banana went from C -> A -> B -> C. Since Chad created the banana and destroyed the banana, he doesn't count, in the transaction, so it's just A & B that matter. In this case the M2 velocity would be 2.0. Now let's look at how QE affects us:\n\n[https:\\/\\/fred.stlouisfed.org\\/graph\\/?g=BDgP ](https://preview.redd.it/plzgaux0r5l61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=aca546e26a8055786997e2da50e5ba60423d15e3)\n\nWe're currently sitting at an abysmal 1.13 in the M2V right now, compared to an average of 1.76 we from the 60's until the 90's. So that means people aren't spending. **We're in a dollar shortage.**\n\nWell, no shit! We can't go anywhere and buy shit!!\n\nYep and to top it off, banks are still not lending with all that jerk off money they got from Papa JPow. Any time the Blue line is above the black one, it means **banks are tightening lending restrictions.** As you can see, banks are still tightening their lending right now. Smart people are paying off debt right now, but **this destroys money** in the process.\n\n[https:\\/\\/fred.stlouisfed.org\\/graph\\/?g=qw94 https:\\/\\/www.federalreserve.gov\\/data\\/sloos\\/sloos-202101-table-1.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/zknji3l3r5l61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec0f08126076a77e1b339d4fe294d7ff4fecf9fe)\n\nOkay Jerk-off-osaurus\\_Rex, I JUST WANT TENDIES! HOW DO I FIND TENDIES!?\n\nOkay, so if banks aren't lending (disinflationary), people are sitting on cash (disinflationary) and smart people are paying down debt (deflationary), where's the inflation coming from?

That's the interest rate on 30y bonds (inverse the price). We want it to go down. See those little green marks, those are short positions, they make it go up. Last year saw the **LARGEST short position in the bond market. EVER**. You know Papa JPow with his infinite money glitch, he wants the red line to go down. Sweet, **we have the FUCKING FEDERAL RESERVE on our side**! You know who hates shorts more than Elon, Cohen or Our RKT Crew? The FUCKING FED. Since the dollar is tied to treasuries, popping the shorts will also cause the **dollar to rally.**\n\nYou know who hates the dollar to rally? Fucking everyone. Stock prices drop, Gold prices drop, Oil prices drop, it's harder to trade internationally... Yep... **JPow is a huge fucking bear**. Your calls are actually fukt.\n\nSo how do we profit off JPow?\n\nFull gay bear style (when the time is right of course). Macro can be slow as shit to play out, so leaps or shares are the game. Timing is hard for this shit, but JPow is HUUUNGRY for them bondies.\n\nThe most obvious monies to be had: long $TLT (30y bonds), Cash is fine too! (just follow $UUP for a rally), Inverse $GDX.

At 4-5% interest it is still historically low, but still high enough to stimulate growth and let things get a tad bit more expensive.        \n\nYou do understand JPOW works for the federal reserve?

{"title": "Gamma Squeeze Confusion", "selftext": "Because I'm seeing a lot of posts about $150 will be the rocket or let's get it to this price by eod type posts I want to clarify gamma squeeze and what's going on for all you apes. Should you trust what I'm saying? No probably not, I'm a moron just like you, I'm bag holding just like you hoping for that moon shot. I do like the stock and I'll see you guys at Mars though.\n\nTl;dr if you believe in the short squeeze just fucking hodl. Call options with various strikes aren't going to cause the short squeeze we want. This is not financial advice I'm a fucking idiot holding 38 shares, I wanted to buy more but my wife's boyfriend wouldn't let me buy anymore.\n\nNo getting the price to $150 by eod will not trigger the short squeezeNo the price dipping today is not necessarily the result of some short attack. In fact the price movement today is exactly what should be expected because of delta, gamma, and charm and I expect it to dip more today.\n\nThere is only one thing that is going to trigger the short squeeze, not some magic end of day number, not some amount of options expiring itm, no the only thing that will trigger the short squeeze that we're hoping for is short sellers of the stock folding and starting to cover their positions, I'll get more into it below.\n\nNow does gamma squeeze help us? YES! This is like super simple shit. Every stock is going to have buy pressure and sell pressure. If a stock has higher buy pressure than sell the price will go up and vice versa. We want as much buy pressure on the stock as we can possibly get from wherever we can get it. The price going up puts pressure on the short sellers of the stock because they're bleeding out of their ass on interest payments and the price going up only makes their losses worse and worse. So now to gamma squeeze.\n\nSo in order to understand gamma squeeze we need to understand delta. Now I know you guys love your fucking FD's you love those super otm cheap ass low time till expiration bull shit and probably haven't looked at a greek before in your life much less tried to understand them so I'll go over some basic shit. Now the following will all be general stuff.\n\nDelta measures the change in price of the option based upon change in price of the underlying. An option with a delta of .25 if the stock goes up $1 the price of the option will go up .25 or $25.  Delta ranges from 0 - 1.0  options that are in the money meaning higher deltas. Super deep itm options have deltas super close to 1 and that makes sense if you think about it. I like BAC so I'm going to use BAC as an example. Don't go out and buy BAC unless you do your own DD on it though.\n\nSay BAC is trading at $30 a share. I have a call option at $10 strike meaning if exercised I'd get 100 shares at $10 ie $1,000 and could sell them for a $2,000 gain immediately. This option would have a delta really close to 1. If BAC went up to $31 a share, my option would be worth $100 more because if I exercised I could instantly realize that gain (this is the intrinsic value of the option). I'm not going to go too deep into intrinsic and extrinsic value here if you don't understand it just go read the tl;dr above and go back to spamming the megathread.\n\nOptions that are at the money meaning the stock is trading at or really close to the strike have a delta at about .5 so long as there is still a decent chunk of time till expiry (I'll get into that more below).  The further you go out of the money the lower your delta because it's more likely your option expires worthless.\n\nNow delta constantly changes depending on the price of the underlying and how it moves compared to your strike. This rate of change of delta is gamma. I've seen it described as delta as the velocity of the option and gamma as its acceleration.  The way gamma operates is that options that are super itm or super out of the money have very low gammas and gamma is highest when the option is at the money and this makes sense if we look at some examples.\n\nSay I have a $75 call option on BAC and BAC is trading at $30. my option will have a stupid low delta because it is super likely it expires out of the money. Say BAC moves up to $31 a share, okay we're moving in the right direction but still super likely my call expires worthless so my delta will hardly be affected by that change. But suppose instead I had a $31 call option and BAC moved from $30 to $31, my delta is going to change much more because now it's way more likely my call expires itm so delta is changing much faster so gamma is higher.\n\nThis gets us to delta hedging and what the market makers that are selling all the short calls are doing. If I sell a call short that at expiration I'm agreeing to sell 100 shares at the strike price if the price is above the strike at expiration. If I sell a call that's way out of the money it's got a low delta.  Well I'm a little risk adverse there is a chance that call will get exercised so I need to make sure I have enough shares to cover that or at least make me feel safe. So I'm going to buy shares equal to my short calls delta. Now let's see this in action.  I sell a call option on BAC with a .2 Delta. A share of stock has a delta of 1 because think about it if an underlying goes up $1 my stock went up $1. Now my call option represents 100 shares so that .20 delta is really a 20 delta so if bought 20 shares and sold the .20 delta call I am delta neutral on BAC. say the stock rose $1 well now I'd be down $20 on my call option but I would be up $20 on the underlying stock that I have.\n\nBut since the price rose delta went up because it's closer to being itm so now I need to buy more shares to get back to delta neutral. Also it's closer to itm so now my gamma went up. Well the closer it gets to my strike price the more and more shares I need to buy and the faster I need to buy them to get to delta neutral. This increases the buy pressure. Well if there are a bunch of short calls at my strike price suddenly we're all scrambling to get back to our delta neutral position and puts enormous buy pressure on the stock that is until we get to our delta neutral position. This can and does cause a chain reaction on the other higher strikes, our buy pressure is increasing the price and now the higher strikes are getting more pressure, their gamma is increasing, they need to start buying to get back to delta neutral. This has the greatest effect at strikes with the greatest open interest. This chain reaction of increasing deltas and gammas is the gamma squeeze that people are talking about and it causes TEMPORARY buy pressure on the stock, once the short call sellers get back to delta neutrality the buy pressure evaporates for them.\n\nSo before where I said a stock atm will have a delta close .5 that's generally true when there is still a decent amount of time till expiration. Well the closer we get to expiration a stock atm will see an increase in that delta because there's a higher and higher chance you need to have those 100 shares to cover.   So today the short call holders at the 130 and below strikes may have had deltas lower than 1 so they didn't need to find the full 100to cover but come today the price held strong, now they suddenly need to find the last remaining shares to get up to 100 per contract. This puts buy pressure on the stock.  So this morning we saw a big surge of buys probably from those short call holders trying to cover themselves but then it tapered off because they managed to find the shares they needed and they'll just hold till end of day most likely.\n\nNow come end of day we will probably see a sell off (and we already are) because the short call holders at say the $150 or above strikes are holding some number of shares to keep their delta neutral position but as we get closer and closer to end of day that delta is going to absolutely tank from another derivative greek called Charm. Now outside factors may dictate buy pressure from somewhere else so this is no guarantee on price movement today.\n\nCharm measures the rate of change of delta compared to the time to expiration. Charm generally has very little effect on the price of the option up and until expiration. For example say it's 3:50 on expiration day BAC is trading at $30.50. A call option with a strike 0f $30 will have a delta at basically 1.00 because it's about to expire itm Charm will force the delta to that position and a call option with a strike of $31 will have a delta of basically 0 because it's about to expire otm and charm will force the delta to that position. If the price suddenly rose to $31 in the last ten minutes of trading charm will force the delta of the $31 call option to 1.00 or if it dipped to 29.50 it would force the delta of the $30 call to 0.\n\nSo now as we near expiration the out of the money call options are having their deltas wrecked by charm meaning those short call holders no longer need to hold as many shares to maintain delta neutral. This selling is putting sell pressure on the stock and will drive the price down at end of day which could cause other options strikes to go otm causing more sell off as charm wrecks their deltas (we saw this last Friday).\n\nNow how does that affect the squeeze we want. Short sellers of the stock are bleeding out the ass with interest payments and have to watch their loss get worse and worse as the price of the underlying rises. More buy pressure is going to keep and hold this price up, we want buy pressure from wherever we can get it. At some point some short sellers are going to break, they'll say enough is enough I'm covering and will start buying shares to cover their short position so they stop bleeding. This is more buy pressure this will drive the price up, this will cause other short sellers to break which causes a chain reaction of short sellers flooding in to cover their short position. This is the squeeze we want and won't happen till they let it happen so just hodl. Now I may have got some of this wrong, please call me a retard in the comments section below.\n\nI do see it as a good thing when calls expire in the money assuming the long call holders are exercising. Long call holders most likely have a bullish outlook on the stock and I see as being much more likely to be hodl'ers rather than short call sellers who are probably going to dump any shares they're holding the moment they no longer have the inverse delta pressure.  \n\n\nEdit: in regards to the word count my apologies, I'm used to my clients paying me by the word.\n\nThank for the awards my fellow 🦍 together strong and fuck you Melvin.", "id": "lyihwq", "created_utc": 1614968985.0, "score": 780, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "TL;DR - Gamma squeeze makes small price bump, short squeeze makes big price bump.

If an event occurs that causes the volatility to disappear or decreas you’re going to see the option price greatly decrease i.e. iv crush. The typical example is I love selling puts on stocks I’m bullish on around their earning because the iv will be through the roof and depending on how earnings go the volatility will disappear after he report so even on price turn downs, the iv crush can save your ass. \n\nTheta is pretty fairly simple. When you pay for the option it only has value so long as its not expired. Every day you get closer to expiration you lose some of that time value because you get closer to it expiring and becoming worthless. Theta is higher for lower delta options and increases dramatically the closer you get to expiration. An option deep itm will have super low theta because that option has a ton of intrinsic value. Theta on low delta options goes in sort of a u shaped graph wheras closer to atm theta is more of a straight line. \n\nHope that helps let me know if you want some more follow up than that.\n\nSorry I wanted to edit my comment on theta with a part I don’t think I described very well. Theta is lower the further you are from expiration and increases at a lower rate the further you are from expiration. So a. 1 delta otm call with one week till expiration theta is going to be super high and increaee quickly and that option’s value will tank in days absent some positive movement on the underlying.

After dipping as low as $53 per share, we saw an amazing growth of nearly 300% when it hit an all-time high of $145.09 in January.
